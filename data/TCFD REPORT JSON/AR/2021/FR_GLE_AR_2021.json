At the same time, we are accelerating the development of Boursorama, the clear leader in online banking in France, driven by its outstanding client acquisition drive, with 800,000 new clients in 2021, and the additional benefits of the agreement signed at the start of 2022 to provide an alternative solution to clients of ING France. Boursorama is on track to achieve its target of more than four million clients a year ahead of schedule.\n\nIn International Retail Banking, Insurance and Financial Services, we finalised or continued our development plans for our international retail banking subsidiaries, as well as for our consumer credit activities. In Global Banking and Investor Solutions, we presented our new strategic roadmap focused on sustainable and profitable growth, with the ambition of building on our clients' growing financing and advisory",

Finally, in our specialist financial business lines, we are strengthening our banking and insurance model in all regions and moving forward with our plan for ALD to acquire LeasePlan, creating a world leader in sustainable mobility. We aim to close this transformative deal by the end of 2022.\n\n## Responsible banking commitments\n\nIn  terms  of  ESG  (Environment,  Social, Governance), 2021 was also historic with our extra-financial performance recognised and welcomed by our stakeholders. Now equipped with a new ESG governance at Group level, we  have  reinforced  our  environmental commitments to achieve carbon neutrality in  our  business  portfolios  by  2050  and developed our positive-impact offers and solutions  to  support  our  clients'  energy transition, which we are actively supporting. As a responsible employer, we have made progress  in  achieving  our  objectives  in terms  of  diversity  and  gender  parity, as demonstrated by the recent appointments to the Group's management bodies, and we continue to invest in our teams' training and commitment levels. The end of the year also saw the definitive dismissal of the two legal proceedings initiated by the US authorities. We have completed the corrective action programmes  and  will  ensure  that  the reinforcements of our compliance systems are incorporated over the long term.\n\n## Maintaining the momentum in 2022\n\nIn an environment set to be more volatile and uncertain, we are determined to sustain this  positive  momentum  and  maintain a regularly high level of results by combining commercial performance with a disciplined approach  to  costs  and  risks.  We will resolutely pursue the implementation of major strategic projects in each of our business lines and finalise our medium-term roadmap at Group level. We will move onto  the  next  stage  in  the  two  major transformations common to all our business lines: integrating CSR objectives into the heart of both our activities and our culture of responsibility, and focusing on digital innovation to accelerate the use of new technologies for the benefit of our clients and to improve operational efficiency.\n\nTo deliver on this momentum, we can count on our Group's entrepreneurial energy and capacity for collective action, which our teams show on a daily basis. Determined, committed and responsible, we put our corporate purpose into action: to build together, with our clients, a better and sustainable future.\n\nWe will move onto the next stage in the two major transformations common to all our business lines: integrating CSR objectives into the heart of both our activities and our culture of responsibility, and focusing on digital innovation to accelerate the use of new technologies for the benefit of our clients and to improve operational efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## HISTORY 1.1\n\nOn  4  May  1864,  Napoleon  III  signed  Societe  Generale's  founding decree. Founded by a group of industrialists and financiers driven by the  ideals  of  progress,  the  Bank's  mission  has  always  been  'to promote the development of trade and industry in France'.\n\nSince  its  beginnings,  Societe  Generale  has  worked  to  modernise  the economy, following the model of a diversified bank at the cutting edge of financial innovation. Its retail banking branch network grew rapidly throughout the French territory, increasing from 46 to 1,500 branches between 1870 and 1940. During the interwar period, the Bank became the leading French credit institution in terms of deposits.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  Societe  Generale  began  to  build  its  international reach by financing infrastructure essential to the economic development of a number of countries in Latin America, Europe and North Africa. This expansion was accompanied by the establishment of an international retail banking network. In 1871, the Bank opened its London  branch.  On  the  eve  of  World  War  I,  Societe  Generale  was present  in  14  countries,  either  directly  or  through  one  of  its subsidiaries. The network was subsequently expanded by the opening of  branches  in  New  York,  Buenos  Aires,  Abidjan  and  Dakar,  and  by acquiring stakes in financial institutions in Central Europe.\n\nSociete Generale was  nationalised by the French law of 2 December, 1945  and  played  an  active  role  in  financing  the  reconstruction  of France. The Bank thrived during the prosperous post-war decades and contributed to the increased use of banking techniques by launching innovative products for businesses, including medium-term discountable credit and lease financing agreements, for which it held the position of market leader.\n\nSociete  Generale  demonstrated  its  ability  to  adapt  to  a  new environment by taking advantage of the banking reforms that followed the French Debr\u00e9 laws of 1966-1967. While continuing to support the businesses it partnered, the Group lost no time in focusing its business on  individual  clients.  In  this  way,  it  supported  the  emergence  of  a consumer  society  by  diversifying  the  credit  and  savings  products  it offered private households.\n\nIn June 1987, Societe Generale was privatised with a successful stock market launch and shares offered to Group staff. The Group developed a  universal  banking  strategy,  notably  through  its  Corporate  and Investment Banking arm, to support the worldwide development of its customers. In France, it expanded its networks by founding Fimatex in 1995,  which  later  became  Boursorama,  now  France's  leading  online bank,  and  by  acquiring  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  in  1997.  Internationally,  it established  itself  in  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  through  Komer\u010dn\u00ed Banka in the Czech Republic and BRD in Romania, and in Russia with Rosbank,  while  consolidating  its  growth  in  Africa  in  Morocco,  C\u00f4te d'Ivoire  and  Cameroon, among other countries. The Group has more than 131,000 members of staff (1) active in 66 countries. It continues its process of transformation by adopting a sustainable growth strategy driven by its core values of team spirit, innovation, responsibility and commitment. Firmly focused on the future by helping our clients bring their  projects  to  life,  Societe  Generale  has  embraced  with  conviction the  opportunities  of  the  digital  age  to  best  anticipate  the  needs  of clients and staff members, and embody the bank of the 21st century. Drawing on more than 150 years of expertise at the service of its clients and  the  development  of  the  real  economy,  in  January  2020  Societe Generale group defined its purpose as 'Building together, with our clients,  a  better  and  sustainable  future  through  responsible  and innovative financial solutions'.",

        "page_content": "## A STRATEGY OF PROFITABLE AND SUSTAINABLE 1.3 DEVELOPMENT, BASED ON A DIVERSIFIED AND INTEGRATED BANKING MODEL\n\nThe Societe Generale Group has built a solid diversified banking model suited  to  the  needs  of  its  26/uni00A0million (1) corporate,  institutional  and individual  clients.  It  is  structured  around  three  complementary  and diversified businesses, all benefiting from strong market positions:\n\n- French Retail Banking; p\n- International Retail Banking and Financial Services; p\n- Global Banking and Investor Solutions. p\n\nIn the Retail Banking businesses, the Group focuses on development in European markets selected for their growth potential (France, Czech Republic and Romania) and Africa, where it has an historic presence, a refined  understanding  of  the  markets  and  top-tier  positions.  In International Financial Services, Societe Generale relies on franchises benefiting  from  leadership  positions  worldwide,  notably  in  the operational vehicle leasing and fleet management businesses, and in equipment  finance.  In  the  Global  Banking  and  Investor  Solutions businesses,  the  Group  provides  high  value-added  solutions  to  its clients  in  the  EMEA  region,  the  US  and  Asia.  Focused  on  Europe  yet connected  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  the  Societe  Generale  Group capitalises on leadership positions driven by cross-business synergies to  create  value  for  stakeholders.  The  Group  leverages  its  diversified model to meet the needs of its corporate and professional clients as well as its individual clients.\n\nThe  rebound  witnessed  in  the  second  half  of  2020  continued throughout  2021,  with  all  the  Group's  businesses  posting  strong commercial  and  financial  performances.  As  a  result,  the  Group recorded  its  best  results  in  history,  enabling  it  to  post  strong profitability and offer shareholders an attractive dividend.\n\nThese  financial  performances  reflect  the  Group's  efforts  over  recent years  to  strengthen  the  inherent  quality  of  its  businesses,  improve operational efficiency, preserve the excellent robustness of the credit portfolio and manage its risks.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  pushed  ahead  with  its  major  strategic  priorities, including in particular:\n\n- merging its two banking networks in France (Vision 2025) to create a p new  bank  serving  nearly  10  million  clients  and  and  ramping  up development  of  its  online  bank  Boursorama  following  the announcement  early  in  2022  of  the  signing  of  a  Memorandum  of Understanding  with  ING  with  a  view  to  offering  the  latter's  online banking clients the best alternative online banking solution;\n- accelerating  the  growth  of  its  long-term  vehicle  leasing  business p (ALD) with the announcement in early 2022 that ALD was to acquire LeasePlan. In the medium term, the Group's plan is for the activities of this new vehicle leasing entity to become a third pillar, alongside retail banking and insurance, and corporate and investment banking.\n\nThe  Group  continued  to  pursue  its  selective  resource  allocation strategy and its focus on achieving the optimal region/offer/client mix for both itself and its clients, and confirmed its strong resolve to keep costs  firmly  in  check.  The  adjustments  that  have  been  made  are designed  to  mark  out  growing,  high-margin  businesses  that  enjoy strong commercial franchises.\n\nLooking forward, the Group is preparing its 2025 trajectory,  which  is built on three pillars:\n\n- continued  disciplined  management  of  costs  and  scarce  resources, p combined with risk control, to contribute to the Bank's solid balance sheet;\n- digital transformation challenges, with the current crisis requiring it p to step up efforts in this regard;\n- commitments in the environmental, social and governance fields. p\n\nOne  of  the  Group's  priorities  is  to  press  on  with  its  commercial development,  focusing  on  quality  of  service,  added  value  and innovation to deliver client satisfaction. Its goal is to become a trusted partner  for  its  clients,  making  sound  use  of  its  digital  capabilities  to provide them with responsible and innovative financial solutions.\n\nOrganic  growth  will  continue  to  be  driven  by  unlocking  internal synergies not only within each business but also between businesses. This will entail greater cooperation between Private Banking and the Retail  Banking  networks,  cooperation  along  the  entire  Investor Services chain, cooperation between the Insurance business and the French  and  International  Retail  Banking  networks,  and  cooperation between regions  and  Global  Transaction  Banking's  activities,  among others.\n\nThe  Group  has  made  certain  changes  to  its  Corporate  Social Responsibility (CSR) governance. Since 1 January 2022, the Sustainable Development Department has reported directly to General Management, underscoring the Group's decision to make CSR a core strategic concern. In  keeping  with  its  previous  goals,  Societe  Generale  has  set  its  CSR targets for 2021 based on four development priorities, defined in light of the results from the materiality survey conducted at the end of 2020.\n\nTwo of  these  priorities  involve  being  a  responsible  bank:  fostering  a culture of responsibility and being a responsible employer. The other two concern how the Group's actions as a responsible bank can drive positive change: supporting the environmental  transition and contributing to growth in local communities.\n\nTo guide its actions as a responsible bank, the Group has set itself the goal of embedding a culture of responsibility and applying the strictest control and compliance framework in the banking sector. It focuses on complying  with  all  applicable  ethics  obligations  and  regulations,  as well as with its own voluntary commitments, and on ensuring robust E&S risk  management,  channelling  its  efforts  into  specific  actions  to deliver  a  positive  impact  on  the  environment  whilst  remaining attentive to and working hand in hand with the various stakeholders in its global ecosystem.\n\nFor Societe Generale, being a responsible employer means providing a sound working environment and promoting diversity and professional development.  This  policy  is  key  in  boosting  both  employee engagement and overall performance. More specifically, the Group has identified five priority areas for action in human resources: Corporate Culture  and  Ethics  Principles,  Professions  and  Skills,  Diversity  and Inclusion,  Performance  and  Compensation,  and  Occupational  Health and Safety.",

        "page_content": "The  Group  draws  on  its  own  exemplary  conduct  and  exceptional resources  to  help  its  clients  with  their  environmental  transition  and support sustainable local communities.\n\nConscious  of  the  challenges  its  clients  face  when  addressing  global warming, Societe  Generale  has  made  the  environmental  transition  a priority issue. Its goal is to be at the forefront of the energy transition. The  core  priorities  of  its  climate  change  strategy,  which  has  been approved by the Board of Directors, are as follows:\n\n- develop  a  shared  CSR  culture  in  terms  of  risk  management  and p commercial opportunities in connection with the energy transition;\n- implement a climate risk management framework; p\n- manage the climate impact of the Group's activities (both its direct p activities and those of its portfolios);\n- support  the  Group's  clients  in  their  energy  transition,  through  a p tailored product and service offering.\n\nIn response,  the  Group's  expertise  in  these  areas  has  earned recognition  from  Dealogic,  which  ranked  it  No.  1  for  financing renewable energies in EMEA at the end of June 2021. Societe Generale was also the recipient of one of the sector's most prestigious awards when  it  was  singled  out  as  Best  Bank  in  Sustainability  in  2021  by International Financing Review (IFR).\n\nLast,  alongside  its  climate  and  environmental  actions,  Societe Generale also promotes sustainable regional development and strong local economies. It supports entrepreneurs, participates in projects to build  sustainable  cities  and  infrastructures  and  promotes  clean mobility solutions in the regions in which it operates. Its actions in this respect  are  particularly  noticeable  in  France,  where  they  constitute one  of  the  strategic  objectives  for  the  Group's  new  retail  banking network, and in Africa, through the Grow with Africa initiative.\n\nSociete  Generale's  efforts  to  achieve  sustainable  development  have not  gone  unnoticed  by  the  ratings  agencies.  Following  on  from  its excellent  ESG  ratings  in  2020,  the  Group  again  rated  highly  in  2021 across the board with all rating agencies in the three Environmental, Social and  Governance  segments,  reflecting  the  depth  of  its commitment and the quality of its actions to promote sustainability.\n\nThe Group's extra-financial ratings for the year were among the best in the banking sector: in the top 1% of all companies worldwide (out of 4,881  companies)  in  Moody's  ESG  Solutions'  universe;  in  the  top  3% banks  worldwide  (out  of  190  banks)  in  MSCI's  universe;  in  the  top quartile  in  the  Sustainalytics  universe  out  of  a  panel  of  408  banks worldwide; and in the top 7% worldwide in the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, placing the Group 8th in Europe and 26th worldwide out of 242 banks.\n\nSociete  Generale  continues  to  foster  a  group-wide  culture  of responsibility  and  to  strengthen  its  internal  control  framework, especially  its  Compliance  operations,  to  meet  the  banking  industry's highest standards. It has also completed the rollout of its Culture and Conduct programme, embedding rules of conduct and strong shared values throughout the entire company.\n\nSociete  Generale  announced  in  2021  the  end  of  two  separate  legal proceedings brought by the US Departmentof Justice, one relating to Societe Generale's IBOR  submissions  and  certain  transactions involving Libyan counterparties, and the other relating to US economic sanctions  compliance.  In  requesting  the  courts  to  dismiss  the  legal proceedings, the DOJ confirmed that the Bank had fully complied with its  obligations  under  the  related  deferred  prosecution  agreements (DPA).\n\nLast,  the  Group  is  determined  to  press  ahead  with  its  stringent  and disciplined  approach  to  risk  management  -  maintaining  credit portfolio quality, continuing efforts regarding operational risk control and compliance - and to its capital allocation management.\n\nIn  line  with  its  strategy  to  fully  address  its  clients'  needs  and  in consideration  of  the  new,  more  demanding  regulatory  environment, the Group's focus will remain on optimising its consumption of scarce capital  and  liquidity  resources  and  maintaining  a  highly  disciplined approach to costs and risk management.\n\n## Outlook\n\nIn  2022,  the  Group  intends  to  build  on  the  commercial  momentum already embedded in its businesses and strengthen the resilience of its financial performance amid a more uncertain environment.\n\nExcluding the Single Resolution Fund contribution, the underlying cost to  income ratio is expected to range between 66% and 68% in 2022, and  improve  thereafter  thanks  to  the  cost  reductions  initiatives announced in 2021.\n\nThe cost  of  risk  is  expected  to  be  below  30  basis  points  in  2022,  i.e. slightly higher than the 2021 level. In the wake of recent developments in Ukraine and Russia, the Group announced on 3 March that it was not changing its cost of risk target and would update it, if necessary, at the time of its Q1 22 results publication.\n\nThe Group is aiming for a CET1 ratio at  least  between  200-250  basis points above the regulatory requirement, including after the entry into force of the regulation finalising the Basel III framework.\n\nThe Board of Directors approved an attractive shareholder distribution of  the  2021  financial  results  equivalent  to  EUR  2.75  per  share.  A  cash dividend of EUR 1.65 per share will be proposed to the General Meeting of Shareholders on 17 May 2022.\n\nThe  Group  is  also  envisaging  a  share  buyback  programme  of approximately EUR 915 million, i.e. equivalent to EUR 1.10 per share. It has been decided to exceptionally split the pay-out as 60% in cash and 40%  through  a  share  buy-back./uni00A0In  future,  the  Group  intends  to maintain a dividend policy based on a 50% pay-out ratio of underlying Group net income with up to 20% of the pay-out in the form of a share buyback.\n\n## French Retail Banking\n\nSociete Generale is the fourth-largest retail bank in France.\n\nThe French Retail Banking business has made sweeping changes to its model, in particular on the back of rapid changes in client behaviours and demand  for ever-increasing convenience, expertise and customised  products  and  services.  The  pace  of  transformation accelerated in 2020, with two major strategic initiatives: the planned merger of Cr\u00e9dit du Nord and Societe Generale, and moves to ramp up growth at  Boursorama.  These  initiatives  are  designed  to  cement  the Group's winning combination of a fully online banking model coupled with  a  network  banking  model  offering  both  digital  and  human expertise - a combination that stands out in the French market. Over the course of 2021, the Group successfully moved ahead with the first stages of its merger project, the key principles of which are as follows:\n\n- a  new  model  based  on  a  full  merger  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  and p Societe  Generale  retail  banks,  combining  the  strengths  of  each within a single bank: one branch network, one head office and one IT system,  with  nearly  10/uni00A0million  clients  served  by  25,000/uni00A0employees in/uni00A02025;\n\n|",

From  a  financial  perspective,  the  merger  will  unlock considerable cost synergies, with a net cost-base reduction target of more  than  EUR/uni00A0350/uni00A0million  by  2024  and  around  EUR/uni00A0450/uni00A0million  by 2025, compared with 2019. The cost of the tie-up has been estimated at  between  EUR/uni00A0700/uni00A0million and  EUR/uni00A0800/uni00A0million. The  return  on normative equity under Basel III is expected to range between 11% and 11.5% in 2025, equating to more than 10% under Basel IV.\n\nFrench Retail Banking also aims to build on its existing growth drivers. Specifically, this means:\n\n- maximising the potential of the integrated bancassurance model by p anticipating  changes  in  the  life-insurance  market  and  taking advantage of strong client take-up potential for personal protection and non-life insurance;\n- increasing  business  among  corporate  and  professional  clients  by p providing strategic advisory services and comprehensive solutions;\n- leveraging  the  expertise  available  in  Private  Banking  to  satisfy  the p expectations of high net worth clients in the French networks.\n\nIn  Asset  &  Wealth  Management  and  Private  Banking,  the  disposal  of Lyxor to Amundi forms part of Societe Generale's strategy of operating in  open  architecture,  distributing  savings  solutions  to  clients  across both  of  its  networks.  By  offering  its  clients  investment  and  asset management  solutions  through  partnerships  with  external  asset managers,  Societe  Generale  gives  its  savers  access  to  the  best investment expertise in France and internationally, while at the same time  responding  to  their  growing  demand  for  socially  responsible investment.  The  new  Wealth  &  Investment  Solutions  Division  within Private  Banking  focuses  on  structuring  savings,  asset  management and  investment  solutions  for  the  Group's  private  banking  and  retail banking networks, as well as structured asset management solutions for its Global Markets clients.\n\nLast,  the  Group  continues  to  support  the  development  of  its  online bank  Boursorama,  which  has  consolidated  its  leadership  position  in France  with  a  bumper  year  in  terms  of  client  acquisition:  more  than 800,000 new clients in 2021, bringing their total number to 3.3 million. Over  the  next  few  years,  Boursorama  intends  to  press  ahead  with investments  to  win  over  new  clients  and  is  targeting  more  than  4 million clients by the end of 2022, one year ahead of schedule. Societe Generale also announced that Boursorama had signed a Memorandum of  Understanding with ING with a view to offering its online banking clients  in  France  the  best  possible  alternative  banking  solution  that furnishes  dedicated  client  experience  and  support  features.  The  two banks intend to sign a definitive agreement by the end of April 2022. The  Group  has  confirmed  its  aim  of  taking  Boursorama  to  maturity, targeting 4.5 million clients and a return on normative equity of more than 25% by 2025.\n\n## International Retail Banking and Financial Services\n\nInternational Retail Banking and Financial Services is a profitable growth driver  for  the  Group  thanks  to  its  leading  positions  in  high-potential markets, its operational efficiency and digital transformation initiatives, and  its  ability  to  unlock  synergies  with  other  Group  activities.  These businesses  have  undergone  a  major  transformation  over  the  last  few years  to  fully  refocus  the  portfolio,  introduce  a  more  optimised  model and improve the underlying risk profile.\n\nInternational Retail Banking activities are mainly located outside the Eurozone and benefit  from  positive  long-term  growth  fundamentals, although the Covid-19 pandemic and associated economic crisis have somewhat slowed their historical trajectory of continuous growth. The Group nevertheless plans to press on with its strategy of consolidating leadership  positions  and  pursuing  responsible  growth  within  its international  banking  activities  in  Europe  and  Africa.  Its  capacity  to meet  its  clients'  needs,  coupled  with  its  innovative,  unique  and efficient platforms, will serve it well in this undertaking:\n\n- in Europe, the health crisis has sharply accentuated underlying trends, p confirming  the  strategic  vision  of  the  Group's  target  retail  banking model,  as  well  as  the  relevance  of  the  transformation  plans undertaken,  which  place  special  emphasis  on  ramping  up  digital transformation.  Accordingly,  the  Group  intends  to  put  the  finishing touches to its omnichannel banking model in the Czech Republic with its KB Change 2025/uni00A0strategic plan, consolidate its franchise's position in Romania as one of the country's three leading banks. The Group's exposure to Russia is limited - less than 2% of its overall exposure - and the  Group  is  closely  monitoring  events  in  the  region's  geopolitical situation.  The  Group  also  intends  to  tap  into  the  full  potential  of  its consumer  finance  activities  in  Europe  through  both  its  own  retail banking networks and its specialist subsidiaries in and outside France/uni00A0;\n- in  Africa,  the  Group  plans  to  take  advantage  of  the  continent's p strong potential for economic growth and bank account penetration by building on its position as one of the three international banks with the largest footprint in Africa, where it enjoys leading positions in  the  Mediterranean  Basin,  as  well  as  in  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  Guinea, Cameroon and Senegal.\n\nAs part of the Grow with Africa programme developed in partnership with a panel of international and local partners, Societe Generale has announced  several  sustainable  growth  initiatives  to  foster  positive transformation  across  the  continent.  Accordingly,  the  Group  is concentrating on providing multidimensional support to African SMEs, funding infrastructure, supporting the energy transition and developing innovative financing solutions.\n\nFinancial  Services  and  Insurance  enjoy  competitive  positions  and strong profitability, in particular with ALD and Insurance, both of which have  robust  growth  potential.  These  are  the  businesses  that  best withstood  the  economic  shock  of  2020.  Incidentally,  they  are continuing  to  roll  out  their  programmes  to  innovate  and  transform their operational model.\n\n- In  Insurance,  the  Group  plans  to  accelerate  the  rollout  of  its p bancassurance  model  across  all  retail  banking  markets  and  all segments (life insurance, personal protection and non-life insurance), as well as of its digital strategy. The aim is to enhance its product range and client experience within an integrated omnichannel framework, while diversifying its business models and growth  drivers  through  a  strategy  of  innovation  and  partnerships. This growth strategy goes hand in hand with greater commitments to responsible finance at SG Assurances.",

        "page_content": "- In  Operational  Vehicle  Leasing  and  Fleet  Management,  the  Group p sees  the  planned  acquisition  of  LeasePlan  as  an  opportunity  to create  a  global  leader  in  sustainable  mobility  solutions.  The  new entity  is  poised  to  be  No./uni00A01  worldwide,  excluding  captives  and financial leasing companies. With a total fleet of 3.5/uni00A0million vehicles at end-December/uni00A02021 and operations in over 40/uni00A0countries, it boasts highly  complementary  expertise  and  prospective  synergies.  The Group  also  intends  to  develop  new  activities  and  services  in  a mobility  sector  undergoing  radical  change.  Having  boosted  its investment  capacities  and  unique  know-how,  ALD  has  positioned itself  at  the  heart  of  this  changing  world  of  mobility,  asserting  its global leadership to become a fully integrated player in sustainable mobility  solutions  with  the  rollout  of  its  Move  2025/uni00A0strategic  plan and the planned acquisition of LeasePlan. It is now particularly well placed to take full advantage of the market's strong growth. To this end,  ALD  forged  ahead  with  its  active  innovation  and  digitalised strategy over the year.\n- Last, for Vendor and Equipment Finance, the Group plans to build on p its  leadership  position  in  Europe  in  those  top-tier  markets  to increase  revenue  and  improve  profitability.  It  plans  to  draw  on  its service  quality,  capacity  for  innovation,  product  expertise  and dedicated teams to retain its preferred partner status with vendors and clients alike.\n\nSociete  Generale  also  plans  to  continue  moving  forward  with  its strategy  of  unlocking  synergies  between  the  activities  of  the  various businesses  in  this  division  and  elsewhere  within  the  Group,  with Private  Banking  and  the  regional  Corporate  and  Investment  Banking platforms,  by  developing  its  commercial  banking  services  such  as trade finance, cash management, payment services and factoring, and by pursuing the development of its bancassurance model.\n\n## Global Banking and Investor Solutions\n\nGlobal Banking and Investor Solutions stands on broad and diversified foundations:  it  has  built  up  a  solid  and  stable  diversified  client  base and benefits from high value-added product franchises and recognised sector  expertise  backed  by  a  global  network.  It  serves  the  financing and investment needs of a broad and diversified client base spanning corporates,  financial  institutions  and  public-sector  entities.  Having undergone a considerable transformation in recent years - reducing its breakeven  point  and  de-risking  the  Global  Markets  business,  and adjusting the size of its businesses - GBIS is focused on delivering value to all its stakeholders through sustainable and profitable growth.\n\nIts  growth strategy is consistent with the position of current economic growth opportunities, i.e. in increased financing needs for infrastructure and  the  energy  transition,  greater  investment  in  private  debt  and  the growing  demand  for  investment  solutions.  At  the  same  time,  it  is gradually and coherently adjusting the size of its businesses, particularly between  Global  Markets  and  Investor  Services  and  Financing  and Advisory,  making  targeted  capital  allocations  to  identified  growth initiatives for particular client segments, businesses and regions.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  made  it  a  priority  to  develop  'ESG  by  design' businesses, setting itself the target of doubling ESG-related revenues by  2025  in  both  Global  Markets  and  Investor  Services  and  Financing and Advisory.\n\nTied in with this objective is the Group's unrelenting focus on:\n\n- reducing  costs  to  improve  operating  leverage  without  business p attrition and  in  keeping  with  its  long-term  commitment  to disciplined cost control;\n- adopting  stringent  management  of  both  market  and  credit  risks, p notably  against  a  backdrop  of  weaker  market  risk  appetite,  and prudent management of its counterparty risk, aiming to maintain a healthy diversification of all risk categories across its businesses.\n\n## RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK\n\nThe latest  wave  of  the  epidemic  has  incurred  a  proportionally  lower death  toll  compared  to  the  very  high  contamination  levels.  The economy's greater adaptability has mitigated the impact on business, but the withdrawal of temporary support measures is only partly being offset by the economic reopening and recovery support measures.\n\nPrevailing uncertainty over events in Ukraine and Russia is making it difficult to forecast the impact on the global economy and the Group, and has furthermore sparked a return of volatility in financial markets. We expect energy prices (notably oil and gas) to remain high in 2022 on back  of  supply  chain  disruptions  and  the  consequences  of  the situation  in  Ukraine.  These  factors  are  likely  to  contribute  to  a slowdown in eurozone growth during 2022 and 2023.\n\nTensions in the job market are playing out in wage adjustments and specifically a rise in the minimum wage. We forecast that these gains, combined  with  rising  energy  prices,  may  trigger  short-term  inflation spikes  in  Europe  and  the  US.  Further  out,  new  monetary  policy strategies on both sides of the Atlantic should drive inflation closer to target,  contrary  to  the  past  decade  during  which  inflation  undershot central bank targets.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve (Fed) could tighten its monetary policy in light of  the  increased  risk  of  heightened  inflation  expectations  and  a wage-price  spiral  taking  hold  in  the  US.  Emerging  markets  are expected  to  continue  the  monetary  tightening  started  in  early  2021, while  China  has  already  begun  its  measured  easing  cycle.  Low  to negative real interest  rates  should  help  trigger  a  global  deleveraging process. That said, uncertainties persist over market expectations as consensus  on  the  ability  of  central  banks  to  keep  inflation  under control could shift suddenly and lead to sharper tightening of financial conditions.  The  2021  regulatory  landscape  was  marked  by  stimulus and  easing  measures  in  line  with  those  of  2020  to  enable  banks  to support the economy. Some of these measures will continue in 2022. Governments  have  lent  massive  support  to  the  financing  of companies. In France, support measures were implemented by way of government-backed  loan  schemes  totalling  EUR  14.3  billion  at end-December 2021, and recovery loans.\n\nThese measures will most likely be maintained or even strengthened in 2022 in light of the continued health crisis and against the backdrop of the French elections.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "The European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) in its capacity  as  prudential  supervisor,  the  European  Banking  Authority (EBA) and the High Council for Financial Stability (HCSF) have used the flexibility of prudential regulations to act on the liquidity and solvency of banks. These regulatory adjustments included:\n\n- the  easing  of  countercyclical  capital  buffer  requirements  with  the p possibility  of  using  them  subject  to  automatic  remedial  action (maximum  distributable  amount  mechanism  and  submission  of  a capital conservation plan);\n- temporary  tolerance  for  non-compliance  with  minimum  liquidity p ratios;\n- greater flexibility in applying the criteria for downgrading moratoria p and  a  recommendation  that  the  pro-cyclical  impacts  of  IFRS9 application be supervised.\n\nThe  trend  is  now  towards  normalisation.  The  ECB  decided  not  to extend its recommendation on dividend pay-outs and share buybacks beyond  30  September  2021.  This  recommendation  involved  limiting divident payment and share buyback amounts for all banks under its direct  supervision.  Last,  the  flexibility  measure  taken  by  the  ECB  to allow  banks  to  have  a  Liquidity  Coverage  Ratio  (LCR)  below  the regulatory threshold of 100% ended on 31 December 2021.\n\nBeyond  the  prevailing  economic  conditions,  several  structural regulatory  projects  aim  to  strengthen  the  prudential  framework, support environmental and digital transitions, protect consumers and develop European capital markets.\n\nThe year 2021 put the spotlight back on finalising the implementation of  the  Basel  III  prudential  agreements  in  the  European  Union.  In October  2021,  the  European  Commission  published  its  new  banking rules  -  the  proposed  CRR3 regulation and the CRD6 directive - which will  enter  into  force  on  1  January  2025.  The  timetable  for  rolling  out the reforms in the main non-EU jurisdictions remains uncertain and is not expected to coincide with the Basel timetable of 1 January 2023.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  European  Green  Deal  proposed  by  the European  Commission  in  December  2019,  environmental  and sustainability issues took centre stage in 2021. The financial sector is facing highly ambitious expectations, the aim being to rapidly mobilise capital flows to achieve carbon neutrality and lay the groundwork for a sustainable  economy.  Work  on  the  EU  taxonomy  for  sustainable activities is ongoing;  activities are classified as \"sustainable\", \"harmful'  or  \"social\".  Accordingly,  banks  and  large  companies  are poised to publish their first climate reports in 2022.\n\nBanks  are  expected  to  better  integrate  their  climate  risk  exposure when managing risks and be more transparent about disclosing ESG risks  in  their  prudential  publications.  The  ECB  will  organise  climate stress  testing  on  top  of  climate  pilot  exercises  run  by  the  French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority ( Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution - ACPR) and the European Banking Authority (EBA).  Debate  is  intensifying  over  the  prudential  treatment  of  assets that are harmful to the climate and will be the topic of an EBA report in 2023. The European Union was a trailblazer for ESG-related topics, so\n\nthe issue of harmonising European standards with those introduced in other jurisdictions will be a key consideration in 2022.\n\nConcomitantly,  digital  transformation  will  continue  to  be  a  priority. The Commission proposed:\n\n- a digital finance action plan; p\n- plans for regulating crypto-assets (MiCA); p\n- the Digital Operations  Resilience  Act  (DORA)  to  strengthen p cybersecurity and the monitoring of outsourced services;\n- initiatives centred on artificial intelligence and digital identity. p\n\nThe year 2021 was also marked by in-depth work on significant topics related to payments, i.e. the  EPI  project  and  ECB's study of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and of an acceleration in the spread of instant payments. These projects will continue in 2022 and should be supplemented  by  Open  Finance  proposals  for  which  the  DSP2 Directive assessment will be an important step.\n\nIn  order  to  finance  these  environmental  and  digital  transitions, regulated savings may be reformed with the introduction of national and European financial regulations fostering  the  redirecting  of  these savings.\n\nConsumer issues is also set to attract considerable attention in both France  and  Europe.  In  particular,  plans  to  revise  MiFID,  PRIIPS  and consumer  credit  directives  are  under  way  at  European  level.  Many issues related to the pricing and transparency of banking products are also being  debated  at  the  national  level:  protection  for  the self-employed (pricing, assets, financing) will continue to take centre stage, and developments in insolvency procedures and the regulation of securities will affect the mechanisms at work in the financing of the economy for the smallest businesses.\n\nLast,  in  a  post-Brexit  environment  and  as  part  of  developing  its strategic  autonomy  plan  announced  in  January  2021,  the  European Commission gave new momentum to the development of the Capital Markets Union (CMU).\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Commission proposed practical steps towards a real CMU following the European action plan published in 2020 with (i) the publication of legislative proposals for the revision of MIFIR, (ii) the publication  of  the  directive  relating  to  alternative  management  and that  of  the  regulation  on  long-term  investment  funds,  and  (iii)  the establishment  of  a  European  single  access  point  (ESAP)  for  financial and non-financial information publicly disclosed by companies.\n\nAt the same time, the Commission launched a targeted consultation to possibly  amend  the  Listing  Act,  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  the attractiveness  of  capital  markets  for  EU  companies  and  facilitating access to capital for small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nThese initiatives play a part in the ongoing work related to Brexit and address  the  issues  of  equivalences,  the  gradual  relocation  of compensation for euro products within the Union, potential regulatory differences and competitive conditions.",

French  Retail Banking is exemplified by its:\n\n- industry-recognised customer service; p\n- leading position in online and mobile banking in France; p\n- robust sales momentum; p\n- constant adaptation to clients' needs and expectations. p\n\nOn  7/uni00A0December  2020,  the  Societe  Generale  Group  announced  the launch  of  merger  plans  for  the  Societe  Generale  and  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord banking  networks  and  for  Boursorama  to  enter  a  new  phase  of maturity, with a goal of 4.5/uni00A0million clients by 2025.\n\nFrench Retail Banking strives to improve client satisfaction across all segments  and  to  further  develop  value-added  services  and  assist businesses with their expansion in France and worldwide.

        "page_content": "The networks continue to support the economy and help clients finance their  projects,  with  growth  in  average  loan  outstandings  up  from EUR/uni00A0217/uni00A0billion in 2020 to EUR/uni00A0221/uni00A0billion in 2021. At the same time, and amid rife competition, deposit inflows showed resilience and resulted in a loan-to-deposit ratio of 86.8% in 2021, down 7 points on 2020.\n\n## France network\n\n## SOCIETE GENERALE NETWORK\n\nThe Societe Generale network offers solutions tailored to the needs of its 6.7 million individual clients as well as almost 430,000 professional clients,  non-profit  associations  and  corporate  clients,  representing EUR/uni00A0108/uni00A0billion in outstanding  deposits  and  EUR/uni00A084 billion in outstanding loans in 2021.\n\nTo achieve this, the network leverages three major strengths:\n\n- approximately 1,202 main branches located mainly in urban areas p where a large proportion of national wealth is concentrated;\n- an  exhaustive  and  diversified  range  of  products  and  services, p ranging  from  savings  vehicles  and  asset  management  solutions  to corporate finance and payment means;\n- a  comprehensive  and  innovative  omnichannel  system  spanning p Internet, mobile, telephone and service platforms.\n\nSociete  Generale  continued  to  expand  its  network  and  increase  its service  offering  in  2021  in  response  to  its  clients'  requirements  and with a view to enhancing customer satisfaction. It notably improved its digital  offering,  focusing  especially  on  professional  and  corporate clients  -  introducing  a  revamped  the  app  and  websites,  promoting electronic signature services and other advantages - added Corporate and  Investment  Banking's  SME/mid-cap  services  to  the  range  of expertise available to corporate clients, and developed Shine, its 100% online  banking  subsidiary  for  professionals  and  VSBs.  It  also announced plans to look into the option of sharing ATMs with Cr\u00e9dit du  Nord,  BNP  Paribas  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Mutuel,  with  a  view  to  improving accessibility for the clients of all four banks.\n\nSociete Generale has made sustainable development the linchpin of its strategy. It took further steps last year to limit its direct environmental impact  by  reducing  waste  and  shrinking  its  carbon  footprint,  and  to address  social  issues.  It  also  developed  a  new  range  of  services designed  to  help  clients  achieve  their  own  sustainable  development and energy transition  goals:  2021  saw  the  introduction  of  social  and environmental loans for corporates, as well as a new range of 100% SRI savings vehicles for individual clients.\n\nIn  2021,  Societe  Generale  and  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  confirmed  plans  to merge, combining their two networks to form a new retail bank serving 10/uni00A0million  clients.  Four  key  principles  have  been  defined  for  this  new entity: it will be a bank with local roots, a bank that is more responsive, accessible and efficient, a bank better adapted to the specific needs of each client category, and a bank that is responsible. The two networks will officially merge on 1/uni00A0January 2023, with a progressive rollout of the new organisation culminating in 2025.\n\n## CR\u00c9DIT DU NORD NETWORK\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit du Nord group consists of nine regional banks -/uni00A0Courtois, Kolb,  Laydernier,  Nuger,  Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  Marseillaise  de  Cr\u00e9dit, Tarneaud,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  de  Banque  Monaco  and  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord/uni00A0-  and  an investment services provider, the brokerage firm Gilbert Dupont.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  entities  are  characterised  by  a  large  degree  of autonomy in managing their activities,  which  is  chiefly  expressed  by rapid decision-making and responsiveness to client demands.\n\nThe  quality  and  strength  of  the  results  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  group have  been  recognised  by  the  market  and  are  confirmed  by  the long-term A- rating attributed by Fitch.\n\nCr\u00e9dit du  Nord  serves  1.8/uni00A0million individual clients (1) , 213,000 professional clients and non-profit associations and 47,000 corporate and  institutional  clients.  In  2021,  its  average  outstanding  deposits totalled  EUR/uni00A057/uni00A0billion,  compared  with  EUR/uni00A052/uni00A0billion  in  2020,  while average  loan  outstandings  stood  at  EUR/uni00A052/uni00A0billion,  compared  with EUR/uni00A050/uni00A0billion in 2020.\n\n## Boursorama\n\nBoursorama  is  a  subsidiary  of  Societe  Generale  and  a  pioneer  and leader in France for its three main businesses: online banking, online brokerage  and  online  financial  information  at  boursorama.com, ranked  No./uni00A01  for  economic  and  stock  market  news.  An  online  bank accessible to all, without any revenue or financial wealth prerequisites, Boursorama's promise is the same as it was when it was first created, i.e. simplify clients' lives at the most competitive price and furnish the best service possible in order to boost their purchasing power.\n\nBoursorama currently  serves  over  3.3/uni00A0million  clients  -  a  figure  it  has quadrupled in the last five years. This rapid growth has been matched by an increase in the bank's outstandings (in excess of EUR/uni00A048/uni00A0billion at end-December  2021),  demonstrating  the  appeal  of  its  fully  online model  based  on  client  autonomy  and  a  comprehensive  range  of banking products and services with automated processes.\n\nIn  2021,  Boursorama  extended  its  range,  particularly  as  regards investment  solutions  (such  as  its  MATLA  retirement  savings  plan:  a 100%  SRI  solution  and  the  least  expensive  on  the  market)  and  life insurance  and  brokerage  products  (its  new  PrimeTime  offer  gives clients access to Accelerated Book Building (ABB) transactions through the  PrimaryBid  platform).  It  also  launched  a  warranty  extension insurance  and  made  changes  to  its  Freedom  package  for  12-17/uni00A0year olds.\n\nAs in 2020, Boursorama was acclaimed the least expensive bank for the 14 th /uni00A0consecutive  year  at  the  Customer  Relationship  Podium  Awards  in 2021,  taking  6 th /uni00A0position  all  sectors  included.  It  continues  to  boast  an excellent  recommendation  rate  of  86%,  coupled  with  a  Net  Promoter Score  of  +40.  Buoyed  by  these  results,  it  is  confident  of  achieving  its targets  of  more  than  4/uni00A0million  clients  by  2023  and  profitability  of  over 25% by 2025.\n\nLaunched over 20/uni00A0years ago, its online portal, www.boursorama.com , is consistently ranked the No./uni00A01 website for financial and economic news and receives 47/uni00A0million visits a month (Source ACPM - December/uni00A02021).\n\nNumber of active clients.

(1)\n\n## Net banking income\n\nNet  banking  income  was  substantially  higher  in  2021,  up  +16.7% (+17.7%*) vs .  2020,  and  +16.1%  (+17.2%*) vs .  2020  on  an  underlying basis, with a very strong momentum in all businesses.\n\nFrench Retail Banking posted a solid performance in 2021. As a result, net banking income (excluding PEL/CEL provision) increased by +4.8% vs . 2020, driven by the recovery in net interest income and by buoyant fee income, particularly in respect of financial fees.\n\nInternational  Retail  Banking  &  Financial  Services  enjoyed  strong revenue  growth  (+9.9%* vs . 2020),  underpinned  by  the  excellent momentum  in  Financial  Services  (+32.0%* vs. 2020)  and  Insurance (+8.6%* vs. 2020).  International  Retail  Banking  benefited  from  a rebound in its activities (+2.8%* vs. 2020).\n\nGlobal Banking & Investor Solutions delivered a remarkable performance, with revenues up +25.2% (+26.1%*) vs . 2020. Financing & Advisory  posted  a  record  performance,  with  growth  of  +14.8% (+15.8%*) vs .  2020,  while  Global  Markets  &  Investor  Services  posted substantially higher revenues than in 2020, up +35.6% (+36.9%*).\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nIn 2021, operating expenses totalled EUR 17,590 million on a reported basis  and  EUR  17,211  million  on  an  underlying  basis  (adjusted  for transformation costs), i.e. an increase of +4.3% vs . 2020.\n\nThe increase  can  be  explained  primarily  by  the  rise  in  variable  costs associated with revenue growth (EUR +701 million) and the increase in the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund (EUR +116 million). The other  operating  expenses  declined  by  EUR  70  million,  excluding structure effect.\n\nDriven  by  a  very  positive  jaws  effect,  underlying  gross  operating income  grew  substantially  (+51.0%)  to  EUR  8,470  million  and  the underlying cost to income ratio improved by nearly 8 points (67.0% vs. 74.6% in 2020).\n\nExcluding  the  contribution  to  the  Single  Resolution  Fund  (SFR),  the underlying  cost  to  income  ratio  is  expected  to  be  between  66%  and 68%  in  2022  and  improve  thereafter.  This  aggregate,  excluding  the contribution  to  the  SRF,  amounts  to  64.7%  in  2021,  bearing  in  mind that SFR contribution totalled EUR 586 million in 2021.\n\nThe contribution to the Fund is expected to rise until the end of 2023.\n\nThe  radical  transformations  that  were  announced  for  the  Group  in 2021  have  led  to  changes  in  the  2023  cost  outlook.  The  various initiatives  in  progress  will  help  push  down  the  Group's  underlying cost-to-income  ratio  beyond  2022,  excluding  the  Single  Resolution Fund contribution year after year./uni00A0\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Cost of risk\n\nIn  2021, the cost of risk declined to a low 13 basis points, which was lower than the 2020 level of 64 basis points, i.e. EUR 700 million ( vs. EUR 3,306 million in 2020). The amount breaks down to a provision on non-performing loans of EUR 949 million and a provision write-back on performing loans of EUR 249 million.\n\nThe Group's provisions  on  performing  loans  amounted  to  EUR  3,355 million at end-2021.\n\nThe Group granted government-guaranteed loans (\"PGE\") to support its clients during the crisis. At 31 December 2021, the residual amount of government-guaranteed loans represented around EUR 17 billion. In France, this loan category totalled approximately EUR 14 billion, while net exposure stood at around EUR 1.5 billion.\n\nThe doubtful loan ratio stood at 2.9% at 31 December 2021, a decline on the end-September 2021 level of 3.1%. The gross coverage ratio on doubtful loans for the Group was 51% at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe cost of risk is expected to be below 30 basis points in 2022.\n\n## Operating income\n\nBook operating income totalled EUR 7,508 million in 2021 compared with EUR 2,093 million in 2020. Underlying operating income came to EUR 7,770 million compared with EUR 2,323 million in 2019.\n\n## Net profits or losses from other assets\n\nNet profits or losses from other assets totalled EUR 635 million in/uni00A02021, of which  EUR  439  million  from  the  disposal  of  Lyxor's  asset management activities and EUR 185 million in capital gains from the disposal of real estate.\n\n## Impairment losses on goodwill\n\nOn  back  of  the  review  of  International  Retail  Banking's  financial trajectory, the Group recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of EUR 114  million  in  2021  relating  to  the  acquisition  of  the  CGU  Africa, Mediterreanean Basis and Overseas.\n\n## Income tax\n\nThe Group recognised EUR 130 million in deferred tax assets in 2021.\n\n## Net income\n\n| (In EURm)                       | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Reported Group net income       | 5,641  | (258)  |\n| Underlying Group net income (1) | 5,264  | 1,435  |\n\n| (In %)              | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| ROTE (reported)     | 11.7%  | -0.4%  |\n| Underlying ROTE (1) | 10.2%  | 1.7%   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## DEFINITIONS AND METHODOLOGY, ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE 2.3.6 MEASURES\n\n## Framework\n\nThe  financial  information  presented  in  respect  of  the  financial  year ended 31 December/uni00A02021 was reviewed by the Board of Directors on 9 February 2022 and was prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted in the European Union and applicable at that date.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nIn  2020,  the  allocation  of  normative  capital  to  the  businesses  on  the basis of their capital consumption was determined in accordance with CRR rules, i.e. 11% of their risk-weighted assets, supplemented by the consumption  of  Common  Equity  Tier  1  capital  chargeable  to  each business  after  taking  into  account  non-controlling  interests  and  the adjustment of capital consumption in insurance activities. Accordingly, the capital allocation rule applies to the Group's three pillars - French Retail  Banking,  International  Retail  Banking  and  Financial  Services, and  Global  Banking  and  Investor  Solutions  -  and  enables  each activity's  capital  consumption  and  profitability  to  be  calculated  by activity  on  a  standalone  and  uniform  basis,  taking  into  account  the Group's regulatory constraints.\n\n## Net banking income\n\nNet banking income (NBI) for each business division includes:\n\n- revenues generated by its activity; p\n- the  yield  on  normative  capital  allocated  to  the  business  division, p which is calculated using a long-term rate by currency. In return, in order  to  compare  performances  between  the  Group's  different business lines, book capital is reassigned to the Corporate Centre at the same rate.\n\nMoreover, capital gains and losses generated by the business divisions on  the  disposal  of  shares  in  non-consolidated  entities,  and  income from management of the Group's industrial and bank equity portfolios, are booked  under  NBI  as  these  securities  are  classified  as available-for-sale financial assets.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating  expenses  for  the  business  divisions  correspond  to  the information reported in Note/uni00A08.1 to the Group's consolidated financial statements at  31  December/uni00A02020  (see  pages  483  to  485)  and  include their direct expenses, their management overheads, and a share of the head-office expenses, which are in principle almost fully redistributed between the business divisions. The Corporate Centre only books costs related to its own activity, along with certain technical adjustments.\n\n## Cost-to-income ratio\n\nThe  cost-to-income  ratio  indicates  the  operating  expenses  of  a business in relation to its net banking income. This indicator provides a measure of a system's effectiveness (see glossary).\n\n## IFRIC 21 adjustment\n\nThe IFRIC/uni00A021 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they fall due (generating event) in order to recognise only the portion concerning the current quarter, i.e. a  quarter  of  the  total.  It  consists  of  smoothing  the  charge recognised over the financial year to provide a more reliable economic picture of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period under  review.  By  applying  the  IFRIC/uni00A021  adjustment,  the  expense  previously recognised progressively if the generating event occurs over a  period of time - is instead recognised once and in its entirety. The contributions  to  Single  Resolution  Fund  \"SRF\")  are  part  of  IFRIC21 adjusted  charges;  they  include  contributions  to  national  resolution funds within the EU.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  difference  between  the  income  tax  charged  to  the Group's  consolidated  companies  and  the  sum  of  normative  taxes  of the strategic pillars is assigned to the Corporate Centre.\n\n## ROE, ROTE\n\nGroup  ROE  and  ROTE  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  average  Group shareholders' equity under IFRS.\n\n## It excludes:\n\n- unrealised or deferred capital gains or losses booked directly under p shareholders' equity, excluding conversion reserves;\n- deeply subordinated notes; p\n- undated subordinated notes adjusted as shareholders' equity. p\n\n## It deducts:\n\n- interest  payable  to  holders  of  deeply  subordinated  notes  and  of p adjusted, undated subordinated notes;\n- a provision in respect of the dividends to be paid to shareholders. p\n\nFor the ROTE, the following items are also excluded:\n\n- average net goodwill in the assets, and underlying average goodwill p relating to shareholdings in companies accounted for by the equity method;\n- average net intangible assets. p\n\n<!-- image -->",

The securities  were  fully  subscribed  by  Societe  Generale  Assurances. The operation follows in the footsteps of a first covered bond Security Token  issuance  worth  EUR  100/uni00A0million  on  the  Ethereum  blockchain, settled in euros in April/uni00A02019,  and  of  a  second covered bond Security Token issuance worth EUR 40/uni00A0million, this time settled in Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and issued by Banque de France in May/uni00A02020. This  latest  transaction  completes  a  new  step  in  the  development  of Societe  Generale  -  Forge,  a  regulated  subsidiary  of  Societe  Generale Group, which aims to offer crypto assets structuring, issuing, exchange and custody services to the Group's professional clients by 2022.\n\nThis  new  experimentation,  performed  in  accordance  with  best  market practices, demonstrates the legal, regulatory and operational feasibility of issuing more complex financial instruments (structured products) on public blockchain. It leverages this disruptive technology which enables increased efficiency and fluidity of financial transactions: unprecedented product  structuration  capacity,  shortened  time-to-market,  automated corporate actions, increased transparency and transaction and settlement speeds, as well as reduced cost and fewer intermediaries.\n\nThanks  to  Societe  Generale  -  Forge's  innovative  operating  model, Security  Tokens  can  be  directly  integrated  into  conventional  banking systems interfaced with the SWIFT format. Innovation is key to Societe Generale Group's digital transformation. The Group has been involved for  several  years  in  numerous  initiatives  based  on  blockchain  and distributed ledger technologies, using the most innovative technologies and creating disruptive business models, with the aim of better serving its clients.\n\n## SOCIETE GENERALE AND 2.4.2 KYRIBA JOIN FORCES TO CREATE A CLOUD TREASURY MANAGEMENT SOLUTION\n\nSociete  Generale's  clients  will  have  access  to  a  complete  treasury management solution (monitoring, payments and fraud management) based on Kyriba's global cloud platform.\n\nOn  11/uni00A0June  2021,  Societe  Generale,  one  of  the  leading  European financial  services  groups  particularly  in  the  field  of  transaction banking,  and  Kyriba,  a  global  leader  of  cloud-based  finance  and  IT solutions,  announced  in  London  a  strategic  partnership  to  launch  a\n\nnew  treasury  management  solution.  This  solution  will  include payment automation and fraud management functionalities, and will be  dedicated  to  the  Bank's  corporate  clients  and  their  subsidiaries. Fully hosted in the cloud, this solution will be based on Kyriba's global platform  and  distributed  by  Societe  Generale.  The  objective  was  to facilitate  daily  treasury  management  for  corporate  clients,  so  Kyriba and  Societe  Generale  pooled  their  expertise  to  offer  the  following functionalities:\n\n- real-time monitoring of treasury positions and provisional p management of liquidity flows;\n- payment automation (remittances); p\n- banking delegation and mandate management; p\n- enhanced fraud management; p\n- multi-bank  connectivity  and  ERP,  payment  validation  workflow p management.\n\nSince  it  is fully hosted  in  the  cloud,  the  solution  facilitates implementation  and  seamless  updates.  It  will  be  available  on  SG Markets, the Bank's digital client portal for corporates.\n\nBased  on  Kyriba's  global  cloud  platform,  the  functionalities  of  this solution  will  offer  the  same  level  of  quality  as  those  offered  to  the world's largest companies in terms of data management, cybersecurity, business processes and innovation.\n\nIt  was  launched  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021/uni00A0starting  with  the French market.\n\nAlexandre Maymat, Head of Global Transaction and Payment Services at Societe Generale commented: 'Treasury management is a key area of focus for companies and we believe it is essential to make this easier through simple, efficient and secure tools. This is even more important as  we  exit  the  current  crisis  and,  depending  on  their  size,  some companies  are  poorly  equipped  in  this  area.  With  our  open architecture model allowing us to offer our clients the best solutions on  the  market,  it  seemed  natural  to  partner  with  Kyriba,  whose solutions  are  known  for  their  robustness  and  adaptability.  This partnership also inaugurates other collaborations that we will be keen to develop with Kyriba to ensure we can always better anticipate and meet the needs of our clients.'\n\n'We  are  very  proud  to  join  this  strategic  partnership  with  Societe Generale. The recent crisis has underlined the need for companies to manage liquidity as closely as possible and to control and secure their payments.  We  believe  this  joint  solution  will  improve  the  way  they leverage  their  cash  and  liquidity  and  become  more  resilient,  more scalable and more competitive. The technological advance of Kyriba's Active Liquidity Management Platform in terms of Artificial Intelligence and real-time will help those businesses to better withstand and take advantage  of  every  opportunity  offered  by  the  market.  It  is  also  an important step in Kyriba's development, which will contribute to our growth  in  this  market,'  added  Edi  Poloniato,  co-Head  of  Banking Solutions for Kyriba.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To  meet  this  need,  Societe Generale Private Banking France offers a new  discretionary management solution, '29 Haussmann Signature ISR'.\n\nWith this pioneering initiative, clients have the assurance that at least 90% of their  mandate  will  be  invested  in  funds  or  ETFs  with  the  SRI label at all times.\n\nWith  the  '29  Haussmann  Signature  SRI'  mandate,  clients  invest  in Societe  Generale  Group  funds  with  SRI  certification,  which  select companies based on both traditional financial criteria and environmental, social and governance criteria.\n\nThis approach makes it possible to better assess certain risks (climate and  health  risks,  etc.)  and  to  identify  the  sources  of  opportunities represented  by  the  challenges  of  sustainable  development  in  the medium  and  long  term  (renewable  energies,  waste  treatment,  new technologies, etc.).\n\n## A solution designed by the managers of SG 29 Haussmann\n\nWith '29 Haussmann Signature ISR', clients delegate the management of  their  investments  to  the  SG  29  Haussmann  teams,  experts  in  the financial  markets,  who  steer  their  investments  with  the  aim  of generating sustainable performance over time.\n\nTo  build  their  portfolios,  SG  29  Haussmann's  managers  rely  on  the Societe Generale group funds and SRI-labelled ETFs covering different asset classes, geographical  areas,  capitalisation  segments  and investment themes.\n\n'We  have  chosen  to  complement  the  expertise  of  our  managers  by delegating the management of certain strategies to external partners to  whom  we  have  set  specifications  that  reflect  our  SRI  approach,' explained  Guillaume  de  Martel,  Executive  Chairman  of  SG  29 Haussmann.  This  new  offering  benefits  from  SG  29  Haussmann's allocation expertise and provides access to recognised SRI investment strategies  through  its  teams,  as  well  as  through  major  asset management  companies  such  as Mirova (Natixis Investment Managers),  DNCA  Finance,  La  Financi\u00e8re  de  l'\u00c9chiquier,  Amundi  and BlackRock\u00ae.\n\n'By  offering  our  clients  the  opportunity  to  contribute  to  a  more virtuous  and  sustainable  economy,  this  new  SRI-labelled  mandate management - a pioneer in France - is fully aligned with our strategy of being a positive-impact private bank and completes one of the most innovative  and  comprehensive  responsible  investment  packages  on the  market,'  added  Mathieu  Vedrenne,  Head  of  Societe  Generale Private Banking France.\n\n## BNP PARIBAS, CR\u00c9DIT 2.4.4 MUTUEL AND SOCIETE GENERALE ARE STUDYING A PLAN TO POOL THEIR ATMS TO INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY FOR THEIR CLIENTS\n\nBNP  Paribas,  Cr\u00e9dit  Mutuel (1) and  Societe  Generale (2) are  studying  a plan  to  pool  their  network  of  ATMs  in  France  in  order  to  together guarantee, on a long-term basis, the best access to automated banking services  and  strengthen  service  offerings  to  their  customers.  This sharing  would  allow  customers  of  the  three  banks  to  benefit  from enhanced access to all the services they offer to their customers free of charge,  on  common  ATMs,  including  cash  deposit  and  withdrawal, cheque deposit, account consultation and RIB printing services.\n\nThe  pooling  plan  comes  amid  rapid  changes  in  the  use  of  banking services,  and  where  the  use  of  cheques  and  cash  is  declining constantly.  These  trends,  which  accelerated  with  the  health  crisis (3) , has led to an explosion in the number of contactless payments (+53% in  2020)  and  a  sharp  drop  in  cash  withdrawals  (-23%  in  2020) (4) .  The pooling of ATMs could help ensure access to cash across France in the long term. Currently, 99% of France's population must drive at least 15 minutes to reach an ATM machine (5) .\n\nThe study will pay particular attention to the establishment of ATMs in rural and isolated territories, thereby reaffirming the commitment by the three banks to be local and relational banks. Project analysis will continue until the end of the year amid consultation and dialogue with key stakeholders, i.e. employe e re presentative bodies, local authorities, etc. The plan will be subject to the required approvals from the relevant regulatory bodies.\n\n- The SRI-label was launched by the Ministry of Economy and Finance in August/uni00A02016. It is the result of a strict labelling process conducted by two independent bodies (Afnor * Certification and EY France). The label aims to provide investors with better visibility on SRI products, while guaranteeing that their management is based on sound methodologies with a strong transparency requirement and quality information.

This  change  is  explained  by  a  EUR  16.9  billion increase in guarantee deposits received, a EUR 1.2 billion increase in securities settlement accounts payable and a EUR 2.3 billion increase in other sundry creditors.\n\nGroupe  shareholders'  equity  amounted  to  EUR  65.1  billion  at  31 December 2021 vs. EUR 61.7 billion at 31 December 2020. The variation is primarily attributable to the following factors:\n\n- net income Group share for the financial year at 31 December 2021 p of EUR 5.6 billion;\n- issuance and redemption of equity instruments: EUR -1.7 billion; p\n- remuneration of equity instruments: EUR -0.6 billion; p\n- treasury stock: EUR -0.5 billion; p\n- distribution of dividends: EUR -0.5 billion; p\n- unrealised or deferred capital gains and losses: EUR +1.1 billion. p\n\nAfter taking into account the non-controlling interest (EUR 5.8 billion), the  Group  shareholders'  equity  totalled  EUR  70.9  billion  at  31 December 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The Group is following with the utmost attention the development of the situation in Ukraine and Russia, and it is committed to supporting its clients and all its employees. Societe Generale complies rigorously with legislation in force and diligently applies all necessary measures to  strictly  observe  international  sanctions  as  soon  as  they  become public.\n\nAt  Group  level,  the  exposure  to  Russia (1) represents  1.7%  of  total exposure, i.e. EUR 18.6 billion at 31 December 2021 based on exchange rates  at  that  date.  The  amount  breaks  down  as:  EUR  15.4  billion  of exposure recognised in SG Russia (2) ('onshore exposures') and EUR 3.2 billion recognised outside Russia ('offshore exposures'), of which EUR 2.6 billion on the balance sheet.\n\nGroup  activities  situated  in  Russia  (SG  Russia (2) )  represent  2.8%  of Group net banking income in 2021 and 2.7% of Group net income (3) . They  chiefly  involve  our  banking  subsidiary  Rosbank,  which  is 99.97%-owned by the Group. Rosbank has a solid capital position, with a CET1 ratio of 10.74%, i.e. 274 basis points above the local regulatory requirement, and functions independently in terms of liquidity, with a loan-deposit ratio around 80% at 31 December 2021. These exposures are  largely  denominated  in  local  currency,  i.e.  up  to  99.7%  on  retail and 68% on corporate.\n\nThe exposures break down as follows:\n\n- retail outstandings account for approximately 41% of SG Russia's (2) p total  exposure. They are 70%- secured (mortgage and auto loans), the remaining 30% of which mainly comprises loans to employees of Rosbank's  corporate  clients,  for  whom  the  Bank  processes  their salaries;\n- corporate  exposure  represents  around  31%  of  the  total  and p principally involves large Corporates (80%);\n- exposure to financial institutions totals EUR 0.5 billion; p\n- russian sovereign debt and that of assimilated entities stands at EUR p 3.7 billion, including around EUR 1.2 billion in sovereign bonds.\n\nExposure to local counterparties subject to embargo is very low (EUR 0.2 billion (5) ).\n\nThe Group is conducting its business in Russia with the utmost caution and selectivity, while supporting its historical clients. Its priorities are to  reduce  its  risks  and  preserve  the  liquidity  of  its  subsidiary  by maintaining  a  diversified  collection  of  deposits.  The  rouble  clearing business is conducted entirely from Rosbank on behalf of the Group's major clients.\n\nWith a CET1 ratio of 13.7% at 31 December 2021, i.e. a buffer of around 470  basis  points  above  the  regulatory  requirement,  the  Group  has more than enough buffer to absorb the consequences of a potential extreme scenario, in which the Group would be stripped of property rights  to  its  banking  assets  in  Russia.  The  capital  impact  has  been estimated at around -50 basis points (4) of  the  CET1  ratio,  based  on  a Rosbank net book value equivalent to EUR 2.1 billion at 31 December 2021,  EUR  0.5  billion  in  subordinated  loans  and  including  the cancellation of associated RWA. This would not affect the payment of the dividend for the year 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the Group has minor exposure to Ukraine, representing less  than  EUR  80  million  at  31  December  2021,  mainly  through  its subsidiary  ALD  whose  activity  is  concentrated  on  international corporate clients.\n\nOffshore  exposures  to  Russia (1) , which  mainly  involve  operations conducted by our financing activities in Global Banking and Investor Solutions,  represent  EUR  3.2  billion  with  top-tier  counterparties  in their sector of activity. They specifically concern the following sectors: EUR 2.2 billion for the metals and minerals sector, EUR 0.7 billion for the energy sector, EUR 0.2 billion for the transport and telecoms sector and EUR 0.1 billion for financial institutions.\n\nCounterparties  under  embargo  represent  around  EUR  0.7  billion  in offshore  net  outstandings (5) .  For  the  record,  sanctions  forbid  new activities  but  do  not  prevent  the  settlement  of  operations  or necessarily the repayment of facilities.\n\nThe  Group  also  has  around  EUR  0.3  billion  in  net  outstandings  on private  banking  clients,  the  majority  of  which  are  mortgage  and Lombard loans.\n\nAt this stage, the Group is not changing its cost of risk target and will update it, if necessary, at the time of its Q1 22 results publication.\n\n## STATEMENT ON POST-CLOSING EVENTS 2.11\n\nSince the end of the last financial period, no significant change in the financial performance of the Group occurred other than those described in the present Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF on 9 March 2022.\n\n- Reported Group Net Income. (3)\n- Based on a EUR/RUB exchange rate of 120. (4)\n- Based on the lists of sanctions published at 27.02.2022. (5)\n\n<!-- image -->",

From a formal standpoint, the Board decided not to include the  purpose  in  the  By-laws.  However,  at  its  Extraordinary  General\n\nMeeting of 2020, Societe Generale modified its By-laws to specify that the  Board  determines the approaches of the Company's activity and ensures they are implemented according to its corporate interests by taking into account environmental and social responsibility considerations  (see  Chapter/uni00A05).  In  May/uni00A02021,  the  first  sentence  of  the preamble of the Board of Directors' Internal Rules was also modified to mirror this position.\n\n## Presentation of the organisation\n\n(At 17/uni00A0January 2022)\n\n<!-- image -->",

At that date, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi became Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a remained Chief Executive Officer. On 21/uni00A0May 2019, the Board of Directors decided to renew the term of office of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a as Chief Executive Officer for a further four-year term after his term of office as Director was renewed at the General Meeting of 21/uni00A0May 2019.\n\nLorenzo  Bini  Smaghi  was  reappointed  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors on 23/uni00A0May 2018.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  appointed  Jean-Bernard  L\u00e9vy  as  non-voting Director for a two-year term from 18/uni00A0May 2021. One of his tasks is to assist the Board of Directors in relation to its energy transition remit.\n\nSince  17/uni00A0January  2022,  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Oud\u00e9a  has  been  assisted  by  two Deputy Chief Executive Officers whose terms of office were renewed on 21/uni00A0May  2019,  until  the  expiration  of  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Oud\u00e9a's  term.  The  Chief Executive  Officer  and  the  two  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officers  are assisted  by  three  Deputy  General  Managers  who  are  not  corporate officers.\n\nOn  17/uni00A0January  2022,  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Oud\u00e9a,  Chief  Executive  Officer,  took direct  control  of  supervising  the  Risk  and  Compliance  functions,  in addition  to  the  Inspection  and  Audit,  Finance,  Corporate  Secretary Departments,  and  the  Human  Resources  and  Communication Departments.\n\nFrom  17/uni00A0January  2022,  Diony  Lebot,  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer, will  be  responsible  for  overseeing  all  ESG  policies  and  their  effective incorporation  into  the  strategic  trajectories  adopted  by  the  Group's business  units  and  functions.

An  Italian  national,  Mr Lorenzo  Bini  Smaghi  brings  to  the  Board  of  Directors  a  wealth  of experience in the international financial world.\n\nIf  shareholders  vote  to  renew  his  chairmanship,  the  Nomination  and Corporate  Governance  Committee  will  propose  to  the  Board  of Directors that he continues to serve as chairman of the board based on the  positive  assessments  of  the  operation  of  the  Board  of  Directors each year since 2015. The functions of the Chairman and of the Chief Executive  Officer  will  remain  separate  in  accordance  with  Article 511-58 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.\n\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me  Contamine,  independent  Director,  member  of  the  Audit  and Internal Control  Committee  since  2018  and  Chairman  of  the Compensation  Committee  since  2021  (member  since  2020)  will  be proposed  for  a  second  term.  A  French  citizen,  J\u00e9r\u00f4me  Contamine brings recognised experience in the management of large companies and financial expertise to the Board. He is a Director and member of the Audit Committee of TotalEnergies.\n\nDiane C\u00f4t\u00e9, independent Director, member of the Audit and Internal Control  Committee  since  2018  and  member  of  the  Risk  Committee since  2021,  will  be  proposed  for  a  second  term.

She  is  an  independent  Director  of  X-Forces Enterprises (United Kingdom).\n\nIf the General Meeting accepts these proposals, the Board of Directors will  continue  to  comprise  42%  women  and  over  90%  independent Board  members,  with  50%  of  directors  being  foreign  nationals, excluding the three employee members.\n\nAt 1/uni00A0January 2022, eleven Directors were members of one or several of the Board of Directors' Committees.\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProportion of independent Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAverage age\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6.5\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee  review  these objectives  each  year  through  an  annual  assessment,  the  results  of which  are  set  out  on  page  89  of  the  present  report  on  corporate governance. The Board of Directors also ensures the regular renewal of its members  and  strictly  applies  the  recommendations  of  the AFEP-MEDEF Code regarding the independence of its members.\n\nThe Board is committed to strictly upholding the guidelines laid down by  the  European  Banking  Authority  and  the  European  Central  Bank regarding fit and proper person procedures.\n\n|",

Furthermore,  the  Board  of  Directors  ensures that  it  has  technological  and  digital  transformation  expertise  among\n\nits  ranks.  Each  year,  the  Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance Committee and the Board of Directors reviews the balance existing in the Board of Directors' composition. Assessing the Directors' expertise highlights  the  complementary  nature  of  their  profiles  which  address the entire spectrum of the Bank's businesses and the risks associated with its activity.\n\n## Directors' expertise\n\nThe chart below illustrates the Directors' main areas of expertise and experience. Their biographies can be found on pages 71 to 79.\n\nEach of the ten key areas of expertise of the Board of Directors is held by at least four Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

The only change occurring between 2020 and 2021 was the appointment of S\u00e9bastien Wetter as Director in the new position of Director representing employee shareholders. It should be noted  that  Directors  representing  employees  are  not  taken  into account when calculating the Board of Directors' gender balance ratio.\n\nThe Board also makes sure that a balanced representation of men and women exists on its Committees. At 1/uni00A0January 2022, each Committee comprised both men and women.\n\nThe Audit and Internal Control Committee is chaired by a woman.\n\n## Sound balance in the ages and seniority of the Directors\n\nAt 1/uni00A0January 2022, the average age of the Directors was 58:\n\n- two Directors are less than 50; p\n- six Directors are between 50 and 60; p\n- five Directors are between 60 and 65; p\n- one Director is between 66 and 70; p\n- one Director is over 70. p\n\nThis  balanced  breakdown  ensures  that  members  have  both  the experience and the available time to devote to the Board's work. The desired objective is to preserve the balance between the different age brackets of Board members.\n\nBy the next General Meeting, average tenure on the Board of Directors will  be  seven  years.  The  average  should  be  weighed  up  against  the Directors' four-year terms of office and the Board of Directors' practice to  factor  in  the  independence  aspect, i.e. to  not  have  served  as  a Director for more than 12/uni00A0years when renewing the terms of office of the independent Directors.\n\n## Composition suited to the Group's international dimension\n\nNine different nationalities are represented on the Board of Directors, which includes two members who have dual citizenship.\n\nAll  Board  members,  ruling  out  the  Directors  who  are  employees, possess  international  experience,  either  because  they  have  held  a position outside France during their career, or because they have held one or several terms of office in non-French companies.\n\nThe aim of the Board of Directors is to ensure that at least one-third of its members appointed at the General Meeting are non-French citizens and, furthermore, to include persons whose nationalities embody the Group's  European  dimension.  At  1/uni00A0January  2022,  six  out  of  twelve Directors were non-French nationals.\n\n## MORE THAN 90% OF DIRECTORS WERE INDEPENDENT AT 1 JANUARY 2022\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and based on the report of its  Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee,  the  Board  of Directors reviewed the situation of each of its members at 1/uni00A0January 2022  with  regard  to  the  independence  criteria  defined  in  the aforementioned Code.\n\nIt  reviewed  the  status  of  the  business  relationships  existing  between the Directors or the companies they manage and Societe Generale or its  subsidiaries.  The  review  concerned  both  customer  and  supplier relationships.\n\nThe  Board  specifically  focused  on  the  banking  and  advisory relationships  between  the  Group  and  the  companies  in  which  its Directors are also executive officers to assess whether the nature and extent of these relationships could possibly affect the independence of Directors' decision-making. The assessment is based on a multi-criteria  review  integrating  several  parameters,  such  as  the Company's overall debt and liquidity, the ratio of bank debt to overall debt,  the  amount  of  Societe  Generale's  commitments  and  the significance  of  these  commitments  compared  to  total  bank  debt, advisory mandates held, and other commercial relationships.\n\nThe  review  concentrated  primarily  on  G\u00e9rard  Mestrallet,  Executive President  of  Al  Ula,  William  Connelly,  Chairman  of  the  Supervisory Board of Aegon N.V. and Chairman of Amadeus IT Group/uni00A0SA, and Juan Maria Nin G\u00e9nova, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Promociones Habitat, Itinere Infraestructuras and Mora Banc, and Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom.\n\nIn  the  four  cases,  the  Committee  ascertained  that  the  nature  of  the economic, financial and other relationships between the Directors, the groups  they  manage  or  chair  and  Societe  Generale  did  not  alter  the findings of their independence review conducted in early 2021. Societe Generale's  role  in  financing  the  debt  of  their  groups  appeared  to  be compatible with the Committee's assessment criteria, i.e. less than 5% of  the  banking and non-banking debt. They are therefore deemed to be independent.\n\nIn  light  of  the  report,  only  four  Directors  are  considered  not  to  be independent:  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Oud\u00e9a,  the  Director  representing  employee shareholders and the two Directors representing the employees.\n\nAt 1/uni00A0January 2022, the number of independent Directors was therefore eleven, i.e. 92% of the Board's members, using the AFEP-MEDEF Code's calculation rule that excludes the two employee representatives and the employee shareholder representative.\n\nThe  percentage  is  well  above  the  Board  of  Directors'  objective  of respecting  the  minimum  threshold  of  50%  of  independent  Directors recommended in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nIf the  General  Meeting  approves  the  resolutions  concerning  the composition of the Board of Directors:\n\n- the percentage of women on the Board of Directors would be 42%, p while the independence rate would be 92% (11 out of 12/uni00A0Directors) if the  three  Directors  representing  employees  are  excluded  from  the calculation in accordance with legislation and the AFEP-MEDEF Code;\n- 6  out  of  15/uni00A0Directors  would  be  non-French  nationals, i.e. the p percentage  of  international  Board  members  would  be  40%  if  the Directors  representing  employees  are  included,  and  six  out  of  12 Board members, taking the percentage of international members to 50% if the Directors representing employees are excluded from the calculation.\n\nThe Board consequently ensured that, in its present form, it has armed itself with all the necessary skills to function properly and to carry out its  brief  of  defining  the  strategy  of  Societe  Generale  Group  and reviewing its implementation.\n\n|",

He met Directors  individually,  in  particular  with  regard  to  the  assessment  of the  Board's  performances,  including  individual  Director  appraisals. The Chairman held several meetings with the ECB. He also participated in keynote speeches on finance and the macro-economy. He met with the authorities during his trip to Luxembourg. The Chairman also gave media interviews on several occasions and met with clients, investors and  shareholders.  In  order  to  prepare  the  General  Meeting,  he organised meetings with the main shareholders and proxies. Last, the Chairman  took  part  in  a  roadshow  to  showcase  the  Group's governance system to investors. Given the circumstances, he performs a substantial part of his work using videoconference facilities.\n\n## The Board of Directors' expertise\n\nThe Internal Rules of Societe Generale's Board of Directors define its organisation  and  operating  procedures.  The  rules  were  amended  on 18/uni00A0May 2021.\n\nThe Board of Directors deliberates on any matter falling within its legal and  regulatory  powers  and  must  devote  sufficient  time  to  perform its/uni00A0tasks.\n\nIn  particular,  the  scope  of  the  Board  of  Directors'  remit  includes  the following  areas  (see  pages  633  and  634,  pursuant  to  Article/uni00A01  of  the Internal Rules):\n\n- strategic  focus  and  operations: the  Board  approves  the  Group's p strategic  focus,  ensures  its  implementation  and  reviews  it  at  least once a year. The focus deals essentially with the Group's values and the  Code  of  Conduct  as  well  as  the  main  thrusts  of  the  policy  on social  and  environmental  responsibility,  human  resources,  and information  and  organisational  systems.  It  approves  the  plans  for strategic operations, in particular acquisitions and disposals, which may have a significant impact on the Group's earnings, its balance sheet structure and risk profile;\n- financial statements and communication: the  Board ensures the p accuracy  and  truthfulness  of  the  annual  and  consolidated  annual accounts,  and  the  quality  of  the  information  provided  to  the shareholders and the market. It approves the Management Report. It oversees  the  publication  and  communication  process,  and  the quality  and  reliability  of  the  information  to  be  published  and communicated;\n\n|",

        "page_content": "- risk management: the Board approves the global strategy and risk p appetite of any nature, and supervises the corresponding implementation. To this end, it approves and regularly reviews the strategies and policies governing the taking, management, monitoring and reduction of the risks to which Societe Generale is or could  be  exposed,  including  the  risks  created  by  the  economic environment. In particular, it ensures the adequacy and effectiveness of  the  risk  management  systems,  monitors  the  risk  exposure stemming from Group activities and approves the overall risk limits. It  ensures the effectiveness of the corrective measures taken in the event of a default;\n- governance: it  appoints the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and, p upon the latter's proposal, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s), it determines  any  possible  limitations  on  the  powers  of  the  Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s). It reviews the  governance  system,  periodically  assesses  its  effectiveness  and ensures that remediation measures to address potential shortcomings  have  been  taken.  It  specifically  ensures  compliance with banking regulations in respect of internal control. It also fixes guidelines and controls the implementation by the Effective Senior Managers of the oversight systems to ensure effective and prudent management of the Group, in particular the avoidance of conflicts of interest.  It  deliberates  on  changes  to  the  Group's  management structure prior to their implementation and is kept informed of the main changes to its organisation. At least once a year it reviews its own functioning and that of board committees, the skills, aptitudes and availability of its members, as well as on the conclusions of the periodic assessment thereof. It examines once a year the succession plan  for  the  Chairman  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officers.  Where appropriate, its gives prior consent to the dismissal of the Chief Risk Officer, after the Risk Committee and the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee have been consulted. It prepares the report on corporate governance;\n- compensation  and  wage  policy: the  Board  distributes  the  total p amount  of  compensation  awarded  to  Directors  and  drafts  the compensation policy principles applicable in the Group, in particular with  regard  to  regulated  persons.  It  sets  the  compensation  of  the Chief Executive Officers and  decides  on  the  allocation  of performance shares in accordance with the authorisations given at the General Meeting. Once a year it discusses the Company's policy regarding professional and wage equality between men and women;\n- preventive  recovery  plan: the  Board  establishes  the  preventive p recovery plan that is communicated to the European Central Bank and deliberates on any similar plan requested by foreign supervisory authorities.\n\n## Functioning of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Internal Rules govern the functioning of the Board of Directors; see Article/uni00A06  of  the  Internal  Rules,  page/uni00A0635.  A  meeting  of  the  board  is convened by the Chairman, by letter, fax, email or any other means, or at the request of one-third of the Directors. It meets at least eight times a  year,  notably  to  approve  the  annual  and  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## The Board of Directors' work\n\nIn 2021, the Board held 15 meetings (vs . 18 in 2021), the average length of  which  was  three  hours.  The  average  attendance  rate  of  Directors was 96% per meeting, compared with 97% in 2020. In addition to these meetings, the Board of Directors also held several conference calls to discuss current events.\n\nThree  executive  sessions  were  also  held  in  the  absence  of  Chief Executive  Officers  to  assess  the  General  Management  team,  the succession plans, the Company's organisation, compensation of chief executives and the strategic focus.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  reviewed  the  Group's  strategy  and  its  main businesses,  and  examined  the  competitive  landscape  during  two strategic seminars organised in March and September.\n\nFurther to the work already carried out, the Board of Directors devoted several work sessions on the link-up between the Societe Generale and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord networks, and the merger of ALD and LeasePlan which was announced to the market on 6 January 2022. It also approved the Lyxor disposal.\n\nAs is the case every year, the Board of Directors approved the annual, interim and quarterly financial statements, and reviewed the budget.\n\nDuring  2021,  the  Board  continued  to  monitor  the  Group's  liquidity profile and its capital trajectory in light of regulatory requirements.\n\nSimilarly, at each meeting, it monitored the remediation programmes put  in  place  following  the  settlement  agreements  concluded  with US/uni00A0authorities.\n\nThese agreements resulted in two decisions which were handed down by  US  federal  courts  on  30/uni00A0November  2021  and  2/uni00A0December  2021, resulting in the permanent dismissal of legal action brought by the US Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  relating  first  to  Societe  Generale's  IBOR submissions  and  certain  transactions  involving  Libyan  counterparties and, second, compliance with US economic sanctions. In requesting the courts to dismiss the legal proceedings, the DOJ acknowledged that the Bank had fully complied with its obligations under the related deferred prosecution agreements (DPA). The DPA of June/uni00A02018 was entered into contemporaneously between Societe Generale and the French Director of Prosecutions  ( Parquet  national  financier, \"PNF\")  regarding  a settlement ( convention judiciaire d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public , 'CJIP') focusing on the Libyan  matter.  In  this  matter,  the  PNF  issued  a  termination  of  legal proceedings order on the public proceedings against Societe Generale in December/uni00A02020 following its acknowledgment that Societe Generale had fulfilled its obligations under the CJIP.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  continue  to  strengthen  the  compliance programme and to ensure that respect for rules and integrity are the cornerstones of the Group's corporate culture.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  during  its  meeting  of  15/uni00A0December  2021 reviewed the implementation of the diversity objectives for governance  bodies  that  it  had  laid  down  at  its  Board  meeting  of 4/uni00A0November  2020.  This  diversity  policy  is  described  in  Chapter/uni00A03.1.5, 'Diversity Policy within Societe Generale'.\n\nEach  Director  receives  the  information  required  to  carry  out  their duties, in particular to prepare each Board meeting. The Directors are also  given  useful  information,  including  critical  information,  on significant  events  for  the  Company.  Each  Director  attends  training sessions to enable them to perform their duties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

The Board regularly reviewed the Group's risk status. It approved the Group's risk appetite. It approved the ICAAP and the ILAAP, as well as the Group's overall market risk limits. The Board reviewed the Annual Reports on internal  control  communicated  to  the  French  Prudential  Supervisory and Resolution Authority (ACPR), as well as the responses to follow-up letters following ACPR and ECB inspections.\n\nIt  also  assessed  the  performances  of  Chief  Executive  Officers  and determined  their  compensation,  as  well  as  that  of  the  Chairman.  It decided performance share plans.\n\nBoard  members  also  discussed  the  policy  in  place  with  respect  to gender equality in the workplace and equal pay.\n\nLast, the Board decided on the allocation of compensation to Directors (see page 90) and the non-voting Director.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  prepared  and  approved  the  resolutions  to  be submitted to the Annual General Meeting and in particular those relating to the reappointment of Directors whose terms are due to expire.\n\nEach year, the Board performs a review of its functioning by way of an assessment.  The  assessment  is  carried  out  every  three  years  by  an external consulting firm and, for the other years, is based on interviews and surveys conducted by the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee. As was the case last year (2020), the assessment was again performed internally.  In  2019,  the  assessment  was  carried  out  by  an external firm, which will be repeated in 2022. The conclusions of the 2021 review are set out in the assessment section of this report (see page/uni00A089).\n\nSimilarly,  and  as  is  the  case  every  year,  the  Board  discussed  the succession  plans  for  General  Management.  These  succession  plans distinguish between successions that occur when terms of office expire and unexpected successions, and are prepared by the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nMeeting  on  9  February  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  the propositions  presented  by  the  Compensation  Committee  regarding the Chief Executive Officers' quantitative and qualitative targets. The general principles of the overall structure of their remuneration remain unchanged on the whole (see 3.1.6).\n\nIn 2021, the working method employed by the Board was improved by systematising  the  use  of  a  Director  in  charge  of  tabling  strategic  or cross-business discussions after a presentation from General Management, where necessary. This process enhanced the substance of the work performed and added weight to each individual Director's involvement.  Furthermore,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  the  benefit  of Jean-Bernard  L\u00e9vy's  insight  in  his  role  of  non-voting  Director  for  a two-year term from 18/uni00A0May 2021. One of his tasks is to assist the Board of Directors in relation to its energy transition remit.\n\nNo new agreement was concluded during the year ended 31/uni00A0December 2021, directly or by any other intermediary, between on the one hand, any  of  the  corporate  officers  or  any  of  the  shareholders  holding  a fraction  of  voting  rights  exceeding  10%  of  a  company,  and  on  the other, another company controlled by the former in accordance with Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0233-3  of  the  French  Commercial  Code.  Excluded  from  this assessment were agreements on ordinary operations and concluded under normal conditions.\n\n|",

It examined the drafts to update the Board of Directors' Internal Rules. It ensured  that  the  Board's  composition  remained  balanced  in  light  of the forthcoming renewal of directorships in 2022. As is the case each year,  it  ensured  that  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  provisions  on  Director independence  was  being  complied  with.  It  decided  to  launch  two requests  for  proposals  to  recruit  Directors  in  2023  and  for  the  2022 external Board of Directors' appraisal.\n\nIt reviewed the composition of the Committees.\n\nAs  part  of  its  preparation  of  the  succession  plans  for  General Management, the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee relies on work carried out internally by the Chief Executive Officer and, where  necessary,  by  external  consultants.  These  succession  plans distinguish between unexpected successions and successions prepared ahead for the medium and long term.\n\nThe Chairman of the Committee, in conjunction with the Chairman of the  Board,  oversaw  the  Board's  internal  assessment  procedure  (see below on page/uni00A091).\n\nThe Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee prepared the conditions of the allocation of compensation to Directors.\n\nIt  prepared  the  Board's  review  of  the  present  report  on  corporate governance.\n\nIt  prepared  the  Board's  decision  on  the  Group's  diversity  targets  for the governing bodies, which were approved by the Board.\n\nIt also took note of the smooth running of the 2021 General Meeting.\n\n## Appraisal of the Board of Directors and its members\n\nEach  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  devotes  part  of  a  meeting  to discussing its own functioning based on an appraisal performed by a specialised  external  consultant  every  three  years,  and  in  other  years based  on  interviews  and  surveys  carried  out  by  the  Nomination  and Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nIn both cases, the anonymous responses are summarised and submitted in a document that serves as a basis for the Board's discussions.\n\nIn 2021, the appraisal was conducted on the basis of a questionnaire approved  by  the  Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee and individual and separate interviews with the Chairman of the Board of  Directors  and  the  Chairman  of  the  Nomination  and  Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nThe  appraisal  focuses  on  the  collective  functioning  of  the  Board,  as well as on the individual performance of each Director. The appraisal findings are prepared by the Chairpersons and subsequently discussed by  the  Nomination  and  Corporate  Governance  Committee  and  the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  appraisal  procedure  took  place  between  September/uni00A02021  and January 2022.\n\nIndividual performances were not discussed by the Board of Directors. The Chairperson informs each member of their appraisal results.\n\nThe opinions of Board members' performances are very positive and showed improvement on the previous year.\n\nAreas  for  improvement  were  expressed  on  the  organisation  of  Board work, namely the need for more summaries and more streamlined files.\n\nThe  Board  finds  the  seminars  and  executive  sessions  that  are organised to be of great value.\n\nStrategies such as presentations by a Director in the role as lead speaker were  very  effective  when  preparing  discussions.  Remote  meetings  (by videoconference) did not impinge on the Board's efficiency.\n\nThe Directors identified the following topics as areas which should be examined in greater depth:\n\n- CSR; p\n- sales and marketing activity; p\n- customer satisfaction; p\n- internal/HR organisation. p\n\nThe  Committees  operate  in  a  very  satisfactory  manner.  The  question was raised about creating a CSR Committee. The Board of Directors has chosen to directly handle CSR strategy at Board level. In future, once the applicable CSR legislation has been passed and once an evaluation of the decision to tap the expertise of a non-voting Director, has been performed, the issue of creating a dedicated committee will be tabled again,  bearing  in  mind  that  environment  and  climate  risks  are  dealt with  by  the  Risk  Committee.  The  Board  also  discussed  the  possible creation of a Strategy Committee and a Technology Committee. In the past, the option of creating a Strategy Committee was discarded so that strategy  questions  could  be  handled  at  Board  level.  The  question  of creating  a  Technology  Committee  is  a  more  recent  one.  Rather  than creating a committee, the preferred option is to increase training and presentations on the topic. The Board generally prefers not to create committees to deal with strategic topics, which, by their very nature, are debated by the Directors at Board meetings.\n\nBoard  members  greatly  appreciated  their  training  sessions.  The Directors  identified  the  following  topics  as  some  of  the  areas  which should be dealt with in greater depth, i.e. Asset Liability Management (ALM) matters and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues given the current legislative trends taking place.\n\n## Training\n\nTwelve  training  sessions  were  held  in  2021.  A  customised  training programme is systematically organised for each incoming Director.\n\nBoard members received additional training on the following matters in 2021:\n\n- liquidity, ALM; p\n- CSR; p\n- retail and investment banking products; p\n- accounting issues; p\n- artificial intelligence; p\n- security. p\n\nThe  training  programme  will  be  further  broadened  in  2022,  in accordance with the findings of the Board of Director's appraisal.\n\nAs a result of work performed at the annual seminar and debate over certain topics at Board meetings, additional training on the regulatory and competitive landscape will also be provided.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

The full amount was used in 2021.\n\nThe rules governing the breakdown of compensation to Directors are determined by Article/uni00A015 of the Board's Internal Rules (see Chapter/uni00A07).\n\nSince 2018, the amount of allocated compensation has been reduced by EUR 200,000, shared between the members of the Risk Committee and  the  members  of  the  Audit  and  Internal  Control  Committee meeting as the US Risk Committee. Diane C\u00f4t\u00e9, member of the Audit and Internal Control Committee, is exempted from participating in the work  of  the  US  Risk  Committee  and  thus  does  not  receive  any corresponding  compensation.

The  policy  reflects  the  Group's determination  to  recognise  all  talents  and  to  combat  all  forms  of discrimination  involving  beliefs,  age,  disability,  parenthood  status, ethnic origin, nationality, sexual or gender identity, sexual orientation, membership  in  a  political,  religious,  trade  union  or  minority organisation.  The  Group  has  signed  various  non-discrimination charters, notably with regard to men and women. Each year, the Board of Directors examines a progress report on these issues in and outside France, which can be found on the Societe Generale website.\n\nThe  Group  has  set  targets  for  the  promotion  of  women  and international profiles. With regard to the Board of Directors, Societe Generale is committed to respecting the 40% gender diversity rate. In addition,  the  Board  of  Directors  ensures  that  each  Committee includes men and women and that their chairs are divided between the  two  genders.  Since  17/uni00A0January  2022,  General  Management  has been  comprised  of  six  members,  including  two  women  and  two non-French nationals.\n\nThe  diversity  policy  stipulates  that  the  Group's  management  bodies must  include  at  least  30%  women  by  2023,  a  target  that  must  be achieved  in  business  lines  and  functions  alike.  The  target  will  be applied to the Group's management bodies and senior employees at two  levels.  First,  at  Group  Strategy  Committee  level,  which  includes General Management and the Heads of the Business and Service Units (around 30 managers), and second, it will also apply to the Group's 150 top executives (Group Key Persons). The Group has also implemented a  proactive  policy  to  increase  the  number  of  international  profiles  in management  positions  and,  more  broadly,  to  make  the  entire organisation an inclusive environment at all levels.\n\nAt 31/uni00A0December 2021, 23% of Group Strategy Committee positions and 25% of Group Key Person positions were held by women. An action plan was introduced to achieve the target of  30%  women in management bodies and increase the number of international (non-French) profiles in the Group's management bodies. The plan includes:\n\n- an  enhanced  talent  management  strategy  that  will  focus  on p supporting career paths and professional development for very high potential women and international profiles;\n- sessions to raise awareness about gender bias and stereotyping are p available to all employees and were made compulsory for managers and future managers in 2021. From 2022 onwards, the Group intends to also involve HR teams and managers in charge of recruiting and managing employees in these sessions;\n- a more collective approach when making management p appointments  with  a  view  to  enhancing  diversity  in  management bodies;\n- an assessment of each member of the Management Board based on p diversity targets as of 2021.\n\nGeneral Management will inform the Board of Directors of the results obtained for each year. The review will cover the proportion of women and  international  profiles  in  the  high-potential  and  future-manager pools, 'Group Key Person' positions and in defined succession plans, as  well  as  their  involvement  in  specific  development  programs,  the monitoring  of  their  career  paths  and  any  potential  pay  gaps,  and initiatives to draw the attention of the Bank's management bodies to these people.\n\nWhere  appropriate,  the  assessment  report  will  also  address  the reasons why the targets were not met and what measures have been taken to rectify the situation. The results are disclosed in the annual report on corporate governance.\n\n|",

The transparency, clarity and measurability of the chosen criteria are improved to meet stakeholders' expectations;\n- given the change in governance announced at end-2021 and in force p since 17/uni00A0January  2022,  the  financial  criteria  for  the  Chief  Executive Officer will be based solely on Group performance.\n\nIn  accordance  with  Article/uni00A0L./uni00A022-10-8  of  the  French  Commercial  Code ( Code de commerce ), the remuneration policy detailed below is subject to  the  approval  of  the  General  Meeting.  If  it  is  rejected,  the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of 18/uni00A0May 2021 will remain in effect.\n\nThe  General  Meeting  must  give  its  approval  prior  to  payment  of  the variable components of remuneration (annual variable remuneration and long-term incentives) or any exceptional components.\n\nBy virtue of the second paragraph of Article/uni00A0L./uni00A022-10-8 (III) of the French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors reserves the right to deviate from  the  approved  remuneration  policy  in  certain  exceptional circumstances,  provided  that  such  action  is  temporary,  in  the Company's  best  interests  and  necessary  to  ensure  its  viability  or long-term survival. The latter could in particular be made necessary by a  major  event  affecting  either  the  activity  of  the  Group  or  one  of  its areas of activity, or the economic environment of the Bank. The Board of Directors will decide on the adjustments that should be made to the remuneration  policy  in  light  of  any  such  exceptional  circumstances based  on  the  Compensation  Committee's  recommendation  and, where appropriate, the advice of an independent consultancy firm. For example, the Board could adjust or modify the criteria or conditions governing  the  calculation  or  payment  of  variable  remuneration.  Any such adjustments will be temporary.\n\n## GOVERNANCE OF REMUNERATION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\nThe governance framework and decision-making process in respect of the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officers  is  designed  to  ensure  that  their  remuneration  is  in  line  with both the shareholders' interests and the Group's strategy.\n\nThe process for defining, reviewing and implementing the remuneration  policy  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  and  the  Chief Executive  Officers  is,  for  its  part,  designed  to  avoid  any  conflict  of interests. This is achieved, in particular, by means of the composition of  the  Compensation  Committee,  studies  commissioned  from  an independent firm, internal and external auditing and the multi-stage approval procedure:\n\n- composition  and  functioning  of  the  Compensation  Committee: p the Committee is composed of at least three Directors, including one elected  by  the  employees.  At  least  two-thirds  of  the  Committee's members must be independent, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code (1) .  Its  composition  ensures  that  it  is  both  independent  and competent  to  judge  whether  the  remuneration  policies  and practices are appropriate in view of the Company's risk, equity and liquidity management. The Chief Executive Officer is excluded from the  Compensation  Committee's  deliberations  when  they  directly concern his own remuneration;\n- independent  evaluation: the  Compensation  Committee  bases  its p work on studies conducted by the independent firm of Willis Towers Watson. These studies are based on companies listed on the CAC/uni00A040 index as well as a panel of comparable benchmark European banks (Barclays,  BBVA,  BNP  Paribas,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole/uni00A0SA,  Credit  Suisse, Deutsche  Bank,  Intesa,  Nordea,  Santander,  UBS  and  UniCredit). They/uni00A0assess:\n- the competitiveness of the overall remuneration of the Chairman -of  the  Board  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officers  compared  with  a panel of peers,\n- Societe Generale's results compared to the criteria defined by the -Group to assess the Chief Executive Officers' performance, and\n- the correlation between the Chief Executive Officers' performance -and their remuneration;\n- internal and external auditing: the information serving as the basis p for  decisions  regarding  the  Chairman  of  the  Board's  and  Chief Executive  Officers'  remuneration  is  regularly  audited  by  either  the Internal Audit Division or external auditors;\n- multi-stage  approval: the  Compensation  Committee  submits  its p proposals  to  the  Board  of  Directors  for  approval.  The  Board's decisions then form the subject of a binding annual resolution at the Shareholders' General Meeting.\n\nThe  remuneration  and  employment  conditions  for  the  Group's employees are also taken into account as part of the decision-making process when defining and implementing the policy applicable to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officers.\n\nThe  Compensation  Committee  reviews  the  Company  remuneration policy as well as the remuneration policy for regulated employees (as defined under banking regulations) on an annual basis.\n\nIt  monitors  the  remuneration  of  the  Chief  Risk  Officer,  the  Chief Compliance Officer and the Head of the Inspection and Audit Division. It  receives  all  information  necessary  for  such  purposes,  in  particular the  Annual  Report  sent  to  the  European  Central  Bank.  It  submits  a policy  proposal  to  the  Board  of  Directors  for  performance  share awards and prepares the Board's decisions on the employee savings plan.\n\nAccordingly,  any  change  in  the  policy  and  terms  of  employee remuneration is flagged to the Board of Directors and approved by the latter at the same time as any change in the policy governing corporate officers so that it may make decisions affecting the officers by taking into account the remuneration conditions of the Group's employees.\n\nDetails  of  the  Compensation  Committee's  work  in  2021  appear  on page/uni00A087.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

His  appointment  was  renewed  on 23/uni00A0May/uni00A02018  for  the  same  duration  as  his  term  of  office  as  Director ( i.e./uni00A0 four years). He does not have an employment contract.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Oud\u00e9a  was  appointed  Chief  Executive  Officer  in  May/uni00A02008, then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2009, and Chief Executive Officer  again  on  19/uni00A0May  2015.  His  appointment  was  renewed  on 21/uni00A0May/uni00A02019.  He  terminated  his  employment  contract  when  he  was appointed  Chairman  and  CEO  in  2009  in  accordance  with  the AFEP-MEDEF  Code's  recommendations  regarding  corporate  officers not holding several concurrent duties.\n\nPhilippe  Aymerich  and  Diony  Lebot  were  appointed  Deputy  Chief Executive Officers on 14/uni00A0May  2018;  their  appointments were renewed on 21/uni00A0May 2019. The employment contracts held by Philippe/uni00A0Aymerich and Diony/uni00A0Lebot have been suspended for the duration of their terms of office. The collective bargaining agreement for the French banking sector governs any termination of their employment contracts, and in particular the requisite notice periods.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  Chief  Executive  Officers are appointed for a term of four years and may be removed from office at any time.\n\nThey are not bound to the Group by any service agreement.\n\nAdditional information on the positions of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officers can be found in the table on page/uni00A0136. The benefits and conditions applicable to the Chairman of the Board and Chief  Executive  Officers  once  they  leave  the  Group  are  detailed  on pages/uni00A0103-104.\n\n## REMUNERATION PRINCIPLES\n\nThe purpose of the compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board of  Directors  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officers  is  to  ensure  that  the Company's top-level positions attract the most promising candidates and to cultivate motivation and loyalty on a lasting basis, while also ensuring appropriate compliance and risk management, in accordance with the principles laid down by the Group's Code of Conduct.\n\nThe policy takes into account all remuneration components as well as any  other  benefits  granted  so  as  to  cover  the  entirety  of  the  Chief Executive  Officers'  compensation.  It  ensures  an  appropriate  balance between these various elements in the general interests of the Group.\n\nVariable remuneration, which is based on certain performance criteria, is  designed  to  recognise  the  existence  of  the  Group's  strategy  and promote its sustainability in the interests of shareholders, clients and staff alike.\n\nPerformance is assessed on an annual and multi-annual basis, taking into account both Societe Generale's intrinsic performance as well as its performance compared to the market and its competitors.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  pay  for  performance  principle,  non-financial aspects  are  taken  into  account  in  addition  to  financial  performance criteria when  calculating  variable  remuneration  and  long-term incentives;  such  non-financial  aspects  include  in  particular  issues  of corporate  social  responsibility  and  compliance  with  the  Group's leadership model.\n\nFurthermore, the Chairman of the Board's and Chief Executive Officers' remuneration complies with:\n\n- the Capital Requirements Directive of 20/uni00A0May 2019 (CRDV), the aim of p which  is  to  ensure  that  remuneration  policies  and  practices  are compatible  with  effective  risk  management.  CRDV  has  been transposed into national law and its remuneration principles have been in force since 1/uni00A0January 2021;\n- After application of the discount rate for variable remuneration awarded as instruments deferred for five years or more, pursuant to Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0511-79 of the French Monetary (1) and Financial Code, where applicable.\n\n|\n\n- the French Commercial Code; and p\n- AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendations. p\n\nLastly,  when remuneration is received in the form of shares or share equivalents,  Chief  Executive  Officers  are  forbidden  from  using  any hedging or insurance strategies, whether over the vesting or holding periods.\n\n## REMUNERATION OF THE NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN\n\nLorenzo Bini Smaghi's annual remuneration was set at EUR/uni00A0925,000 for the  duration  of  his  term  of  office  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on 7/uni00A0February 2018 and approved at the AGM held on 23/uni00A0May 2018.\n\nThe Board has made sure that this level of compensation is the median value for the following panel of European banks: Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, Credit Suisse, Deutsche  Bank,  Intesa Sanpaolo, Nordea, Santander, UBS and UniCredit.\n\nHe does not receive remuneration in his capacity as Director.\n\nTo  ensure  his  total  independence  when  fulfilling  his  duties,  he  does not  receive  variable  compensation,  securities  or  any  compensation contingent on the performance of Societe Generale or the Group.\n\nHe is provided with company accommodation for the performance of his duties in Paris.\n\n## REMUNERATION OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT\n\n## Balanced remuneration taking into account the expectations of the various stakeholders\n\nThe remuneration of Chief Executive Officers breaks down into three components:\n\n- fixed  remuneration  (FR) rewards  experience  and  responsibility, p taking  into  account  market  practices.  It  accounts  for  a  significant proportion  of  overall  remuneration  and  serves  as  the  basis  for calculating the maximum  percentages for annual variable remuneration and long-term incentives;\n- annual  variable  remuneration  (AVR) rewards  both  financial  and p non-financial  performance  over  the  year  as  well  as  the  Chief Executive Officers' contributions towards the success of the Societe Generale Group. It is capped at 135% of annual fixed remuneration for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  115%  for  the  Deputy  Chief Executive Officers;\n- long-term incentives (LTI) aim to align the Chief Executive Officers' p focus with shareholders' interests, and to provide the former with an incentive to deliver long-term performance. Vesting of LTIs is subject to  a  condition  of  continued  presence  and  is  based  on  the  Group's financial  and  non-financial  performance  as  measured  against  both internal and external criteria. The amount awarded is capped at 135% of  annual  fixed  remuneration  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  at 115% for the Deputy Chief Executive Officers (based on IFRS values).\n\nPursuant  to  CRDV,  and  as  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  in May/uni00A02014,  the  total  variable  remuneration  component  ( i.e. annual variable remuneration plus long-term incentives) is capped at 200% of fixed remuneration (1) .",

        "page_content": "## Fixed remuneration\n\nIn line with the AFEP-MEDEF  Code's  recommendations,  fixed remuneration is reviewed only after relatively long intervals.\n\nSince  the  Board  of  Directors'  decision  of  31/uni00A0July  2014  to  increase Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Oud\u00e9a's  fixed  remuneration  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  by EUR/uni00A0300,000 to compensate him for the loss of his pension rights under the  Group's  supplementary  schemes,  his  annual  fixed  remuneration has  amounted  to  EUR/uni00A01,300,000.  The  previous  review  of  his  fixed remuneration took effect on 1/uni00A0January 2011.\n\nPhilippe Aymerich and Diony Lebot, who were both appointed Deputy Chief  Executive  Officers  on  3/uni00A0May  2018,  with  effect  on  14/uni00A0May  2018, each receive EUR/uni00A0800,000 in annual fixed remuneration, as decided by the  Board  of  Directors  on  3/uni00A0May  2018  in  line  with  the  Company's remuneration  policy  in  force  at  that  time.  Their  annual  fixed remuneration has since remained unchanged.\n\nThe fixed remuneration set out above for each of the Chief Executive Officers was approved at the AGM of 18/uni00A0May 2021.\n\nAs  recommended  by  the  Compensation  Committee,  the  Board  of Directors decided  on  9/uni00A0February 2022  to  maintain  the  fixed remuneration for all Chief Executive Officers at the same amounts.\n\nAny  change  to  the  above  officers'  fixed  remuneration  endorsed  by  the Board requires the approval of the General Meeting before it takes effect.\n\n## Financial criteria: 60%\n\n## Non-financial criteria: 40%\n\nFinancial  criteria based  on  annual  financial  performance.  Indicators and  target  achievement  levels  are  set  in  advance  by  the  Board  of Directors and are primarily based on the respective budget targets for the Group and the businesses in each Chief Executive Officer's remit.\n\n## Financial portion\n\nThe  financial  portion  is  calculated  according  to  the  Group's  or  the business's financial performance targets being achieved.\n\nIn  light  of  the  changes  to  Group  governance  announced  at  the  end  of 2021  and  in  force  since  17/uni00A0January  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  on 9/uni00A0February  2022,  following  the  recommendations  of  the  Compensation Committee,  decided  that  the  financial  criteria  for  the  Chief  Executive Officer will be based solely on Group performance (in 2021, these criteria were split between Group targets and targets for his individual/uni00A0remit).\n\nThe  financial  criteria  for  the  annual  variable  remuneration  of  the Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officers  will  remain  split  between  Group targets and targets for their individual remits:\n\n- 60% for Group performance indicators; and p\n- 40% for indicators concerning each Deputy Chief Executive Officer's p individual remit.\n\nThe financial indicators used remain unchanged:\n\n- the financial criteria for the Group are the return on tangible equity p (ROTE), the Core Equity Tier/uni00A01  (CET1)  ratio  and  the  cost-to-income (C/I) ratio, with an equal weighting for each indicator;\n- the financial criteria for remits involving specific responsibilities are p gross operating income, Return on Normative Equity (RONE) and the cost-to-income  ratio  of  the  individual  supervisory  remit,  with  an equal weighting for each indicator.\n\nNon-financial  criteria based  essentially  on  the  achievement  of  key targets in relation to the Group's strategy, and namely the CSR targets, operational efficiency, risk management and regulatory compliance.\n\nCovering both financial and operational aspects, these indicators are directly linked to the Group's strategy and reflect compliance with the predefined  budgets.  The  Board  of  Directors  excludes  from  its calculations any components it deems exceptional.\n\n- Compliance with the  budgetary  target  equates  to  an  achievement p rate of 80%.\n- The budgetary target is guided by: p\n- a  high  point  defined ex  ante by  the  Board  of  Directors  and -allowing for an achievement rate of 100%,\n- a low  point  defined ex ante by  the  Board  of  Directors -corresponding to an achievement rate of 40% and below which the achievement rate is considered zero.\n\nThe achievement rate of each target is defined on a straight-line basis between these limits.\n\nThe  financial  portion  is  capped  at  60%  of  the  maximum  annual variable  remuneration,  with  the  latter  corresponding  to  135%  of annual fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and 115% for the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.\n\n## Non-financial portion\n\nEach  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  sets  non-financial  targets  for  the following financial year. They include collective targets, reflecting the team  spirit  that  is  essential  to  General  Management;  however,  the Board also sets targets specific to each Chief Executive Officer based on their respective remits.\n\nFollowing the recommendations of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors on 9/uni00A0February 2022 decided to simplify the structure of  non-financial  criteria  for  Chief  Executive  Officers  in  order  to  place special emphasis on CSR criteria and improve the transparency, clarity and measurability of the criteria used.\n\n## Annual variable remuneration\n\n## glyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>VeV%Rc f%glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>eTglyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>fcVi\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  each  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  defines  the evaluation  criteria  that  will  be  used  to  calculate  the  Chief  Executive Officers' annual variable remuneration in respect of the financial year.\n\nThe general principles defined for the 2021 financial year were renewed.\n\nThe main changes that were approved by the Board of Directors on 9 February  2022  following  recommendations  of  the  Compensation Committee  concern  the  process  for  determining  annual  variable remuneration:\n\n- the  structure  of  non-financial  criteria  is  simplified,  with  a  special p focus on CSR criteria. The transparency, clarity and measurability of the chosen criteria are improved to meet stakeholders' expectations;\n- given  the  change  in  governance  announced  at  end-2021  and p applicable since 17/uni00A0January 2022, the financial criteria for the Chief Executive Officer will be based solely on Group performance.\n\nAnnual  variable  remuneration  is  60%  based  on  financial  criteria  and 40%  on  non-financial  criteria,  thus  combining  an  evaluation  of  the Group's  financial  performance  with  an  assessment  of  managerial skills, in line with the Group's strategy and leadership model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

In the event of exceptional performance, the achievement rate of some quantifiable  non-financial  targets  can  be  increased  to  120%  by  the Board  of  Directors,  bearing  in  mind  that  the  overall  non-financial target achievement rate may not exceed 100%.\n\nThe  non-financial  portion  is  capped  at  40%  of  the  maximum  annual variable  remuneration,  the  latter  corresponding  to  135%  of  annual fixed  remuneration  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  115%  for  the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  reviews  the  financial  and  non-financial performance criteria each year.\n\n## SUMMARY OF THE CRITERIA FOR ANNUAL VARIABLE REMUNERATION\n\nThe financial and non-financial targets and their respective weightings are set out in the below table.\n\n|                                   |            | F./uni00A0Oud\u00e9a Weight   | P./uni00A0Aymerich and D./uni00A0Lebot Weight   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial targets - 60%           | Indicators |                          |                                                 |\n|                                   | ROTE       | 20.0%                    | 12.0%                                           |\n| For the Group                     | CET1 ratio | 20.0%                    | 12.0%                                           |\n|                                   | C/I ratio  | 20.0%                    | 12.0%                                           |\n|                                   | GOI        |                          | 8.0%                                            |\n| Individual remits                 | C/I ratio  |                          | 8.0%                                            |\n|                                   | RONE       |                          | 8.0%                                            |\n| TOTAL FINANCIAL TARGETS           |            | 60.0%                    | 60.0%                                           |\n| Non-financial targets - 40%       |            |                          |                                                 |\n| CSR                               |            | 20.0%                    | 20.0%                                           |\n| Specific to each individual remit |            | 20.0%                    | 20.0%                                           |\n| TOTAL NON-FINANCIAL TARGETS       |            | 40.0%                    | 40.0%                                           |\n\nThe non-financial targets incorporate both quantifiable targets set ex ante by the Board of Directors and more qualitative targets, such as meeting milestones in the execution of certain strategic projects.\n\n|",

This concerns  both  cash  payments  and  awards  of  shares  or  share equivalents subject to the achievement of long-term Group profitability  and  equity  targets;  the  amounts  awarded  are  reduced  if targets  are  not  met.  The  Board  of  Directors  reviews  the  target achievement rates ahead of the definitive vesting of deferred variable remuneration. A six-month holding period applies after each definitive vesting date.\n\nThe  value  of  the  variable  portion  granted  in  shares  or  share equivalents is calculated on the basis of a share price set by the Board of  Directors  in  March  of  each  year  and  corresponding  to  the trade-weighted average of the twenty trading days prior to the Board Meeting. The portion of annual variable remuneration granted as share equivalents entitles the beneficiary to payment of a sum equivalent to any dividend payments made over the compulsory holding period. No dividends are paid during the vesting period.\n\nFurthermore,  if  the  Board  deems  that  a  decision  taken  by  the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officers has particularly  significant  consequences  for  the  Company's  results  or image, it may decide not only to reconsider payment of the deferred annual variable remuneration in full or in part (malus clause), but also to recover, for each award, all or part of the sums already distributed over a five-year period (clawback clause).\n\nLastly, the vesting of the deferred annual variable remuneration is also subject  to  a  condition  of  presence  throughout  the  Chief  Executive Officer's  current  term of office.  The  only  exceptions to this condition are  as  follows:  retirement,  death,  disability,  incapacity  to  carry  out duties  or  removal  from  office  due  to  a  strategic  divergence  with  the Board of Directors. Once the Chief Executive Officer's current term of office comes to an end, this condition of presence no longer applies. However,  if,  after  a  Chief  Executive  Officer  leaves  office,  the  Board observes  that  a  decision  they  took  has  particularly  significant consequences  for  the  Company's  results  or  image,  it  may  decide  to apply either the malus or the clawback clause.\n\n## TR#\n\nAnnual  variable  remuneration  is  capped  at  135%  of  annual  fixed remuneration  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  at  115%  for  the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.\n\n## Long-term incentives\n\n## glyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>VeV%Rc #%glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>eTglyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>#cVi\n\nChief Executive Officers are awarded long-term incentives consisting of shares or share equivalents in order to involve them in the Company's long-term  progress  and  to  align  their  interests  with  those  of  the shareholders.\n\nIn order to comply with the AFEP-MEDEF Code's recommendations, at its meeting held each year to approve the financial statements for the previous  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  decides  whether  to  award  any Societe  Generale  shares  or  share  equivalents  to  the  Chief  Executive\n\nOfficers. The fair value of the award upon granting is proportional to the  other  components  of  their  remuneration  and  is  set  in  line  with practices from previous years. Said fair value is based on the share's closing price on the day before the Board Meeting. The Board cannot award  Chief  Executive  Officers  long-term  incentives  when  they leave/uni00A0office.\n\n## )Vi'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>eglyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> Reglyph<c=23,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> #Rm Ve' \"glyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> c\"eglyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>E'V%  glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>eTVe'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>)Vi\n\nIn line with previous years, at its meeting on 9/uni00A0February 2022, the Board of Directors accepted the Compensation Committee's recommendation to  keep  the  main  features  of  the  long-term  incentives  (LTI)  plan unchanged.\n\nThe features of the LTI plan are as follows:\n\n- shares  or  share  equivalents  are  granted  in  two  instalments,  with p vesting periods of four and six years, followed by a one-year holding period, thus increasing the indexing periods to five and seven years, respectively;\n- definitive vesting subject to a condition of presence throughout the p vesting periods, as well as performance conditions.\n\nThe performance conditions governing vesting are as follows:\n\n- for  80%  of  the  LTI  award,  the  relative  performance  of  the  Societe p Generale  share,  as  measured  by  the  increase  in  total  shareholder return  (TSR)  compared  with  that  for  11  comparable  European banks (1) over the full vesting periods. Consequently, the full number of shares or share equivalents will only vest if Societe Generale's TSR falls in the first quartile of the sample panel. If it falls slightly above the median value, the vesting rate will be 50% of the total number of shares or share equivalents granted. No shares or share equivalents will  vest  if  the  TSR  performance  is  below  the  median  value  (the complete vesting chart is shown below);\n- for 20% of the LTI award, the Group's relative CSR performance. Half p (10%)  is  conditional  on  the  Group's  compliance  with  its  energy transition  financing  commitments  and  the  other  half  (10%)  on  its positioning  within  the  main  extra-financial  ratings  (S&P  Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, Sustainalytics and MSCI).\n\nIn  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  will  set  a  target  for  the  2023  energy transition financing criterion in respect of the Group's CSR policy and commitments regarding the financed energy mix.\n\nAs for the portion based on external extra-financial ratings, the vesting rate will be as follows:\n\n- 100% vesting if all three target ratings are achieved over a three-year p period as from the year of the award ( i.e. for awards made in 2023 in respect of 2022, the ratings for 2024, 2025 and 2026);\n- two-thirds  vesting  if  on  average  at  least  two  target  ratings  are p achieved over a three-year period as from the year of the award.\n\nThe criterion is examined if the ratings performances required by the following three extra-financial rating agencies are met:\n\n- S&P Global CSA: positioning in the first quartile; p\n- Sustainalytics: positioning in the first quartile; p\n- MSCI: rating \u2265/uni00A0BBB. p\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Societe Generale will in such circumstances be released from  its  obligation  to  pay  any  financial  consideration  and  may furthermore claim back any consideration that may have already been paid since the breach.\n\nIn accordance with Article/uni00A023.4 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, no payments will  be  made  under  the  non-compete  to  any  Chief  Executive  Officer leaving  the  Company  within  six  months  of  drawing  their  pension  or beyond the age of 65.\n\n## iV)VhReTV #Rm\n\nAs  recommended  under  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Oud\u00e9a terminated  his  employment  contract  upon  his  appointment  to  the position of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2009. Accordingly, he forfeited his entitlement to the benefits and guarantees that he would otherwise have enjoyed as an employee with close to 15/uni00A0years' service.\n\nAll  Chief  Executive  Officers  (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Oud\u00e9a,  Philippe  Aymerich  and Diony Lebot (3) )  are  entitled  to  severance  pay  in  respect  of  their  Chief Executive Officer positions.\n\nThe conditions governing their severance pay are as follows:\n\n- severance  pay  will  only  be  owed  in  the  event  of  non-voluntary p departure  from  the  Group,  confirmed  as  such  by  the  Board  of Directors.  No  severance  pay  will  be  owed  in  the  event  of  serious misconduct,  resignation  or  non-renewal  of  a  Chief  Executive Officer's appointment for any reason;\n- severance pay will be contingent upon an overall achievement rate p for the annual variable remuneration targets of at least an average of  60%  over  the  three  years  prior  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer leaving office (or over the duration of their term of office if less than three years);\n- the  sum  paid  will  represent  two  years'  fixed  remuneration,  in  line p with the AFEP-MEDEF Code's recommendation, i.e. two years' fixed remuneration plus variable remuneration;\n- no  severance  pay  will  be  owed  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  or  a p Deputy Chief Executive Officer if they leave office within six months of drawing their French state pension, or if they are entitled to a full state pension upon their departure (in accordance with Article/uni00A024.5.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code);\n- in accordance with Article/uni00A024.5.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board p of  Directors reviews the Company's situation and the performance of each Chief Executive Officer ahead of any decisions on severance pay,  in  order  to  confirm  that  neither  the  Company  nor  the  Chief Executive Officer is failing to perform.\n\nUnder  no  circumstances  may  the  severance  pay  and  non-compete clause  combined  exceed  the  cap  recommended  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code ( i.e. two years' fixed plus annual variable remuneration including, where applicable, any other severance payments provided for under an employment contract - in particular any contractual redundancy pay). This  cap  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  fixed  and  annual  variable remuneration awarded over the two years preceding severance.\n\n## OTHER BENEFITS FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n\nThe Chief Executive Officers each have their own company car, which is  available  for  private  as  well  as  professional  use,  and  insurance providing the same health and death/disability cover as for employees.\n\n## Exceptional variable remuneration\n\nSociete  Generale  does  not  generally  award  exceptional  variable remuneration  to  its  Chief  Executive  Officers.  However,  in  light  of legislation requiring prior approval of all aspects of the remuneration policy,  the  Board  of  Directors  reserves  the  right  to  pay  additional variable remuneration if warranted in certain highly specific situations, for example, due to the corresponding impact on the Company, or the level  of  commitment  and  challenges  involved.  Grounds  for  such remuneration would need to be given and said remuneration would be set in accordance with the general principles of the AFEP-MEDEF Code on remuneration, as well as with the recommendations of the French Financial Markets Authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF).\n\n- It would  be  paid  on  the  same  terms  as  the  annual  variable remuneration, i.e. partially deferred over a period of three years, and subject to the same vesting conditions.\n\n|",

The same principle will also apply to all other benefits granted to the Chairman of  the  Board  of  Directors  or  the  Chief  Executive  Officers  ( e.g. supplementary pension, health and disability insurance,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  is  therefore  responsible  for  setting  the  fixed remuneration  of  the  incoming  Chairman  of  the  Board  or  that  of  the Chief Executive Officers in light of these conditions, and in line with the remuneration awarded to the existing Chairman and Chief Executive Officers and in accordance with the practices of comparable European financial institutions.\n\nLastly, should the incoming Chairman of the Board or Chief Executive Officer be selected from outside the Societe Generale Group, they may be awarded a hiring bonus designed to act as compensation for any remuneration  they  may  have  forfeited  upon  leaving  their  previous employer.  This  bonus  would  vest  on  a  deferred  basis  and  would  be conditional upon the satisfaction of performance conditions similar to those  applicable  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officers'  deferred  variable remuneration.\n\n## DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION\n\nThe  total  remuneration  awarded  to  Directors  is  approved  by  the General  Meeting.  The  total  amount  of  remuneration  awarded  to  the Directors  has  been  set  at  EUR/uni00A01,700,000  since  2018,  bearing  in  mind that the number of Directors has increased from 12 to 13 since the new Director representing the employees was elected.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  do  not receive any remuneration as Board members.\n\nThe rules governing this remuneration and its breakdown between the Directors are defined under Article/uni00A015 of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors (see Chapter/uni00A07) and detailed on page/uni00A090.\n\n## Total remuneration and benefits for the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officers paid in or awarded in respect of 2021\n\nReport  submitted  to  the  approval  of  the  shareholders  pursuant  to Article/uni00A0L./uni00A022-10-34(I) of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe Chairman  of the Board's and Chief Executive Officers' remuneration  for  2021  complies  with  the  remuneration  policy approved by the General Meeting of 18/uni00A0May 2021.\n\nThe  remuneration  policy,  the  performance  criteria  used  to  establish the  annual  variable  remuneration  and  the  terms  governing  the attribution of long-term incentives are defined in accordance with the principles set out at the beginning of this chapter. The remuneration recommendations for 2021 comply with this policy framework.\n\n## RESOLUTIONS PASSED AT THE GENERAL MEETING OF 18 MAY 2021\n\nAt the General Meeting of 18/uni00A0May 2021, resolutions 5 and 6 concerning the  remuneration  policy  applicable  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  Chief  Executive  Officers  over  the  coming  years,  were adopted  by  majorities  of  94.95%  (for  the  resolution  regarding  the Chairman of the Board) and 96.55% (for the resolution regarding the Chief Executive Officers).\n\nResolutions 9 to 14 regarding the Chairman of the Board's and Chief Executive Officers' remuneration paid in or awarded in respect of 2020 were adopted by majorities of 94.79% (for the resolution regarding the Chairman  of  the  Board)  and  between  85.05%  and  85.42%  (for  the resolution regarding the Chief Executive Officers). Lastly, Resolution 8 regarding  the  application  of  the  remuneration  policy  for  2020, including  in  particular  the  regulatory  pay  ratios,  was  approved  by  a majority of 97.96%.\n\nThe approval rates of the ex post 2020 resolutions regarding the Chief Executive Officers differed compared to those previously observed. In order  to  meet  the  expectations  of  stakeholders,  the  structure  of non-financial  criteria  was  simplified,  with  a  special  focus  on  CSR criteria.  The  transparency,  clarity  and  measurability  of  the  selected criteria  were improved as part of the ex ante policy  presented at the beginning of the present chapter (see page 99).\n\n## REMUNERATION OF THE NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN\n\nLorenzo Bini Smaghi's annual remuneration was set at EUR/uni00A0925,000 for the  duration  of  his  term  of  office  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on 7/uni00A0February 2018 and approved at the AGM held on 23/uni00A0May 2018.\n\nHe does not receive variable remuneration, remuneration as a Director, securities  or  any  compensation  contingent  on  the  performance  of Societe Generale or the Group.\n\nHe is provided with company accommodation for the performance of his duties in Paris.\n\nThe amounts paid during 2021 are shown in the table on page/uni00A0117.\n\n## REMUNERATION OF GENERAL MANAGEMENT\n\nThe remuneration policy for  the  Chief  Executive  Officers  ensures  the payment  of  balanced  remuneration,  taking  into  account  the expectations of the various stakeholders.\n\n## Fixed remuneration for 2021\n\nThe Chief Executive Officers' fixed remuneration remained unchanged in  2021.  It  amounted  to  EUR/uni00A01,300,000  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer and EUR/uni00A0800,000 for each Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## Annual variable remuneration for 2021\n\nfVhglyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"hdReTV Thglyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>'Vhglyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>R Reglyph<c=23,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> RiiViidVe' glyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"h glyph<c=11,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>Gglyph<c=11,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=10,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\n\nAt  its  meetings  of  9/uni00A0February  2021  and  11/uni00A0March  2021,  the  Board  of Directors defined the evaluation criteria for the Chairman of the Board of Directors' and Chief Executive Officers' annual variable remuneration for  2021,  60%  of  which  is  contingent  on  the  achievement  of  financial targets, and 40% on the achievement of non-financial targets.\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of 18/uni00A0May 2021, these criteria include the following:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

Covering both financial and operational aspects, these indicators  are  directly  related  to  the  Group's  strategy  and  reflect compliance  with  the  predefined  budgets.  The  Board  of  Directors excludes from its calculations any components it deems exceptional.\n\n- Compliance with the  budgetary  target  equates  to  an  achievement p rate of 80%.\n- For each performance target, the budgetary target is guided by: p\n- a high point pre-defined by the Board of Directors allowing for an -achievement rate of 100%,\n- a  low  point  pre-defined  by  the  Board  of  Directors  reflecting  an -achievement rate of 40%, below which the achievement rate is deemed null.\n\nThe achievement rate of each target is defined on a straight-line basis between these limits.\n\nThe  financial  portion  is  capped  at  60%  of  the  maximum  annual variable  remuneration,  with  the  latter  corresponding  to  135%  of annual fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and 115% for the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.\n\n## Achievement of financial targets in 2021\n\nThe  financial  results  for  2021  are  the  highest  in  the  Group's  history. They far exceed the 2021 budget, established towards the end of the pandemic  crisis,  while  also  out-performing  the  results  for  2019 and/uni00A02020.\n\nAccordingly, the underlying cost-to-income ratio recorded in 2021 was 5.8%  lower  than  the  budgeted  amount  (580/uni00A0bp),  the  Group's underlying ROTE was more than two times higher than the budgeted amount,  and  the  phased-in  Core  Equity  Tier/uni00A01  ratio  of  13.7%  at year-end  was  much  higher  than  the  budget  forecast  (a  difference  of more than 100/uni00A0bp).\n\nAgainst a backdrop of strong economic rebound and buoyant market performance,  these  exceptional  results  are  due  to  the  perfect execution  of  strategic  decisions  made  in  2020,  very  stringent  cost discipline, and a very low cost of risk reflecting the quality of the credit portfolio and the continuation of a very cautious provisioning policy. They  are  driven  mainly  by  the  Group's  business,  and  especially  by market activities and fleet management activities.\n\nMore specifically, budget targets have been significantly exceeded for RBDF, financial services and GBIS, leading to amaximum achievement rate of 100% financial targets. For the international retail networks, the level of achievement is slightly below budget in terms of GOI, leading to  an  achievement  rate  of  76%  and  in  line  with  the  budget  for  the cost/income ratio, leading to an achievement rate of 80%. The RONE of financial services is significantly above budget, leading to a maximum achievement rate of 100%. These results are summarised in the table on page/uni00A0110.\n\n## Non-financial portion\n\nAt  its  meeting  on  9/uni00A0February  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors  set  the non-financial targets for 2021.\n\nOf  the  targets  set,  55%  are  shared  between  all  three  Chief  Executive Officers,  with  the  remaining  45%  being  specific  to  their  individual remits.\n\nThese  targets  are  assessed  on  the  basis  of  certain  key  questions defined  in  advance  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  backed  by  figures where possible. The achievement rate can be anywhere between 0 and 100%  of  the  maximum  non-financial  portion.  The  respective weightings  for  each  target  are  likewise  defined  in  advance.  The non-financial  portion  is  capped  at  40%  of  the  maximum  annual variable  remuneration,  the  latter  corresponding  to  135%  of  annual fixed  remuneration  for  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  115%  for  the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.\n\n## Achievement of non-financial targets in 2021\n\nHaving  received  the  Compensation  Committee's  recommendations, the Board of Directors took into account the following achievements when assessing the non-financial targets.\n\n- The  Board's  assessment  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officers' p collective targets\n\nThe weightings applicable to each of the collective targets were as follows:\n\n| Collective Targets                            | 55%   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Markets' perception                           | 15%   |\n| Customer centricity                           | 10%   |\n| CSR                                           | 10%   |\n| Digital technology and operational efficiency | 10%   |\n| Regulatory                                    | 10%   |\n\n## Markets' perception - 15%\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  considered  that  the markets'  perception  of the Societe Generale Group had greatly improved. This performance was assessed using the following quantifiable factors:\n\n- the  relative  performance  of  the  Societe  Generale  share,  which p showed the strongest growth of the Euro Stoxx Banks index in 2021 (+77.4% in 2021 versus 36% for the Euro Stoxx Banks index);\n- the improved ratio of stock market price to net tangible asset value p per  share,  which  recorded  a  31.1%  increase  at  31/uni00A0December  2020 and a 49.5% increase at 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\nStrategic presentations to the market on International Retail Banking, GBIS, French Retail Banking and ALD were well received by investors.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Customer centricity - 10%\n\nThe Board of Directors observed the continued progress in terms of customer experience , as reflected in the improved Net Promoter Score and in customer satisfaction surveys. The NPS showed positive results overall in 2021, with an increase in 12 of the 25 observable scorers and more than half of the scores above the average market NPS.\n\nOverall, the Societe Generale and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord networks successfully maintained  their  customer  satisfaction  level  against  a  backdrop  of profound  change  and  network  mergers.  With  respect  to  individual customers, the Board of Directors noted leadership positions in terms of  NPS  (first  or  second  in  their  respective  markets)  for  Boursorama, SG/uni00A0Morocco, SG C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, BRD, SG Cameroon and SG Senegal.\n\nThe  Board  also  noted  the  year-on-year  improvement  in  Private Banking customer satisfaction.\n\n## CSR - 10%\n\nIn  terms  of Corporate  Social  Responsibility  (CSR) ,  the  Board  of Directors  noted  that  the  Group improved  all  its  extra-financial ratings and was ranked among the top banks under assessment. This year, the Group's ranking was as follows:\n\n- in the first decile of S&P Global CSA (formerly RobecoSAM), up from p the 90 th /uni00A0percentile to the 93 rd /uni00A0percentile;\n- in  the  14 th /uni00A0percentile  of  the  408  panel  banks,  improving  its  score p from 25.9 to 22.4 (score from 0 to 100, with 0 being the highest score) for Sustainalytics;\n- in the top 3% of banks with an improvement from AA to AAA for/uni00A0MSCI. p\n\nRegarding compliance  with  CO2  reduction  commitments , the alignment targets have been set to longer time horizons. There was no target for 2021 as this is a longer-term process. Societe Generale joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance initiative in April/uni00A02021 and has undertaken to  set  alignment  targets  within  36/uni00A0months  of  joining.  Accordingly, alignment  targets  to  reach  carbon  neutrality  by  2050  were  defined, sector by sector, starting with the most carbon-intensive sectors.\n\nRegarding  the Group's  own  CO2  emissions  target ,  namely  a  50% reduction  by  2030,  the  Board  of  Directors  noted  that  the  Group  was ahead  of  schedule,  pointing  to  the  efforts  made  and  the  positive impact of the health situation in this respect.\n\nFrom  a  more  qualitative  perspective,  the  Board  of  Directors' assessment considered the systematic integration of CSR aspects in the  strategic  business  presentations made  to  it.  This  year,  they concerned  International  Retail  Banking,  GBIS,  SGSS,  French  Retail Banking and ALD, in particular.\n\nThe overall trends shown in the 2021 Employee Satisfaction Survey were  also  very  positive,  with  progress  made  across  all  key  aspects. More  specifically,  the  engagement  index  rose  by  nearly  3/uni00A0points  in 2021.  The  rebound  was  particularly  strong  among  the  Group's  4,000 main managers, with an increase of 12/uni00A0points compared with 2020.\n\n## Digital technology and operational efficiency - 10%\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  noted  a  strong  improvement  in  the  Group's digital footprint .\n\nAll the Business Units launched projects to assess the financial impact of digital technology on their strategy. All the retail entities in France and Europe achieved their targets in respect of customers' adoption of digital  channels.  BDDF,  KB,  BRD,  Rosbank  and  SGMA  are  either  very close to or have met their digital sales targets.\n\nValue management  in  digital investments has been greatly strengthened, in particular for retail entities and specialised services, which  have  begun  to  produce  financial  measures  of  the  impact  of digital technology: Digital NBI, costs of online/offline services.\n\nSeveral  key  milestones  in  the  IT  programme  were  achieved  in  2021 (accelerating the data roadmap, developing and approving the Go to Cloud  strategy,/uni00A0etc.).  The  organisation  of  digital  capabilities  was streamlined by merging the GBIS teams with the Corporate Divisions.\n\n## Regulatory - 10%\n\nLegal  proceedings  instigated  by  the  US  Department  of  Justice  in connection  with  the  deferred  prosecution  agreements  (market regulations, anti-corruption, sanctions and embargoes) were brought to an end without further timetable extensions, reflecting the quality of  the  Bank's  work.  All  the  remedial  measures  scheduled  for  2021  in respect of the deferred prosecution agreements were undertaken.\n\nThe Group's KYC remediation programme, which covered 17.4/uni00A0million customers, was largely completed in a timely manner by 31/uni00A0March/uni00A02021.\n\nAll  the  recommendations  set  out  in  the  remediation  programme developed by the Internal Control Department were carried out. The checks  were  implemented  in  line  with  the  targets  and  all  the dashboards are being developed.\n\n## The Board's assessment of the targets for each Chief Executive p Officer's specific remit\n\nThe  individual  extra-financial  targets  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officers were as follows:\n\n| Individual extra-financial targets                            | 45%   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| CEO /square6                                                  |       |\n| Strategy - Equity Story 21-25                                 | 10%   |\n| GBIS                                                          | 20%   |\n| Management/HR                                                 | 15%   |\n| Deputy CEO/uni00A0 RISQ, CPLE, ASSU, SGEF, ALD /square6       |       |\n| ALD                                                           | 10%   |\n| ASSU                                                          | 10%   |\n| Control functions                                             | 25%   |\n| Deputy CEO BOURSO, AFMO, EURO, RUSS, CDN, BDDF, ITIM /square6 |       |\n| French Retail Banking                                         | 15%   |\n| International Retail Banking and Consumer Finance             | 20%   |\n| Resource-pooling/Synergies                                    | 10%   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

A  number  of  key  strategic milestones  were  achieved,  communicated  and  well  received  by investors in the course of 2021, such as the Vision 2025/uni00A0projects (aimed at  the  merger  between  the  Societe  Generale  and  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord networks),  plans  for  ALD  to  acquire  LeasePlan  (thereby  creating  a leader in the mobility sector and a third pillar to rebalance the Group's business  model),  and  the  Global  Banking  and  Investor  Solutions medium-term strategic plan.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  considered  that  the  target  of finalising  the strategic  trajectory  for  the  GBIS  businesses had  been  largely achieved. The GBIS strategy and financial trajectory approved by the Board of Directors on 11/uni00A0March 2021 and disclosed on 10/uni00A0May 2021 was well received by the market.\n\nThe main projects set out in the GBIS strategy have been launched, in particular  the  Euclide  project  on  digitalisation  and  the  wholesale customer experience, as well as CSR development.\n\nGlobal  market  activities  were  successfully  transformed:  all  targets were  achieved  in  2021,  notably  in  terms  of  risk  reduction,  while maintaining  strong  revenue.  Excluding  the  sum  allocated  to  variable remuneration, GBIS' directs costs were down.\n\nIn  terms  of Human Resources management ,  the  Board  of  Directors observed that the process of renewing the General Management team was  conducted  smoothly,  thanks  to  prior  work  on  succession  plans, and noted its successful implementation.\n\nRegarding diversity in  management bodies, the appointments made in key Group positions in 2021 showed significant progress, placing the Group  slightly  ahead  of  its  trajectory  regarding  the  proportion  of women and international profiles in these positions:\n\n- from 21% to 25% for women; p\n- from 20% to 26% for non-French/international profiles. p\n\nThe proportion of international profiles in the Strategy Committee was also  up  slightly,  from  17%  to  19%.  Women's  representation  on  the Strategy  Committee  was  virtually  stable  (from  24%  to  23%)  and remains an area for improvement for the Group. The diversity achieved in  the  General Management team, of which 33% are women, bears a special mention.\n\n## Regarding the Deputy Chief Executive Officer p (RISQ, CPLE, ASSU, SGEF, ALD)\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  considered  that the  ALD  strategy was successfully  implemented and contributed to developing intra-group synergies, in particular with the retail banking, consumer finance and insurance  networks.  Several  external  acquisitions  and  investments were  finalised  in  2021.  The  Move  2025/uni00A0strategic  plan  was  continued with several key advances across all major components of the plan.\n\nThe roll-out of the bancassurance model in France showed positive momentum in 2021, in synergy with the retail banking business lines: customer  product  and  service  uptake  in  the  networks  continued  to increase, mainly due to digital sales growth. The life insurance savings business was very buoyant in 2021. In France specifically, gross inflows rose by nearly 50% in a market that recorded 32% growth. In terms of net  inflows,  ASSU's  market  share  was  12.5%,  far  exceeding  Societe Generale's  natural  market  share  of  around  7%.  ASSU's  outstandings also have an excellent structure: with UL funds standing at 35%, ASSU is outperforming the market average of 27%.\n\nLast,  the  Board  of  Directors  considered  that  the  Group  had  met  its control  functions target.  Progress  in  the  Group's  major  strategic initiatives and remediation plans met targets. In the area of developing data  usage  tools  and  initiatives  surrounding  the  use  of  data  and artificial intelligence, the Nextgen project (compliance) was launched in  2021.  The  Data  Visa  programme  came  to  an  end.  The  programme helped to legally secure the transfer of data from legal entities to SGSA for  all  the  Group's  central  administrative  uses,  which  will  save considerable time for future projects of this type.\n\nIn 2021, the RISQ and CPLE Divisions were restructured to better clarify roles  and  responsibilities,  strengthen  the  pooling  of  expertise  and improve oversight.\n\n## Regarding the Deputy Chief Executive Officer p (BOURSO, AFMO, EURO, RUSS, CDN, BDDF, ITIM)\n\nThe Board of Directors noted that the deployment of the French Retail Banking  strategy has  continued  successfully.  Plans  to  merge  the Societe Generale (BDDF) and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord networks were launched in  January/uni00A02021  with  12/uni00A0projects  led  by  a  two-person  BDDF/Cr\u00e9dit  du Nord team. The project roadmap has been defined for 2021, 2022 and 2023.  The  milestones  planned  for  2021  have  been  achieved  (target organisation,  submission  of  the  ACPR  regulator  file,  launch  of  social dialogue  and  submission  of  the  file  on  the  new  bank's  target  model and organisation).\n\nBoursorama not only met the targets under its development plan, but exceeded some of the indicators, in particular the number of clients. Financial performance is in line with the targets. The start of exclusive discussions with ING for the transfer of individual customers is also an important step in boosting Boursorama's development in France.\n\nIn terms of bancassurance, nearly all of the measures provided for in the 2021 action plan were implemented (product offers, training and coordination of networks, deployment of digital tools).\n\n- In Europe ,  the  strategic  plans  of  Rosbank,  KB  and  BRD  were defined and presented.\n\nThe digital footprint has expanded across all international retail banks, in particular Rosbank.\n\nSeveral initiatives were launched in the Retail Banking core business and Group-wide to strengthen synergies and resource-pooling with the Bank-as-a-service project and many initiatives with ASSU and ALD.\n\n|",

A  six-month  holding  period  applies  after  each  definitive vesting date.\n\nThe  amount  of  variable  remuneration  granted  in  shares  or  share equivalents is converted based on a share price determined each year by  the  Board  of  Directors  in  March  and  corresponding  to  the trade-weighted average over the last twenty trading days prior to the Board Meeting.\n\nFurthermore,  if  the  Board  deems  that  a  decision  taken  by  the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officers has particularly  significant  consequences  for  the  Company's  results  or image, it may decide not only to reconsider payment of the deferred\n\nannual variable remuneration in full or in part (malus clause), but also to recover, for each award, all or part of the sums already distributed over a five-year period (clawback clause).\n\nVesting of the deferred annual variable remuneration is also subject to a  condition  of  presence  throughout  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's current  term  of  office.  The  only  exceptions  to  this  condition  are  as follows: retirement, death, disability, incapacity to carry out duties or removal  from  office  due  to  a  strategic  divergence  with  the  Board of/uni00A0Directors.\n\nOnce the Chief Executive Officer's current term of office comes to an end,  this  condition  of  presence  no  longer  applies.  However,  if  the Board concludes that a decision a Chief Executive Officer took during their  term  of  office  has  had  particularly  significant  consequences  for the  Company's  results  or  image,  it  may  decide  to  apply  either  the malus or the clawback clause.\n\nThe  portion  of  annual  variable  remuneration  granted  as  share equivalents entitles the beneficiary to payment of a sum equivalent to any dividend payments made over the compulsory holding period. No dividends are paid during the vesting period.\n\nAny  remuneration  received  by  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officers  in respect  of  their  duties  as  Directors  within  Group  companies  is deducted from their variable remuneration. The Chief Executive Officer does not receive any remuneration for Directorships.\n\n## ANNUAL VARIABLE REMUNERATION - DEFERRED PORTION PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS\n\n| Cumulative terms            | Proportion of the unvested award   | Trigger level/Cap 100% achievement rate                                  |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Group profitability         | 100%                               | Group profitability for the year preceding vesting >/uni00A00            |\n| Equity levels (CET 1 ratio) | 100%                               | CET1 ratio for the year preceding vesting >/uni00A0minimum threshold set |\n\n## R!!(Rglyph<c=31,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> )R%glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>RSglyph<c=31,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>V %V (!V%R'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"! #Rglyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>U glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>!

The purpose of the plan is to involve the Chief Executive Officers in the Company's long-term progress and align their interests with those of the shareholders.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  long-term  incentives  awarded  (as  valued  under IFRS) is capped  at  the  same  level  as  their  annual  variable remuneration.  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Oud\u00e9a's  long-term  incentives  are  therefore capped at 135% of his annual fixed remuneration. For the Deputy Chief Executive Officers, the cap is 115% of their annual fixed remuneration.\n\nIn compliance with current regulations, the total variable component ( i.e. annual variable remuneration plus long-term incentives) is in any event capped at 200% of the fixed component (1) .\n\nOn this basis, and in line with previous years, the Board of Directors decided, at its meeting of 9/uni00A0February 2022 (subject to the approval of the General Meeting on 17/uni00A0May 2022, in accordance with Article/uni00A0L./uni00A022-10-34  (II)  of  the  French  Commercial  Code),  to  implement an incentives plan for financial year 2021 as follows:\n\n- award value unchanged over time (under IFRS). The corresponding p number  of  shares  was  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  Societe Generale share's book value at 8/uni00A0February 2022;\n- shares granted in two instalments, with vesting periods of four and p six years, followed by a one-year holding period, thus increasing the total indexing periods to five and seven years;\n- definitive vesting subject to a condition of presence throughout the p vesting periods, as well as performance conditions.\n\nAccordingly, the vesting of the long-term incentives will depend on:\n\n- for  80%  of  the  LTI  award,  the  relative  performance  of  the  Societe p Generale  share,  as  measured  by  the  increase  in  total  shareholder return (TSR) compared with that for 11 comparable European banks over the full vesting periods. Consequently, the full number of shares or share equivalents will only vest if Societe Generale's TSR falls in the  first  quartile  of  the  sample  panel.  If  it  falls  slightly  above  the median value, the vesting rate  will  be  50%  of  the  total  number  of shares or share equivalents granted. No shares or share equivalents will  vest  if  the  TSR  performance  is  below  the  median  value  (the complete vesting chart is shown below);\n- for 20% of the LTI award, the Group's relative CSR performance. Half p (10%)  is  conditional  on  the  Group's  compliance  with  its  energy transition  financing  commitments  and  the  other  half  (10%)  on  its positioning  within  the  main  extra-financial  ratings  (S&P  Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, Sustainalytics and MSCI).\n\nIn  terms  of  the  energy  transition  financing  criterion  in  respect  of  the financed  energy  mix,  the  target  under  the  LTI  plan  for  2021  will  be related  to  the  Group's  commitment  to  raising  EUR/uni00A0250/uni00A0billion  for  the energy  and  environmental  transition  between  1/uni00A0January  2021  and 31/uni00A0December 2025 either through:\n\n- sustainable bond issues; or p\n- transactions  in  the  renewable  energies  sector,  whether  through p advisory or financing.\n\nThe  vesting  rate  will  be  100%  if  this  target  is  met.  If  at  least EUR/uni00A0200/uni00A0billion is  reached,  the  vesting  rate  will  be  75%.  Below EUR/uni00A0200/uni00A0billion, the vesting rate will be zero.\n\nAs for the portion based on external extra-financial ratings, the vesting rate will be as follows:\n\n- 100% vesting if all three target ratings are achieved over a three-year p period  as  from  the  year  of  the  award  ( i.e. the  rankings/ratings  for 2023, 2024 and 2025);\n- two-thirds  vesting  if  on  average  at  least  two  target  ratings  are p achieved over a three-year period as from the year of the award.\n\nThe criterion is examined if the ratings performances required by the following three extra-financial rating agencies are met:\n\n- S&P Global CSA: positioning in the first quartile; p\n- Sustainalytics: positioning in the first quartile; p\n- MSCI: rating \u2265 BBB. p\n\nFor ratings that are adjusted over the year, the rating applied will be that  allocated  at  the  annual  review.  Changes  may  be  made  to  the panel of ratings considered if justified in light of developments in the extra-financial ratings sector.\n\nIf  the  Group  is  not  profitable  in  the  year  preceding  the  definitive vesting of long-term incentives, no payment will be made, regardless of  the  Societe  Generale  share  performance  and  the  Group's  CSR performance.\n\n|",

The  payment  plan  will  be  cancelled  in  the  event  of early departure from the Group, except for retirement, departure of a Chief Executive Officer from the Group related to the change of control or  for  reasons  related  to  the  change  in  Group  structure  or  its organisation, and in the event of death, disability or incapacity:\n\n- in  the  event  of  death,  disability  or  incapacity,  the  shares  will  be p retained and full payments made;\n- if  a  beneficiary  retires  or  leaves  due  to  a  change  of  control,  the p shares  will  be  retained  and  full  payments  made  subject  to  the Board's assessment and findings on performance;\n- if  a  beneficiary  leaves  the  Group due to changes in its structure or p organisation, payments will be made on a pro rata basis according to  the  time  spent  in  office  compared  to  the  overall  vesting  period and after the Board's assessment and findings on performance.\n\nLastly,  a  'malus'  clause  also  applies  to  the  beneficiaries'  long-term incentives. Accordingly, if the Board finds conduct or actions that fall short of Societe Generale's expectations, in particular as defined in the Group's  Code  of  Conduct,  or  finds  risk-taking  which  exceeds  a  level deemed  acceptable  by  Societe  Generale,  it  may  decide  to  withhold payment of the long-term incentives in full or in part.\n\nIn compliance with current regulations, the total variable component ( i.e. annual variable remuneration plus long-term incentives) is capped at the regulatory limit of 200% of the fixed component (1) .\n\nInsofar  as  the  ratio  between  the  total  variable  component  and  the fixed remuneration for 2021 exceeds the regulatory ratio for the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officers, the Board of Directors on 9/uni00A0February 2022 capped the variable component at 200% of the fixed remuneration by reducing the number of shares awarded under the long-term incentive plan in order to comply with this ratio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

recommendations  and  in  order  to  align  the interests of the Chief Executive Officers with those of the Company, the Chief  Executive  Officers  have  since  2002  been  required  to  hold  a minimum number of Societe Generale shares. Accordingly, at its meeting of 13/uni00A0March 2019, the Board of Directors set the following requirements:\n\n- the Chief Executive Officer must hold 120,000/uni00A0shares; p\n- Deputy Chief Executive Officers Philippe Aymerich and Diony Lebot p must each hold 45,000/uni00A0shares.\n\nChief  Executive  Officers  who  were  previously  employees  may  hold shares either directly or indirectly through the Company savings plan.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Oud\u00e9a already holds sufficient shares. Philippe Aymerich and Diony Lebot must acquire the requisite number of shares by the end of their four-year term of office ( i.e. in 2023). Until they hold the requisite number  of  shares,  Chief  Executive  Officers  must  retain  50%  of  the vested shares awarded under Societe Generale share plans, as well as all shares resulting from the exercise of stock options, after deducting the  cost  of  exercising  said  options  and  the  corresponding  social security charges and taxes.\n\nThe  Board  will  review  the  minimum  holding  requirement  when  the Chief Executive Officers are proposed for re-election.\n\nIn  addition,  and  in  accordance  with  the  law,  the  Chief  Executive Officers are required to hold a certain percentage of the vested shares awarded  under  Societe  Generale  share  plans  or  resulting  from  the exercise of stock options in a registered account until the end of their term  of  office.  For  shares  awarded  under  share  plans,  the  Board  of Directors at its meeting of 15/uni00A0March 2017 set this percentage at 5% of vested shares from the award in respect of 2017. This percentage was fixed in view of the regulatory requirement for a significant proportion of variable remuneration to be granted in the form of shares and the minimum holding requirements. For shares resulting from the exercise of  stock  options,  the  Board  set  the  percentage  at  40%  of  the  capital gains  realised  on  exercising  the  options,  net  of  tax  and  any  other compulsory deductions and less any capital gains used to finance the acquisition of the shares.\n\nChief  Executive  Officers  are  therefore  required  to  hold  a  significant number of  shares.  They  are  prohibited  from  hedging  their  shares  or options throughout the vesting and holding periods.\n\nEach  year,  the  Chief  Executive  Officers  must  provide  the  Board  of Directors  with  all  information  enabling  it  to  verify  their  compliance with these obligations.\n\nIn their statements to the Board, the Chief Executive Officers declared that  they  have  not  hedged  their  Societe  Generale  shares  or  Societe Generale Actionnariat (Fonds/uni00A0E) shares, and undertook not to do so in the future.\n\n|",

The  Group  is  now  organised  into  25  Business  and Service Units. A Management Committee was set up, comprising some sixty  senior  managers  appointed  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer, including  the  24/uni00A0managers  of  the  Business  Units  (core  businesses, regions) and Service Units (support and audit functions). The Heads of the  Business  Units  and  Service  Units  are  part  of  the  Group  Strategy Committee which, under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer, ensures the implementation of the Group's strategy.\n\nRemuneration  for  the  Management  Committee's  members  complies with CRDV. It is set by General Management and breaks down into two components:\n\n- fixed  remuneration,  which  is  set  according  to  each  member's p responsibilities, observes market practices;\n- annual  variable  remuneration,  subject  to  meeting  predefined p collective and individual targets. The collective targets apply to all members  of  the  Management  Committee  and  represent  a substantial portion of their total annual variable remuneration. They reflect  the  Group's  collective  performance  and  are  defined  in  line with the targets set for the Chief Executive Officers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

This information is indicated with the note ' Audited I ' (the symbol \u25b2 indicates the end of the audited part).\n\nThe Societe Generale Group is subject to oversight by supervisory authorities and to regulations on capital requirements applicable to credit institutions and investment firms (Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0575/2013 of 26/uni00A0June 2013).\n\nAs  part  of  the  Third  Pillar  of  the  Basel  Accord,  a  detailed  and  standardized  statement  is  included  in  the  'Risk  Report  for  the  purposes  of improving published financial disclosures' (Pillar/uni00A03 Report and cross-reference table).\n\nAll  information  regarding  the  Pillar/uni00A03  Report  and  the  prudential  disclosures  is  available  on  the www.societegenerale.com website,  under 'Investors', Universal Registration Document and Pillar/uni00A03.\n\n## TYPES OF RISKS\n\nThe  Group's  risk  management  framework  involves  the  following main categories:\n\n- credit risk: risk of losses arising from the inability of the Group's p customers, issuers or other counterparties to meet their financial commitments.  This  risk  includes  the  risk  linked  to  market transactions  and  securitisation  activities  and  may  be  further amplified by individual, country and sector concentration risk;\n- counterparty credit risk: Credit risk of a counterparty on a market p transaction, combined with the risk of changes in exposure;\n- market  risk: risk  of  a  loss  of  value  on  financial  instruments p arising from changes in market parameters, the volatility of these parameters  and  correlations  between  them.  These  parameters include, but are not limited to, exchange rates, interest rates, the price of securities (equity, bonds), commodities, derivatives and other assets;\n- operational  risk: risk  of  losses  resulting  from  inadequacies  or p failures in processes, personnel or information systems, or from external events. It includes:\n- non-compliance risk: risk of court-ordered, administrative or -disciplinary  sanctions,  financial  loss  or  reputational  damage due  to failure to comply  with  legal and  regulatory requirements or professional/ethical standards and practices applicable to banking,\n- reputational risk: risk arising from a negative perception on -the part of customers, counterparties, shareholders, investors or regulators that could negatively impact the Group's ability to maintain or engage in business relationships and to sustain access to sources of financing,\n- misconduct risk: risk resulting from actions (or inactions) or -behavior of  the  Bank  or  its  employees  inconsistent  with  the Group's  Code  of  Conduct,  which  may  lead  to  adverse consequences  for  our  stakeholders,  or  place  the  Bank's sustainability or reputation at risk,\n- IT  and  Information  Systems  Security  risk (cybercrime,  IT -systems failures,/uni00A0etc.);\n- structural risk: risk of losses in interest margin or banking book p value if interest rates, exchange rates, or credit spreads change. This  risk  is  related  to  the  Bank's  commercial  and  proprietary activities,  it  includes  the  distortion  of  the  structural  difference between assets and liabilities related to pension obligations, as well as the risk related to longer terms of future payments;\n- liquidity  and  funding  risk: liquidity  risk  is  defined  as  the p inability  of  the  Group  to  meet  its  financial  obligations:  debt repayments, collateral supply,/uni00A0etc. Funding risk is defined as the risk that the Group will not be able to finance its business growth on a scale consistent with its commercial objectives and at a cost that is competitive compared to its competitors;\n- model  risk: Risk  of  losses  due  to  decisions  reached  based  on p results  of  internal  modeling  due  to  errors  in  development, implementation or use of these models;\n- risk  related  to  insurance  activities: through  its  insurance p subsidiaries, the Group is also exposed to a variety of risks linked to this business. In addition to balance sheet management risks (interest  rate,  valuation,  counterparty  and  exchange  rate  risk), these risks  include  premium pricing risk, mortality risk and the risk of an increase in claims;\n- strategic/business risk: risks  resulting  from  the  Group's  inability p to  execute  its  strategy  and  to  implement  its  business  plan  for reasons that are not attributable to the other risks in this list; for instance, the non-occurrence of the macroeconomic scenarios that were used to construct the business plan or sales performance that was below expectations;\n- private equity risk: risk  of  reduction in the value of our equity p ownership interests;\n- residual value risk: through its  specialized financing activities, p mainly  in  its  long-term  vehicle  leasing  subsidiary,  the  Group  is exposed to residual value risk (where the net resale value of an asset at the end of the leasing contract is less than expected);\n- settlement/delivery risk: risk arising on market transactions in p the case of transactions (commodities spot, OTC securities spot, Forex spot, OTC derivatives, Securities Financing Transactions,/uni00A0etc.) whose payment type is FoP (Free of Payment), inducing an asynchronous settlement/delivery of the flows to be paid and received.\n\nIn  addition, risks associated with climate change ,  both  physical (increase  in  the  frequency  of  extreme  climatic  events)  and transition-related (New Carbon Regulation), have been identified as factors that could aggravate the Group's existing risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The risk  exposure  or  measurement  figures  included  in  the  risk  factors provide  information  on  the  Group's  exposure  level  but  are  not necessarily representative of any future evolution of these risks.\n\n- market and structural risks; p\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO THE MACROECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL, 4.1.1 MARKET AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS\n\n4.1.1.1  The  global  economic  and  financial  context,  geopolitical tensions,  as  well  as  the  market  environment  in  which  the  Group operates, may adversely affect its activities, financial position and results of operations.\n\nAs  a  global  financial  institution,  the  Group's  activities  are  sensitive  to changes  in  financial  markets  and  economic  conditions  generally  in Europe, the United States and elsewhere around the world. The Group generates 49% of its business in France (in terms of net banking income for the financial year ended 31 December 2021), 32% in Europe, 7% in the Americas and 12% in the rest of the world. The Group could face significant deteriorations in market and economic conditions resulting from,  in  particular,  crises  affecting  capital  or  credit  markets,  liquidity constraints,  regional  or  global  recessions,  sharp  fluctuations  in commodity  prices  (notably  oil),  currency  exchange  rates  or  interest rates,  inflation  or  deflation,  rating  downgrades,  restructuring  or defaults  of  sovereign  or  private  debt,  or  adverse  geopolitical  events (including acts of terrorism and military conflicts). Such events, which can  develop  quickly  and  thus  may  not  have  been  anticipated  and hedged,  could  affect  the  Group's  operating  environment  for  short  or extended  periods  and  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  its  financial position, cost of risk and results of operations.\n\nThe  economic  environment  remains  very  uncertain  despite  the  good performance  of  industry  and  world  trade.  Although  initially  rapid,  the economic  recovery  was  severely  disrupted  in  2021  by  the  effect  of, firstly, production delays due to occasional factory closures, absenteeism  due  to  illness,  and  shortages  of  labor,  components (especially  electronic  components)  and  electricity  in  certain  regions, and secondly, delays in transport deliveries due to, among other things, congestion in ports. In addition, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict starting in  the  beginning  of  2022  has  generated  historically  high  tensions  with Western countries, with significant potential impacts on global growth and energy prices and a humanitarian impact. These disruptions could persist  in  2022  and  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  activity  and profitability of certain Group counterparties in 2022.\n\nDisruptions in global supply chains, accompanied by tensions in the labour  market,  and  rising  energy  prices  are  also  leading  to  higher inflation,  particularly  in  the  United  States,  where  a  massive  fiscal stimulus package has provided a strong boost to demand. Europe and emerging countries are also facing inflationary pressures. The longer the pandemic lasts, the more persistent these disruptions will be, with\n\na potentially lasting impact on inflation, consumer purchasing power and ultimately on economic activity. The Russian-Ukrainian conflict is likely to accentuate some of these disruptions, particularly in Europe where, for example, natural gas prices have risen sharply and remain highly volatile.\n\nThe  economic  and  financial  environment  remains  exposed  to intensifying  geopolitical  risks.  Tensions  between  Russia  and  Western countries  over  the  situation  in  Ukraine  have  increased  significantly since  mid-February  2022.  The  exceptional  economic  and  financial sanctions put in place by a large number of countries, particularly in Europe  and  the  United  States,  against  Russia  and  Belarus  could significantly  affect  operators  with  links  to  Russia,  with  a  material impact  on  the  Group's  risks  (credit  and  counterparty,  market, reputation,  compliance,  legal,  operational,  etc.  ).  Based  on  the sanctions published on 27 February 2022, the Group's local exposure to  corporate  and  financial  institution  counterparties  subject  to sanctions is low at EUR 0.2 billion and counterparties under sanctions account for approximately EUR 0.7 billion of the Group's net off-shore exposure. Any new international sanction or Russian countermeasure could have an impact on the global economy and consequently on the Group's  risks.  The  Group  will  continue  to  analyse  in  real  time  the developments  in  the  global  impact  of  this  crisis  and,  together,  will enforce the necessary measures to comply with legislation in force and protect the Group's franchise.\n\nUncertainty about the consequences of the situation in Ukraine makes it difficult to predict the impact on the global economy and the Group. Several  scenarios  remain  conceivable  for  the  Group.  The  estimated impact on the property rights on its banking assets in Russia would be of  approximately  -50  basis  points  of  CET1  capital  ratio  based  on Rosbank's  net  book  assets  equivalent  to  EUR  2.1  billion  at  31 December 2021, with EUR 0.5 billion of subordinated debt and taking into account the cancellation of the associated weighted assets.\n\nThis crisis could also exacerbate the already visible increase in prices and  availability  of  hydrocarbons,  as  well  as  the  price  of  certain foodstuffs  and  metals.  It  could  also  generate  strong  volatility  on  the financial markets and a significant drop in the price of certain financial assets.  In  addition,  the  Russian  government  and  certain  Russian financial institutions could experience  payment  defaults,  with consequences that are difficult to anticipate for the Group.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "As of 31 December 2021, EAD exposures on Russia represented 1.7% of the  Group's  exposure  to  credit  and  counterparty  risks,  i.e.  EUR  18.6 billion (of which EUR 15.4 billion on its subsidiary Rosbank) and EUR 3.2 billion of off-shore exposures, mainly consisting of transactions set up as part of the financing activities of the Corporate and Investment Banking  division).  In  2021,  activities  located  in  Russia  represented 2.8% of the Group's net banking income and 2.7% of its net income. In addition, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has a minor exposure in Ukraine (less than EUR  80  million  at  31  December  2021),  mainly  through  its  subsidiary ALD. See also section 2.10 \" Post-closing events \" of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\nFurthermore,  the  U.S.-China  confrontation  brings  with  it  trade tensions  and  the  risk  of  a  technological  fragmentation.  In  Africa,  a series of political coups in the Sahel region has heightened awareness of the fragility of the institutional frameworks of countries exposed to terrorism.\n\nContinued high geopolitical risks are an additional source of instability that could also weigh on economic activity and credit demand, while increasing volatility in financial markets. In the context of Brexit, the topic of non-equivalence of clearing houses (central counterparties, or CCPs) remains a point of vigilance, with possible impacts on financial stability, notably in Europe, and therefore on the Group's business.\n\nOver  the  last  decade,  the  financial  markets  have  thus  experienced significant  disruptions  resulting  notably  from  concerns  over  the evolution  of  central  bank  interest  rate  policies,  the  trajectory  of  the sovereign debt of several Eurozone countries, Brexit, the persistence of commercial and political  tensions  (namely  between  the  United  States and China) or fears of a major slowdown of growth in China, fostered again  recently  by  the  financial  difficulties  of  Chinese  real  estate development  companies,  the  disruption  of  value  and  supply  chains caused by the Covid-19 crisis or more recently by the tensions linked to the crisis in Ukraine. Given the magnitude of external financing needs, several  emerging  countries  would  face  increasing  difficulties  if  U.S. interest rates were to rise, and their financial conditions were to tighten.\n\nThe long period of low interest rates in the Eurozone and the United States, driven by accommodating monetary policies, has affected the Group's net interest margin for several years. Growth in the volume of loans  made  to  non-financial  companies,  already  high  before  the pandemic, significantly increased in 2020 with the implementation of government-guaranteed loan programmes (such as the Pr\u00eats Garantis par l'Etat programme in France). In 2021, this growth slowed with the repayment of a part of the credit lines drawn in 2020. Should an overly fragile  economic  recovery  materialise,  it  may  provoke  a  rise  in  the volume  of  non-performing  loans  and  create  a  weak  investment dynamic  in  a  context  where  companies'  balance  sheets  are  already fragile.  The  environment  of  low  interest  rates  tends  to  lead  to  an increased  risk  appetite  of  some  participants  in  the  banking  and financial  system,  lower  risk  premiums  compared  to  their  historical average  and  high  valuation  levels  of  certain  assets.  These  market conditions could change rapidly in the event of a more rapid increase in key interest rates by the major central banks, which could cause a marked correction in asset prices.\n\nFurthermore, the environment of abundant liquidity that has been at the  origin  of  the  upturn  in  credit  growth  in  the  Eurozone  and particularly in France, amplified by the implementation of the French government-guaranteed loan programme, could lead in the future to additional regulatory measures by supervisory authorities in order to limit  the  extension  of  credit  or  to  further  protect  banks  against  a financial cycle downturn.\n\nThe  Group's  results  are  thus  significantly  exposed  to  economic, financial, political and geopolitical conditions in the principal markets in which it operates.\n\nFurthermore,  the  situation  related  to  the  Covid-19  crisis  is  a  further aggravating  factor  in  the  various  risks  faced  by  the  Group.  See  also section 4.1.1.2 ' The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic and its economic consequences could adversely affect the Group's business and financial performance '.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group's EAD to credit and counterparty risks were  concentrated  in  Europe  and  the  United  States  (together accounting for 90%), with a predominant exposure to France (46% of EAD). The other exposures concern Western Europe excluding France (accounting  for  21%),  North  America  (accounting  for  14%),  Eastern European  members  of  the  European  Union  (accounting  for  7%)  and Eastern Europe excluding the European Union (accounting for 2%).\n\nIn France, the Group's principal market, the good growth performance during  the  2016-2019  period  and  low  interest  rates  have  fostered  an upturn in the housing market. A reversal of activity in this area could have a material adverse effect on the Group's asset value and business, by  decreasing  demand  for  loans  and  resulting  in  higher  rates  of non-performing loans.\n\nThe Group also operates in emerging markets, such as Russia, or Africa and the Middle East (5% of the Group's credit exposure). A significant adverse  change  in  the  macroeconomic,  health,  political  or  financial environment in these markets could have a material adverse effect on the  Group's  business,  results  and  financial  position.  These  markets may  be  adversely  affected  by  uncertainty  factors  and  specific  risks, such as a new increase in oil and natural gas prices, which would weigh on the financial position of importing countries as well as their growth and  exchange  rates.  The  correction  of  macroeconomic  or  budgetary imbalances that would result could be imposed by the markets with an impact  on  growth  and  on  exchange  rates.  A  major  source  of uncertainty currently comes from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and its humanitarian, economic and financial consequences. In the longer term,  the  energy  transition  to  a  \"low-carbon  economy\"  could adversely  affect  fossil  energy  producers,  energy-intensive  sectors  of activity  and  the  countries  that  depend  on  them.  In  addition,  capital markets  (including  foreign  exchange  activity)  and  securities  trading activities  in  emerging  markets  may  be  more  volatile  than  those  in developed  markets  and  may  also  be  vulnerable  to  certain  specific risks,  such  as  political  instability  and  currency  volatility.  These elements could negatively  impact  the  Group's  activity  and  results  of operations.\n\n## 4.1.1.2  The  coronavirus  pandemic  (Covid-19)  and  its  economic consequences  could  adversely  affect  the  Group's  business  and financial performance.\n\nIn December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (Covid-19) emerged in China. The virus has since spread to numerous countries around the world,  with  a  high  concentration  of  cases  in  certain  countries  where the  Group  operates.  The  World  Health  Organization  declared  the outbreak  of  a  pandemic  in  March  2020.  The  Covid-19  pandemic  and the health measures taken in response to it (border closures, lockdown measures,  restrictions  on  certain  economic  activities,  etc.)  have  had and  may  continue  to  have  a  significant  impact,  both  direct  and indirect, on the global economic situation and financial markets.\n\nThe  deployment  of  vaccination  programmes  has  reduced  the  risk  of severe  illness  from  Covid-19  infections  among  the  vaccinated population and the need for strict lockdowns in the event of high virus circulation in countries where vaccines have been deployed on a large scale.  The  persistence  of  the  pandemic  and  the  emergence  of  new variants  (such  as  the  highly  transmissible  Omicron  variant)  have  led, and  may  again  lead,  to  new  targeted  restrictive  measures  or  an increase  in  absenteeism  and  work  stoppages,  exacerbating  the disruptions already present in global supply chains, and thus adversely affecting the Group's business, financial performance and results.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

New phases of lockdown measures or curfews in the countries where the Group operates could again impact the Group's financial results.\n\nIn many jurisdictions in which the Group operates, national governments and  central  banks  have  taken  or  announced  exceptional  measures  to support  the  economy  and  its  actors  (government-guaranteed  loan facilities  programmes,  tax  deferrals,  facilitated  recourses  to  part-time working, compensation, etc.) or to improve liquidity in financial markets (asset  purchases,  etc.).  While  these  support  measures  have  been effective  in  addressing  the  immediate  effects  of  the  crisis,  the mechanisms put in place may not be sufficient to sustain the recovery over the long term.\n\nThe various restrictive measures implemented since the beginning of the  pandemic  in  several  of  the  main  countries  where  the  Group operates (with Western Europe representing 67% of the Group's EAD (Exposure  at  Default)  at  31  December  2021,  of  which  46%  was  in France) have had a significant impact on economic activity. The risk of new  restrictive  measures  (especially  in  the  event  of  new  pandemic waves)  as  well  as  a  slower-than-expected  recovery  of  demand (particularly in certain economic sectors) could increase the economic difficulties resulting from the health crisis. This, combined with a high level of public and corporate indebtedness, may constitute a brake on economic growth and lead to significant adverse repercussions on the credit  quality  of  the  Group's  counterparties  (affected  in  particular  by the  gradual  cessation  of  government  support  measures  or  by difficulties in extending these measures) and the level of non-performing loans for both businesses and individuals.\n\n2020  was  characterised  by  a  significant  increase  in  the  cost  of  risk, mainly  due  to  the  provisioning  for  Stages  1  and  2  in  anticipation  of future defaults. In 2021, the net cost of risk was low in the absence of default,  while  the  Group  continued to maintain a provisioning policy for Stages 1 and 2 in the event that defaults begin to materialise. The Group's  cost  of  risk  could  be  affected  in  future  years  by  its participation in the French government-guaranteed loan programmes (in  respect  of  the  unguaranteed  residual  exposure)  on  which  the observed defaults remain to be quantified.\n\nWithin  the  Corporate  portfolio,  at  31  December  2021,  the  most impacted  sectors  were  the  automotive  sector  (0.9%  of  the  Group's total exposure), hotels, catering and leisure (0.6% of the Group's total exposure),  non-food  retail  distribution  (the  entirety  of  the  retail distribution sector represents 1.6% of the Group's total exposure) and air transport (less than 0.5% of the Group's total exposure).\n\nThe  Group's  results  and  financial  position  were  affected  by unfavourable  developments  in  global  financial  markets  due  to  the Covid-19 crisis,  especially  in  March  and  April  2020  (extreme  volatility and dislocation of term structure, alternate sharp declines and rapid rebounds  in  the  equity  markets,  widening  of  credit  spreads, unprecedented declines in, or cancellation of, dividend distributions,/uni00A0etc.).  These  exceptional  conditions  particularly  affected the  management  of  structured  equity-linked  products.  Since  then, these  activities  have  been  thoroughly  reconsidered  to  improve  and reduce the risk profile. Although monetary and fiscal stimuli - as well as  medical  advances  -  have  supported  economies  and  financial markets,  the  Group  remains  attentive  to  the  risk  of  correction  that could occur in particular in the event of new epidemic waves.\n\nFor  information  purposes,  risk-weighted  assets  (RWA)  related  to market  risks  were  thus  down  24%  at  the  end  of  December  2021 compared to the situation at the end of December 2020, to EUR 11.6 billion. The Global Markets and Investor Services sector, which mainly concentrates  the  Group's  market  risks,  represented  a  net  banking income of EUR 5.6 billion, or 22% of the Group's total revenues in 2021.\n\nRestrictive  measures  have  led  the  Group  to  massively  implement remote working arrangements, particularly for a significant part of its market activities. This organisation, which was deployed in immediate response to the crisis, increases the risk of operational incidents and the  risk  of  cyber-attacks.  Even  though  the  Group  has  put  in  place adaptation and support measures, these risks remain higher in periods of  widespread  recourse  to  remote  working.  All  employees  remain subject  to  health  risks  at  the  individual  level.  Prolonged  remote working  also  increases  psychosocial  risk,  with  potential  impacts  in terms  of  organisation  and  business  continuity  in  the  event  of prolonged absences.\n\nThe  unprecedented  environment  resulting  from  the  Covid-19  crisis could  alter  the  performance  of  the  models  used  within  the  Group (particularly in terms of asset valuation and assessment of own funds requirements  for  credit  risk),  due  in  particular  to  calibration  carried out  over  periods  that  are  not  comparable  to  the  current  crisis  or  to assumptions that are no longer valid, taking the models beyond their area  of  validity.  The  temporary  decline  in  performance  and  the recalibration  of  these  models  could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the Group's results.\n\nThe ECB recommendation to restrict dividend distribution and share buybacks for all banks placed under its direct supervision expired on 30 September 2021. As from this date, dividend distribution and share buybacks  policies  will  be  determined  in  accordance  with  the provisions of the applicable prudential regulation.\n\nUncertainty as to the duration and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic makes  it  difficult  to  predict  its  impact  on  the  global  economy. Consequences  for  the  Group  will  depend  on  the  duration  of  the pandemic, the measures taken by national governments and central banks and developments in the health, economic, financial and social context.\n\n## 4.1.1.3  The  Group's  failure  to  achieve  its  strategic  and  financial objectives disclosed to the market could have an adverse effect on its  business,  results  of  operations  and  the  value  of  its  financial instruments.\n\nAt the time of the publication of its annual results on 10 February 2022, the  Group  communicated  new  guidance  on  its  operating  expenses, cost of risk and solvency. The Group targets an underlying cost/income ratio  (excluding  the  Single  Resolution  Fund  -  SRF)  between  66%  and 68% in 2022 and with further improvement thereafter. Over 2022, the Group's cost of risk should not exceed 30 basis points. In consideration of the situation in Ukraine, the Group communicated on 3 March 2022 that it was not changing its cost of risk target and that it would update it, if necessary, at the time of its Q1 2022 results publication. The Group manages its CET1 ratio with a margin of flexibility of between 200 and 250 basis points higher than regulatory requirements, defined as the Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA), including under Basel IV.\n\nThese expectations are based on a number of assumptions related to the macroeconomic, geopolitical and health context. The non-occurrence  of  these  assumptions  (including  in  the  event  of  the occurrence of one or more of the risks described in this section) or the occurrence of unanticipated events could compromise the achievement of  Group's  strategic  and  financial  objectives  and  negatively  affect  its activity, results and financial situation.\n\n|",

Although  this  project  has  been  designed  to  enable  a controlled  deployment,  the  merger  could  have  a  short-term  material adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  business,  financial  position  and  costs. System reconciliations could face delays, delaying part of the expected merger benefits. The project could lead to the departure of a number of employees, requiring replacements and efforts related to new employee training, thus potentially generating additional costs. The merger could also  lead  to  the  departure  of  a  portion  of  the  Group's  customers, resulting  in  loss  of  revenue.  The  legal  and  regulatory  aspects  of  the transaction could result in delays or additional costs. In October 2021, the Group presented the detailed Vision 2025 project, specifying that the timetable and ambitions remained aligned with the initial presentation of  the  project.  In  addition,  the  effective  sale  of  Lyxor  was  finalised  on 31/uni00A0December 2021. The Group also announced the signature by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and ALD of two memoranda of understanding providing for the acquisition by ALD of 100% of LeasePlan, with a view to creating a global leader in sustainable mobility solutions. The Group also announced on 1 February  2022  that  Boursorama  had  signed  a  memorandum  of understanding with ING. Under this agreement, exclusive new customer offers and a simplified subscription process (depending on the product) are  expected  to  be  proposed  to  ING  customers  who  wish  to  become Boursorama customers.\n\nThe  Group  may  however  face  an  execution  risk  on  these  strategic projects,  which  are  to  be  carried  out  simultaneously.  Any  difficulty encountered  during  the  process  of  integrating  activities  (particularly from  a  human  resource  standpoint)  is  likely  to  result  in  higher integration  costs  and  lower-than-anticipated  savings,  synergies  or benefits. Moreover, the process of integrating the acquired operational businesses into the Group could disrupt the operations of one or more of  its  subsidiaries  and  divert  management's  attention,  which  could have a negative impact on its business and results. These acquisitions may not materialise, in whole or in part, resulting in a reduced level of expected earnings.\n\nFurthermore, the Group is committed to becoming a leading bank in the field of responsible finance through, among others:\n\n- more than EUR 150 billion in financing granted to support the energy p transition, above the 2019-2023 target of EUR 120 billion, two years ahead of schedule;\n- strong targets for decarbonizing the Group's portfolios, including a p planned  total  exit  from  thermal  coal  and  a  10%  reduction  in  the Group's  overall  exposure  to  the  oil  and  gas  extraction  sector (upstream) by 2025;\n- the signing as co-founder of the Principles for a Responsible Banking p Sector, through which the Group undertakes to strategically align its business  with  the  Sustainable  Development  Objectives  set  by  the United Nations and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change;\n- a  key  role  as  a  founding  member of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance p initiative,  with  a  commitment to align its  portfolios  on  trajectories aimed  at  global  carbon  neutrality  by  2050  in  order  to  reach  the objective of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nThese  measures  (and  additional  measures  that  may  be  taken  in  the future) could in some cases affect decrease the Group's results in the sectors concerned.\n\n4.1.1.4 The Group is subject to an extended regulatory framework in  each  of  the  countries  in  which  it  operates  and  changes  to  this regulatory framework could have a negative effect on the Group's businesses, financial position and costs, as well as on the financial and economic environment in which it operates.\n\nThe Group is subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which it operates. French, European and U.S. regulations as well as other local regulations  are  concerned,  given  the  cross-border  activities  of  the Group,  among  other  factors.  The  application  of  existing  regulations and  the  implementation  of  future  regulations  requires  significant resources  that  could  affect  the  Group's  performance.  In  addition, possible non-compliance with regulations could lead to fines, damage to  the  Group's  reputation,  forced  suspension of its operations or the withdrawal of operating licences. By way of illustration, exposures to credit  and  counterparty  risks  (EAD)  in  France,  the  27-member European Union (including France) and the United States represented 46%, 67% and 14%, respectively as of 31 December 2021.\n\nAmong  the  regulations  that  could  have  a  significant  influence  on the/uni00A0Group:\n\n- several regulatory changes  are  still likely to degrade  the p environment for market activities: (i) the possible strengthening of transparency constraints and investor protection measures (review of MiFID II / MiFIR, IDD, ELTIF (European Long-Term Investment Fund Regulation)),  (ii)  the  implementation  of  the  fundamental  review  of the  trading  book,  or  FRTB,  which  may  significantly  increase requirements  applicable  to  European  banks  and  (iii)  despite  the European Commission's decision of 8 February 2022 to extend the equivalence granted to UK central counterparties until 30 June 2025, possible relocations could be requested;\n- in the United States, the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act has p been almost finalised. The new Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC)  regulations  related  to  security-based  swap dealers  have  been  applicable  since  2021  and  requires  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's  registration  with  the  SEC  as  a  Securities  Based  Swap Dealer  and  compliance  with  related  regulations.  Further,  once  the SEC has issued a final order on substituted compliance for France, a portion  of  the  SEC's  rules  could  be  satisfied  by  demonstrating compliance with home country laws;\n- European  measures  aimed  at  restoring  banks'  balance  sheets, p especially  through  active  management  of  non-performing  loans (\"NPLs\"), which are leading to a rise of prudential requirements and an  adaptation  of  the  Group's  strategy  for  managing  NPLs.  More generally,  additional  measures  to  define  a  framework  of  good practices for granting (e.g., loan origination orientations published by the European Banking Authority) and monitoring loans could also impact the Group;\n- the strengthening of data quality and protection requirements and a p potential strengthening of cyber-resilience requirements in relation to the publication on 24 September 2020 of the proposed European regulation on digital operational resilience for the financial sector;\n- the implementation of the European sustainable finance regulatory p framework, with an increase in non-financial reporting obligations, enhanced inclusion of environmental, social and governance issues in  risk  management  activities  and  the  potential  inclusion  of  such risks in the supervisory review and assessment process (Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process, or SREP);\n- the strengthening of the crisis prevention and resolution regime set p out  in  the  Bank  Recovery  and  Resolution  Directive  of  15  May  2014 (\"BRRD\"), as revised, gives the Single Resolution Board (\"SRB\") the power to initiate a resolution procedure towards a credit institution when  the  point  of  non-viability  is  considered  reached.  In  this context,  the  SRB  could,  in  order  to  limit  the  cost  to  the  taxpayer, force  some  creditors  and  the  shareholders  of  the  Group  to  incur losses in priority. Should the resolution mechanism be triggered, the Group could, in particular, be forced to sell certain of its activities, modify  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  remuneration  of  its  debt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Furthermore,  the  Group's  contribution  to  the  annual financing of the Single Resolution Fund (\"SRF\") is significant and will grow  steadily  until  2023,  with  2024  being  the  year  of  the  full endowment of the fund. The contribution to the banking resolution mechanisms is described in Note 7.3.2 \"Other provisions for risks and expenses\" of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\nNew  legal  and  regulatory  obligations  could  also  be  imposed  on  the Group in the future, such as:\n\n- the ongoing implementation in France of consumerand p social-oriented  measures  affecting  retail  banking:  limitation  of banks' fees for individuals and extension of such measures to small and  medium-sized  businesses,  and  protection  measures  for vulnerable customers;\n- the  potential  requirement  at  the  European  level  to  open  more p access to banking data (savings books, investments) to third-party service providers and/or to pool customer data;\n- new  obligations  arising  from  a  package  of  proposed  measures p announced by the European Commission on 20 July 2021 aiming to strengthen  the  European  supervisory  framework  around  the  fight against  money  laundering  and  terrorist  financing,  as  well  as  the creation of a new European agency to fight money laundering;\n- new measures arising from changes to bankruptcy laws relating to p the  management  of  the  health  crisis  caused  by  the  Covid-19 pandemic,  including  those  facilitating  recourse  to  accelerated safeguard procedures;\n- new requirements resulting from the EU banking regulation reform p proposal presented on 27 October  2021  by  the  European Commission. The reform consists of several legislative instruments to amend the directive on capital requirements (European Parliament and EU Council, directive 2013/36/EU, 26 June 2013) as well as the regulation on capital requirements (CRR) (European Parliament and EU Council, regulation (EU) No. 575/2013, 26 June/uni00A02013).\n\nThe Group is also subject to complex tax rules in the countries where it operates.  Changes  in  applicable  tax  rules,  uncertainty  regarding  the interpretation  of  certain  evolutions  or  their  effects  may  have  a negative impact on the Group's business, financial position and costs.\n\nMoreover, as an international bank that handles transactions with US persons,  denominated  in  US  dollars,  or  involving  US  financial institutions,  the  Group  is  subject  to  US  regulations  relating  in particular  to  compliance  with  economic  sanctions,  the  fight  against corruption  and  market  abuse.  More  generally,  in  the  context  of agreements with US and French authorities, the Group has undertaken to  implement,  through  a  dedicated  programme  and  a  specific organisation, corrective actions to address identified deficiencies and strengthen  its  compliance  programme.  In  the  event  of  a  failure  to comply  with  relevant  US  regulations,  or  a  breach  of  the  Group's commitments under these agreements, the Group could be exposed to the risk  of  (i)  administrative  sanctions,  including  fines,  suspension  of access to US markets, and even withdrawals of banking licences, (ii) criminal proceedings, and (iii) damage to its reputation.\n\n## 4.1.1.5  Increased  competition  from  banking  and  non-banking operators could have an adverse effect on the Group's business and results, both in its French domestic market and internationally.\n\nDue to its international activity, the Group faces intense competition in  the  international  and  local  markets  in  which  it  operates,  whether from banking or non-banking actors. As such, the Group is exposed to the risk of not being able to maintain or develop its market share in its various  activities.  This  competition  may  also  lead  to  pressure  on margins,  which  would  be  detrimental  to  the  profitability  of  the Group's activities.\n\nConsolidation  in  the  financial  services  industry  could  result  in  the competitors benefiting from greater capital, resources and an ability to offer a broader range of financial services. In France and in the other main  markets  where  the  Group  operates,  the  presence  of  major domestic  banking  and  financial  actors,  as  well  as  new  market participants (notably neo-banks and online financial services providers),  has  increased  competition  for  virtually  all  products  and services  offered  by  the  Group.  New  market  participants  such  as \"fintechs\" and new services that are automated, scalable and based on new technologies (such as blockchain) are developing rapidly and are fundamentally  changing  the  relationship  between  consumers  and financial services providers, as well as the function of traditional retail bank  networks.  Competition  with  these  new  actors  could  be exacerbated by the emergence of substitutes for central bank currency (crypto-currencies, digital central bank currency, etc.).\n\nMoreover,  competition  is  also  enhanced  by  the  emergence  of non-banking actors that, in some cases, may benefit from a regulatory framework  that  is  more  flexible  and  in  particular  less  demanding  in terms of equity capital requirements.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Group has implemented a strategy, in particular with regard to the development of digital technologies and the  establishment  of  commercial  or  equity  partnerships  with  these new actors (such as Lumo, the platform offering green investments, or Shine,  the  neobank  for  professionals).  In  this  context,  additional investments may be necessary for the Group to be able to offer new innovative services and to be competitive with these new actors. This intensification  of  competition  could,  however,  adversely  affect  the Group's  business  and  results,  both  on  the  French  market  and internationally.\n\n## 4.1.1.6  Environmental,  social  and  governance  (ESG)  risks,  in particular related to climate change, could have an impact on the Group's  activities,  results  and  financial  situation  in  the  short-, medium-and long-term.\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) risks are defined as risks stemming from the current or prospective impacts of ESG factors on counterparties or invested assets of financial institutions. ESG risks are seen as aggravating factors to the traditional categories of risks (credit and  counterparty  risk,  market  and  structural  risk,  operational  risk, reputational  risk,  compliance  risk,  liquidity  and  funding  risk,  risks related  to  insurance  activities)  and  are  likely  to  impact  the  Group's activities,  results  and  financial  position  in  the  short-,  medium-  and long-term.\n\nThe  Group  is  thus  exposed  to  environmental  risks,  and  in  particular climate  change  risks  through  its  financing,  investment  and  service activities.  Concerning climate risks, a distinction is made between (i) physical  risk,  with  a  direct  impact  on  entities,  people  and  property stemming  from  climate  change  and  the  multiplication  of  extreme weather events; and (ii) transition risk, which results from the process of  transitioning  to  a  low-carbon  economy,  such  as  regulatory  or technological disruptions or changes in consumer preferences.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "The  Group  could  be  exposed  to  physical  risk  resulting  from  a deterioration in the credit quality of its counterparties whose activity could be negatively impacted by extreme climatic events or long-term gradual  changes  in  climate,  and  through  a  decrease  in  the  value  of collateral received (particularly in the context of real estate financing). The Group's insurance activities could also be impacted with exposure in regions and  countries that are particularly vulnerable to climate/uni00A0change.\n\nThe  Group  may  also  be  exposed  to  transition  risk  through  its  credit portfolio  in  a  limited  number  of  sensitive  sectors  that  are  subject  to more  stringent  regulations  or  due  to  technological  disruptions,  and may be exposed to reputation risk in the event it does not comply with its  commitments  in  favor  of  environmental  transition  or  if  these commitments are considered insufficient by its stakeholders.\n\nBeyond  the  risks  related  to  climate  change,  risks  more  generally related  to  environmental  degradation  (such  as  the  risk  of  loss  of biodiversity)  are  also  aggravating  factors  to  the  Group's  risks.  The Group  could  notably  be  exposed  to  credit  risk  on  a  portion  of  its portfolio,  linked  to  lower  profitability  of  some  of  its  counterparties due,  for  example,  to  a  significant  decline  in  revenues  following changes  in  customer  behavior  or  to  increasing  legal  and  operating costs  (for  instance  due  to  the  implementation  of  new  environmental standards).\n\nIn addition, the Group is exposed to social risks, related for example to non-compliance  by  some  of  its  counterparties  with  labor  rights  or workplace  health  and  safety  issues,  which  may  trigger  or  aggravate non-compliance, reputational and credit risks for the Group.\n\nSimilarly,  risks  relating  to  governance  of  the  Group's  counterparties and  stakeholders  (suppliers,  service  providers,  etc.),  such  as  an inadequate  management  of  environmental  and  social  issues  or non-compliance with corporate governance codes related to, among others,  anti-money  laundering  issues,  could  generate  credit  and reputational risks for the Group.\n\nBeyond the risks related to its counterparties or invested assets, the Group  could  also  be  exposed  to  risks  related  to  its  own  activities. Therefore, the Group is exposed to physical climate risk with respect to its  ability  to  maintain  its  services  in  geographical  areas  impacted  by extreme events (floods, etc.).\n\nThe  Group  also  remains  exposed  to  specific  social  and  governance risks,  relating  for  example  to  compliance  with  labor  laws,  the management of its human resources and ethical issues, transparency or  the  composition  (such  as  in  terms  of  diversity)  of  its  Board  of Directors or staff.\n\nAll  these  risks  could  have  an  impact on the Group's business, results and reputation in the short, medium and long term.\n\n## 4.1.1.7  The  Group  is  subject  to  regulations  relating  to  resolution procedures, which could have an adverse effect on its business and the value of its financial instruments.\n\nThe  BRRD  and  Regulation  (EU)  No.  806/2014  of  the  European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union of 15 July 2014 (the  Single  Resolution  Mechanism,  or  \"SRM\")  define  an  European Union-wide  framework  for  the  recovery  and  resolution  of  credit institutions and investment firms. The BRRD provides the authorities with  a  set  of  tools  to  intervene  early  and  quickly  enough  in  an institution considered to be failing so as to ensure the continuity of the institution's essential financial and economic functions while reducing the  impact  of  the  failure  of  an  institution  on  the  economy  and  the financial system  (including  the  exposure  of  taxpayers  to  the consequences of the failure). Under the SRM Regulation, a centralised resolution  authority  is  established  and  entrusted  to  the  SRB  and national resolution authorities.\n\nThe powers granted to the resolution authority under the BRRD and the SRM Regulations include write-down/conversion powers to ensure that capital  instruments  and  eligible  liabilities  absorb  the  Group's  losses and recapitalise it in accordance with an established order of priority (the \"bail-in tool\"). Subject to certain exceptions, losses are borne first by  the  shareholders  and  then  by  the  holders  of  additional  Tier  1  and Tier  2  capital  instruments,  then  by  the  non-preferred  senior  debt holders and finally by the senior preferred debt holders, all in the order of  their  claims  in  a  normal  insolvency  proceeding.  The  conditions  for resolution  provided  by  the  French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code implementing  the  BRRD  are  deemed  to  be  met  if:  (i)  the  resolution authority or the competent supervisory authority determines that the institution  is  failing  or  likely  to  fail;  (ii)  there  is  no  reasonable perspective  that  any  measure  other  than  a  resolution  measure  could prevent the failure within a reasonable timeframe; and (iii) a resolution measure  is  necessary  to  achieve  the  resolutions'  objectives  (in particular,  ensuring  the  continuity  of  critical  functions,  avoiding  a significant  negative  effect  on  the  financial  system,  protecting  public funds  by  minimizing  the  recourse  to  extraordinary  public  financial support, and protecting customers' funds and assets) and the winding up of  the  institution  under  normal  insolvency  proceedings  would  not meet these objectives to the same extent.\n\nThe  resolution  authority  could  also,  independently  of  a  resolution measure or in combination with a resolution measure, proceed with the  write-down  or  conversion  of  all  or  part  of  the  Group's  capital instruments (including subordinated debt instruments) into equity if it determines that the Group will no longer be viable unless it exercises this  write-down  or  conversion  power  or  if  the  Group  requires extraordinary public financial support (except where the extraordinary public  financial  support  is  provided  in  the  form  defined  in  Article  L. 613-48 III, 3\u00b0 of the French Monetary and Financial Code).\n\nThe bail-in tool could result in the write-down or conversion of capital instruments  in  whole  or  in  part  into  ordinary  shares  or  other ownership instruments.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  bail-in  tool,  the  BRRD  provides  the  resolution authority  with  broader  powers  to  implement  other  resolution measures  with  respect  to  institutions  that  meet  the  resolution requirements, which may include (without limitation) the sale of the institution's  business  segments,  the  establishment  of  a  bridge institution,  the  split  of  assets,  the  replacement  or  substitution  of  the institution as debtor of debt securities, changing the terms of the debt securities (including changing the maturity and/or amount of interest payable  and/or  the  imposition  of  a  temporary  suspension  of payments),  the  dismissal  of  management,  the  appointment  of  a provisional  administrator  and  the  suspension  of  the  listing  and admission to trading of financial instruments.\n\nBefore taking any resolution action, including the implementation of the  bail-in  tool,  or  exercising  the  power  to  write  down  or  convert relevant capital instruments, the resolution authority must ensure that a  fair,  prudent  and  realistic  valuation  of  the  institution's  assets  and liabilities is made by a third party independent of any public authority.\n\nThe  application  of  any  measure  under  the  French  implementing provisions  of  the  BRRD  or  any  suggestion  of  such  application  to  the Group could have a material adverse effect on the Group's ability to meet  its  obligations  under  its  financial  instrument  and,  as  a  result, holders of these securities could lose their entire investment.\n\nIn  addition,  if  the  Group's  financial  condition  deteriorates,  the existence of the bail-in tool or the exercise of write-down or conversion powers  or  any  other  resolution  tool  by  the  resolution  authority (independently of or in combination with a resolution) if it determines that Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale or the Group will no longer be viable could result in  a  more  rapid  decline  in  the  value  of  the  Group's  financial instruments than in the absence of such powers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The Group may therefore incur losses in the event of default by one or more counterparties, particularly if the Group encounters legal or other difficulties in enforcing the collateral allocated  to  its  exposures  or  if  the  value  of  this  collateral  is  not sufficient to fully recover the exposure in the event of default. Despite the  Group's  efforts  to  limit  the  concentration  effects  of  its  credit portfolio  exposure,  it  is  possible  that  counterparty  defaults  could  be amplified within the same economic sector or region of the world due to the interdependence of these counterparties.\n\nConsequently, the default of one or more significant counterparties of the Group could have a material adverse effect on the Group's cost of risk, results of operations and financial position.\n\nFor  information,  as  of  31  December  2021,  the  Group's  exposure  at default (EAD, excluding counterparty risk) was EUR 934 billion, with the following breakdown by type of counterparty: 30% on sovereigns, 30% on corporates, 23% on retail customers and 6% on credit institutions and  similar.  Risk-weighted  assets  (RWA)  for  credit  risk  totalled EUR/uni00A0277/uni00A0billion.\n\nRegarding  counterparty  risks  resulting  from  market  transactions (excluding  CVA),  at  the  end  of  December  2021,  the  exposure  value (EAD)  was  EUR  145  billion,  mainly  to  corporates  (42%)  and  credit institutions  and  similar  entities  (38%)  and  to  a  lesser  extent  to sovereign entities (17%). Risk-weighted assets (RWA) for counterparty risk amounted to EUR 25 billion.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the main sectors to which the Group is exposed in its corporate portfolio included financial activities (accounting for 20.2% of exposure), real estate (9.7%), commercial services (9.6%), wholesale trade (8.0%), the transport, postal services and logistics sector (7.1%), collective services (7.0%) and the oil and gas sector (5.4%).\n\nIn  terms  of  geographical  concentration,  the  five  main  countries  to which the Group is exposed as of 31 December 2021 were France (46% of  the  Group's  total  EAD,  mainly  related  to  retail  customers  and sovereigns),  the  United  States  (13%  of  EAD,  mainly  related  to corporates  and  sovereigns),  the  Czech  Republic  (5%  of  the  Group's total EAD, mainly related to retail clients, corporates and sovereigns), the  United  Kingdom  (4%  of  EAD,  mainly  related  to  corporates  and sovereigns) and Germany (4% of the Group's total EAD, mainly related to  corporates  and  credit  institutions).  Furthermore,  the  financial situation of certain counterparties  could  be  affected  by  the geopolitical  tensions  mentioned  in  section  4.1.1.1  ' The  global economic  and  financial  context,  geopolitical  tensions,  as  well  as  the market environment in which the Group operates, may adversely affect its activities, financial position and results of operations '.\n\nFor  more  detail  on  credit  and  counterparty  risk,  see  sections  4.5.6 \"Quantitative information\" and 4.6.3 \"Counterparty credit risk measures\" of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 4.1.2.2  The  financial  soundness  and  conduct  of  other  financial institutions and market participants could have an adverse effect on the Group's business.\n\nFinancial  institutions  and  other  market  players  (commercial  or investment  banks,  mutual  funds,  alternative  funds,  institutional clients,  clearing  houses,  investment  service  providers,  etc.)  are important  counterparties  for  the  Group  in  capital  or  inter-bank markets.  Financial  services  institutions  and  financial  players  are closely  interrelated  as  a  result  of  trading,  clearing  and  funding relationships.  In  addition,  there  is  a  growing  involvement  in  the financial markets of players with little or no regulation (hedge funds, for example). As a result, defaults by one or several actors in the sector or  a  crisis  of  confidence  affecting  one  or  more  actors  could  result  in market-wide liquidity scarcity or chain defaults, which would have an adverse effect on the Group's activity. The situation in Ukraine and the consequences of international sanctions, among other things, and the evolution  of  the  financial  markets  could  also  weaken,  or  even  cause the  default,  of  a  certain  number  of  financial  players.  In  addition, certain  financial  players  could  experience  operational  or  legal difficulties  in  the  unwinding  or  settlement  of  certain  financial transactions.\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  clearing  institutions  and  their  members because  of  the  increase  in  transactions  traded  through  these institutions,  induced  in  part  by  regulatory  changes  that  require mandatory  clearing  for  over-the-counter  derivative  instruments standardised by these clearing counterparties. The Group's exposure to clearing houses amounted to EUR 39 billion of EAD on 31 December 2021. The default of a clearing institution or one of its members could generate  losses  for  the  Group  and  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the business and results of the Group.\n\nThe  Group  is  also  exposed  on  assets  held  as  collateral  for  credit  or derivatives instruments, with the risk that, in the event of failure of the counterparty,  some  of  these  assets  may  not  be  sold  or  that  their disposal  price  may  not  cover  the  entire  exposure  in  credit  and counterparty risks. These assets are subject to periodic monitoring and a specific management framework.\n\nAt  31  December  2021,  the  Group's  exposure  (EAD)  to  credit  and counterparty  risks  on  financial  institutions  amounted  to  EUR  116 billion, representing 11% of the Group's EAD in respect of credit risk.\n\n## 4.1.2.3  The  Group's  results  of  operations  and  financial  position could be adversely affected by a late or insufficient provisioning of credit exposures.\n\nThe Group regularly records provisions for doubtful loans in connection with its lending activities in order to anticipate the occurrence of losses. The amount of provisions is based on the most accurate assessment at the time of the recoverability of the debts in question. This assessment, based  notably  on  multi-scenario  approaches,  relies  on  an  analysis  of the  current  and  prospective  situation  of  the  borrower  as  well  as  an analysis  of  the  value  and  recovery  prospects  of  the  debt,  taking  into account  any  security  interests.  In  some  cases  (loans  to  individual customers), the provisioning method may call for the use of statistical models  based  on  the  analysis  of  historical  losses  and  recovery  data. Since 1 January 2018, the Group has also been recording provisions on performing loans under the IFRS9 accounting standard. This assessment is based on statistical models for assessing probabilities of default  and  potential  losses  in  the  event  of  default,  which  take  into account a prospective analysis based on regularly updated macroeconomic scenarios.\n\n|",

Outstanding loans  in  default  (stage  3  under  IFRS  9)  represented  EUR  17.8  billion, including  47%  in  France,  23%  in  Africa  and  Middle  East  and  14%  in Western Europe (excluding France). The gross ratio of doubtful loans on the balance sheet was 2.9% and the gross coverage ratio of these loans was approximately 51%. The cost of risk stood at 13 basis points during 2021, against a cost of risk of 64 basis points in 2020.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the stock of provisions relating to outstanding amounts (on- and off-balance sheet) amounted to EUR 3.6 billion on\n\n## MARKET AND STRUCTURAL RISKS 4.1.3\n\nMarket  risk  corresponds  to  the  risk  of  impairment  of  financial instruments  resulting  from  changes  in  market  parameters,  the volatility  of  these  parameters  and  the  correlations  between  these parameters.  The  concerned  parameters  include  exchange  rates, interest  rates,  as  well  as  the  prices  of  securities  (shares,  bonds)  and commodities, derivatives and any other assets.\n\n## 4.1.3.1 Changes and volatility in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on the Group's business and the results of market activities.\n\nIn the course of its activities, the Group takes trading positions in the debt, currency, raw material and stock markets, as well as in unlisted shares,  real  estate  assets  and  other  types  of  assets  including derivatives.  The  Group  is  thus  exposed  to  \"market  risk\".  Volatility  in the financial markets can have a material adverse effect on the Group's market activities. In particular:\n\n- significant  volatility  over  a  long  period  of  time  could  lead  to p corrections  on  risky  financial  assets  (and  especially  on  the  riskiest assets) and generate losses for the Group;\n- a  sudden  change  in  the  levels  of  volatility  and  its  structure,  or p alternative short-term sharp declines and fast rebounds in markets, could  make  it  difficult  or  more  costly  to  hedge  certain  structured products and thus increase the risk of loss for the Group.\n\nSevere market disruptions and high market volatility have occurred in recent years and may occur again in the future, which could result in significant  losses  for  the  Group's  markets  activities.  Such  losses  may extend to a broad range of trading and hedging products, notably on derivative instruments, both vanilla and structured.\n\nIn  the  event  that  a  much  lower-volatility  environment  emerges, reflecting a generally optimistic sentiment in the markets and/or the presence of systematic volatility sellers,  increased  risks  of  correction may  also  develop,  particularly  if  the  main  market  participants  have similar  positions  (market  positions)  on  certain  products.  Such corrections  could  result  in  significant  losses  for  the  Group's  market activities.  The  volatility  of  the  financial  markets  makes  it  difficult  to predict  trends  and  implement  effective  trading  strategies;  it  also increases  risk  of  losses  from  net  long  positions  when  prices  decline and,  conversely,  from  net  short  positions  when  prices  rise.  The realisation of any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial position.\n\nSimilarly, the sudden decrease in, or even the cancellation of, dividends, as  experienced  during  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  and  changes  in  the correlations  of  different  assets  of  the  same  class,  could  affect  the Group's performance, with many activities being sensitive to these risks.\n\nA  prolonged  slowdown  in  financial  markets  or  reduced  liquidity  in financial markets could make asset disposals or position manoeuvrability more difficult, leading to significant losses. In many of the Group's activity segments, a prolonged decline in financial markets, particularly  asset  prices,  could  reduce  the  level  of  activity  in  these markets  or  their  liquidity.  These  variations  could  lead  to  significant losses  if  the  Group  were  unable  to  quickly  unwind  the  positions concerned, adjust the coverage of its positions, or if the assets held in collateral could not be divested, or if their selling prices did not cover the Group's entire exposure on defaulting loans or derivatives.\n\nThe  assessment  and  management  of  the  Group's  market  risks  are based on a set of risk indicators that make it possible to evaluate the potential  losses  incurred  at  various  time  horizons  and  given probability levels, by defining various scenarios for changes in market parameters  impacting  the  Group's  positions.  These  scenarios  are based  on  historical  observations  or  are  hypothetically  defined. However,  these  risk  management  approaches  are  based  on  a  set  of assumptions  and  reasoning  that  could  turn  out  to  be  inadequate  in certain configurations or in the case of unexpected events, resulting in a  potential  underestimation  of  risks  and  a  significant  negative  effect on the results of the Group's market activities.\n\nFurthermore, in the event of a deterioration of the market situation, the  Group  could  experience  a  decline  in  the  volume  of  transactions carried  out  on  behalf  of  its  customers,  leading  to  a  decrease  in  the revenues generated from this activity and in particular in commissions received.\n\nFinally, the prospect of a faster-than-expected monetary tightening led to tensions and volatility in rates at the end of 2021, reflected notably by  a  flattening  of  the  main  curves.  More  generally,  the  reduction  in accommodating monetary policies could lead to significant corrections  in  the  markets  due  to  higher  interest  rates  and  less liquidity.  In  addition,  certain  players  who  have  benefited  from  a prolonged  environment  of  low  interest  rates  and  high  liquidity  may encounter  difficulties,  with  a  risk  of  propagation  to  all  financial markets,  which  could  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on  the Group's market activities and results.\n\nFor information purposes, Global Markets & Investor Services activities, which account for most of the Group's market risks, represented EUR 5.6 billion of net banking income in 2021, or 22% of the Group's total revenues. At 31 December 2021, risk-weighted assets (RWA) subject to market  risk  represented  EUR  11.6  billion  (representing  3%  of  the Group's total RWA).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The Group's results are influenced by changes in interest rates in Europe and in the other markets where it operates. In Europe in particular, a protracted environment of low or even  negative  interest  rates  has  affected  and  could  continue  to adversely affect the Group's retail banking income, notably in France.\n\nIn addition, a sequence of very rapid rate hikes also presents a risk to the  Group's  revenues.  Such  a  scenario  may  in  particular  be  the consequence of the end of accommodating policies in reaction to an economic recovery or to high inflation rates. The rise in key rates or the reduction or even the end of central bank asset purchase programmes could then induce a rise in the yield curve which would have the effect of reducing the value of fixed rate assets measured at fair value. and a change in customer behavior that could affect the bank's income and lead the bank to readjust its hedges in an unfavorable context.\n\nFor  information  purposes,  the  Net  banking  income  (NBI)  of  French retail banking amounted to EUR/uni00A07.8/uni00A0billion in 2021.\n\nFor more information on structural interest rate risks, see chapter 4.9 \"Structural  interest  rate  and  exchange  rate  risks\" and  Note  8.1 \"Segment  reporting\" in  Chapter  6  of  the  2022  Universal  Registration Document.\n\n## 4.1.3.3  Fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  could  adversely  affect  the Group's results.\n\nAs a result of its international activities and its geographical presence in  many  countries,  the  Group's  revenues  and  expenses  as  well  as  its assets  and  liabilities  are  recorded  in  different  currencies,  which exposes it to the risk of exchange-rate fluctuations.\n\nBecause the Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in euros, which is the currency of most of its liabilities, it is also subject to translation  risk  for  items  recorded  in  other  currencies,  in  the preparation  of  its  consolidated  financial  statements.  Exchange  rate fluctuations of these currencies against the euro may adversely affect the  Group's  consolidated  results,  financial  position  and  cash  flows. Exchange  rate  fluctuations  may  also  negatively  affect  the  value (denominated in euros) of the Group's investments in its subsidiaries outside the Eurozone.\n\nFor  more  information  of  structural  exchange  rate  risk,  see  chapter 4.7.5 \"Market Risk Capital Requirements and Risk-Weighted Assets\" and chapter  4.9.3 \"Structural  exchange  rate  risk\" in  the  2022  Universal Registration Document.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISKS (INCLUDING RISK OF INAPPROPRIATE 4.1.4 CONDUCT) AND MODEL RISKS\n\nAt  31  December  2021,  risk-weighted  assets  in  relation  to  operational risk  amounted  to  EUR  47  billion,  or  13%  of  the  Group's  total  RWA. These risk-weighted assets relate mainly to Global Markets & Investor Services (65% of total operational risk).\n\nBetween 2017 and 2021, the Group's operational risks were primarily concentrated in five risk categories, representing 93% of the Group's total operating losses observed over the period: fraud (mainly external frauds)  and  other  criminal  activities  (32%),  execution  errors  (20%), disputes  with  authorities  (17%),  errors  in  pricing  or  risk  assessment, including  model  risk  (13%)  and  commercial  disputes  (11%).  The Group's other categories of operational risk (unauthorised activities in the  markets,  failure  of  information  systems  and  loss  of  operating resources) remain minor, representing on average 7% of the Group's losses between 2017 and 2021.\n\nSee chapter/uni00A04.8.3 'Operational risk measurement' of the 2022 Universal Registration  Document  for  more  information  on  the  allocation  of operating losses.\n\n## 4.1.4.1  A  breach  of  information  systems,  notably  in  the  event  of cyber-attack, could have an adverse effect on the Group's business and results in losses and damage the Group's reputation.\n\nThe Group relies heavily on communication and information systems to conduct its business and this is reinforced by the widespread use of remote banking and the digitalisation of processes. Any breach of its systems or the systems of its external partners could materially disrupt the  Group's  business.  Such  incidents  could  result  in  significant  costs related  to  the  recovery  and  verification  of  information,  loss  of revenues, customer  attrition, disputes with counterparties or customers, difficulties in managing market operations and short-term refinancing operations, and ultimately damage the Group's reputation. Difficulties  experienced  by  the  Group's  counterparties  could  also indirectly generate credit and/or reputational risks for the Group. The situation stemming from the conflict in Ukraine mentioned in section 4.1.1.1  \" The  global  economic  and  financial  context,  geopolitical tensions,  as  well  as  the  market  environment  in  which  the  Group operates,  may  adversely  affect  its  activities,  financial  position  and\n\nresults of operations \" increases the risk of cyber-attacks for the Group and its external partners.\n\nEach year, the Group is subject to several cyber attacks on its systems or those of its customers, partners and suppliers. The Group could be subject to targeted and sophisticated attacks on its computer network, resulting in embezzlement, loss, theft or disclosure of confidential data or customer data (which could constitute violations of Regulation (EU) 2016/679  of  the  European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  27/uni00A0April 2016  on  the  protection  of  natural  persons  with  regard  to  the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ('GDPR'). Such actions could result in operational losses and have an adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  business,  results  and  reputation  with its/uni00A0customers.\n\n## 4.1.4.2  The  Group  is  exposed  to  legal  risks  that  could  have  a material  adverse  effect  on  its  financial  position  or  results  of operations.\n\nIn  the  case  of  non-compliance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations, the Group and certain of its former and current representatives may be involved  in  various  types  of  litigation,  including  civil,  administrative, tax,  criminal  and  arbitration  proceedings.  The  large  majority  of  such proceedings arise from transactions or events that occur in the Group's ordinary  course  of  business.  There  has  been  an  increase  in  client, depositor, creditor and investor litigation and regulatory proceedings against  intermediaries  such  as  banks  and  investment  advisors  in recent years, in part due to the challenging market environment. This has  increased  the  risk  for  the  Group  of  losses  or  reputational  harm arising  from  litigation  and  other  proceedings.  Such  proceedings  or regulatory enforcement actions could also lead to civil, administrative, tax  or  criminal  penalties  that  could  adversely  affect  the  Group's business,  financial  position  and  results  of  operations.  The  situation generated by the conflict in Ukraine mentioned in section 4.1.1.1 \" The global economic and financial context, geopolitical tensions, as well as the  market  environment  in  which  the  Group  operates,  may  adversely affect  its  activities,  financial  position  and  results  of  operations \"  could increase the legal risk.\n\n|",

It  is  inherently  difficult  to  predict  the outcome  of  litigation and  proceedings  involving  the  Group's businesses, particularly those cases in which the matters are brought on  behalf  of  various  classes  of  claimants,  cases  where  claims  for damages  are  of  unspecified  or  indeterminate  amounts,  or  cases involving  unprecedented  legal  claims.  Should  such  estimates  prove inaccurate  or  should  the  provisions  set  aside  by  the  Group  to  cover such risks prove inadequate, the Group's financial position or results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nThe provision recorded in the Group's financial statements for public rights disputes amounted to EUR/uni00A0338/uni00A0million on 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\nFor a description of the most significant ongoing proceedings, see the section/uni00A04.11 'Compliance risk, Litigation' , Note/uni00A08.3.2 'Other provisions' and Note/uni00A09 'Information on risks and litigation' of chapter/uni00A06 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 4.1.4.3  Operational  failure,  termination  or  capacity  constraints affecting  institutions  the  Group  does  business  with,  or  failure  of information technology systems could have an adverse effect on the  Group's  business  and  result  in  losses  and  damage  to  its reputation.\n\nAny  dysfunction,  failure  or  interruption  of  service  of  the  Group's communication and information systems or the systems of its external partners,  even  brief  and  temporary,  could  result  in  significant disruptions  to  the  Group's  business.  Such  incidents  could  result  in significant costs related to information retrieval and verification, loss of  revenue,  loss  of  customers,  litigation  with  counterparties  or customers, difficulties in managing market operations and short-term refinancing, and ultimately damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  the  risk  of  operational  failure  or  capacity constraints  in  its  own  systems  and  in  the  systems  of  third  parties, including those of financial intermediaries that it uses to facilitate cash settlement  or  securities  transactions  (such  as  clearing  agents  and houses  and  stock  exchanges),  as  well  as  those  of  clients  and  other market participants. The international tensions linked to the situation in  Ukraine  and  the  sanctions  that  have  been  put  in  place  and  those that may be put in place in the future could also lead to operational difficulties within the Rosbank subsidiary.\n\nThe  interconnections  between  various  financial  institutions,  clearing houses,  stock  exchanges  and  service  providers,  including  external cloud services, increase the risk that the operational failure of any one of them could lead to an operational failure of the entire sector, which could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  Group's  ability  to  conduct  its business and could therefore result in losses. This risk is likely  to  be increased by industry concentration, whether among  market participants  or  financial  intermediaries,  as  complex  and  disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.\n\nThe  Group  is  also  subject  to  various  regulatory  reforms  and  major internal  strategic  projects  that  may  lead  to  operational  disruptions and  have  an  impact  on  the  Group's  operations,  the  accounting  of transactions and their tax or prudential treatment, and on the Group's results in the event of poor project management and understanding of operational  risks.  Examples  include  the  IBOR  interbank  rate  reform, which aims to ensure the continuity of contracts indexed on interbank rates, or the internal project to merge the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale and Cr\u00e9dit du  Nord  retail  networks,  with  the  transfer  of  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord's information system to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale information system.\n\nSee 'Risks  related  to  information  security  and  information  and communication technologies' of section/uni00A04.8.1 'Organisation of operational risk management' , and 'quantitative data' of section/uni00A04.8.3 'Operational  risk  measurement' for  a  breakdown  of  operational  risk losses, and section/uni00A04.8.4 'Risk-weighted assets and capital requirements' of  the  2022  Universal  Registration  Document  for  a breakdown of risk-weighted exposure to operational risks by division.\n\nThe  operational  risks  specific  related  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic  are also  described  in  the  section/uni00A04.1.1.2 'The  coronavirus  (Covid-19) pandemic  and  its  economic  consequences  could  negatively  affect  the Group's business and financial performance' .\n\n## 4.1.4.4  The  Group  is  exposed  to  fraud  risk,  which  could  result  in losses and damage its reputation.\n\nFraud risk is defined as the intentional non-compliance with existing laws, regulations or procedures, which in most cases results in harm to the  bank  or  its  customers,  and  provides  the  fraudster  or  his  or  her relatives with a direct or indirect material or moral benefit.\n\nThe  risk  of  fraud  increases  intrinsically  in  a  crisis  context  (financial pressure  among  clients,  third  parties  or  our  employees)  and  in  a remote  working  environment  that  may  limit  the  capacity  for monitoring and exchanges by or with the manager or other employees contributing  to  the  prevention  or  detection  of  fraud  risk.  This  risk mainly  involves  external  fraud  related  to  the  bank's  credit  activities and  to  the  means  of  payment  (electronic  banking,  transfers  and checks)  made  available  to  customers.  Fraud  schemes  are  changing rapidly  in  terms  of  volume  and  approach,  in  line  with  the  security measures and countermeasures developed in the market and within the Group. Internal fraud is carried out through the misappropriation of  funds  and  the  granting  of  undue  facilities  and  can  be  carried  out with or without external collusion. Finally, unauthorised rogue trading, with  or  without  circumvention  of  controls,  could  impact  results  and have a very significant negative impact on the Group's reputation.\n\nBetween  2017  and  2021,  the  risk  of  fraud  represented  32%  of  the Group's total operating losses.\n\n## 4.1.4.5 Reputational damage could harm the Group's competitive position, its activity and financial condition.\n\nAn organisation benefits from a good reputation when its activities and services  meet  or  exceed  the  expectations  of  its  stakeholders,  both external  (customers,  investors,  shareholders,  regulators,  supervisors, suppliers, opinion leaders such as NGOs,  etc.) and  internal (employees).\n\nThe Group's reputation for financial strength and integrity is critical to its ability to foster loyalty and develop its relationships with customers and  other  counterparties  in  a  highly  competitive  environment.  Any reputational damage could result in loss of activity with its customers or a loss of confidence on the part of its investors, which could affect the  Group's  competitive  position,  its  business  and  its  financial condition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Methods  of distribution  of  products  and  services  that  do  not  provide  sufficient information to customers, a lack of transparency in its communication (particularly  financial  communication)  or  internal  management  rules (including  human  resources  management  or  relations  with  suppliers and service providers) that do not comply with regulatory obligations or  the  bank's  commitments  could  affect  the  Group's  reputation.  In addition, the situation in Ukraine and the international sanctions put in  place  create  an  environment  that  is  likely  to  sharply  increase  the Group's reputational risk.\n\nA corporate social responsibility strategy (in particular with regard to environmental  issues)  deemed  insufficiently  ambitious  in  relation  to the expectations of external stakeholders or difficulties in implementing this strategy could also impact the Group's reputation.\n\nAs  a  result,  negative  comments  regarding  the  Group,  whether  or  not legitimate, and concerning events that may or may not be attributable to  the  Group,  could  deteriorate  the  Group's  reputation  and  affect  its competitive position.\n\nThe Group's reputation could also be adversely affected by a weakness in its  internal  control  measures  aimed  at  monitoring  and  preventing operational,  compliance,  credit  and  market  risks,  particularly  with respect to monitoring inappropriate conduct of its employees (such as corruption,  fraud,  market  abuse  and  tax  evasion).  This  risk  may  arise from  the  conduct  itself  as  well  as  from  administrative  or  criminal sanctions penalising an insufficiently effective control environment, such as the sanctions issued by the US and French authorities in 2018 relating to the Group's failure to comply with economic embargo measures.\n\nAs  a  result,  a  perceived  lack  of  commitment  to  the  Group's  Code  of Conduct, which aims to anchor the Group's values in terms of ethics and responsibility, could be detrimental to the Group's good reputation.\n\nThese various issues  could  also  have  a  non-negligible  impact  on  the Group's ability to attract and recruit younger talent or to retain talent within the Group.\n\nThe  consequences  of  these  events,  which  could  potentially  result  in legal proceedings, may vary according to the extent of media coverage and the overall context and remain difficult to estimate.\n\nFor  more  information  about  reputation  risk  please  see  section/uni00A04.11 'Compliance  risks,  Litigation' and  section/uni00A05.3.2 \"Applying  the  highest standards in client relationship management\" of  Chapter/uni00A05 'Corporate Social Responsibility' of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 4.1.4.6  The  Group's  inability  to  attract  and  retain  qualified employees may adversely affect its performance.\n\nThe Group employs 131,000/uni00A0people in 64/uni00A0countries. Human resources are key  assets  of  the  Group,  its  business  model  and  value  proposition. Inadequate  career  or  skills  management  (integration,  career  prospects and  training,  or  in  terms  of  compensation  levels  in  line  with  market practice, /uni00A0 etc . )  could affect the performance of the Group's banking and financial activities. The Group's inability to attract and retain employees, a  high  rate  of  turnover  or  the  departure  of  strategic  employees  could expose the Group to a loss in its know-how as well as a deterioration in the quality of service, at the expense of client satisfaction.\n\nFurthermore,  the  increased  oversight  of  compensation  policies  to which the banking sector is subject, including rules on certain types of compensation  (fixed,  variable,  performance  conditions,  deferred payments, /uni00A0 etc . ),  may  limit  the  Group's  ability  to  attract  and  retain talent.  This  is  notably  the  case  for  the  CRD/uni00A0IV  directive,  which  has applied since 2014 to banks in the European Economic Area (EEA) and therefore  to  the  Group,  and  for  the  CRD/uni00A0V  directive,  applicable  since January/uni00A02021. These  directives  include  a  cap  on  the  variable\n\ncomponent of compensation compared to its fixed component for the relevant personnel, which could reduce the Group's ability to attract and  retain  employees,  in  particular  against  competitors  located outside of the EEA.\n\nIn addition, the context of the Covid-19 health crisis has reinforced the aspirations of some of the Group's employees to access new ways of working,  with  the  lasting  introduction  of  a  'hybrid'  form  of  work (involving  an  organisation  based  on  both  on-site  presence  of employees  and  remote  working).  However,  hindsight  on  this  hybrid working method is still limited to date and has yet to be evaluated in terms  of  the  level  of  satisfaction  and  commitment  of  the  Group's employees.\n\nFor  more information, see section/uni00A05.4.1.3.4 'Guaranteeing health and safety  at  work  and  continuous  improvement  of  working  conditions' of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 4.1.4.7 The models, in particular the Group's internal models, used in  strategic  decision-making  and  in  risk  management  systems could fail, face delays in deployment or prove to be inadequate and result in financial losses for the Group.\n\nInternal models used within the Group could prove to be deficient in terms  of  their conception,  calibration, use or monitoring  of performance  over  time  in  relation  to  operational  risk  and  therefore could produce erroneous results, notably with financial consequences. The  faulty  use  of  so-called  artificial  intelligence  techniques  in  the conception  of  these  models  could  also  lead  to  the  production  of erroneous results.\n\n## In particular:\n\n- the valuation of certain financial instruments that are not traded on p regulated markets or other trading platforms, such as OTC derivative contracts  between  banks,  uses  internal  models  that  incorporate unobservable  parameters.  The  unobservable  nature  of  these parameters results in an additional degree of uncertainty as to the adequacy  of  the  valuation  of  the  positions.  In  the  event  that  the relevant  internal  models  prove  unsuitable  for  changing  market conditions,  some  of  the  instruments  held  by  the  Group  could  be misvalued and could generate losses for the Group. For illustrative purposes, financial  assets  and  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  on the balance sheet categorised within level 3 (for which the valuation is not based on observed data) represented EUR 13.4 billion and EUR 43.7 billion, respectively, as of 31 December 2021 (see Note 3.4.1 and Note  3.4.2  of  chapter  6  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements included in the 2022 Universal Registration Document on financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value);\n- the  assessment of  customer  solvency  and  the  Bank's  exposure  to p credit  and  counterparty  risk  is  generally  based  on  historical assumptions and observations that may prove to be inappropriate in  light  of  new  economic  conditions.  It  is  based  on  economic scenarios  and  projections  that  may  not  adequately  anticipate unfavourable economic conditions or the occurrence of unprecedented  events.  This  miscalculation  could,  among  other things,  result  in  an  under-provisioning  of  risks  and  an  incorrect assessment of capital requirements;\n- hedging  strategies  used  in  market  activities  rely  on  models  that p include assumptions about the evolution of market parameters and their  correlation,  partly  inferred  from  historical  data.  These  models could be inappropriate in certain market environments (in the event of  a  large-scale  armed  conflict,  strong  movements  in  volatility resulting,  for  example,  from  a  pandemic,  or  tensions  between  the United States and China, in the Middle East or in Africa), leading to an ineffective hedging strategy, thus causing unanticipated losses that could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  results  and financial position;\n\n|",

These models, based in particular on historical observations, could have an impact  on  the  hedging  of  these  risks  when  unprecedented events/uni00A0occur.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  has  initiated  an  evolution  of  its  system  of internal  credit  risk  models  (project  'Haussmann').  This  evolution could have a significant impact on the calculation of its RWA credit and counterparty risk in the event of delay in the schedule for submitting its  models  to  the  supervisor  or  in  the  event  of  late  validation  by  the supervisor.\n\nFinally,  the  unprecedented  environment  resulting  from  the  Covid-19 crisis  could  alter  the  results  of  the  models  used  within  the  Group (particularly in terms of asset valuation and the assessment of capital requirements for credit risk), due in particular to a calibration carried out  over  periods  that  are  not  comparable  to  the  current  crisis,  or  to assumptions  that  are  no  longer  valid,  leading  the  models  to  exceed their  validity  zone.  The  temporary  decline  in  performance  and  the recalibration  of  these  models  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  the Group's results.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISKS 4.1.5\n\n4.1.5.1  The  Group's  access  to  financing  and  the  cost  of  this financing could be negatively affected in the event of a resurgence of financial crises or deteriorating economic conditions.\n\nIn past crises (such as the 2008 financial crisis, the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, the tensions on the financial markets linked to the Covid-19 pandemic  before  the  intervention  of  the  central  banks  or  more recently  the  tensions  linked  to  the  crisis  in  Ukraine),  access  to financing from European banks was intermittently restricted or subject to less favourable conditions.\n\nIf  unfavourable debt market conditions were to reappear following a new systemic or Group-specific crisis, the effect on the liquidity of the European  financial  sector  in  general  and  on  the  Group  in  particular could  be  very  significantly  unfavourable  and  could  have  an  adverse impact  on  the  Group's  operating  results  as  well  as  its  financial position.\n\nFor  several  years,  central  banks  have  taken  measures  to  facilitate financial  institutions'  access  to  liquidity,  in  particular  by  lowering interest  rates  to  historical  lows  and  by  setting  up  TLTRO  (Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations) type facilities and by implementing asset purchase policies to keep long-term interest rates at  very  low  levels.  In  a  context  of  higher  inflation,  central  banks (notably the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve) have begun to phase out these accommodating policies. For example, the ECB indicated in December/uni00A02021  that  it  will  cease  the  Emergency  Pandemic  Purchase programme  (EPPP)  in  March/uni00A02022  and  its  Targeted  Long-Term Refinancing  Operations  (TLTRO  3)  in  June/uni00A02022.  In  this  context,  the Group could face an unfavourable evolution of its financing cost and access to liquidity.\n\nIn addition, if the Group were unable to maintain a satisfactory level of deposits  from  its  customers,  it  could  be  forced  to  resort  to  more expensive financing, which would reduce its net interest margin as well as its results.\n\n## 4.1.4.8  The  Group  may  incur  losses  as  a  result  of  unforeseen  or catastrophic  events,  including  health  crises,  large-scale  armed conflicts, terrorist attacks or natural disasters.\n\nThe Group remains dependent on its natural and social environment. The  occurrence  of  a  new  epidemic  or  pandemic  crisis  (such  as  the Covid-19  pandemic)  or  a  health  crisis  related  to  the  pollution  of  the natural  environment  could  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  Group's activities.  Also,  large-scale  armed  conflicts,  terrorist  attacks,  natural disasters (including earthquakes, such as in Romania, and floods, such as  the  exceptional  flooding  of  the  Seine  in  Paris),  extreme  weather conditions  (such  as  heatwaves)  or  major  social  unrest  (such  as  the gilets jaunes movement in France) could affect the Group's activities.\n\nSuch events could create economic and financial disruptions or lead to operational  difficulties  (including  travel  limitations  or  relocation  of affected employees) for the Group.\n\nThese events could impair the Group's ability to manage its businesses and  also  expose  its  insurance  activities  to  significant  losses  and increased  costs  (such  as  higher  re-insurance  premiums).  Upon  the occurrence of such events, the Group could incur losses.\n\nThe Group's regulatory short-term liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) stood at 129% at 31 December 2021 and liquidity reserves amounted to EUR 229 billion at 31 December 2021.\n\n## 4.1.5.2  A  downgrade  in  the  Group's  external  rating  or  in  the sovereign rating of the French state could have an adverse effect on the Group's cost of financing and its access to liquidity.\n\nFor the proper conduct of its activities, the Group depends on access to financing and other sources of liquidity. In the event of difficulties in accessing the secured or unsecured debt markets on terms it considers acceptable, due to market conditions or factors specific to the Group, or if it experiences unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, including material  decreases  in  customer  deposits,  its  liquidity  could  be impaired. In addition, if the Group is unable to maintain a satisfactory level of customer deposits collection, it may be forced to turn to more expensive  funding  sources,  which  would  reduce  the  Group's  net interest margin and results.\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of an increase in credit spreads. The Group's medium- and long-term financing cost is directly linked to the level  of  credit  spreads  which  can  fluctuate  depending  on  general market conditions. These spreads can also be affected by an adverse change  in  France's  sovereign  debt  rating  or  the  Group's  external ratings by rating agencies.\n\nThe  Group  is  currently  monitored  by  four  financial  rating  agencies: Fitch Ratings, Moody's, R&I and Standard & Poor's. The downgrading of the Group's credit ratings, by these or other agencies, could have a significant impact on the Group's access to funding, increase its cost of financing or reduce its ability to carry out certain types of transactions or  activities  with  customers.  This  could  also  require  the  Group  to provide  additional  collateral  to  certain  counterparties,  which  could have an adverse effect on its business, financial position and results of operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The  Group's  ratings  could  be  placed  under negative  watch  or  be  subject  to  a  downgrade.  In  addition,  France's sovereign ratings could also be downgraded due to an increase in its debt and deficits (further increased by the Covid-19 pandemic and the response measures taken by the French government). These elements could  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Group's  financing  costs  and  its access to liquidity. The Group's ratings by Fitch Ratings, Moody's, R&I and  Standard  &  Poor's  are  available  on  the  Group's  website ( https://investors.societegenerale.com/en/financial-and-non-financialinformation/ratings/credit-ratings).\n\nAccess  to  financing  and  liquidity  constraints  could  have  a  material adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  business,  financial  position,  results  of operations and ability to meet its obligations to its counterparties.\n\nAt end 2021, the Group raised a total of EUR/uni00A039.1/uni00A0billion  of  long-term funding  (of  which  EUR/uni00A035.3/uni00A0billion for  the  parent  company  and EUR/uni00A03.8/uni00A0billion for  its  subsidiaries)  which  relates,  at  the  parent company  level, to senior structured issues (EUR/uni00A019.9/uni00A0billion), subordinated  issues  (EUR/uni00A02.4/uni00A0billion),  senior  vanilla  non-preferred issues  (EUR/uni00A06.9/uni00A0billion), unsecured  senior  vanilla  preferred  issues (EUR/uni00A02.1/uni00A0billion) and secured issues (EUR/uni00A07.1/uni00A0billion).\n\nFor 2022, the Group  has  planned  a  funding  programme  of approximately  EUR/uni00A020/uni00A0billion  in  vanilla  long-term  debt,  in  senior preferred and secured debt as well as in senior non-preferred debt and subordinated debt.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO INSURANCE ACTIVITIES 4.1.6\n\n4.1.6.1  A  deterioration  in  market  conditions,  and  in  particular  a significant  increase  or  decrease  in  interest  rates,  could  have  a material  adverse  effect  on  the  life  insurance  activities  of  the Group's Insurance business.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group's  insurance  activities  represented  net  banking income of EUR/uni00A01 billion, or 4% of the Group's consolidated net banking income.  The  Group's  Insurance  division  is  mainly  focused  on  life insurance.  At  31/uni00A0December  2021,  life  insurance  contracts  registered outstandings  of  EUR/uni00A0135/uni00A0billion,  divided  between  euro-denominated contracts (63%) and unit-linked contracts (37%).\n\nThe Group's Insurance business is highly exposed to interest-rate risk due to the high proportion of bonds in the euro-denominated funds in its  life  insurance contracts. The level of and changes in interest rates may, in certain configurations, have a material adverse effect on the results and financial position of this business line.\n\nWith  its  impact  on  the  yield  of  euro-denominated  contracts,  a prolonged outlook of low interest rates reduces the attractiveness of these  products  for  investors,  which  can  negatively  affect  fundraising and income from this segment of the life insurance business.\n\nA sharp rise in interest rates could also degrade the competitiveness of the  life  insurance  offerings  in  euros  (compared  with  bank  savings products,  for  example)  and  trigger  significant  repurchases  and arbitrage  operations  by  customers,  in  an  unfavourable  context  of unrealised losses on bond holdings. This configuration could affect the revenues and profitability of the life insurance activity.\n\nMore  generally,  a  pronounced  widening  of  spreads  and  a  decline  in equity  markets  could  also  have  a  significant  negative  effect  on  the results of the Group's life insurance business.\n\nIn the event of a deterioration in market parameters, the Group could be required to strengthen the own funds of its insurance subsidiaries to enable them to continue meeting their regulatory requirements in this domain.\n\n|",

The  Group  also  wishes  to  maintain long-term relationships with its clients built on the mutual confidence deserved  and  to  meet  the  expectations  of  all  of  its  stakeholders  by providing them with responsible and innovative financial solutions.\n\nThis is reflected in:\n\n- an organisation with 16 Business Units offering various products and p services to the Group's clients in different geographic locations;\n- balanced selective capital allocation between activities: p\n- a  preponderance  of  retail  banking  activities  in  France  and -abroad, which currently represent around 60% of risk weighted assets ('RWA') of the Group,\n- limitation  of  Business  Unit  Global  Markets'  share  in  the  RWA  of -the  Group.  In  accordance  with  its  client-focused  development strategy,  the  Group  ceased  its  trading  activities  for  its  own account (1) in  2019,  and  finalised  its  project  to  simplify  the products processed in 2021,\n- non-bank services activities,  in  particular  Insurance  and  vehicle -fleet management and financing, are conducted in line with the business strategy; they demonstrate a disciplined risk profile and thus generate profitability compliant with the Group's expectations;\n- a geographically balanced model: p\n- in Retail Banking, the Group focuses on international -development  leveraging  historic  presence,  extensive  market knowledge and top-tier positions,\n- as  regards  Global  Banking  and  Investor  Solutions,  apart  from -historical establishments, the Group targets activities for which it can leverage international expertise;\n- a  targeted  growth  policy,  favoring  existing  areas  of  expertise,  a p sound  quality  business  fund  and  the  search  for  synergies  in  the diversified banking model;\n- a positive and sustainable contribution to the transformations of our p economies, in particular with regard to the technological revolution, and economic, social and environmental transitions; CSR concerns are  therefore  at  the  heart  of  its  strategy  and  the  Group's relationships with stakeholders;\n- a strong vigilance as regards its reputation, deemed by the Group to p be a high-value asset which must be protected.\n\n## A robust financial strength profile\n\nThe  Group  seeks  to  achieve  sustainable  profitability,  relying  on  a robust financial profile consistent with its diversified banking model, by:\n\n- aiming for profitable and resilient business development; p\n- maintaining a target rating allowing access to financial resources at p a  cost  consistent  with  the  development  of  the  Group's  businesses and its competitive positioning;\n- calibrating its capital and hybrid debt targets to ensure: p\n- meeting  the  minimum  regulatory  requirements  on  regulatory -capital ratios,\n- compliance  with  the  financial conglomerate  ratio which -considers  the  combined  solvency  of  the  Group's  banking  and insurance activities,\n- one-year  coverage  of  the  'internal  capital  requirement'  using -available CET1 capital,\n- a  sufficient  level  of  creditor  protection  consistent  with  a  debt -issuance program that is particularly hybrid consistent with the Group's objectives in terms of rating and regulatory ratios such as Tier/uni00A01,  TLAC  ('Total Loss Absorbing Capacity'), MREL ('Minimum Required Eligible Liabilities'), and the leverage ratio;\n- ensuring  resilience  of  its  liabilities,  which  are  calibrated  by  taking p into account a survival horizon in a liquidity stress ratio, compliance with LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) and NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio) regulatory ratios and the level of dependence on short-term fundings and the foreign exchange needs of the Group's businesses, particularly in dollars;\n- controlling the leverage ratio through a leverage ratio target. p\n\n## Credit risk (including concentration effects)\n\nCredit risk appetite is managed through a system of credit policies, risk limits and pricing policies.\n\nWhen  it  takes  on  credit  risk,  the  Group  focuses  on  medium-  and long-term  client  relationships,  targeting  both  clients  with  which  the Bank  has  an  established  relationship  of  trust  and  prospects representing  profitable  business  development  potential  over  the mid-term.\n\nAcceptance  of  any  credit  commitment  is  based  on  in-depth  client knowledge  and  a  thorough  understanding  of  the  purpose  of  the transaction.\n\nIn a credit transaction, risk acceptability is based first on the borrower's ability  to  meet  its  commitments,  in  particular  through  the  cash  flows which will allow the repayment of the debt. For medium and long-term operations,  the  funding  duration  must  remain  compatible  with  the economic  life  of  the  financed  asset  and  the  visibility  horizon  of  the borrower's cash flow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Security interests are assessed with prudent value haircuts and paying special attention to their actual enforceability.\n\nComplex transactions or those with a specific risk profile are handled by  specialised  teams  within  the  Group  with  the  required  skills and/uni00A0expertise.\n\nThe Group seeks risk diversification by controlling concentration risk and maintaining a risk allocation policy through risk sharing with other financial partners (banks or guarantors).\n\nCounterparty ratings are a key criterion of the credit policy and serve as  the  basis  for  the  credit  approval  authority  grid  used  in  both  the commercial and risk functions. The rating framework relies on internal models. Special attention is paid to timely updating of ratings (which, in any event, are subject to annual review) (1) .\n\nThe risk measure of the credit portfolio is based primarily on the Basel parameters  that  are  used  to  calibrate  the  capital  need.  As  such,  the Group favors the  so-called  advanced  Basel  models  (IRBA),  which  are more risk-sensitive and more adapted to the specific characteristics of the bank's portfolio. These measures are complemented by an internal stress-sized  risk  assessment,  either  at  the  global  portfolio  level  or  at the  sub-portfolio  level,  linking  risk  measures  and  rating  migration  to macro-economic  variables.  In  addition,  the  calculation  of  expected losses  under  the  provisions  of  IFRS/uni00A09,  used  to  determine  the  level  of impairment on healthy outstandings, provides additional insight into assessing portfolio risk.\n\nIn  consultation  with  the  Risk  Department,  the  businesses  implement, most of the time, pricing policies that are differentiated according to the level of risk of counterparties and transactions. The purpose of pricing a transaction  is  to  ensure  acceptable  profitability,  in  line  with  the objectives  of  ROE  (Return  on  Equity)  of  the  business  or  entity,  after taking into account the cost of the risk of the transaction in question. The pricing of an operation can nevertheless be adapted in certain cases to take into account the overall profitability and the potential customer relationship  development.  The  intrinsic  profitability  of  products  and customer segments is subject to periodic analysis in order to adapt to changes in the economic and competitive environment.\n\nProactive management  of  counterparties  whose  situation  has deteriorated is key to containing the risk of final loss in the event of counterparty  failure.  As  such,  the  Group  has  put  in  place  rigorous procedures for monitoring non retail counterparties and/or for closer monitoring of retail counterparties whose risk profiles are deteriorating. In addition, the businesses and entities, in conjunction with  the  Risk  and  Finance  Departments,  and  through  collaborators specialising  in  recovery  and  litigation,  work  together  to  effectively protect the Bank's interests in the event of default.\n\n## Counterparty credit risk\n\nThe  future  value  of  exposure  to  a  counterparty  as  well  as  its  credit quality are uncertain and variable over time, both of which are affected by  changes  in  market  parameters.  Thus,  counterparty  credit  risk management is based on a combination of several types of indicators:\n\n- indicators of potential future exposures (potential future exposures, p or PFE), aimed at measuring exposure to our counterparties:\n- the  Group  controls  idiosyncratic  counterparty  credit  risks via a -set  of  CVaR  (Counterparty  VaR (2) limits.  The  CVaR  measures  the potential  future  exposure  linked  to  the  replacement  risk  in  the event of default by one of the Group's counterparties. The CVaR is calculated for a 99% confidence level and different time horizons, from one day until the maturity of the portfolio,\n- in addition to the risk of a counterparty default, the CVA (Credit -Valuation Adjustment) measures the adjustment of the value of our portfolio of derivatives and repos account the credit quality of our counterparties;\n- the  abovementioned  indicators  are  supplemented  by  stress  test p frameworks  or  on  nominal  ones  in  order  to  capture  risks  that  are more difficult to measure:\n- the more extreme correlation risks are measured via stress tests -at  different  levels  (wrong-way  risk,  stress  monitoring  at  sector level, risk on collateralised financing activities and agency),\n- the CVA risk is measured via a stress test in which representative -market  scenarios  are  applied,  notably  involving  the  credit spreads of our counterparties;\n- exposures to central counterparty clearing houses (CCP) are subject p to specific supervision:\n- the amount of collateral posted for each segment of a CCP: the -initial posted  margins,  both  for  our  principal  and  agency activities, and our contributions to CCP default funds,\n- in  addition,  a  stress  test  measures  the  impact  linked  to  the -default of an average member on all segments of a CCP and the failure of a major member on a segment of a CCP;\n- the Global  Stress  Test  on  market  activities  includes  cross p market-counterparty  risks,  it  is  described  in  more  detail  in  the 'Market risk' section.\n\n## Market risk\n\nThe  Group's  market  activities  are  carried  out  as  part  of  a  business development strategy primarily focused on meeting client requirements through a full range of products and solutions.\n\nMarket  risk  is  managed  through  a  set  of  limits  for  several  indicators (such  as  stress  tests,  Value  at  Risk  (VaR)  and  stressed  Value  at  Risk (SVaR),  'Sensitivity'  and  'Nominal'  indicators).  These  indicators  are governed  by  a  series  of  limits  proposed  by  the  business  lines  and approved by the Risk Division during the course of a discussion-based process.\n\nThe  choice  of  limits  and  their  calibration  reflect  qualitatively  and quantitatively  the  fixing  of  the  Group's  appetite  for  market  risks.  A regular  review  of  these  frameworks  also  enables  risks  to  be  tightly controlled according to changing market conditions with, for example, a  temporary  reduction  of  limits  in  case  of  a  deterioration.  Warning thresholds  are  also  in  place  to  prevent  the  possible  occurrence of/uni00A0overstays.\n\nLimits are set at different sub-levels of the Group, thereby cascading down the Group's risk appetite from an operational standpoint within its organisation.\n\nWithin these limits,  the  Global  Stress  Test  limits  on  market  activities and the Market Stress Test limits play a pivotal role in determining the Group's  market  risk  appetite;  in  fact,  these  indicators  cover  all operations and the main market risk factors as well as risks associated with a severe market crisis which helps limit the total amount of risk and takes account of any diversification effects.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Operational risk (including reputation and compliance risk)\n\nThe Group is exposed to a diversity of operational risks inherent in its business:  execution  errors,  internal  and  external  fraud,  IT  system failures,  malicious  acts  against  IT  systems,  loss  of  operational resources, commercial disputes, failure to comply with tax obligations, but  also  risk  of  non-compliance,  unappropriated  behavior  or  even reputation.\n\nAs a general rule, the Group has no appetite for operational risk or for non-compliance risk. Furthermore, the Group maintains a zero-tolerance policy on incidents severe enough to potentially inflict serious harm to its image, jeopardise its results or the trust displayed by  customers  and  employees,  disrupt  the  continuity  of  critical operations or call into question its strategic focus.\n\nThe  Group  underscores  that  it  has  is  no  or  very  low  tolerance  for operational risk involving the following:\n\n- internal fraud: the Group does not tolerate unauthorised trading by p its  employees.  The  Group's  growth  is  founded  on  trust,  as  much between employees as between the Group and its employees. This implies  respecting  the  Group's  principles  at  every  level,  such  as exercising loyalty and integrity. The Group's internal control system must be capable of preventing acts of major fraud;\n- cybersecurity:  The  Group  has  zero  tolerance  for  fraudulent p intrusions, in particular those resulting in the theft of customer data or  a  major  operational  disruption.  The  Group  intends  to  introduce effective  means  to  prevent  and  detect  this  risk.  It  is  adequately organised to deal with potential incidents;\n- data  leaks:  the  Group  is  committed  to  deploying  the  necessary p resources  and  implementing  controls  to  prevent,  detect  and remediate  data  leaks.  It  does  not  tolerate  any  leaks  of  its  most sensitive information, in particular that of customer data;\n- business  continuity:  the  Group  relies  heavily  on  its  information p systems  to  perform  its  operations  and  is  therefore  committed  to deploying and maintaining the resilience of its information systems to ensure the continuity of its most essential services. The Group has very  low  tolerance  for  the  risk  of  downtime  in  its  information systems  that  perform  essential  functions,  in  particular  systems directly  accessible  to  customers  or  those  enabling  to  conduct business on financial markets;\n- outsourced  services:  the  Group  seeks  to  achieve  a  high  degree  of p thoroughness  in  the  control  of  its  activities  entrusted  to  external service  providers.  As  such,  the  Group  adheres  to  a  strict  policy  of reviewing its providers;\n- managerial continuity: the Group intends to ensure the managerial p continuity  of  its  organisation  to  avoid  the  risk  of  a  long-term absence of a manager that would question the achievement of its strategic objectives, which might threaten team cohesion or disrupt the Group's relationships with its stakeholders.\n\n## Structural interest rate and exchange rate risks, risk to employee commitments\n\nThe  Group  measures  and  strictly  controls  structural  risks.  The mechanism whereby rate risk,  foreign  exchange  risk  and  the  risk  on pension/long-service obligations is controlled is based on sensitivity or stress  limits  which  are  broken  down  within  the  various  businesses (entities and business lines).\n\nThere  are  four  main  types  of  risk:  rate  level  risk,  curve  risk  book, optional risk (arising from automatic options and behavioral options) and  basis  risk,  related  to  the  impact  of  relative  changes  in  interest rates  indices.  The  Group's  structural  interest  rate  risk  management primarily  relies  on  the  sensitivity  of  Net  Present  Value  ('NPV')  of fixed-rate  residual  positions  (excesses  or  shortfalls)  to  interest  rate changes  according  to  several  interest  rate  scenarios.  The  limits  are established  either  by  the  Board  of  Directors  or  by  the  Finance Committee,  at  the  Business  Unit/Service  Unit  and  Group  levels. Furthermore, the Group measures and controls the sensitivity of its net interest margin ('NIM') on different horizons.\n\nThe Group's policy in terms of structural exchange rate risks consists of limiting as much as possible the sensitivity of its CET1 capital ratio to changes in exchange rates, so that the impact on the CET1 ratio of an appreciation or a depreciation of all currencies against the euro does not exceed a certain threshold in terms of bp by summing the absolute values of the impact of each currency.\n\nRegarding risks to pension and long-service obligations, which are the Bank's  long-term  obligations  towards  its  employees,  the  amount  of the provision is monitored for risk on the basis of a specific stress test and  an  attributed  limit.  The  risk  management  policy  has  two  main objectives:  reduce  risk  by  moving  from  defined-benefit  plans  to defined-contribution plans and optimise asset risk allocation (between hedge  assets  and  performance  assets)  where  allowed  by  regulatory and tax constraints.\n\n## Liquidity and financing risks\n\nControlling liquidity risk is based primarily on:\n\n- compliance  with  regulatory  liquidity  ratios,  with  precautionary p buffers:  LCR  (liquiditycoverage  ratio)  ratios  that  reflect  a  stress situation and NSFR (net stable funding ratio);\n- the  definition  of  a  minimum  survival  horizon  under  combined p market and idiosyncratic stress;\n- framing of transformation and anti-transformation positions (price p risk).\n\nControlling financing risk is based on:\n\n- maintaining  a  liability  structure  to  meet  the  Group's  regulatory p constraints (Tier1,  Total  Capital,  Leverage,  TLAC,  NSFR,  MREL)  and complying  with  rating  agencies'  constraints  to  secure  a  minimum rating level;\n- recourse to market financing: annual long-term issuance programs p and a stock of moderate structured issues and short-term financing raised by supervised treasuries.\n\n## Model risk\n\nThe Group is committed to defining and deploying internal standards to  reduce  model  risk  on  the  basis  of  key  principles,  including  the creation of three independent lines of defence, the proportionality of due  diligence  according  to  each  model's  level  of  risk  inherent,  the consideration of the models' entire lifecycle and the appropriateness of the approaches within the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The  investments  allowed  are mainly related to:\n\n- commercial  support  for  the  network  through  the  private  equity p activity  of  the  Societe  Generale  and  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  network  and certain subsidiaries abroad;\n- taking  stakes,  either  directly  or  through  investment  funds,  in p innovative companies via SG Ventures;\n- the  takeover  of  stakes  in  local  companies:  Euroclear, Cr\u00e9dit p Logement , etc.\n\nInvestments  made  in  private  equity  are  managed  directly  by  the networks concerned (Societe Generale, Cr\u00e9dit du Nord and subsidiaries  abroad)  and  are  capped  at  EUR  25  million.  Beyond  this limit,  the  investment  envelope  must  be  validated  by  the  Group Strategy Department on the basis of a file produced by the Business Unit  with  the  assistance  of  its  Finance  Department.  This  file  aims  to justify this amount, the expected benefits, the profitability considering the  consumption  of  associated  equity,  the  characteristics  of  the\n\ninvestments  (criteria,  types,  duration,  etc.),  a  risk  analysis  and  a governance proposal. If the amount exceeds EUR 50 million, it must be validated by the Group's General Management, with the support of the opinion  of  the  Strategy  Department,  the  Finance  Department,  the Corporate  Secretary  and  the  Compliance  Department.  The  Business Unit  concerned  must  submit  a  report  on  operations  and  the investment envelope to the Strategy Department every six months.\n\nThe  other  minority  holdings  are  subject  to  a  dedicated  validation process in both the investment and divestment phases: validation by the  Managers of the Business Units and entities concerned and their Finance  Department,  the  Strategy  Department,  or  even  the  Group's General Management (over EUR 50 million) or the Board of Directors (over  EUR  250  million).  These  files  are  examined  by  the  Strategy Department based on the opinions of the expert Services and Business Units  concerned  by  the  operation  (at  least  the  Finance  Department, the Legal and Tax Departments within the Corporate Secretary and the Compliance  Department).  The  instruction  is  based  on  an  analysis  of the  participation  concerned,  the  motivations  and  the  investment context, the structuring of the operation, its financial and prudential impacts, as well as an assessment of the risks identified and the means implemented to track and manage them.\n\n## Settlement/Delivery risk\n\nThe  settlement-delivery  risk  on  financial  instruments  arises  when transactions (over-the-counter in cash or forward) give rise to a time lag (usually of a few hours) between the payment and the delivery of the  underlying  (securities,  raw  materials,  foreign  exchange,  etc.) during their settlement.\n\nThe  Group  defines  a  risk  appetite  for  delivery  risk  in  relation  to  the quality of the counterparty ( via its rating) with larger limits granted to counterparties in the investment grade category (IG).\n\n## RISK APPETITE - GENERAL FRAMEWORK 4.2.2\n\nRisk  appetite  is  determined  at  Group  level  and  attributed  to  the businesses and subsidiaries. Monitoring of risk appetite is performed according to the principles described in the Risk Appetite Framework governance  and  implementation  mechanism,  which  are  summarised below.\n\n## Governance\n\nAs  part  of  the  supervision  of  risk  appetite,  the  Group  relies  on  the following organisation:\n\n- the Board of Directors: p\n- approves each year the Group Risk Appetite Statement and the -Group  Risk  Appetite  Framework,  as  well  as  the  Group  Risk Appetite Framework,\n- approves  in  particular  the  main  Group  risk  appetite  indicators -(Board of Directors indicators) validated beforehand by General Management,\n- ensures that risk appetite is relevant to the Group's strategic and -financial objectives and its vision of the risks of the macro-economic and financial environment,\n- reviews  quarterly  the  risk  appetite  dashboards  presented  to  it, -and is informed of risk appetite overruns and remediation action plans,\n- sets  the  compensation  of  corporate  officers,  sets  out  the -principles  of  the  remuneration  policy  applicable  in  the  Group, especially  for  regulated  persons  whose  activities  may  have  a significant  impact  on  the  Group's  risk  profile,  and  ensures  that they are in line with risk management objectives.\n\nThe Board of Directors relies primarily on the Risk Committee.\n\n- General Management: p\n- approves  the  Risk  Appetite  Statement  and  its  Risk  Appetite -Framework based on the proposal of the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,\n- regularly ensures that risk appetite is complied with, -\n- ensures  the  effectiveness  and  integrity  of  the  risk  appetite -implementation system,\n- ensures that the risk appetite for the Group's Business Units and -eligible  subsidiaries/branches  is  formalised  and  translated  into frameworks consistent with the Group's risk appetite,\n- ensures  internal  communication  of  risk  appetite  and  its -transposition in the Universal Registration Document.\n\nIn addition, the main mission of the Risk Department is to develop the Group's  risk  appetite,  as  well  as  the  implementation  of  a  risk management, monitoring and control system.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "The Finance Department contributes to setting this risk appetite in the framework  of  indicators  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Finance Committee (profitability, solvency, liquidity and structural risks).\n\nThe Compliance Department is also responsible for instructing the risk appetite setting for indicators falling within its scope.\n\n## Risk identification process\n\nThe  risk  identification  process  is  a  cornerstone  of  the  Group risk-management framework. It is a Group-wide process to identify all risks  that  are  or  might  be  material.  The  approach  is  comprehensive and holistic: it covers all risk types (1) and all Group exposures.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  annual  review  of  the  Group's  risk  taxonomy,  risk identification  process  is  based  on  two  pillars  in  order  to  ensure  a complete  and  up-to-date  view  of  all  the  material  risks  facing  the Group:\n\n- risk management governance and key Committees such as CORISQs p or COFI at Group or Business Unit level or New Product Committees making it possible to monitor changes in the risk profile for all types of  risk  (credit,  market,  operational, etc.). In addition to monitoring well-identified  risks,  this  governance  can  also  generate  a  debate between  risk  experts  and  senior  management  on  emerging  risks. This  debate  is  fueled  by  the  latest  market  news,  early  warning signals, internal alerts, and more;\n- a  series  of  exercises  aimed  at  identifying  additional  risks,  for p example  arising  from  changes  in  macroeconomic  or  sectoral conditions, financial markets, regulatory constraints, competitors or market  pressure,  business  model  (concentration  effects)  and changes  in  banking  organisations.  These  additional  identification exercises  are  also  organised  by  risk  types,  but  include  some identification  of  cross-risk  effects  ( e.g. credit  and  market  or  credit and  operational).  For  a  given  type  of  risk,  these  exercises  analyse and  segment  the  Group's  exposure  along  several  axes  (Business Unit,  activity,  customer,  product,  region,  etc.).  The  underlying  risk factors are identified for the perimeters where this risk is assessed as being significant.\n\nWhen a significant risk is identified, a risk management system, which may include a quantitative risk appetite (risk ceiling or threshold) or a risk policy, is implemented.\n\nIn  addition,  where  possible,  the  risk  factors  underlying  a  significant risk  are  identified  and  combined  in  a  dedicated  scenario,  and  the associated loss is then quantified by means of a stress test (see also section 'Risk quantification and stress test system').\n\n## Risk quantification and stress test system\n\nFor  each  identified  material  risk,  indicators  to  measure  this  risk  are introduced  to  ensure  monitoring.  These  indicators  can  be  based  on measurements of outstandings (risk weighted or not), sensitivities to the variation of one or more risk factors (interest rate, etc.), impacts of stress tests based on scenarios, etc. These indicators can be expressed as  ratios  and  are  sometimes  the  subject  of  regulatory  or  publication requirements.\n\nRegarding  more  specifically  stress  tests,  or  crisis  simulations,  they assess  what  would  be  the  behavior  of  a  portfolio,  activity,  entity  or Group in a context of degraded activity.\n\nWithin  the  Group,  stress  tests  contribute  to  the  identification, measurement and management of risks, as well as to the assessment of the adequacy of capital and liquidity to the Group's risk profile.\n\nHence, stress tests:\n\n- are a preferential measure providing information on the resilience of p the Group, its activities and its portfolios, and are an integral part of the process of building risk appetite;\n- are based on hypothetical economic  scenarios defined in p conjunction with the Economic and Sectoral Studies Department, or historical  scenarios.  The  stress  tests  break  down  these  scenarios into  impacts  on  the  Group's  activities,  by  taking  into  account  the reaction  capacities  of  the  activities,  by  systematically  combining quantitative  methods  and  expert  judgment  (risks,  finance  or business lines);\n- can also be based on sensitivity analysis (single or multi-factor risk). p\n\nThe stress test system thus comprises:\n\n- a  global  stress  test,  integrated  into  the  budget  process  (Strategic p and  financial  plan),  to  ensure  that  the  Group's  profile  meets  its objectives in the event of an adverse scenario, but also to quantify the  deterioration  in  the  profitability  of  the  Business  Units  in  this scenario.  The  stress  test  system  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process);\n- specific stress tests by type of risk or portfolio: p\n- stress  tests  on  credit  risk  complete  the  overall  analysis  with  a -more granular approach, and thus shed light on the fixing of risk appetite at a portfolio, activity, etc. They are also used to refine the identification, measurement and operational management of this risk,\n- stress  tests  on  market  activities  are  based  on  historical  and -hypothetical  scenarios  and  apply  to  the  entire  Group.  They  are supplemented by specific  sensitivity  stress  tests  on  certain  risk factors  (rates,  equities,  etc.)  or  certain  activities  (emerging markets, etc.). A stress test limit is established for these different risk measures,\n- stress  tests  assess  the  sensitivity  of  structural  interest  rate  risk. -The exercise focuses on changes in the economic value of assets and  liabilities  in  bank  portfolios  and  on  changes  in  the  net interest  margin  generated  by  these  assets  and  liabilities.  The Group sets limits on these sensitivities in scenarios of translation and deformation (steepening and flattening) of the yield curves,\n- a  stress  test  on  social  commitments  consists  of  simulating  the -impact  of  variations  in  market  risk  factors  (inflation,  interest rate,/uni00A0etc.)  on  the  Group's  net  position  (dedicated  investments minus the corresponding social commitments). A stress test limit is established on this indicator,\n- liquidity stress tests, -\n- an assessment of operational risk under stress uses the scenario -analysis and loss modeling work to calibrate the Group's capital requirement regarding operational risk, and makes it possible to understand  the  exposure  to  operational  losses,  including exposure to rare and severe losses not present in the history,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The  Insurance  Business  Unit  also  uses  also results  from  stress  tests  to  define  its  hedging  policy,  the distribution of its assets and the dividend distribution policy;\n- reverse  stress  tests,  both  as  part  of  the  risk  appetite  and  the p recovery plan. The impact of these stress tests is typically defined by a  breaking  point  in  the  solvency  ratio  or  liquidity  indicator,  which poses  a  significant  threat  to  the  Bank.  Hypothetical  scenarios leading  to  this  breaking  point  are  then  constructed  in  order  to identify new weaknesses.\n\n## DEFINITION OF THE 'CENTRAL' AND 'STRESSED' ECONOMIC SCENARIOS\n\n## Central scenario\n\nThe central scenario is based first of all on a set of observed factors such  as  recent  economic  situation  and  economic  policy  shifts (budgetary,  monetary  and  exchange-rate  policies).  From  these observed factors, economists calculate the most likely trajectory of economic and financial variables for the desired forecast horizon.\n\n## Setting and formalisation of risk appetite at Group level\n\nThe Group's risk appetite is formalised in a document ('Risk Appetite Statement') which sets out:\n\n- the strategic profile of the Group; p\n- its profile of profitability and financial soundness; p\n- the  frameworks  relating  to  the  management  of  the  Group's  main p risks  (qualitative,  through  risk  policies,  and  quantitative,  through indicators).\n\nRegarding  the  profile  of  profitability  and  financial  soundness,  the Finance Department proposes each year, upstream of the budgetary procedure,  to  the  General  Management,  financial  targets  at  Group level. These targets, supplemented by alert thresholds and crisis levels according to a 'traffic light' approach, allow:\n\n- to respect, with a sufficient safety margin, the regulatory obligations p to which the Group is subject (in particular the minimum regulatory solvency,  leverage  and  liquidity  ratios),  by  anticipating  as  best  as possible the implementation of new regulations;\n- to  ensure, via a  safety  margin,  sufficient  resistance  to  stress p scenarios  (stress  standardised  by  regulators  or  stress  defined according to a process internal to the Group).\n\nThe  frameworks  relating  to  risk  management,  also  represented via a graduated approach (limits, alert thresholds, etc.), result from a process\n\nIn  addition  to  internal  stress  test  exercises,  the  Group  is  part  of  the sample of European banks participating in major international stress test  programs  piloted  by  the  European  Banking  Authority  (EBA)  and the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nMore specifically on climate risk, the Group participated on a voluntary basis  in  exploratory  climate  stress  exercises  organised  by  the  ACPR ( Autorit\u00e9  de  contr\u00f4le  prudentiel  et  de  r\u00e9solution )  and  the  European Banking  Authority  in  2020.  A  stress  test  coordinated  by  the  ECB  in which the Group is participating is also being performed in the first half of 2022.\n\n## Stressed scenario\n\nThe severity of the stressed scenario, which is determined by the deviation of the GDP trajectory from the central scenario, is based on the magnitude of the 2008-2009 crisis and has been adjusted to take into account the impacts - health, economic and financial - of the Covid-19 crisis on the basis of current knowledge. The severity is  constantly  compared  to  that  of  various  adverse  scenarios produced  by  reputable  institutions  such  as  the  ECB,  the  Bank  of England or the Federal Reserve.\n\nin  which the needs expressed by the businesses are confronted with a contradictory  opinion  independent  from  the  second  line  defence.  The latter is based on:\n\n- independent analysis of risk factors; p\n- the use of prospective measures based on stress approaches; p\n- the proposal for a framework. p\n\nFor the main risks, the frameworks set make it possible to consolidate the  achievement  of  the  Group's  financial  targets  and  to  orient  the Group's profitability profile.\n\n## Allocation of risk appetite in the organisation\n\nThe  allocation  of  risk  appetite  in  the  organisation  is  based  on  the strategic and financial plan, and on risk management systems:\n\n- based on recommendations by the Finance Department to General p Management, the financial targets defined at Group level are broken down into budget allocation targets at business level as part of the budget and the strategic and financial plan;\n- the  breakdown  of  frameworks  and  risk  policies  is  based  on  an p understanding  of  the  needs  of  the  businesses  and  their  business prospects  and  takes  into  account  the  profitability  and  financial strength targets of the Business Unit and/or the entity.\n\n|",

Within this framework, it has hierarchical and functional authority over the compliance teams of Group entities.\n\nThe Group Compliance Service Unit is organised around three broad categories of non-compliance risks :\n\n- financial  security:  know  your  customer  (KYC);  compliance  with -the  rules  and  regulations  on  international  sanctions  and embargoes; countering money laundering and terrorist financing (AML/CTF),  including  reporting  suspicious  transactions  to  the appropriate financial intelligence authority when necessary,\n- regulatory  risks:  customers  protection;  integrity  of  the  financial -markets;  countering  bribery  and  corruption,  ethics  and  good conduct; compliance with regulations related to tax transparency (based  on  knowledge  of  clients'  tax  profile);  compliance  with regulations  on  social  and  environmental  responsibility  and  the Group's commitments,\n- protection  of  data,  including  personal  data  and  in  particular -those of customers;\n- the Corporate Secretary brings together: p\n- the  Group  Legal  Department,  which  ensures  in  particular  the -security and legal regularity of the Group's activities, drawing on the legal services of subsidiaries and branches where applicable,\n- the  Group  Tax  Department,  which  ensures  compliance  with  tax -laws in France and abroad,\n- the  Group  Security  Department,  which  oversees  the  Group's -security in conjunction with the Service Unit of the Resources and Digital  Transformation  Department  regarding  the  security  of information systems,\n- the  Group's  Administrative  Department,  which  provides  the -Group's central administration services and provides support, as necessary, to the Secretary of the Board of Directors;\n- the Human Resources and Communication Department monitors p the implementation of compensation policies, amongst other things;\n- the Corporate Resources and Innovation Department is p specifically  responsible  for  defining  the  policies  to  be  applied  in matters  of  information  systems  and  information  systems  security policies;\n- the Group Internal Audit and General Inspection Department is in p charge  of  internal  audits  and  reports  to  the  Head  of  Group Internal/uni00A0Audit.\n\n|",

It  supports  the  Group's  CSR transformation  to  make  it  a  major  competitive  advantage  both  in business development and in E&S risk management. the Sustainable Development Department provides advice to the General Management through three main tasks:\n\n- the  definition  and  strategic  management  of  the  Group's  CSR -ambition,\n- support for the CSR transformation of Business and Service Units, -\n- the contribution towards promoting the Group's CSR influence./uni00A0 \u25b2 -\n\nAccording  to  the  last  census  carried  out  on  31/uni00A0December  2021,  the full-time equivalent (FTE) workforce of:\n\n- the  Group's  Risk  Department  for  the  second  line  of  defence p represents approximately 4,609 FTEs (1,550 within the Group's Risk Department itself and 3,059 for the rest of the Risk function);\n- the  Compliance  Department  or  the  second  line  of  defence p represents approximately 2,870 FTEs;\n- the  Information  System  Security  Department  totals  approximately p 635 FTEs.\n\n## Risk reporting and assessment systems\n\nThe  Group's  risk  measurement  systems  serve  as  the  basis  for  the production of internal management reports allowing the monitoring of the Group's main risks (credit risk, counterparty, market, operational, liquidity, structural, settlement/delivery) as well as the monitoring of compliance with the regulatory requirements.\n\nThe  risk  reporting  system  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Group's  risk management  system  and  is  adapted  to  its  organisational  structure. The various indicators are thus calculated at the level of the relevant legal entities and Business Units and serve as the basis for the various reportings.  Departments  established  within  the  Risk,  Finance  and Compliance  sectors  are  responsible  for  measuring,  analysing  and communicating these elements.\n\nSince 2015, the Group has defined architecture principles common to the  Finance  and  Risk  functions,  the  TOM-FIR  principles  (Target Operating  Model  for  Finance  &  Risk),  in  order  to  guarantee  the consistency of the data and indicators used for internal management and regulatory production. The principles revolve around:\n\n- Risk and Finance uses, whether at the local level and at the various p levels  of  consolidation  subject  to  an  organised  system  of  'golden sources', with a collection cycle adapted to the uses;\n- common management rules and language to ensure interoperability; p\n- consistency  of  Finance  and  Risk  usage  data,  via  strict  alignment p between accounting data and management data.\n\nThe  Group  produces, via all  of  its  internal  reports  for  internal monitoring purposes by the Business Units and Service Units, a large number of risk metrics constituting a measure of the risks monitored. Some of these metrics are also produced as part of the transmission of regulatory  reports  or  as  part  of  the  publication  of  information  to the/uni00A0market.\n\nThe Group selects from these metrics a set of major metrics ,  able to provide  a  summary  of  the  Group's  risk  profile  and  its  evolution  at regular  intervals.  These  metrics  concern  both  the  Group's  financial rating, its solvency, its profitability and the main risks (credit, market, operational,  liquidity  and  financing,  structural,  model)  and  are included in the reports intended for internal management bodies.\n\nThey are also subject to a framework defined and broken down in line with the Group's risk appetite, giving rise to a procedure for reporting information in the event of breaches.\n\nThus, the risk reports intended for the management bodies are guided in particular by the following principles:\n\n- coverage of all significant risks; p\n- combination  of  a  global  and  holistic  view  of  risks  and  a  more p in-depth analysis of the different types of risk;\n- overview  supplemented  by  focus  on  certain  specific  scopes, p forward-looking elements (based in particular on the presentation of elements  on  the  evolution  of  the  macro-economic  context)  and elements on emerging risks;\n- balance between quantitative data and qualitative comments. p\n\nThe main Risk reports for management bodies are:\n\n- monthly reporting to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors p aims to provide an overview of changes in the risk profile.\n- A  dashboard  for  monitoring  the  Group's  Risk  Appetite  Statement indicators  is  also  sent  quarterly  to  the  Board  of  Directors.  These indicators  are  framed  and  presented  using  a  'traffic  light'  approach (with  distinction  between  thresholds  and  limits)  in  order  to  visually present  monitoring  of  compliance  with  risk  appetite.  In  addition,  a compliance  dashboard  and  a  reputation  dashboard  are  sent  to  the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and provide an overview of each non-compliance risk:\n- monthly reporting to the Group Risk Committee (CORISQ) aims to p regularly  provide  this  committee  with  a  risk  analysis  under  its supervision, with a greater level of detail than reporting to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. In particular, a summary of the main  credit  files  over  the  period  covered  by  the  reporting  is presented;\n- reporting to the Finance Committee (COFI) for General Management p gives  rise  in  particular  to  the  following  two  reports:  a  \"Scarce resources  trajectory\"  report  allowing  budget  execution  to  be monitored and a \"Structural risk monitoring (ALM)\" report \u00bb making it  possible  to  monitor  compliance  with  the  thresholds  and  limits relating to liquidity risks and structural interest and exchange rate risks;\n- the  quarterly  reporting  of  the  Group  Compliance  Committee p (COMCO)  to  General  Management:  the  COMCO  provides  via dedicated reporting an overview of the main non-compliance risks, raises  points  of  attention  on  compliance  topics  Group,  decides  on the main orientations and defines the Group principles in terms of compliance;\n- the  quarterly  reporting  of  the  Provisions  Committee  (COPRO)  to p General Management is intended to provide an overview of changes in the level of provisions at Group level. In particular, it presents the change in the net charge of the cost of risk by pillar, by Business Unit and by stage;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Finally,  the  Risk  Department contributes,  as  a  permanent  member,  to  all  GICCC  meetings, through position papers on the subjects under review.\n\nAlthough  the  above  reports  are  used  at  Group  level  to  monitor  and review  the  Group's  risk  profile  in  a  global  manner,  other  reports  are transmitted to the Board of Directors or to the General Management in order to monitor and control certain types specific risks.\n\n## INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM\n\n## Presentation of the reform\n\nAudited  I The  interest  rate  benchmark  reform  (IBOR:  InterBank Offered  Rates),  initiated  by  the  Financial  Stability  Board  in  2014, aims at replacing these benchmark rates with alternative rates, in particular  the  Risk-Free  Rates  (RFR).  This  reform  accelerated  on 5/uni00A0March 2021, when the Financial Conduct Authority, the supervisor of LIBOR, announced the official dates for the cessation of loss of representativeness:\n\n- EUR  and  CHF  LIBOR  (all  terms);  GBP  and  JPY  LIBOR  (terms: p overnight, one  week,  two  months  and  twelve  months); LIBOR/uni00A0USD (terms: one week and two months): the publication of these  benchmark settings  contributed  by  a  panel  of  banks  has permanently ceased as of 1/uni00A0January 2022;\n- LIBOR  GBP  and  JPY  (terms:  one,  three  and  six  months):  these p settings  have  not  been  contributed  by  a  panel  of  banks  since 1/uni00A0January  2022  and  are,  from  now  on,  published  in  a  synthetic form;  thus,  their  use  is  restricted  to  the  wind-down  of  legacy positions;\n- LIBOR USD (terms: overnight, one, three, six and twelve months): p the  cessation  of  the  publication  of  these  benchmark  settings contributed by a panel of banks is scheduled for end June/uni00A02023.\n\nBesides,  regarding  the  major  euro  area  interest  rate  benchmark indexes:\n\n- EURIBOR: EMMI (European Money Markets Institute), administrator p of the index, does not plan to cease its publication. The EURIBOR will thus be maintained in the coming years;\n- EONIA: Its publication ceased definitively on 3/uni00A0January 2022. The p successor  rate  recommended  by  the  European  Central  Bank working group on the euro area is the \u20acSTR on which the EONIA was based since end 2019.\n\nIn  parallel,  other  interest  rate  indexes  based  on  LIBOR  are  also subject to reform ( e.g. : SOR, MIFOR, THBFIX, ICE swap rate\u2026). Local regulators  or  administrators  continue  clarifying  the  roadmap  and issuing recommendations to reduce the risks associated with these transitions.\n\n## Impact of the reform for the Societe Generale Group\n\nThe Societe Generale Group supports these reforms and takes an active part in the working groups set up by the central banks of the currencies  concerned.  The  Group  is  actively  preparing  for  these changes,  through  specific  transition  program  put  in  place  in Summer 2018 and supervised by the Finance division.\n\n|\n\nAd hoc reports can also be produced. By way of illustration, the Group had  to  adapt  its  risk  management  system  from  the  start  of  the Covid-19  crisis  in  March  2020.  Governance  was  also  strengthened during  this  period  thanks  to  the  activation  of  cells  crisis  and  the implementation  of  dedicated  reports,  whether  intended  for  General Management, the Board of Directors or the supervisor, produced at a higher  frequency  and  including  indicators  adapted  to  the  context (monitoring of sectors of activity sensitive/weakened by the economic crisis,  business  continuity,  etc.).  This  crisis  mechanism  was  gradually eased in 2021.\n\nAdditional  information  on  risk  reporting  and  assessment  systems  by type of risk is also presented in the following chapters.\n\nFor this purpose, the Group has undertaken active awareness and communication  campaigns  for  its  customers,  supplemented  by  a monthly  newsletter  and  a  question  and  answer  kit  on  the  IBOR transition publicly available on the Societe Generale website.\n\nWith  the  cessation  deadlines  announced  for  LIBOR  and  EONIA  in mind, the public authorities and the working groups set up by the central  banks  issued  recommendations  to  the  industry.  These recommendations aim at stopping the production of new contracts referencing  these  indexes  as  well  as  at  migrating  the  existing contracts referencing said indexes to alternative benchmark rates.\n\nTo ensure a consistent approach throughout the Societe Generale group, an internal Committee has been formed. Its role is to issue periodical orientations reflecting the market trends and recommendations from regulators and their working groups. At the time  of  writing  of  this  note,  ten  internal  guidelines  have  been issued and cover three main themes:\n\n- strengthening  of  the  new  contracts  through  the  inclusion  of p fallback clauses and risk warnings;\n- cessation  of  the  production  of  new  transactions  referencing p LIBOR  and  EONIA  (with  some  exceptions  provided  for  by regulators on USD LIBOR) and use of alternative solutions;\n- fair  and  homogenous  treatment  of  customers  through  the p involvement  of  the  compliance  teams  in  the  renegotiations  of contracts.\n\nAt this stage, all directives are applied and widely circulated among the Group staff.\n\nIn  order  to  acquire  the  capacity  to  deal  on  products  referencing RFRs  and  thus  ensure  the  continuity  of  its  business  after  the disappearance  of  LIBOR  and  EONIA,  the  Societe  Generale  group updated its tools and processes in line with the major calculation methods  recommended  by  the  relevant  working  groups  or professional  associations.  Nevertheless,  the  Group  continues monitoring  the  developments  in  the  use  of  RFRs  and  other alternative rates in order to implement any new conventions and meet its customers' needs.",

        "page_content": "The  progressive  cessation  of  the  production  of  new  products indexed on LIBOR and EONIA started in Spring 2021 and the Societe Generale group has been offering to guide its customers towards alternative  solutions  since  then.  In  parallel,  the  Group  has introduced fallback clauses in line with the market standards in the new  contracts  that  remain  indexed  on  the  IBOR  indexes (EURIBOR/uni00A0included).\n\nIn 2021,  the  Group  focused  its  action  on  transitioning  its agreements  referencing  GBP  LIBOR,  CHF  LIBOR,  JPY  LIBOR,  and EUR LIBOR, as well as EONIA. This transition concerned in the first instance  the  customers  of  the  investment  banking  and  financing and advisory activities and, to a lesser extent, some customers of the  French  and  International  retail  networks.  Depending  on  the products, the transition has, overall, been carried out according to three major modalities:\n\n- loans  and  credit  lines  are  subject  to  individual  renegotiations, p together  with  the  related  hedging  instruments,  in  order  to maintain their effectiveness;\n- most  of  the  derivative  products  have  been  transitioned  at  the p instigation  of  the  clearing  houses  or  through  the  activation  of their fallback clauses (protocol set up by the ISDA and to which the  Societe  Generale  group  acceded  in  October/uni00A02020).  Some derivative products have, however, been renegotiated bilaterally;\n- lastly,  for  some  products  (typically:  cash  accounts  and  similar), p the transition has been done through an update of the general conditions.\n\n## RISK AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY\n\nIn  parallel,  the  Societe  Generale  group  ensured  that  transitional solutions  were  provided  regarding  the  few  issuances  having  an early  call  option  dependant  on  LIBOR  in  the  event  that  these options were not exercised, The only issuance directly indexed to JPY  LIBOR  rate  (ISIN  JP525016CF64)  has  been  switched  to  TONA RFR in December/uni00A02021 via a consent solicitation.\n\nAt the end of December/uni00A02021, the Societe Generale group considers that  it  has  achieved  more  than  99.5%  of  its  legal  transition programme regarding the contracts on indexes ending or ceasing to be representative at the end of 2021. The remainder corresponds mainly to contracts being renegotiated at that date and for which the  use  of  synthetic  LIBORs  will  allow  for  the  transition  at  the beginning of 2022.\n\nRegarding the contracts referencing the major terms of USD LIBOR, and due to their disappearance scheduled for end of June/uni00A02023, the Societe Generale group has not yet launched a massive transition of  its  current  stock  but  aims  at  completing  it  in  June/uni00A02023. However,  the  Group  offers  a  proactive  switch  to  alternative solutions  whenever  it  interacts  with  customers  and  supports customers wishing to opt in early in their transition process.\n\nThe table below presents an estimate of the exposures related to the contracts impacted by the benchmark reform and whose term is scheduled beyond the official cessation dates.\n\nThis table has been produced based on the project monitoring data and  on  the  legal  status  of  the  contracts  migration.  At  the  end  of January 2022, there were no significant exposures on the indexes ceasing to be representative as at 31 December 2021. \u25b2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

(4)\n- Only the major interest rate benchmarks impacted by the IBOR reform are presented in this table. The EURIBOR construction methodology was reformed in 2019 and (5) revised in 2020. Its cessation was announced neither by EMMI - its administrator - nor by ESMA - its regulator. Contracts exposed to this rate are therefore no longer presented in this table.\n\n## RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH RATE REFORM\n\nAudited I The  risks  related  to  the  IBOR  reform  are  now  mainly  limited  to  USD  LIBOR  for  the  period  running  until  June/uni00A02023.  They  remain managed and monitored within the governance framework dedicated to the IBOR transition. They have been identified as follows:\n\n- program  governance  and  execution  risk,  liable  to  cause  delays  and  loss  of  opportunities,  is  monitored  as  part  of  the  work  of  regular p Committees and arbitration bodies;\n- legal  documentation  risk,  liable  to  lead  to  post-transition  litigations,  is  managed  through  fallback  clauses  inserted  in  the  contracts p depending on the availability of market standards;\n- market risk, with the creation of a basis risk between the rate curves associated with the different indexes, is the subject of close monitoring p and supervision;\n- operational risks  in  the  execution  of  the  transition  of  transactions,  depending  in  particular  on  the  willingness  and  preparedness  of  our p counterparties, the volume of transactions to be migrated and their spread over time;\n- liquidity risk related to increased drawdowns in a context of increased credit costs; the relevance of the integration of this component into p the liquidity models will be assessed during the annual review of the drawdown models;\n- regulatory  risk  managed  according  to  the  Group  guidelines  which  are  in  line  with  the  recommendations  of  the  regulators  and  working p groups on the LIBOR transition; these guidelines concern the products which, by exception, continue referencing USD LIBOR;\n- misconduct risk, related to the end of LIBOR, notably managed through: p\n- specific guidelines detailed by business line, -\n- training of the teams, -\n- communications to customers (conferences, events, bilateral discussions in particular with the less informed customers) are organised -on the transition-related risks, the alternative solutions that may be implemented, and on how they could be affected. \u25b2\n\n|",

This  Order,  which  applies to all credit institutions and investment companies, defines the concept of internal control,  together  with  a  number  of  specific  requirements  relating  to the assessment and management of the various risks inherent in the activities  of  the  companies  in  question,  and  the  procedures  under which the supervisory body must assess and evaluate how the internal control is carried out.\n\nThe  Basel  Committee  has  defined  four  principles/uni00A0-/uni00A0independence, universality,  impartiality,  and  sufficient  resources/uni00A0-/uni00A0which  underpin the internal control carried out by credit institutions.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  ensures  that  Societe  Generale  has  a  solid governance system and a clear organisation ensuring:\n\n- a well-defined, transparent and coherent sharing of responsibilities; p\n- effective  procedures  for  the  detection,  management,  monitoring p and reporting of risks to which the Company could be exposed.\n\nThe Board tasks the Group's General Management with rolling out the Group's strategic guidelines to implement this set-up.\n\nThe  Audit  and  Internal  Control  Committee  is  a  Board  of  Directors' Committee that is specifically responsible for preparing the decisions of the Board in respect of internal control supervision.\n\nAs  such,  General  Management  submits  reports  to  the  Audit  and Internal Control Committee on the internal control of the Group. The Committee monitors the implementation of remediation plans when it considers the risk level to be justified.\n\nInternal control is based on a body of standards and procedures.\n\nAll  Societe  Generale  Group  activities  are  governed  by  rules  and procedures contained in a set of documents referred to collectively as the  'Standard  Guidelines',  compiled  in  the  Societe  Generale  Code, which:\n\n- set out the rules for action and behavior applicable to Group staff; p\n- define the structures of the businesses and the sharing of roles and p responsibilities;\n- describe the management rules and internal procedures specific to p each business and activity.\n\nThe  Societe  Generale  Code  groups  together  the  standard  guidelines which, in particular:\n\n- define the governance of the Societe Generale Group, the structures p and  duties  of  its  Business  Units  and  Services  Units,  as  well  as  the operating  principles  of  the  cross-business  systems  and  processes (Codes of Conduct, charters,/uni00A0etc.);\n\nThe Societe Generale Code has force of law within the Group and falls under the responsibility of the Group Corporate Secretary.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Societe  Generale  Code,  operating  procedures specific to each Group activity are applied. The rules and procedures in force are designed to follow basic rules of internal control, such as:\n\n- segregation of functions; p\n- immediate, irrevocable recording of all transactions; p\n- reconciliation of information from various sources. p\n\nMultiple  and  evolving  by  nature,  risks  are  present  in  all  business processes. Risk management and control systems are therefore key to the Bank's ability to meet its targets.\n\nThe  internal  control  system  is  represented  by  all  methods  which ensure  that  the  operations  carried  out  and  the  organisation  and procedures implemented comply with:\n\n- legal and regulatory provisions; p\n- professional and ethical practices; p\n- the  internal  rules  and  guidelines  defined  by  the  Company's p management body of the undertaking in its executive function.\n\nInternal control in particular aims to:\n\n- prevent malfunctions; p\n- assess  the  risks  involved,  and  exercise  sufficient  control  to  ensure p they are managed;\n- ensure  the  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  internal  processes, p particularly those which help safeguard assets;\n- detect irregularities; p\n- guarantee  the  reliability,  integrity  and  availability  of  financial  and p management information;\n- check the quality of information and communication systems. p\n\nThe internal control system is based on five basic principles:\n\n- the comprehensive scope of the controls, which cover all risk types p and apply to all the Group's entities;\n- the individual responsibility of each employee and each manager in p managing  the  risks  they  take  or  supervise,  and  in  overseeing  the operations they handle or for which they are responsible;\n- the  responsibility  of  functions,  in  line  with  their  expertise  and p independence, in defining normative controls and, for three of them, exercising second-level permanent control;\n- the  proportionality  of  the  controls  to  the  materiality  of  the  risks p involved;\n- the independence of internal auditing. p\n- set out the operating framework of an activity and the management p principles  and  rules  applicable  to  products  and  services  rendered, and also define internal procedures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This department performs periodic internal audits  that  are  strictly  independent  of  the  business  lines  and  the permanent control function;\n- internal control coordination, which falls under the responsibility p of  a  Deputy Chief Executive Officer for the year 2021 and the Chief Executive Officer from 2022, is also provided at Group level and is rolled out in each of the departments and core businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  for  2021  and  the  Chief  Executive Officer  from  2022  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  overall  consistency and effectiveness of the internal control system.\n\nThe Group Internal Control Coordination Committee is responsible for providing  a  consolidated  overview  of  the  Group's  internal  control framework, assessing its effectiveness, completeness and consistency, taking corrective measures, and monitoring their implementation.\n\nIt  is  chaired  by  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  for  2021  and  the Chief Executive Officer from 2022 and comprises the Chief Risk Officer, the  Chief  Financial  Officer,  the  Group  Chief  Compliance  Officer,  the Group Chief Information Officer, the Head of Group Internal Audit, and the Head of Internal Control Coordination.\n\nThe Group Internal Control Coordination Committee met nine/uni00A0times in 2021. It addressed the following issues:\n\n- review  of  the  effectiveness  and  consistency  of  the  Group  internal p control framework;\n- review  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  permanent  control  in  the  Risk, p Compliance and Finance Service Units, as well as the ability of the Risk and Compliance functions to exercise their role as the Second Line of defence for the Group;\n- review of the Group quarterly permanent control dashboard prior to p its communication  to  the  Group  Audit  and  Internal  Control Committee (CACI);\n- cross-business  review  of  cybersecurity  controls  and  outsourced p activities controls.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "The  Supervisory  Internal  Control  Coordination  Committee  (SICCC) performs the regular review of the internal control framework and of risks  of  every  second  BU/SU,  assessing  it  in  terms  of  efficiency, consistency and completeness, taking corrective actions and monitoring their implementation.\n\nIt  is  chaired  by  the  representative  of  General  Management  (Chief Executive  Officer  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  or  Deputy  General Manager) in charge of the area under review and brings together the Heads of the second line of defence (CPLE, DFIN, RISQ), the Head of the Group's  Information  Systems  (RESG),  the  Head  of  the  third  line  of defence  (IGAD),  the  Head  of  the  Permanent  Control  Framework  and the Coordination of Internal Control (DGLE/PIC), as well as the Heads Business  Units  and  Service  Units  concerned  with  the  agenda  and transversal functions according to the agenda.\n\nThe  organisation  implemented  at  Group  level  to  coordinate  the actions of the various participants in internal control is coordinated in each Business Unit (BU) and Service Unit (SU). All of the Group's BUs and SUs have an Internal Control Coordination Committee. Chaired by the Head of the Business Unit or the Service Unit, these Committees bring together the competent Heads of Internal Audit and Permanent Control for the Business Unit and Service Unit in question, as well as the Head of Group Internal Control Coordination and the Heads of the Group-level control functions.\n\n## Permanent control system\n\nThe Group's permanent control system comprises:\n\n- the first-level permanent control, which is the basis of the Group's p permanent control, is performed by the businesses. Its purpose is to ensure  the  security,  quality,  regularity  and  validity  of  transactions completed at operational level;\n- the second-level permanent control, which is independent of the p businesses  and  concerns  three  departments, i.e. the  Compliance, Risk and Finance Departments.\n\nIn 2018, General Management initiated a transformation programme of the  Group's  permanent  control  system,  which  is  under  its  direct supervision.  Through  a  set  of  actions  focusing  on  areas  such  as standards,  methods,  tools,  procedures  and  training,  the  programme served  to  consolidate  the  control  culture  and  optimise  risk  control, and  thus  helps  to  improve  the  quality  and  the  reliability  of  services provided to our customers and partners. In 2021, this programme has been finalised and closed, and the transfer of the long-term activities to operating teams has been completed.\n\n## FIRST-LEVEL PERMANENT CONTROL\n\nPermanent Level/uni00A01  controls,  carried  out  on  operations  performed  by BUs and the SUs, ensure the security and quality of transactions and the  operations.  These  controls  are  defined  as  a  set  of  provisions constantly implemented to ensure the regularity, validity, and security of the operations carried out at operational level.\n\nThe permanent Level/uni00A01 controls consist of:\n\n- any  combination  of  actions  and/or  devices  that  may  limit  the p likelihood of a risk occurring or reduce the consequences for the Company: these  include  controls  carried  out  on  a  regular  and permanent basis by the businesses or by automated systems during the  processing  of  transactions,  automated  or  non-automated security rules and controls that are part of transaction processing, or controls  included  in  operational  procedures.  Also  falling  into  this category  are  the  organisational  arrangements  ( e.g. ,  segregation  of duties) or governance,  training  actions,  when  they  directly contribute to controlling certain risks;\n\n- controls  performed  by  managers: line  managers  control  the p correct functioning of the devices for which they are responsible. As such,  they  must  apply  formal  procedures  on  a  regular  basis  to ensure that employees comply with rules and procedures, and that Level/uni00A01 controls are carried out effectively.\n\nDefined  by  a  Group  entity  within  its  scope,  Level/uni00A01  controls  include controls/uni00A0(automated or manual)  that  are integrated into the processing  of  operations,  proximity  controls  included  in  operating procedures, safety rules,/uni00A0etc. They are carried out in the course of their daily  activities  by  agents  directly  in  charge  of  an  activity  or  by  their managers. These controls aim to:\n\n- ensure the proper enforcement of existing procedures and control of p all risks related to processes, transactions and/or accounts;\n- alert management in the event of identified anomalies or malfunctions. p\n\nPermanent Level/uni00A01  controls are set by management and avoid, as far as  possible,  situations  of  self-assessment.  They  are  defined  in  the procedures and must be traced without necessarily being formalised, e.g. preventive automated controls that reject transations that do not comply with system-programmed rules.\n\nIn  order  to  coordinate  the  operational  risk  management  system  and the permanent Level/uni00A01  control  system,  the  BUs/SUs deploy a specific department called CORO (Controls/uni00A0&/uni00A0Operational Risks Office Department).\n\n## SECOND-LEVEL PERMANENT CONTROL\n\nThe permanent Level/uni00A02 control ensures that the Level/uni00A01 control works properly:\n\n- the scope  includes  all  permanent  Level/uni00A01 checks,  including p managerial supervision checks and checks carried out by dedicated teams;\n- this  review  and  these  audits  aim  to  give  an  opinion  on  (i)  the p effectiveness of Level/uni00A01 controls, (ii) the quality of their implementation,  (iii)  their  relevance  (including,  in  terms  of  risk prevention),  (iv)  the  definition  of  their  modus  operandi,  (v)  the relevance of remediation plans implemented  following  the detection of anomalies, and the quality of their follow-up, and thus contribute to the evaluation of the effectiveness of Level/uni00A01 controls.\n\nThe permanent level/uni00A02 control, control of the controls, is carried out by teams independent of the operational.\n\nThese controls are performed centrally by dedicated teams within Risk Service  Unit  (RISQ/CTL),  Compliance  Service  Unit  (CPLE/CTL)  and Finance Service Unit (DFIN/CTL) and locally by the second-level control teams within the BU/SUs or entities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

To fulfill its mandate,  the  Group's  IGAD  Service  Unit  has  adequate resources from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. The Group's Inspection and Audit Service Unit has about 1,100/uni00A0employees.\n\nThe Group Head of Inspection and Audit reports directly to the Group Chief  Executive  Officer,  with  whom  it  holds  regular  meetings.  The Group Head of Inspection and Audit meets regularly with the Chairman of  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Audit  and  Internal  Control  Committee and  the  Risk  Committee  refer  to  the  Group  Head  of  Inspection  and Audit  on  their  initiative  or  at  his  request  on  any  subject.  The  Group Head  of  Inspection  and  Audit  participates  in  the  Internal  Control Committee  and  the  Risk  Committee  meetings.  Moreover,  bilateral meetings are held as needed between the Group Head of Inspection and Audit and the chairpersons of these Committees.\n\nThe  Inspection  and  Audit  Service  Unit  (IGAD)  is  part  of  the  Group's internal control framework. IGAD carries out an internal audit mandate through its missions. In its role as the third line of defence, it is strictly independent from the Group's business units and permanent control functions.\n\nIn  line  with  standards  set  by  the/uni00A0IIA  (Institute  of  Internal  Auditors), IGAD's  internal  audit  mandate  is  defined  as  an  independent  and objective  activity  that  provides  the  Group  with  assurance  as  to  how effectively  it  is  controlling  its  operations,  advises  on  improvements and  contributes  to  the  creation  of  added  value.  By  carrying  out  this mandate, Inspection and Internal Audit help the Group to achieve its targets by evaluating systematically and methodically its processes for risk  management,  control  and  corporate  governance  and  making recommendations to increase their efficiency.\n\nThe  Inspection  and  Audit  Service  Unit  exercises  a  key  role  in  the Group's risk management set-up and can assess any of its components.\n\nUnder this mandate, the General Inspection and Internal Audit assess (i)  the  quality  of  risk  management  within  an  audited  scope,  (ii)  the permanent control framework is adequately structured and effective, (iii) management's risk awareness and compliance with conduct rules and expected professional practices.\n\n|\n\nWhilst  Audit  Departments  perform  solely  an  internal  audit  role, General Inspection has, in addition to its internal audit role, a mandate to  undertake  other  assignments  such  as  any  type  of  analysis  or research,  be  involved  in  the  assessment  of  strategic  projects  or intervene on specific subjects as requested by General Management. Such  assignments,  limited  with  regards  to  resources  dedicated  to them,  are  carried  out  within  a  framework  ensuring  that  ethical principles  defined  in  Institute  of  Internal  Auditors'  Standards  are being/uni00A0met.\n\nThe  General  Inspection  also  supervises  the  rollout  of  data-analysis initiatives  within  the  scope  of  Inspection  and  Audit  activities.  This mission  is  ensured via a  dedicated  data-lab  (INS/DAT),  under  the responsibility of an Inspection Managing Director (Inspecteur principal) . The General Inspection also supervises and coordinates the Service Unit's relationship with regulators.\n\nIGAD centrally has six distinct Audit Departments. Each of these Audit Departments  is  placed  under  the  supervision  of  a  Head  of  internal Audit  responsible  for  the  auditing  on  a  specific  scope  of  activities.  A matrix organisation allows coverage of the main cross-business issues at  Group  level.  In  France,  the  Internal  Audit  teams  are  hierarchically linked  to  the  Inspection  unit.  Audit  Department  heads  based  in branches  or  affiliates  overseas  report  to  the  local  entity's  head. However, in their internal audit role they report directly to the Internal Audit Head in charge of their region or entity.\n\nInspection  and  Audit  teams  work  together  on  an  annual  risk assessment to define the Inspection and Audit plans for the upcoming year. IGAD teams regularly work together on joint assignments. They issue recommendations to correct issues identified in risk management and generally improve operations and risk management. IGAD  teams  are  subsequently  in  charge  of  monitoring  the  effective implementation of these recommendations.",

The Audit and Internal Control Committee's remit also is to monitor the independence of the Statutory Auditors, and the effectiveness of the internal control, measurement,  supervision  and  control  systems  for  risk  related  to the accounting and financial processes. The Statutory Auditors meet with the Audit and Internal Control Committee during the course of their assignment;\n- the Group  Finance  Department gathers  the  accounting  and p management  data  compiled  by  the  subsidiaries  and  the  Business Units/Services Units in a set of standardised reports. It consolidates and  verifies  this  information  so  that  it  can  be  used  in  the  overall management  of  the  Group  and  disclosed  to  third  parties (supervisory bodies, investors,/uni00A0etc.). It also has a team in charge of the preparation of the Group regulatory reports;\n\nIn the framework of these missions, it is in charge of:\n\n- monitoring the financial aspects of the Group's capital -transactions and its financial structure,\n- managing  its  assets  and  liabilities,  and  consequently  defining, -managing  and  controlling  the  Group's  financial  position  and structural risks,\n- ensuring that the regulatory financial ratios are respected, -\n- defining  accounting  and  regulatory  standards,  frameworks, -principles and procedures for the Group, and ensuring that they are observed,\n- verifying  the  accuracy  of  all  financial  and  accounting  data -published by the Group;\n- the Finance Departments of subsidiaries and Business p Units/Services Units carry out certification of the accounting data and entries booked by the back offices and of the management data submitted by the front offices. They are accountable for the financial statements  and  regulatory  information  required  at  the  local  level and  submit  reports  (accounting  data,  finance  control,  regulatory reports,  etc.)  to  the  Group  Finance  Department.  They  can  perform these activities on their own or else delegate their tasks to Shared Service  Centres  operating  in  finance  and  placed  under  Group Finance Department governance;\n- the Risk Department consolidates the risk monitoring data from the p Group's  Business  Units/Services  Units  and  subsidiaries  in  order  to control credit, market and operational risks. This information is used in  Group  communications  to  the  Group's  governing  bodies  and  to third  parties.  Furthermore,  it  ensures  in  collaboration  with  the Group  Finance  Department,  its  expert  role  on  the  dimensions  of credit  risk,  structural  liquidity  risks,  rates,  exchange  rates,  on  the issues  of  recovery  and  resolution  and  the  responsibility  of  certain closing processes, notably the production of solvency ratios;\n- the Back offices are  responsible  for  all  support  functions  to  front p offices  and  ensure  contractual  settlements  and  deliveries.  Among other  responsibilities,  they  check  that  financial  transactions  are economically  justified,  book  transactions  and  manage  means of/uni00A0payment.\n\n## Accounting and regulatory standards\n\nLocal  financial  statements  are  drawn  up  in  accordance  with  local accounting standards, and the consolidated Group financial statements are prepared in accordance with the standards defined by the Group Finance Department , which are based on IFRS as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe  applicable  standards  on  solvency  and  liquidity,  promulgated  by the Basel Committee, were translated into European law by a directive (CRD4)  and  a  regulation  (CRR).  They  were  rounded  out  by  the Regulation CRR2 and the Directive CRD5 which entered into force on 28/uni00A0June 2019. These texts are supplemented by several delegated acts and  implementation  technical  standards.  As  the  Societe  Generale Group  is  identified  as  a  'financial  conglomerate',  it  is  subjected  to additional supervision.\n\nThe Group Finance Department has dedicated teams that monitor the applicable standards and draft new internal standards to comply with any changes in the accounting and regulatory framework.\n\n## Procedures for producing financial and accounting data\n\nEach entity in  the  consolidation  scope  of  the  Group  prepares  its  own accounting  and  management  statements  on  a  monthly  basis.  This information  is  then  consolidated  each  month  at  Group  level  and published  for  the  markets  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Data  reported  are subject  to  analytical  reviews  and  consistency  checks  performed  by Finance  Department  or  delegated  to  financial  shared  service  centres acting  under  their  responsibility  and  sent  to  the  Group  Finance Department. The Group Finance Department forwards the consolidated financial statements, Management Reports and regulatory statements to General Management and any interested third parties.\n\nIn practice, procedures have been tailored to the growing complexity of  products  and  regulations.  Moreover,  specific  adaptation  action plans can be implemented where necessary.\n\n## Internal control procedures governing the production of financial and accounting data\n\nAccounting data are compiled independently of the front offices and the sales teams.\n\nThe quality  and  objectivity  of  the  accounting  and  management  data are ensured by the separation of sales functions and all the functions of operational processing and follow-up of the operations: back offices and middle offices integrated into Resources Department and teams in charge of result production integrated into Finance Department. These teams carry out a series of controls defined by Group procedures on financial and accounting data, in particular:\n\n- verification of the economic justification of all information reported; p\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

It  performs  checks  to guarantee the accuracy of the information disclosed.\n\nThe  data  received  for  consolidation  from  each  subsidiary  are  drawn from  corporate  accounting  data  by  the  subsidiaries  after  they  have been locally brought into compliance with Group accounting principles.\n\nEach  subsidiary  must  be  able  to  explain  the  transition  from  the Company  financial  statements  to  the  financial  statements  reported through the consolidation tool.\n\nThe Finance Departments of the Business Units/Services Units have a dedicated department for financial management and control.\n\n## CONTROL BY THE FINANCIAL SHARED SERVICE CENTRES\n\nFinancial  shared  service  centres  perform  the  first-level  controls necessary  to  ensure  the  reliability  of  accounting,  tax  and  regulatory information  on  the  financial  statements  they  produce  in  accordance with  local  and  IFRS  standards  and  notably  data  quality  and consistency  checks  (equity,  securities,  foreign  exchange,  financial aggregates from the balance sheet and income statement, deviations from  standards),  justification  and  certification  of  the  financial statements under their responsibility, intercompany reconciliation of the financial statements, regulatory statement checks and verification of evidence of tax charges and balances (current, deferred and duties).\n\nThese controls are declared as part of the managerial supervision and Group accounting certification processes.\n\nThese  controls  allow  the  Shared  Services  Centres  to  provide  all necessary  information  to  the  Finance  Departments  of  Business Units/Services Units and the Group Finance and Accounting Department to ensure the reliability and consistency of the accounts prepared.\n\n## SUPERVISION BY THE GROUP FINANCE DEPARTMENT\n\nOnce  the  financial  statements  prepared  by  the  entities  have  been restated according to Group standards, they are entered into a central database and processed to produce the consolidated statements.\n\nThe service in charge of consolidation in the Group Accounting Officer Department  checks  that  the  consolidation  scope  complies  with  the applicable  accounting  standards  and  performs  multiple  checks  on data received for consolidation purposes. These checks include:\n\n- confirmation that the data collected are properly aggregated; p\n- verification of recurring and non-recurring consolidation entries; p\n- exhaustive treatment of critical points in the consolidation process; p\n- treatment of any residual differences in reciprocal or intercompany p statements.\n\nLast,  this  service  ensures  that  the  overall  consolidation  process  has been  conducted  properly  by  performing  analytical  reviews  of  the summary data and verifying the consistency of the main aggregates of the  financial  statements.  Changes  in  shareholders'  equity,  goodwill, provisions  and  any  deferred  taxes  consolidated  in  the  fiscal  year  are also analysed.\n\nA team in this department is in charge of managing and coordinating the  quarterly  Group  accounting  certification  framework  to  certify first-level controls on a quarterly basis (internal control certification).\n\nThe Group Finance Department has also a dedicated team, it which is responsible  for  ensuring  second-level  permanent  controls  on  all Finance  processes  and  for  implementing  the  framework  within  the Group. Its mission is to ensure the effectiveness, quality and relevance of  the  Level/uni00A01  control  framework  by  assessing  it  through  process  or activity  reviews,  testing  controls  and  quarterly  certifications.  The team, reporting directly to the Group Finance Department, also reports to  the  Head  of  Permanent  &  Internal  Control  Division  of  Societe Generale Group.\n\n|",

The  majority  of  these  provisions  entered into force in June 2021.\n\nThe amendments include:\n\n- NSFR: The text introduces the regulatory requirements for the NSFR p ratio. A ratio of 100% must now be respected from June 2021;\n- Leverage  ratio:  the  minimum  requirement  of  3%  to  which  will  be p added, from 2023, 50% of the buffer required as a systemic institution;\n- Derivatives counterparty risk (SA-CCR): the \"SA-CCR\" method is the p Basel  method  replacing  the  \"CEM\"  method  for  determining prudential exposure to derivatives in a standard approach;\n- Large  Risks:  the  main  change  is  the  calculation  of  the  regulatory p limit  (25%)  on  Tier  1  (instead  of  total  own  funds),  as  well  as  the introduction of a specific cross-limit on systemic institutions (15%);\n- TLAC:  The  ratio  requirement  for  G-SIBs  is  introduced  in  CRR.  In p accordance with the Basel text, G-SIBs must respect an amount of own  funds  and  eligible  debt  equal  at  the  most  between 16%+weighted risk capital buffers and 6% of leverage exposure in 2019,  with  the  ratio  increasing  to  18%+risk-weighted  buffers  and 6.75% leverage in 2022.\n\nWith regard to the implementation of the market risk reform (FRTB), after the publication of the first revised standard in January 2016 and of the consultation in March 2018 on this subject, the Basel Committee published in January 2019 its final text: BCBS457. In March 2020, the Basel Committee announced a one-year delay in the implementation of  FRTB  (1  January  2023  instead  of  1  January  2022  as  originally planned in the January 2019 text).\n\nThe European FRTB calendar would be as follows:\n\n- regarding reporting requirements: p\n- the Standardised Approach (SA) has been effective since Q3 2021, -\n- for  the  Internal  Model  Approach  (IMA),  reporting  should  start -three  years  after  the  publication  in  the  Official  Journal  of  the European Union (OJEU) of three technical standards (RTS) of the EBA, which are expected for Q1 2022;\n- the capital requirements for FRTB: a two-year postponement (i.e. to p 1 January 2027) could be applied in the event of unlevel playing field with the United States.\n\nIn December 2017, the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the Basel Committee's oversight body, endorsed the regulatory reforms aiming to complete Basel 3.\n\nA first version of the transposition text was published by the European Commission  on  27  October  2021  ('CRR3  -  CRD6')  and  will  serve  as support for the European Trialogue. The text will then have to be voted on by Parliament to become applicable.\n\nThese  new  rules,  which  were  to  take  effect  from  2022,  have  been postponed  to  January  2025  with  an  overall  output  floor:  the risk-weighted  assets  (RWA)  will  be  floored  to  a  percentage  of  the standard  method  (credit,  market  and  operational).  The  output  floor level will increase gradually, from 50% in 2025 to 72.5% in 2030.\u25b2\n\nIn  the  face  of  the  health  crisis  and  of  its  economic  and  financial consequences,  a  number  of  measures  have  been  taken  by  the supervisory and regulatory authorities in 2020. Some of them are still in force. For example, the ECB announced the possibility of operating below the conservation cushion (CCB), as well as the countercyclical (CCyB) and the Systemic Risk Buffer (0% in France) cushions.\n\nMoreover,  the  European  Parliament  and  the  Council  reached  an agreement through the CRR 'quick fix' regulation, implemented as of 30  June  2020  part  of  whose  provisions  consisted  in  anticipating  the implementation  of  CRR2/CRD5  measures  that  improve  banks'  CET1 capital.  The  \"quick  fix\"  has  postponed  the  implementation  of  the leverage buffer (0.5% for the Group) from 1 January 2022 to 1 January 2023 to be in line with the recommendation of the Basel Committee.\n\nIn 2021, the level of additional capital requirements in respect of Pillar 2  (P2R  or  'Pillar  2  Requirement'),  effective  since  1  March  2019, remained  at  1.75%.  In  2022,  the  European  Central  Bank  notified  the level  of  requirement  in  respect  of  P2R  (Pillar  2  Requirement)  for Societe Generale, which will apply from 1 March 2022. This level stands at  2.12%,  including  the  additional  requirement  regarding  Pillar  2 prudential  expectations  on  the  provisioning  of  non-performing  loans granted before 26 April 2019.\n\nDetailed information on the G-SIB requirements and other prudential information  are  available  on  the  Group  website,  www.societe generale.com.\n\nThroughout 2021, Societe Generale complied with the minimum ratio requirements applicable to its activities.\n\n|",

These regulatory indicators are supplemented  by  an  assessment  of  the  coverage  of  internal  capital needs by available CET1 capital, thus confirming the relevance of the targets set in the risk appetite. In addition, this assessment takes into account  the  constraints  arising  from  the  other  metrics  of  the  risk appetite, such as rating, MREL, TLAC and leverage ratio.\n\n## RISK AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY\n\nAll these indicators are measured on a forward-looking basis in relation to their target on a quarterly or even monthly basis for the current year. During the preparation of the financial plan, they are also assessed on an annual basis over a minimum of three-year horizon according to a baseline and adverse scenarios, in order to demonstrate the resilience of  the  bank's  business  model  against  adverse  macroeconomic  and financial environments. Capital adequacy is continuously monitored by the General Management and by the Board of Directors as part of the Group's corporate governance process and is reviewed in depth during the  preparation of the financial plan. It  ensures  that  the  bank  always complies  with  its  financial  target  with  a  buffer  above  the  'Maximum Distributable Amount' (MDA) threshold.\n\nIn addition, the Group maintains a balanced capital allocation among its three strategic core businesses:\n\n- French Retail Banking; p\n- International Retail Banking and Financial Services; p\n- Global Banking and Investor Solutions. p\n\nEach  of  the  Group's  core  businesses  accounts  for  around  a  third  of total  Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA), with a predominance of credit risk (84% of total Group RWA, including counterparty credit risk).\n\nAt  31  December  2021,  Group  RWA  were  up  3%  to  EUR  363  billion, compared with EUR 352 billion at end-December 2020.\n\nThe  evolution  of  the  business  lines'  RWA  lies  at  the  core  of  the operational management of the Group's capital trajectory based on a detailed understanding of the vectors of variations. Where appropriate,  the  General  Management  may  decide,  upon  a  proposal from  the  Finance  Department,  to  implement  managerial  actions  to increase  or  reduce  the  share  of  the  business  lines,  for  instance  by validating  the  execution  of  synthetic  securitisation  or  of  disposals  of performing or non-performing portfolios.\n\n## SCOPE OF APPLICATION - PRUDENTIAL SCOPE 4.4.3\n\nThe Group's prudential reporting scope includes all fully consolidated entities, with the exception of insurance entities, which are subject to separate capital supervision.\n\nAll  regulated  entities  of  the  Group  comply  with  their  prudential commitments on an individual basis.\n\nNon-regulated entities outside of the scope of prudential consolidation are subject to periodic reviews, at least annually.\n\nThe following table provides the main differences between the accounting scope (consolidated Group) and the prudential scope (Banking Regulation requirements).\n\nTABLE 2: DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACCOUNTING SCOPE AND PRUDENTIAL REPORTING SCOPE\n\n| Type of entity                                   | Accounting treatment   | Prudential treatment       |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Entities with a finance activity                 | Full consolidation     | Full consolidation         |\n| Entities with an Insurance activity              | Full consolidation     | Equity method              |\n| Holdings with a finance activity by nature       | Equity method          | Equity method              |\n| Joint ventures with a finance activity by nature | Equity method          | Proportional consolidation |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Regulated financial entities and affiliates outside of Societe Generale's prudential consolidation  scope  are  all  in  compliance  with  their  respective solvency  requirements.  As  a  general  principle,  all  banks  should  be subject  to  double  supervision,  on  a  standalone  basis  and  on  a consolidated  basis  but  the  CRR  allows,  under  specific  conditions, waivers from the requirements on an individual basis granted by the competent authorities.\n\nThe supervisory authority accepted that some Group entities may be exempted  from  the  application  of  prudential  requirements  on  an individual  basis  or,  where  applicable,  on  a  sub-consolidated  basis. Terms  and  conditions  of  waiver  of  requirements  granted  by supervisors include a commitment to provide these subsidiaries with the Group's support to ensure their overall solvency and liquidity, as well  as  a  commitment  to  ensure  that  they  are  managed  prudently according to the applicable banking regulations.\n\nThe  conditions  for  applying  waivers  regarding  monitoring  on  an individual  basis  for  a  Parent  Institution,  as  far  as  solvency  and  large exposure  ratios  are  concerned,  are  defined  by  the  CRR,  which stipulates that two conditions have to be met:\n\n- there  is  no  significant  obstacle,  in  law  or  in  fact,  current  or p anticipated,  to  the  prompt  transfer  of  equity  capital  or  the  rapid repayment of liabilities to the Parent Institution in a Member State;\n- the risk assessment, measurement and control procedures that are p useful for the purposes of supervision on a consolidated basis cover the Parent Institution in a Member State.\n\nAccordingly,  for  instance,  Societe  Generale  SA  is  not  subject  to prudential requirements on an individual basis.\n\nAny transfer of equity or repayment of liabilities between the parent company and its entities is carried out in compliance with capital and liquidity requirements that are locally applicable.\n\n|",

They rank junior to all other obligations of the  Bank,  including  undated  and  dated  subordinated  debt,  and senior only to common stock shareholders;\n- Societe Generale may elect, on a discretionary basis, not to pay the p interest and coupons linked to these instruments. This compensation is paid out of distributable items;\n- they  include  neither  a  step-up  in  compensation  nor  any  other p incentive to redeem;\n- they must have a loss-absorbing capacity; p\n- they  might  be  haircut  or  converted  when  in  resolution  or p independently of a resolution measurement;\n- subject to the prior approval of the European Central Bank, Societe p Generale  has  the  option  to  redeem  these  instruments  at  certain dates, but no earlier than five years after their issuance date.\n\nDeductions of Additional Tier/uni00A01 capital essentially apply to the following:\n\n- AT1 hybrid treasury shares; p\n- holding of AT1 hybrid shares issued by financial sector entities; p\n- minority  interests  beyond  the  minimum  T1  requirement  in  the p entities concerned.\n\n## Tier 2 capital\n\nTier/uni00A02 capital includes:\n\n- undated deeply subordinated notes (1) ; p\n- dated subordinated notes; p\n- any positive difference between the sum of value adjustments and p impairment  losses  on  customer  loans  and  receivables  exposures managed under the IRB approach and expected losses, up to 0.6% of total credit RWA under the IRB approach;\n- value  adjustments  for  credit  risk  related  to  collective  impairment p losses on customer loans and receivables exposures managed under the standardised approach, up to 1.25% of total credit RWA.\n\nDeductions of Tier/uni00A02 capital essentially apply to the following:\n\n- Tier/uni00A02 hybrid treasury shares; p\n- holding of Tier/uni00A02 hybrid shares issued by financial sector entities; p\n- minority interests beyond the minimum capital requirement in the p entities concerned.\n\nAll capital  instruments  and  their  features  are  detailed  online ( www.societegenerale.com/en/measuring-our-performance/informationand-publications/registration-documents ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

They  are  expressed  as  a percentage  of  RWA  and  according  to  the  split  of  own  funds  i.e.: Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 (T1) or Total Capital (TC).\n\nEach  quarter,  the  ratios  are  calculated  following  the  accounting closing and then compared to the supervisory requirements.\n\nThe Pillar 1 regulatory minimum capital requirement is set at 4.5% for CET1, 6% for T1 and 8% for TC. This minimum remains stable over time.\n\nThe  minimum  Pillar  2  requirement  (P2R)  is  set  by  the  supervisor following the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). It has stood at 1.75% since 1 March 2019 and until 28 February 2022. From 1 March  2022,  this  level  will  stand  at  2.12%,  including  the  additional requirement  regarding  Pillar  2  prudential  expectations  on  the provisioning of non-performing loans granted before 26 April 2019.\n\nIn addition to these requirements comes the overall buffer requirement which is the sum of:\n\n- the  mean  of  the  countercyclical  buffer  rates  of  each  country, p weighted by the relevant credit risk exposures in these countries. As of 1 January 2022, Societe Generale's countercyclical buffer is equal to 0.04%;\n- the  conservation  buffer  in  force  since  1  January  2016  with  a p maximum level standing at 2.50% since 1 January 2019;\n- the  Group's  G-SIB  buffer  imposed  by  the  Financial  Stability  Board p (FSB), which is equal to 1%.\n\nAs  at  1  January  2022,  taking  into  account  the  combined  regulatory buffers, the phased-in CET1 ratio level that would trigger the Maximum Distributable Amount (MDA) mechanism stands at 9.02%. It will stand at 9.23% from 1 March 2022.\n\n|                                                   | 01.03.2022   | 01.01.2022   | 01.01.2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Minimum requirement for Pillar/uni00A01           | 4.50%        | 4.50%        | 4.50%        |\n| Minimum requirement for Pillar/uni00A02 (P2R) (1) | 1.19%        | 0.98%        | 0.98%        |\n| Minimum requirement for countercyclical buffer    | 0.04%        | 0.04%        | 0.04%        |\n| Minimum requirement for conservation buffer       | 2.50%        | 2.50%        | 2.50%        |\n| Minimum requirement for systemic buffer           | 1.00%        | 1.00%        | 1.00%        |\n| Minimum requirement for CET1 ratio                | 9.23%        | 9.02%        | 9.02%        |\n\n- As per article 104a of the CRD5 directive, a minimum of 56% of P2R add-on has to be covered by CET1 capital (instead of 100% previously) and 75% by Tier 1 capital.

The  phased-in  ratio\n\n## LEVERAGE RATIO 4.4.7\n\nThe  Group  calculates  its  leverage  ratio  according  to  the  CRR2  rules applicable since June 2021 (except those regarding G-SIBs expected to be applicable from January 2023).\n\nManaging  the  leverage  ratio  means  both  calibrating  the  amount  of Tier/uni00A01  capital  (the  numerator of the ratio) and controlling the Group's leverage exposure (the denominator of the ratio) to achieve the target ratio  levels  that  the  Group  sets  for  itself.  To  this  end,  the  leverage exposure of the different businesses is monitored by the Finance/uni00A0Department.\n\n- market  risk  accounted  for  3%  of  RWA  (of  which  99%  for  Global p Banking and Investor Solutions);\n- operational risk accounted for 13% of RWA (of which 65% for Global p Banking and Investor Solutions).\n\nstands at 31.1% of RWA when considering the possibility to account for senior  preferred  debts  up  to  2.5%  of  RWA  and  9.5%  of  leverage exposure.\n\nThe  Minimum  Requirement  for  own  funds  and  Eligible  Liabilities (MREL) has applied to credit institutions and investment firms within the European Union since 2016.\n\nContrary to the TLAC ratio, the MREL is tailored to each institution and regularly revised by the resolution authority.\n\nThroughout 2021, Societe Generale complied with its MREL requirement.\n\nThe  Group  aims  to  maintain  a  consolidated  leverage  ratio  that  is significantly  higher  than  the  3.5%  minimum  set  in  the  Basel Committee's  recommendations,  transposed  in  Europe via CRR2, including  a  fraction  of  the  systemic  buffer  which  is  applicable  to the/uni00A0Group.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the leverage ratio of Societe Generale stood at  4.9%,  considering  a  Tier  1  capital  amount  of  EUR  57.9  billion compared with a leverage exposure of EUR 1,189 billion (versus 4.8% at  31  December  2020,  with  EUR  56.2  billion  and  EUR  1,179  billion respectively).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

As such, Societe Generale must not have any exposure towards a single beneficiary which exceeds 25% of the Group's capital.\n\nThe final rules of the Basel Committee on large exposures, transposed in  Europe via CRR2, have been applicable since June 2021. The main\n\nchanges compared with CRR reside in the calculation of the regulatory limit (25%), henceforth expressed as a proportion of Tier 1 (instead of cumulated Tier 1 and Tier 2), and in the introduction of a cross-specific limit on systemic institutions (15%).\n\n## FINANCIAL CONGLOMERATE RATIO 4.4.9\n\nThe Societe Generale group, also identified as a 'Financial conglomerate', is subject to additional supervision from the ECB.\n\nAt  31  December  2021,  Societe  Generale's  financial  conglomerate equity  covered  the  solvency  requirements  for  both  banking  and insurance activities.\n\nAt 30 June 2021, the financial conglomerate ratio was 151%, consisting of a numerator 'Own funds of the Financial Conglomerate' of EUR 76.1 billion,  and  a  denominator  'Regulatory  requirement  of  the  Financial Conglomerate' of EUR 50.5 billion.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the financial conglomerate ratio was 153%, consisting of a numerator 'Own funds of the Financial Conglomerate' of EUR 75.1 billion, and a denominator 'Regulatory requirement of the Financial Conglomerate' of EUR 49.2 billion.\n\n|",

This risk includes the risk related to securitisation activities, and may be further amplified by individual, country and sector concentration risk. \u25b2\n\n## CREDIT RISK MONITORING AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM 4.5.1\n\n## General principles\n\nAudited  I The  risk  approval  process  is  based  on  the  following  main principles:\n\n- the  analysis  and  the  validation  of  the  files  fall  respectively  and p independently  to  the  sector  of  commercial  follow-up  of  the  client and to the dedicated risk units within the risk management function. In  order  to  guarantee  a  consistent  approach  to  Group  risk-taking, this  commercial  monitoring  sector  and  this  risk  unit  examine  all authorisation  requests  relating  to  a  given  client  or  category  of clients. This commercial monitoring sector and this risk unit must be independent of each other;\n- the internal rating of counterparties is a key criterion in the granting p policy.  These  ratings  are  proposed  by  the  commercial  monitoring sector and validated by the dedicated risk unit;\n- a system of delegation of competence, largely based on the internal p rating  of  the  counterparties,  confers  decision-making  capacities  to the  risk  units  on  the  one  hand  and  the  commercial  monitoring sectors on the other.\n\nThe business line assumes the burden of provisions and losses related to its credit decisions as the first line of defence. The Risk Department submits recommendations to CORISQ on the evolution of the granting policy,  with  limits  on  credit  portfolios,  for  the  countries,  geographic areas,  sectors,  products  or  types  of  customers  presenting  high concentration risks. \u25b2\n\n## Governance\n\nThe  Risk  Department,  working  with  the  Finance  Department, determines  the  risk  appetite  of  the  Group.  This  seeks  to  define  the acceptable level of risk given the Group's strategic aims.\n\nThe  Risk  Department  is  responsible  for  implementing  the  system  to manage  and  monitor  risks,  including  cross-Group  risks.  The  Risk Department exercises hierarchical and functional oversight of the Risk management  function  in  charge  of  Group  credit  risk  giving  it  a comprehensive view of all the Group's credit risks.\n\nThe  Risk  Department  helps  define  risk  policies  in  light  of  each  core business targets and the associated risk issues. It defines or approves the methods and procedures used to analyse, measure, approve and monitor  risks  and  the  risk  IT  system  and  makes  sure  these  are appropriate to the core businesses' needs. As second line of defence, various Risk Departments  (for  Retail  Banking,  Corporate  and Investment Banking and Market activities) are also in charge of credit risk and as such responsible for the independent control as second line of  defence. These consist in independently reviewing and comparing\n\nany  credit  application  that  exceeds  the  authority  delegated  to  core businesses or local Risk Department teams. The Risk Department also assesses  the  quality  of  first-level  credit  reviews  and  takes  any corrective action necessary.\n\nThe Risk Department also approves transactions and limits proposed by core business lines in respect of credit risk.\n\nFinally, as part of its responsibilities for second line of defence, the Risk Department carries out permanent controls of credit risks. As such, the Risk  Department  provides  independent  control  as  a  second  line  of defence  on  the  detection  and  monitoring  of  the  resolution  of  limit auioverruns.\n\nThe monthly Risk Monitoring Report presented to CORISQ by the Risk Department comments among others on the evolution of the Group's credit portfolio and ensures compliance with the guidelines. Changes in  the  credit  portfolio,  changes  in  credit  policy  validated  by  CORISQ and  respect  for  the  Group's  risk  appetite  are  presented  at  least quarterly to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nAs part of the quarterly reporting to the Board of Directors and to the Risk  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  an  overview  of  the  main credit  risk  metrics  supplemented  by  details  of  the  thresholds  and limits  where  applicable  is  presented.  The  following  metrics  are  in particular  the  subject  of  a  presentation  with  a  quarterly  history:  net cost  of  risk,  NPL  rate  (non-performing  loans),  coverage  rate,  average credit  quality  of  portfolios,  outstanding  corporates  placed  under surveillance (watchlist), supervision of corporate exposures by sector of  activity, Grands  Risques  R\u00e9glementaires (major  regulatory  risk exposures), etc.\n\nA monthly version of the reporting intended for the Risk Committee of the  Board  of  Directors  also  provides  additional  information  at  a Business Unit level or on certain financing activities. A summary of the thematic CORISQs is also presented.\n\nAs  part  of  the  monthly  CORISQ  reporting  to  General  Management,  a summary of the main credit files is presented. Thematic presentations also  provide  recurring  clarifications  on  certain  perimeters  and activities: personal real estate loans, consumer credit, non-retail credit risk, sector limits, country risks, major regulatory risks ( Grands Risques R\u00e9glementaires ), etc.\n\n## Specificities of retail portfolios\n\nAudited I Individual  and  professional  portfolio  (retail  portfolio)  have specific  features  in  terms  of  risk  management.  This  management  is based on a statistical approach and on the use of tools and methods in the industrialisation of processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This  mass  monitoring  of  retail customer exposure is based on the use of a statistical risk approach and monitoring by homogeneous risk class.\n\nIn  these  circumstances,  the  risk  monitoring  system  for  the  Retail portfolio cannot rely on the same procedures or the same tools as for corporates.\n\nFor  instance,  any  change  in  marketing  policy  (cut  to  probationary period for loyalty, delegation of lending decisions to brokers, increase in  margins,  etc.)  can  have  a  rapid  and  massive  impact  and  must therefore be tracked by a system that allows all actors (i) to identify as quickly  as  possible  where  any  deterioration  in  exposures  is  coming from and (ii) to take remedial action.\n\nEven if the IFRS/uni00A09/uni00A0standard  authorises a collective approach and if the Group has a statistical approach on retail customers for the evaluation of  the  expected  loss,  the  increase  in  risk  for  the  purposes  of  the classification  into  stages  is  identified  on  an  individual  basis  for  this clientele.  The  available  parameters  (operating  accounts  and  late payments) allow the assessment of the significant increase in credit risk at the level of individual exposures. The collective approach is currently only used in a very small number of instances within the Group.\n\n## IMPORTANCE OF TOOLS AND METHODS IN THE INDUSTRIALISATION OF PROCESSES\n\nThe  Risk  management  function  must  support  Business  Units  and subsidiary managers in managing their risks with an eye to:\n\n- the effectiveness of lending policies; p\n- the quality of the portfolio and its development over the lifetime of p exposures (from grant to recovery).\n\nRisk  Department structures its supervision around the following four processes:\n\n- granting:  this  decision-making  process  can  be  more  or  less p automated  depending  on  the  nature  and  complexity  of  the transactions, and hence the associated risk;\n- monitoring: different entities use different systems for granting and p managing retail  risks  systems  (scoring,  expert  systems,  rules,  etc.) and an appropriate monitoring system must be in place for each to assess  the  appropriateness  of  the  grant  rules  applied  (notably via monitoring);\n- recovery:  recovery  is  an  essential  stage  in  the  life  cycle  of  Retail p portfolio credits and makes a decisive contribution to our control of cost  of  risk.  Whatever  the  organisation  adopted  (outsourcing, in-house collection, etc.), the establishment of an effective collection process is an essential element of good risk management. It makes a decisive contribution to controlling the cost of risk and limiting the level of our non-performing loans. If recovery is outsourced, it must conform to the Group's regulations governing outsourcing;\n- provisioning:  provisions  against  the  Retail  portfolio  are  decided  at p local level. They  are  calculated  using  the  methodologies  and governance methods defined and approved by the Risk Department./uni00A0 \u25b2\n\n## Monitoring individual concentration\n\nSociete Generale complies with regulations governing large exposures (major  regulatory  risks  exposure  cap  of  25%  of  equity).  A  more restrictive  internal  limit  of  10%  delegated  by  General  Management (which can occasionally or permanently amend it) has been put in place. Since 1/uni00A0July 2018, the High Council for Financial Stability has imposed to financial  institutions  an  exposure  limit  on  most  indebted  companies established in France at a maximum level of 5% of eligible equity.\n\nInternal systems are implemented to identify and manage the risks of individual  concentrations,  particularly  at  granting  of  credit.  For example,  concentration  thresholds,  based  on  the  internal  rating  of counterparties,  are  set  by  CORISQ  and  define  the  governance  for validating the limits on individual concentrations. Exposures to groups of clients deemed significant by the Group are reviewed by the Large Exposure Committee chaired by the General Management. As part of the  identification  of  its  risks,  the  Group  also  carries  out  loss simulations  by  type  of  customer  (on  significant  individual  exposures that the Group could have).\n\nThe Group uses credit derivatives to reduce some exposures considered to be overly significant. Furthermore, the Group systematically seeks to mutualise  risks  with  other  banking  partners  by  avoiding  keeping  an excessive share in the banking pool of large-scale companies.\n\n## Monitoring country risk\n\nCountry  risk  arises  when  an  exposure  (loan,  security,  guarantee  or derivative)  becomes  susceptible  to  negative  impact  from  changing regulatory, political, economic, social and financial conditions.\n\nCountry risk breaks down into two major categories:\n\n- political and non-transfer risk covers the risk of non-payment resulting p from either actions or measures taken by local government authorities (decision  to  prohibit  the  debtor  from  meeting  its  commitments, nationalisation, expropriation, non-convertibility,/uni00A0etc.), domestic events (riots, civil war,/uni00A0etc.) or external events (war, terrorism,/uni00A0etc.);\n- commercial risk occurs when the credit quality of all counterparties p in  a  given  country  deteriorates  due  to  a  national  economic  or financial  crisis,  independently  of  each  counterparty's  individual financial  situation.  This  could  be  a  macroeconomic  shock  (sharp slowdown  in  activity,  systemic  banking  crisis,/uni00A0etc.), currency depreciation,  or  sovereign  default  on  external  debt  potentially entailing other defaults.\n\nOverall  limits  and/or  monitoring  of  exposures  have  been  established for countries  based  on  their  internal  ratings  and  governance indicators. The supervision is strengthened depending on the level of the country's risk.\n\nCountry limits are approved annually by Risk Department (or General Management in specific situations). They can be revised downward at any  time  if  the  country's  situation  deteriorates  or  is  expected  to deteriorate.\n\nAll Group exposures (securities, derivatives, loans and guarantees) are taken into account by this monitoring. The Country Risk methodology determines  an  initial  risk  country  and  a  final  risk  country  (after  any guarantee-related effects), which is supervised using country limits.\n\nThe procedure for putting a country on watch list is triggered in the event  of  deterioration  in  the  country  risk  or  anticipation  of  such  a deterioration by the Risk Department.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Sector monitoring\n\nThe Group regularly reviews its entire credit portfolio through analyses by  business  sector.  To  do  this,  it  relies  on  industry  sector  studies (including  a  one-year  anticipation  of  sectoral  risk)  and  on  sectoral concentration analyses.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  periodically  reviews  its  exposures  to  the portfolio  segments  presenting  a  specific  risk  profile,  within  the framework of CORISQs at Group level or at Business Unit level. These identified sectors or sub-portfolios are, where appropriate, subject to specific  supervision  through  portfolio  exposure  limits  and  specific granting  criteria. The  limits are monitored  either  at  General Management level  or  at  Business  Unit  management  level  depending on the materiality and the level of risk of the portfolios.\n\nAs a complement, more targeted sector-based research and business portfolio analysis, may be conducted by General Management, the Risk Department  or  Bank  Departments,  depending  on  current  issues.  In that respect, Covid-19 vulnerable sectors have been subject to specific monitorings.\n\nPortfolios specifically monitored by the Group CORISQ include:\n\n- individual  and  professional  credit  portfolio  (retail)  in  metropolitan p France  and  in  International  Retail  Banking  in  Europe.  The  Group defines in particular a risk appetite target concerning the minimum share  covered  by Credit  Logement guarantee  for  real  estate  loans granted to individuals;\n- oil and gas sectors, on which the Group has defined a credit policy p adapted  to  the  different  types  of  activity  of  sector  players.  This policy  distinguishes  financing  guaranteed  by  oil  reserves,  project financing,  short-term  trade  finance  transactions,  and  takes  into account regional characteristics;\n- commercial  real  estate  scope,  on  which  the  Group  has  defined  a p framework  for  origination  and  monitoring  of  exposures  and  limits according  to  the  different  types  of  financing,  geographical  areas and/or activities;\n\n## CREDIT RISK HEDGING 4.5.2\n\n## Audited I Guarantees and collateral\n\nThe Group uses credit risk mitigation techniques for both market and commercial banking activities. These techniques provide partial or full protection against the risk of debtor insolvency.\n\nThere are two main categories:\n\n- personal  guarantees  are  commitments  made  by  a  third  party  to p replace the primary debtor in the event of the latter's default. These guarantees encompass the protection commitments and mechanisms  provided  by  banks  and  similar  credit  institutions, specialised  institutions  such  as  mortgage  guarantors,  monoline  or multiline insurers, export credit agencies,/uni00A0States in the context of the health crisis linked to Covid-19, etc. By extension, credit insurance and  credit  derivatives  (purchase  of  protection)  also  belong  to  this category;\n- collateral  can  consist  of  physical  assets  in  the  form  of  property, p commodities  or  precious  metals,  as  well  as  financial  instruments such  as  cash,  high-quality  investments  and  securities,  and  also insurance policies.\n\nCREDIT RISK\n\n- leveraged finance, for which the Group applies the definition of the p scope and the management guidelines recommended by the ECB in 2017 (Guidance on leveraged transactions). The Group continues to pay  a  particular attention to the Leverage  Buy-Out  (LBO) sub-portfolio;\n- exposures  on  hedge  funds  is  subject  to  a  specific  attention.  The p Group  incurs  risk  on  hedge  funds  through  derivative  transactions and  its  financing  activity  guaranteed  by  shares  in  funds.  Risks related to hedge funds are governed by individual limits and global limits on market risks and wrong way risks;\n- exposures  on  shadow  banking  are  managed  and  monitored  in p accordance  with  the  EBA  guidelines  published  in  2015  which specifies expectations regarding the internal framework  for identifying,  controlling  and  managing  identified  risks.  CORISQ  has set a global exposure threshold for shadow banking.\n\n## Credit stress tests\n\nWith the aim of identifying, monitoring and managing credit risk, the Risk Department works with the businesses to conduct a set of specific stress tests relating to a country, subsidiary or activity. These specific stress  tests  combine  both  recurring  stress  tests,  conducted  on  those portfolios  identified  as  structurally  carrying  risk,  and ad  hoc stress tests, designed to recognise emerging risks. Some of these stress tests are  presented  to  CORISQ  and  used  to  determine  how  to  frame  the corresponding the activities concerned.\n\nCredit  risk  stress  tests  complement  the  global  analysis  with  a  more granular  approach  and  allow  fine-tuning  of  the  identification, assessment and operational management of risk, including concentration.  They  allow  to  calculate  the  expected  credit  losses  on exposures which have undergone an event of default and on exposures which have not undergone an event of default, in accordance with the method prescribed in the standard IFRS/uni00A09. The perimeter covered may include counterparty credit risk on market activities when relevant.\n\nAppropriate haircuts are applied to the value of collateral, reflecting its quality and liquidity.\n\nIn  order  to  reduce  its  risk-taking,  the  Group  is  pursuing  active management  of  its  securities,  in  particular  by  diversifying  them: physical  collateral,  personal  guarantees  and  others  (including  Credit Default Swaps).\n\nFor  information,  the  mortgage  loans  of  retail  customers  in  France benefit  overwhelmingly  from  a  guarantee  provided  by  the  financing company Cr\u00e9dit Logement ,  ensuring  the  payment of the mortgage to the Bank in the event of default by the borrower (under conditions of compliance  with  the  terms  of  collateral  call  defined  by Cr\u00e9dit Logement ).\n\nDuring the credit approval process, an assessment is performed on the value  of  guarantees  and  collateral,  their  legal  enforceability  and  the guarantor's  ability  to  meet  its  obligations.  This  process  also  ensures that the collateral or guarantee successfully meets the criteria set forth in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Regarding  collateral,  regular  revaluations  are  made  on  the basis of an estimated disposal value composed of the market value of the asset and a discount. The market value corresponds to the value at which  the  good  should  be  exchanged  on  the  date  of  the  valuation under conditions of normal competition. It is preferably obtained on the  basis  of  comparable  assets,  failing  this  by  any  other  method deemed  relevant  (example:  value  in  use).  This  value  is  subject  to haircuts  depending  on  the  quality  of  the  collateral  and  the  liquidity conditions.\n\nRegarding collateral used for credit risk mitigation and eligible for the RWA  calculation,  it  should  be  noted  that  95%  of  guarantors  are investment  grade.  These  guarantees  are  mainly  provided  by Cr\u00e9dit Logement ,  export  credit  agencies,  the  French  State  (within  the Pr\u00eats Garantis par l'\u00c9tat framework of the loans guaranteed by the French State) and insurance companies.\n\nIn accordance  with  the  requirements  of  European  Regulation No./uni00A0575/2013  (CRR),  the  Group  applies  minimum  collateralisation frequencies  for  all  collateral  held  in  the  context  of  commitments granted  (financial  collateral,  commercial  real  estate,  residential  real estate, other security interests, leasing guarantees).\n\nCloser  valuations  must  be  carried  out  in  the  event  of  a  significant change  in  the  market  concerned,  the  default  or  litigation  of  the counterparty or at the request of the risk management function.\n\nIn  addition,  the  effectiveness  of  credit  risk  hedging  policies  is monitored as part of the LGD.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the risk management function to validate the operational  procedures  put  in  place  by  the  business  lines  for  the periodic  valuation  of  collateral  (guarantees  and  collateral),  whether automatic valuations or on an expert opinion and whether during the credit decision for a new competition or during the annual renewal of the credit file.\n\nThe amount of guarantees and collateral is capped at the amount of outstanding loans less provisions, i.e. EUR 373/uni00A0billion  at  31/uni00A0December 2021 (compared with EUR 319/uni00A0billion at 31/uni00A0December  2020),  of  which EUR 175/uni00A0billion for retail customers and EUR 198/uni00A0billion for other types of counterparties (compared with EUR 156/uni00A0billion and EUR 163/uni00A0billion at 31/uni00A0December 2020, respectively).\n\nThe  outstanding  loans  covered  by  these  guarantees  and  collateral correspond  mainly  to  loans  and  receivables  at  mortised  cost,  which amounted to EUR 294/uni00A0billion at 31/uni00A0December 2021, and to off-balance sheet  commitments,  which  amounted  to  EUR  68/uni00A0billion  (compared with  EUR  258/uni00A0billion and  EUR  51/uni00A0billion at 31/uni00A0December 2020 respectively).\n\nThe  amounts  of  guarantees  and  collateral  received  for  performing outstanding loans (Stage/uni00A01) and under-performing loans (Stage/uni00A02) with payments past due amounted to EUR 2.4/uni00A0billion at 31/uni00A0December 2021 (EUR  4.3/uni00A0billion  at  31/uni00A0December  2020),  including  EUR  1.5/uni00A0billion  on retail  customers and EUR 0.9/uni00A0billion  on  other  types  of  counterparties (versus  EUR  1.7/uni00A0billion  and  EUR  2.6/uni00A0billion  at  31/uni00A0December  2020 respectively).\n\n## Use of credit derivatives to manage Corporate concentration risk\n\nThe  Group  may  use  credit  derivatives  for  in  the  management  of  its Corporate  credit  portfolio,  primarily  to  reduce  individual,  sector  and geographic  concentrations  and  to  implement  a  proactive  risk  and capital management approach.\n\nHoused  in  Corporate  and  Investment  Banking,  the  Performance  & Scarce Resources management (PSR) team works in close conjunction with  the  Risk  Department  and  the  businesses  to  reduce  excessive portfolio  concentrations,  react  quickly  to  any  deterioration  in  the creditworthiness of a particular counterparty and recommend actions to  improve  the  capital  allocation.  PSR  is  part  of  the  department responsible  for  defining  and  effectively  deploying  the  strategy,  for monitoring  performance  and  managing  the  scarce  resources  in  the credit and loan portfolio.\n\nTotal  outstanding  purchases  of  protection  through  Corporate  credit derivatives  were  stable  at  EUR/uni00A02.5/uni00A0billion  in  nominal  terms  and  a corresponding fair value of EUR/uni00A0-10.3/uni00A0million at the end of December/uni00A02021  (compared  to  EUR/uni00A02.5/uni00A0billion  nominal  value  and  a corresponding  fair  value  of  -7.3/uni00A0million euros  at  the  end  of December/uni00A02020).  New  operations  have  mainly  been  performed  to approve  capital  allocation  (EUR/uni00A01.7/uni00A0billion)  and  to  a  lower  extend reduce concentration risk (EUR/uni00A00.8/uni00A0billion).\n\nOver  2021,  the  credit  default  swaps  (CDS)  spreads  of  European investment grade issues (Itraxx index) were stable, fluctuating around an  annual  average  of  50  basis  points.  The  overall  sensitivity  of  the portfolio (Price Value of a Basis Point) is falling due to the reduction in the average maturity of the protections.\n\nThe  majority  of  protection  purchases  (99%  of  outstandings  at 31/uni00A0December  2021)  are  made  against  European  clearing  houses,  and all  against  counterparties  with  'Investment  Grade'  ratings  (rating  at least equal to BBB-).\n\nMoreover,  the  amounts  recognised  as  assets  (EUR/uni00A00.9/uni00A0billion  at 31/uni00A0December  2021 versus EUR/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion  at  31/uni00A0December  2020)  and liabilities (EUR/uni00A01.2/uni00A0billion at 31/uni00A0December 2021 versus EUR/uni00A01.4/uni00A0billion at 31/uni00A0December  2020)  correspond  to  the  fair  value  of  credit  derivatives mainly held under a transaction activity.\n\n## Credit insurance\n\nThe Group has developed relationships with private insurers over the last  several  years  in  order  to  hedge  some  of  its  loans  against commercial and political non-payment risks.\n\nThis  activity  is  performed  within  a  risk  framework  and  monitoring system approved by the Group's General Management. The system is based  on  an  overall  limit  for  the  activity,  along  with  sub-limits  by maturity,  and  individual  limits  for  each  insurance  counterparty,  the latter  being  furthermore  required  to  meet  strict  eligibility  criteria. There is also a limit for insured transactions in Non Investment Grade countries./uni00A0 \u25b2\n\nThe amount of guarantees and collateral received for non-performing outstanding loans as at 31/uni00A0December 2021 amounted to EUR 5.2/uni00A0billion (compared with EUR 4.5/uni00A0billion as at 31/uni00A0December 2020), of which EUR 1.8/uni00A0billion  on  retail  customers  and  EUR  3.4/uni00A0billion  on  other  types  of counterparties  (compared  with  EUR  1.8/uni00A0billion  and  EUR  2.7/uni00A0billion respectively  as  at  31/uni00A0December  2020).  These  amounts  are  capped  at the amount of outstanding.\n\n|",

For exposures  processed  under  the  standard  method  excluding  retail banking, the Group mainly uses external ratings from the Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch rating agencies and the Banque de France. In  the  event  that  several  Ratings  are  available  for  a  third  party,  the second best Rating is retained.\n\nThe rating model monitoring framework is operational, in accordance with regulatory requirements, and detailed below in this section/uni00A04.5.4 'Risk measurement and internal ratings' .\n\nIn accordance with the texts published by the EBA as part of the 'IRB Repair' programme and following the review missions carried out by the ECB (TRIM - Targeted Review of Internal Models), the Group plans to develop its internal model system credit risk, so as to comply with these  new  requirements.  A  program  ('Haussmann')  has  been launched  in  this  direction  within  the  Group,  and  deals  with  aspects such as:\n\n- the  simplification  of  the  architecture  of  the  models,  and  the p improvement of its auditability: either by ex  nihilo development of new  models  based  on  the  New  Definition  of  Default  (NDoD),  and natively  integrating  the  expectations  of  the  EBA  and  ECB,  or  by bringing certain existing models up to standard;\n- improving  the  quality  of  data  and  its  traceability  throughout  the p chain;\n- the review of the roles and responsibilities of the teams, particularly p with regard to the construction and monitoring ('back test') of the system;\n- the review of certain IT application bricks, and their rationalisation; p\n- the establishment of a more complete normative base, and a more p consistent relationship with the supervisor.\n\nThe programme is also based on building the target model strategy on the rollout plan towards the IRB approach.\n\nFollowing  the  TRIMs  and  as  part  of  compliance  with  IRB  Repair, evolutions  to  the  rating  systems  and  models  have  been  and  will  be submitted for validation to the ECB.\n\nAudited I To calculate its capital requirements under the IRB method, Societe  Generale  estimates  the  Risk-Weighted  Assets  (RWA)  and  the Expected Loss (EL) that may be incurred in light of the nature of the transaction, the quality of the counterparty ( via internal rating) and all measures taken to mitigate risk.\n\nThe calculation of RWA is based on the parameters Basel parameters, which are estimated using the internal risk measurement system:\n\n- the  Exposure  at  Default  (EAD)  value  is  defined  as  the  Group's p exposure in the event that the counterparty should default. The/uni00A0EAD includes exposures recorded on the balance sheet (loans, receivables,  accrued  income,  market  transactions,/uni00A0etc.),  and  a proportion of off-balance sheet exposures calculated using internal or regulatory Credit Conversion Factors (CCF);\n- the Probability of Default (PD): the probability that a counterparty of p the Bank will default within one year;\n- the Loss Given Default (LGD): the ratio between the loss incurred on p an exposure in the event a counterparty defaults and the amount of the exposure at the time of the default.\n\nThe  estimation  of  these  parameters  is  based  on  a  quantitative evaluation  system  which  is  sometimes  supplemented  by  expert  or business judgment.\n\nIn  addition,  a  set  of  procedures  sets  out  the  rules  relating  to  ratings (scope, frequency of review, grade approval procedure,/uni00A0etc.) as well as those for supervision, backtesting and the validation of models. These procedures  allow,  among  other  things,  to  facilitate  critical  human judgment,  an  essential  complement  to  the  models  for  non-retail portfolios.\n\nThe Group also takes into account:\n\n- the impact of guarantees and credit derivatives, by substituting the p PD, the LGD and the risk-weighting calculation of the guarantor for that  of  the  obligor  (the  exposure  is  considered  to  be  a  direct exposure  to  the  guarantor)  in  the  event  that  the  guarantor's  risk weighting is more favorable than that of the obligor;\n- collateral  used  as  guarantees  (physical  or  financial)./uni00A0This  impact  is p taken into account via the LGD level./uni00A0 \u25b2\n\nTo  a  very  limited  extent,  Societe  Generale  also  applies  an  IRB Foundation  approach  (where  only  the  probability  of  default  is estimated  by  the  Bank,  while  the  LGD  and  CCF  parameters  are determined  directly  by  the  supervisory  authority)  to  a  portfolio  of specialised  lending  exposures,  including  those  granted  to  the subsidiaries Franfinance Entreprises, Sogelease and Star Lease.\n\nMoreover, the Group has authorisation from the regulator to use the IAA (internal assessment approach) method to calculate the regulatory capital  requirement  for  ABCP  (Asset-Backed  Commercial  Paper) securitisation.\n\nIn addition to the capital requirement calculation objectives under the IRBA method, the Group's credit risk measurement models contribute to  the  management  of  the  Group's  operational  activities.  They  also constitute  tools  to  structure,  price  and  approve  transactions  and contribute to the setting of approval limits granted to business lines and the Risk function.\n\n|",

They  combine  quantitative parameters derived from financial data that evaluate the sustainability and solvency of companies and qualitative parameters that evaluate economic and strategic dimensions.\n\nThe following table presents the indicative corresponding scales of the main  external  credit  assessment  institutions  and  the  corresponding average  probabilities  of  default,  as  well  as  the  Group's  internal rating/uni00A0scale.\n\n|",

parameters  pertaining  to  the  transaction,  as well as the fees incurred for recovering the receivable in the event of a counterparty default.\n\nThe  models  used  to  estimate  the  Loss  Given  Default  (LGD)  excluding retail clients are applied by regulatory sub-portfolios, type of asset, size and  location  of  the  transaction  or  of  the  counterparty,  depending  on whether  or  not  collateral  has  been  posted,  and  the  nature  thereof  if applicable.  This/uni00A0makes  it  possible  to  define  homogeneous  risk  pools, particularly in terms of recovery, procedures and the legal environment.\n\nThese estimates are founded on statistics when the number of loans in default is sufficient. In such circumstances, they are based on recovery data  observed  over  a  long  period.  When  the  number  of  defaults  is insufficient, the estimate is revised or determined by an expert.\n\n## CREDIT CONVERSION FACTOR (CCF) MODELS\n\nFor its off-balance sheet exposures, the Group is authorised to use the internal approach for 'Term loan with drawing period' products and revolving credit lines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

These results may justify the implementation of remediation plans if the system is deemed to be insufficiently prudent. The discriminating power of the models and the change of the composition of the portfolio are also measured.\n\nThe  results  presented  above  cover  the  entire  Group  portfolios. Backtests  compare  the  estimated  probability  of  default  (arithmetic mean weighted by debtors)  with  the  observed  results  (the  historical annual default rate). The historical default rate was calculated on the basis of performing exposures over the period from 2008 to 2020.\n\nThe historic default rate remains stable across all the exposure classes. The  estimated  probability  of  default  is  higher  than  the  historical default  rates  for  all  Basel  portfolios  and  for  most  of  the  ratings.  It should  be  noted  that  new  internal  models  are  being  developed  to comply with new regulatory requirements.\n\n## 31.12.2021\n\nTABLE 17: COMPARISON OF RISK PARAMETERS: ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL PD VALUES - WHOLESALE CLIENTS IRBA\n\n| Exposure class                             | Weighted average PD (%)   | Arithmetic mean of debtor PD (%)   | Historical Average Annual Default Rate (%)   | Average annual default rate (%)   | Number of debtors Year-end (1)   |   of which: number of debtors in default during the year |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Central banks and central  administrations | 0.6%                      | 1.3%                               | 0.2%                                         | 0.2%                              | 451                              |                                                        1 |\n| Institutions                               | 0.5%                      | 0.8%                               | 0.3%                                         | 0.1%                              | 3,480                            |                                                        3 |\n| Corporates - SME                           | 2.9%                      | 4.3%                               | 3.4%                                         | 1.6%                              | 61,326                           |                                                      988 |\n| Corporates - Specialised lending           | 1.8%                      | 2.8%                               | 1.9%                                         | 1.0%                              | 2,255                            |                                                       22 |\n| Corporates - Others                        | 1.3%                      | 3.9%                               | 1.8%                                         | 1.2%                              | 24,625                           |                                                      301 |\n\n- Performing exposures.

The models incorporate  data  on  the  account  behavior  of  counterparties. They  are  segmented  by  type  of  customer  and  distinguish  between retail  customers,  professional  customers,  very  small  businesses  and real estate investment companies ( Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s civiles immobili\u00e8res ).\n\nThe counterparties of each segment are classified automatically, using statistical  models,  into  homogeneous  risk  pools,  each  of  which  is assigned  a  probability  of  default.  These  estimates  are  adjusted  by  a safety margin to estimate as best as possible a complete default cycle, using a through-the-cycle (TTC) approach.\n\n## LGD MODELS\n\nThe  models  for  estimating  the  Loss  Given  Default  (LGD)  of  retail customers  are  specifically  applied  by  business  line  portfolio  and  by product, according to the existence or not of collateral.\n\nConsistent with operational recovery processes, estimate methods are generally based on a two-step modeling process that initially estimates the proportion of defaulted loans in loan termination, followed by the loss incurred in case of loan termination.\n\nThe expected losses are estimated using internal long-term historical recovery data for exposures that have defaulted. These estimates are adjusted by safety margins in order to reflect the possible impact of a/uni00A0downturn.\n\n## CCF MODELS\n\nFor  its  off-balance  sheet  exposures,  Societe  Generale  applies  its estimates for revolving loans and overdrafts on current accounts held by retail and professional customers.\n\n|",

Backtests  compare  the  estimated  probability  of  default  (arithmetic average  weighted  by  the  debtors)  to  the  observed  results  (the historical  annual  default  rate).  The  historical  default  rate  was calculated on the basis of healthy outstandings over the period from 2010  to  2020.  Creditors  are  included  in  accordance  with  the  revised instructions of the EBA publication of 14 December 2016 (EBA/GL/2016/11).\n\nThe  historical  default  rate  is  relatively  stable  across  all  exposure classes,  the  probability  of  default  is  falling.  Indeed,  the  quality  of counterparties has improved (migration of populations to the best risk classes) due in particular to government measures taken in the Covid context. Since the risk scores are mainly based on the number of days of  arrears  and  the  cash  balance,  they  are  impacted  by:  (i)  the implementation of  a  moratorium  on  the  repayment  of  loans,  (ii)  the increase in cash balances by the payment of government-guaranteed loans ( Pr\u00eats de Garantie par l'Etat )  and by the payment by the French state of various aid initiatives to support professionals in the economy amid  the  Covid  pandemic,  (iii)  the  observation  of  an  increase  of  the personal savings rate during the Covid crisis.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  new  internal  models,  the  development  of which is finalised or planned, will make it possible to comply with the latest regulatory requirements.\n\n4",

Depending  on  the  specificities  of  each  model  family,  in  particular depending on the regulatory environment, the second line of defence may decide to  perform  the  backtesting  of  the  model  family.  In  such case the LOD2 is responsible for defining a dedicated standard for the model family and informing the first line of defence (starting with the model owner) of the outcome of the backtesting.\n\nThe Model Risk Department, reporting directly to the Risk Department, acts as a second line of defence for all credit risk models. Independent model  review  teams  rely,  for  the  conduct  of  their  missions,  on principles  of  control  of  the  theoretical  robustness  (assessment  of  the quality of the design and development) of the models, the conformity of the implementation and the use, the continuous follow-up of model relevance over time. The independent review process concludes with (i)/uni00A0a  report  summarizing  the  scope  of  the  review, the tests performed, the results of the review, the conclusions or recommendations and with (ii)/uni00A0Reviewing  and  Approval  Committees  (respectively Comit\u00e9  Mod\u00e8les and Comit\u00e9 Experts in the case of credit risk models). The model control system gives rise to recurring reports to the Risk Department within the framework  of  various  bodies  and  processes  (Group  Model  Risk\n\nManagement  Committee,  Risk  Appetite  Statement  /  Risk  Appetite Framework, monitoring of recommendations, etc.) and annually to the General  Management  (CORISQ).  The  Model  Risk  Department  reviews, amongst  others,  new  models,  backtesting  results  and  any  change  to the  credit  own  funds  estimation  models.  In  accordance  with  the Delegated Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0529/2014 of 20/uni00A0May 2014 relating to the follow-up  of  internal  models  used  for  own  funds  computation,  any model change to the Group's credit risk measurement system is then subjected  to  two  main  types  of  notification  to  the  competent supervisor,  depending  on  the  significant  nature  of  the  change  laid down by this regulation itself:\n\n- significant changes which are subject to a request for approval prior p to their implementation;\n- other  changes  which  should  be  notified  to  the  competent p authorities: (i) prior to their implementation: changes, according to the criteria defined by the regulation, are notified to the Supervisor ( ex-ante notification);  barring  a  negative  response,  these  may  be implemented  within  a  two  months  period;  (ii)  after  their implementation:  these  changes  are  notified  to  the  competent authorities after their implementation at least once a year, through a specific report ( ex-post notification).\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  Department,  as  a  third  line  of  defence,  is responsible for  periodically  assessing  the  overall  effectiveness  of  the model  risk  management  framework  (relevance  of  the  model  risk governance  and  efficiency  of  second  line  of  defence  activities)  and performing the independent model audit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This  cost  of  risk  is  thus  down  sharply compared to 2020, due to a very high level low cost of risk on defaulted outstandings (stage 3) and moderate reversals of provisions on sound outstandings (stage 1/stage 2) while maintaining a prudent provisioning policy in an environment that remains marked by strong uncertainties.\n\nThe  cost  of  risk  (expressed  in  basis  points  on  the  average  of outstandings  at  the  beginning  of  the  period  for  the  four  quarters preceding  the  closing,  including  operating  leases)  thus  stands  at  13 basis points for the year 2021 compared to 64 basis points in 2020.\n\n- In French Retail Banking , the cost of risk is down to 5 basis points in p 2021  compared  to  52  basis  points  in  2020.  This  NCR  includes  a recovery of 8 bp on sound outstandings (compared to the internship 1/internship 2 allocation of 30 bp in 2020).\n- At 38 basis points in 2021 (compared to 96 basis points in 2020), the p cost  of  risk  for  the International  Retail  Banking  and  Financial Services division decreased due to the slowdown in defaults and a recovery in 3 basis points on stage 1/stage 2.\n- The cost of risk for Global Banking and Investor Solutions posted a p level  of  5  basis  points  (compared  to  57  basis  points  in  2020), reflecting a sharp drop in the cost of risk on defaulted outstandings (8 bp against 38 bp in 2020) and a slight recovery of 3 bp on healthy outstandings.\n\n|",

(1)\n\n## Restructured debt\n\nAudited  I For  Societe  Generale  Group,  'restructured'  debt  refers  to loans  with  amounts,  terms  or  financial  conditions  contractually modified  due  to  the  borrower's  insolvency  (whether  insolvency  has already occurred or will definitely occur unless the debt is restructured). Societe  Generale  aligns  its  definition  of  restructured  loans  with  the EBA/uni00A0one.\n\nRestructured debt does  not  include  commercial  renegotiations involving customers for whom the Bank has agreed to renegotiate the debt  in  order  to  maintain  or  develop  a  business  relationship,  in accordance with credit approval rules in force and without relinquishing any of the principal amounts or accrued interests.\n\nAny situation leading to a credit restructuring and involving a loss of value greater than 1% of the original debt or in which the customer's\n\nability  to  repay  the  debt  according  to  the  new  schedule  appears compromised  must  result  in  the  classification  of  the  considered customer  in  Basel  default  and  the  classification  of  outstanding  as impaired, in accordance with the EBA directives on the application of the  definition  of  default  according  to  Article  178  of  European Regulation No. 575/2013. In this case, customers are kept in default for as  long  as  the  Bank  is  uncertain  about  their  ability  to  honour  their future  commitments  and  at  least  for  one  year  from  the  date  of  the restructuring.  In  other  cases,  an  analysis  of  the  customer's  situation makes it possible to estimate his ability to repay according to the new schedule. Otherwise, the customer is also transferred to Basel default.\n\nThe total balance sheet amount of restructured debt at 31 December 2021  mainly  corresponds  to  loans  and  receivables  at  amortised  cost for an amount of EUR 8.1 billion./uni00A0\u25b2\n\n| (In EURm)                             | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Non-performing restructured debt      | 3,342        | 2,470        |\n| Performing restructured debt          | 5,424        | 1,223        |\n| GROSS AMOUNT OF RESTRUCTURED DEBT (1) | 8,765        | 3,692        |\n\n- Composed of EUR 8.2 billion carried on the balance sheet and EUR 0.6 billion as off-balance sheet at 31 December 2021.

The NPL rate calculation was modified  in  order  to  exclude  from  the  gross  exposure  in  the  denominator  the  net  accounting  value  of  the  tangible  assets  for  operating  lease.  Performing  and non-performing loans include loans at fair value through profit or loss which are not eligible to IFRS 9 provisioning and so not split by stage.

Counterparty credit risk may increase in the event of an adverse correlation (Wrong Way Risk), i.e. when  the  Group's exposure to  a  counterparty  increases  at  the  same  time  as  the  credit  quality  of  this  counterparty  deteriorates  ( i.e. when  its  probability  of default increases).\n\nTransactions involving counterparty credit risk include delivered pensions, securities lending and borrowing, and derivatives contracts, whether they are dealt with as principal activity or on behalf of third parties (agency activities or client clearing) in the context of market activities. \u25b2\n\n## DETERMINING LIMITS AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK 4.6.1\n\n## Main principles\n\nAudited/uni00A0I Counterparty credit risk is framed through a set of limits that reflect the Group's appetite for risk.\n\nThe  risk approval  process  follows  the  following  fundamental principles:\n\n- a system of delegation of competence, largely based on the internal p rating  of  the  counterparties,  confers  decision-making  capacities  to the risk units on the one hand and the customer monitoring sector on the other hand;\n- the  commercial  monitoring  sector  and  this  risk  unit  must  be p independent of each other;\n- the limits and internal rating set for each counterparty are proposed p by the client monitoring sector and validated by the dedicated risk unit in charge of the counterparty type. Limits can be individual at the level of the counterparty, or global over a set of counterparties in the case of monitoring exposures in stress tests, for example.\n\nThese limits are subject to annual or ad hoc reviews depending on he needs and changing market conditions.\n\nA  dedicated  team  within  the  Risk  Department  is  in  charge  of production, reporting and controls on risk metrics, namely:\n\n- ensuring the completeness and reliability of the risk calculation by p taking into account all the transactions booked by the transaction processing department;\n- producing daily certification and risk indicator analysis reports; p\n- controlling  compliance  with  defined  limits,  at  the  frequency  of p metrics calculation, most often on a daily basis: breaches of limits are reported to Front Office and Credit Officer for remediation actions.\n\nIn addition, a specific monitoring and approval process is implemented for the most sensitive counterparties or the most complex categories of financial instruments.\n\n## Governance\n\nWhile  not  a  substitute  for  CORISQ  or  for  the  Risk  Committee  of  the Board of Directors (see the section on Risk management governance), the  Counterparty  Credit  Risk  Committee  (CCRC)  closely  monitors counterparty credit risk through:\n\n- a global overview on exposure and counterparty risk metrics such as p the  global  stress  tests,  the  Potential  Future  Exposure  PFE,  etc.,  as well as focuses on specific activities such as collateralised financing, or agency business;\n- dedicated analysis in case of identification of emerging risk areas. p\n\nThis Committee, chaired by the Risk Department on a monthly basis, brings  together  representatives  from  the  Market  Activities  and  the Global  Banking  and  Advisory  Business  Units,  but  also  departments that, within the risk management function, are in charge of monitoring counterparty credit risks  on  market  transactions  and  credit  risk.  The CCRC also provides an opinion on the changes to the risk frameworks within its authority.\n\n## Replacement risk\n\nThe Group frames the replacement risks by limits:\n\n- defined at the counterparty level; p\n- consolidated  across  all  products  types  authorised  with  the p counterparty;\n- established by maturity buckets to control future exposure using the p Potential Future Exposure (PFE) measure also known as CVaR within Societe Generale;\n- calibrated  according  to  the  credit  quality  and  the  nature  of  the p counterparty,  the  nature/maturity  of  the  financial  instruments contemplated (FX transactions, repos transactions, security lending transactions,  derivatives,/uni00A0etc.),  and  the  economic  understanding, the contractual legal framework agreed and any other risk mitigants.\n\n|",

This  balance  may  be  the  subject  of  a guarantee or collateralisation. It results in a single net claim owed by or to the counterparty.\n\nIn order to reduce the legal risk associated with documentation and to comply with key international standards, the Group documents these agreements  under  the  main  international  standards  as  published  by national or international professional associations such as International  Swaps  and  Derivatives  Association  (ISDA),  International Capital  Market  Association  (ICMA),  International  Securities  Lending Association (ISLA), French Banking Federation (FBF),/uni00A0etc.\n\nThese  contracts  establish  a  set  of  contractual  terms  generally recognised as standard and give way to the modification or addition of more specific provisions between the parties in the final contract, for example regarding the triggering events. This standardisation reduces implementation times and secures operations. The clauses negotiated by  clients  outside  the  bank's  standards  are  approved  by  the decision-making bodies in charge of the master agreements standards -  Normative  Committee  and/or  Arbitration  Committee  -  made  up  of representatives  of  the  Risk  Division,  the  Business  Units,  the  Legal Division  and  other  decision-making  departments  of  the  bank.  In accordance  with  regulatory  requirements,  the  clauses  authorising global  close-out  netting  and  collateralisation  are  analysed  by  the bank's  legal  departments  to  ensure  that  they  are  enforceable  under the legal provisions applicable to clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Collateralisation\n\nMost of over-the-counter transactions are collateralised. There are two types of collateral exchanges:\n\n- initial margin (IM) or Independent Amount (IA (1) ): an initial amount of p collateral  aiming  at  covering  potential  future  exposure, i.e. the unfavourable change in the Mark-to-Market of positions in the time period between the last collection of margins and the liquidation of positions following the counterparty default;\n- variation margin (VM): collateral collected to cover current exposure p arising from Mark-to-Market changes, used as an approximation of the actual loss resulting from  the  default  of  one  of  the counterparties.\n\nAll aspects of the margining  regime  are  defined  in  collateral arrangements, such as credit support annexes (CSA (2) ). The main features defined are:\n\n- the scope covered ( i.e. the nature of transactions allowed); p\n- the  eligible  collateral  and  the  applicable  haircut:  main  types  of p collateral  exchanged  are  cash  or  high-quality  and  liquid  assets according to the Group's policy, and are subject to a haircut, which is  the  valuation  percentage  applicable  to  each  type  of  collateral, based on liquidity and price volatility of the underlying during both normal and stressed market conditions;\n- the timing and frequency of the calculation of the margin call and p exchanges, usually daily;\n- the margin call thresholds if not under regulatory obligation; p\n- the Minimum Transfer Amount (MTA). p\n\nIn  addition,  specific  parameters  or  optional  features  can  be  defined depending  on  the  type  of  counterparty/transaction,  such  as  an additional  guarantee  amount  (flat-rate  increase  of  the  exposure allowing the party making a margin call to be 'over-collateralised'), or rating-dependent clauses, typically mutual in nature, where additional collateral is requested in case of a party's rating downgrade.\n\nThe Group monitors given and received collateral exchanges. In case of discrepancies  between  the  parties  with  respect  to  margin  call amounts,  dedicated  teams  from  the  operations  and  the  risk departments are in charge of analysing the impacted transactions to ensure they are correctly valued and of addressing the issue.\n\n## BILATERAL COLLATERAL EXCHANGE\n\nThe initial margin, historically very rare except with hedge funds, was generalised  by  EMIR  and  DFA  regulations  which  introduced  the\n\nmandatory  use  of  master  agreements  and  related  CSA,  prior  to  or when  entering  into  an  uncleared  OTC  derivatives  transactions.  It  is now mandatory for the Group to exchange IM and VM for non-cleared OTC derivatives transactions with a large number of its counterparties (its  financial  counterparties  and  some  non-financial  counterparties above certain thresholds defined by the regulation, with compliance dates depending on the volume of transactions).\n\nThe  Regulatory  Technical  Standards  (RTS)  on  Initial  Margin  Model Validation  (IMMV)  under  EMIR  allows  counterparties  subject  to mandatory bilateral collateral exchange requirements to waive these rules  in  certain  circumstances.  The  Group  has  incorporated  a  waiver application  process  for  intra-group  entities  into  its  risk  management policies.  The  eligibility  criteria  for  this  waiver  are  framed  and monitored as required by the Delegated Regulation.\n\n## CLEARING HOUSES\n\nEMIR and DFA regulations have also required that the most standard over-the-counter  derivatives  transactions  be  compensated  through clearing  houses.  The  Group  thus  compensates  its  own  operations (principal  activity),  but  also  client  clearing  activities  (agency-type activity),  which  are  subject  to  systematic  margin  calls  to  mitigate counterparty  credit  risk  (customers  posting  daily  variation  margins and  initial  margins  to  Societe  Generale,  in  order  to  cover  current exposure  and  future  exposure).  The  Regulatory  Technical  Standards (RTS)  on  Initial  Margin  Model  Validation  (IMMV)  under  EMIR  allows counterparties  to  waive  the  mandatory  clearing via a  clearing  house for intra-group transactions for standardised derivatives transactions. The Group includes and applies this exemption according to the rules and criteria defined. \u25b2\n\nThe use of CCPs enables credit risk to be mitigated through the CCP's settlement systems by:\n\n- applying the bilateral set-off of daily amounts payable in the same p currency (payment netting), either to all derivatives, or by class of derivatives cleared by the CCP;\n- providing in most cases for the termination of cleared transactions p by the CCP in the event of its default.\n\n## OTHER MEASURES\n\nIn  addition  to  margin  requirements  for  some  counterparties  or mandatory clearing for the most standardised derivatives transactions, DFA  and  EMIR  provide  for  an  extensive  framework  for  the  regulation and transparency of OTC derivatives markets, such as reporting of OTC derivatives, timely confirmation or trade acknowledgement.\n\nIA (Independent Amount) is the same concept as initial margin, but applies to different perimeters (OTC swaps not cleared for IA). (1) The Credit Support Annex (CSA) is a legal document under ISDA contract that regulates the management of collateral between two counterparties. (2)\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK MEASURES 4.6.3\n\n## Replacement risk 4.6.3.1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAudited/uni00A0I The  measure  of  replacement  risk  is  based  on  an  internal model that determines the Group's exposure profiles. As the value of the exposure to a counterparty is uncertain and variable over time, we estimate the potential future replacement costs over the lifetime of the transactions. \u25b2\n\n## PRINCIPLES OF THE MODEL\n\nThe future fair value of market transactions with each counterparty is estimated from Monte Carlo models based on a historical analysis of market risk factors.\n\nThe principle of the model is to represent the possible future financial markets  conditions  by  simulating  the  evolutions  of  the  main  risk factors  to  which  the  institution's  portfolio  is  sensitive.  For  these simulations, the model uses different diffusion models to account for the characteristics inherent in the risk factors considered and uses a 10-year history for calibration.\n\nThe  transactions  with  the  various  counterparties  are  then  revalued according to these different scenarios at the different future dates until the  maturity  of  the  transactions,  taking  into  account  the  terms  and conditions defined in the contractual legal framework agreed and the credit mitigants, notably in terms of netting and collateralisation only to the extent we believe that the credit mitigants provisions are legally valid and enforceable.\n\nThe  distribution  of  the  counterparty  exposures  thus  obtained  allows the  calculation  of  regulatory  capital  for  counterparty  credit  risk  and the economic monitoring of positions.\n\nThe Risk Department responsible for Model Risk Management at Group level,  assesses  the  theoretical  robustness  (review  of  the  design  and development  quality),  the  compliance  of  the  implementation,  the suitability  of  the  use  of  the  model  and  continuous  monitoring  of  the relevance of the model over time. This independent review process ends with (i)/uni00A0a report that describes the scope of the review, the tests carried out, the results of the review, the conclusions or recommendations and (ii)/uni00A0review  and  approval  Committees.  This  model  review  process  gives rise to (i) recurring reports to the Risk Management Department within the framework of various committees and processes (Group Model Risk Management  Committee,  Risk  Appetite  Statement/Risk  Appetite Framework,  monitoring  of  recommendations,/uni00A0etc.)  and  (ii)  a  yearly report to the Board of Directors (CORISQ).\n\n## REGULATORY INDICATOR\n\nAudited/uni00A0I With  respect  to  the  calculation  of  capital  requirements  for counterparty  credit  risk,  the  ECB,  following  the  Targeted  Review  of Internal Models, has renewed the approval for using the internal model described above to determine the Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EEPE) indicator.\n\nFor products not covered by the internal model as well as for entities in the  Societe  Generale  Group  that  have  not  been  authorised  by  the supervisor to use the internal model, the Group uses the market-price valuation method  for  derivatives (1) and the general financial security-based method for securities financing transactions (SFT (2) ).\n\nThe  effects  of  compensation  agreements  and  collateralisation  are taken  into  account  either  by  their  simulation  in  the  internal  model when such credit risk mitigant or guarantees meet regulatory criteria, or  by  applying  the  rules  as  defined  in  the  market-price  valuation method  or  the  financial  security-based  method,  by  subtracting  the value of the collateral.\n\nThese exposures are then weighted by rates resulting from the credit quality  of  the  counterparty  to  compute  the  Risk  Weighted  Assets (RWA). These rates can be determined by the standard approach or the advanced approach (IRBA).\n\nAs  a  general  rule,  when  EAD  is  modelled  in  EEPE  and  weighted according  to  IRB  approach,  there  is  no  adjustment  of  the  LGD according to the collateral received as it is already taken into account in the EEPE calculation. \u25b2\n\nThe RWA breakdown for each approach is available in the 'Analysis of Counterparty Credit Risk Exposure by Approach' table in Section/uni00A04.6.3.4 ' Quantitative Information '.\n\n## ECONOMIC INDICATOR\n\nFor  the  economic  monitoring  of  positions,  Societe  Generale  relies mainly on a maximum exposure indicator determined from the Monte Carlo  simulation,  called  internally  Credit  Value-at-Risk  (CVaR)  or  PFE (Potential Future Exposure). This is the maximum amount of loss that could occur after eliminating 1% of the most adverse occurrences. This indicator  is  calculated  at  different  future  dates,  which  are  then aggregated into segments, each of them being framed by limits.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  developed  a  set  of  stress  test  scenarios  to determine  the  exposure  that  would  result  from  changes  in  the  fair value  of  transactions  with  all  its  counterparties  in  the  event  of  an extreme shock affecting the market parameters.\n\n## Credit Valuation Adjustment 4.6.3.2\n\n## MAIN PRINCIPLES\n\nThe  CVA  (Credit  Valuation  Adjustment)  refers  to  adjustment  to marked-to-market of the derivatives and repos portfolio to take into account the credit quality of each counterparty facing the Group in the valuation. This adjustment is equivalent to the counterparty credit risk hedging cost in the Credit Default Swap (CDS) market.\n\nFor a specific counterparty, the CVA is determined on the basis of:\n\n- the  positive  expected  exposure  to  the  counterparty,  which  is  the p average  of  the  positive  hypothetical  future  exposure  values  for  a transaction or a group of transactions. It is mainly determined using risk  neutral Monte Carlo simulations of risk factors that may affect the  valuation  of  the  derivatives  transactions.  The  transactions  are revalued  through  time  according  to  the  different  scenarios,  taking into  account  the  terms  and  conditions  defined  in  the  contractual legal framework  agreed,  notably  in  terms  of  netting  and collateralisation  ( i.e. that  transactions  with  appropriate  credit mitigants  will  generate  lower  expected  exposure  compared  to transactions without credit mitigants);\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## RISK AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY\n\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK\n\n- the probability of default of the counterparty, which is linked to the p level of CDS spreads;\n- the  amount  of  losses  in  the  event  of  default  (LGD  -  Loss  Given p Default taking into account the recovery rate).\n\nThe Group calculates this adjustment for all counterparties which are not subject to a daily margin call or for which collateral only partially covers the exposure.\n\n## CAPITAL REQUIREMENT FOR CVA RISK\n\nThe  financial  institutions  are  subject  to  the  calculation  of  a  capital requirement under the CVA, to cover its variation over ten days. The scope  of  counterparties  is  reduced  to  financial  counterparties  as defined  in  EMIR  (European  Market  Infrastructure  Regulation)  or  to certain Corporates that may use derivatives beyond certain thresholds and for purposes other than hedging.\n\nThe CVA charge is determined by the Group mainly using the advanced method:\n\n- the  positive  expected  exposure  to  the  counterparty  is  mainly p determined  using  the  internal  model  described  in  section/uni00A04.6.3.1, which  estimates  the  future  exposure  profiles  to  a  counterparty, taking into account counterparty credit risk mitigants;\n- the VaR and the Stressed VaR on CVA are determined using a similar p methodology to the one developed for the calculation of the market VaR  (see  market  risk  chapter).  This  method  consists  of  an 'historical' simulation of the change in the CVA due to fluctuations in  the  credit  spreads  observed  on  the  counterparties  in  portfolio, with  a  confidence  interval  of  99%.  The  calculation  is  made  on  the credit spreads variation observed, on the one hand, over a one-year rolling  period  (VaR  on  CVA),  and,  on  the  other  hand,  over  a  fixed one-year historical window corresponding to the period of greatest tension in terms of credit spreads (stressed VaR on CVA);\n- the  capital  charge  is  the  sum  of  two  elements:  VaR  on  CVA  and p Stressed VaR on CVA multiplied by a coefficient set by the regulator, specific to each bank.\n\nThe  positions  not  taken  into  account  in  the  advanced  method  are subject to a capital charge determined through the standard method by applying  a  normative  weighting  factor  to  the  product  of  the  EAD (Exposure  At  Default)  by  a  maturity  calculated  according  to  the  rules defined  by  the  CRR  (Capital  Requirement  Regulation);  see  the 'Transactions subject to own funds requirements for CVA risk' table in Section/uni00A04.6.3.4 'Quantitative  Information' ) for the breakdown  of CVA-related RWA between advanced and standard methods.\n\n## CVA RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe management of this exposure and of this regulatory capital charge led the Bank to purchase hedging instruments such as Credit Default Swap  (CDS)  from  large  credit  institutions  on  certain  identified counterparties or on indices composed of identifiable counterparties. In  addition  to  reducing  credit  risk,  it  decreases  the  variability  of  the CVA and the associated capital amounts resulting from fluctuations in counterparty credit spreads.\n\n## Unfavorable correlation risk 4.6.3.3 (wrong-way risk)\n\nWrong-way risk is the risk of the Group's exposure to a counterparty increasing significantly, combined with a simultaneous increase in the probability of the counterparty defaulting.\n\nThere are two different cases:\n\n- general  wrong-way  risk  arises  when  the  likelihood  of  default  by p counterparties  is  positively  correlated  with  general  market  risk factors;\n- specific  wrong-way  risk  arises  when  future  exposure  to  a  specific p counterparty is positively correlated with the counterparty's probability  of  default  due  to  the  nature  of  the  transaction  with  the counterparty.\n\nSpecific  wrong-way  risk,  in  the  case  of  a  legal  link  between  the counterparty and the underlying of a transaction concluded with the counterparty, is subject to dedicated regulatory capital requirements, calculated  on  the  perimeter  of  transactions  carrying  such  risk. Furthermore,  for  counterparties  subject  to  such  a  specific  risk,  the Potential  Future  Exposure  (PFE)  is  also  increased,  so  that  the transactions  allowed  by  the  limits  in  place  will  be  more  constrained than in the absence of specific risk.\n\nThe  general  wrong-way  risk  is  controlled via a  set  of  stress  tests applied  to  transactions  made  with  a  given  counterparty,  based  on scenarios common with the market stress tests. This set-up is based on:\n\n- a  quarterly  analysis  of  stress  tests  on  all  counterparties  (financial p institutions,  corporates,  sovereigns,  hedge  funds  and  proprietary trading groups) for principal and agency (client clearing) businesses, allowing to understand the most adverse scenarios related to a joint deterioration  in  the  quality  of  counterparties  and  the  associated positions;\n- a weekly monitoring of dedicated single-factor stress tests for hedge p fund  counterparties  and  Proprietary  Trading  Groups,  subject  to limits at the counterparty level.\n\n|",

These parameters include, but are not limited to, exchange rates, interest rates, the price of securities (equities or bonds), commodities, derivatives and other assets. \u25b2\n\n## ORGANISATION OF MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT 4.7.1\n\n## Main functions\n\nAudited/uni00A0I Although primary responsibility for managing risk exposure relies  on  the  front  office  managers,  the  supervision  system  comes under  the  Market  Risk  Department  of  the  Risk  Department,  which  is independent from the businesses.\n\nThe main missions of this department are:\n\n- the definition and proposal of the Group's market risk appetite; p\n- the proposal of appropriate market risk limits by Group activity to p the Group Risk Committee (CORISQ);\n- the  assessment  of  the  limit  requests  submitted  by  the  different p businesses within the framework of the overall limits authorised by the Board of Directors and General Management, and based on the use of these limits;\n- the  permanent  verification  of  the  existence  of  an  effective  market p risk monitoring framework based on suitable limits;\n- the definition of the indicators used to monitor market risk; p\n- the daily calculation and certification of the market risk indicators, p of  the  P&L  resulting  from  market  activities,  based  on  formal  and secure  procedures,  and  then  of  the  reporting  and  the  analysis  of these indicators;\n- the daily monitoring of the limits set for each activity. p\n\nIn  order  to  perform  its  tasks,  the  department  also  defines  the architecture and the functionalities of the information system used to produce  the  risk  and  P&L  indicators  for  market  transactions,  and ensures  it  meets  the  needs  of  the  different  businesses  and  of  the Market Risk Department. \u25b2\n\nThis department contributes to the detection of possible rogue trading operations through a monitoring mechanism based on alert levels (on gross nominal value of positions for example) applied to all instruments and desks.\n\n|\n\n## Governance\n\nMarket risks oversight is provided by various Committees at different levels of the Group:\n\n- the  Risk  Committee  of  the  Board  of  Directors (1) is  informed  of  the p Group's major market risks; in addition, it issues a recommendation on the most substantial proposed changes in terms of market risk measurement and framework (after prior approval by the CORISQ); this recommendation is then referred to the Board of Directors for a decision;\n- the Group Risk Committee (2) (CORISQ), chaired by the Chief Executive p Officer of the Group, is regularly informed of Group-level market risks. Moreover, upon a proposal from the Risk Department, it validates the main choices with regard to market risk measurement, as well as the key  developments  on  the  architecture  and  implementation  of  the market risk framework at Group level;\n- the market risks related to the Global Markets Division are reviewed p during  the  Market  Risk  Committee (3) (MRC)  led  by  the  Market  Risk Department  and  co-chaired  by  the  Risk  Department  and  by  the Global  Markets  Division.  This  Committee  provides  information  on risk  levels  for  the  main  risk  indicators  as  well  as  for  some  specific activities  pointed  out  depending  on  market  or  business  driven events.  It  also  provides  an  opinion  on  the  market  risk  framework changes falling under the remit of the Risk Department and Global Markets Division.\n\nDuring  these  Committees,  the  market  activities  P&L  and  several metrics for monitoring market risks are systematically reported:\n\n- stress  test  measurements:  Global  Stress  Test  on  market  activities p and Market Stress Test;\n- regulatory  metrics:  Value-at-Risk  (VAR)  and  Stressed  Value-at-Risk p (SVAR).\n\nIn  addition  to  these  Committees,  detailed  and  summary  market  risk reports, produced on a daily, weekly, monthly or quarterly basis, either related  to  various  Group  levels  or  geographic  areas,  are  sent  to  the relevant business line and risk function managers.\n\nIn terms of governance, within the Market Risk Department, the main functional and transversal subjects are dealt with during Committees organised by value chains (market risk, P&L,/uni00A0etc.). These Committees are decision-making bodies, composed of senior representatives from each relevant Department teams and regions. \u25b2",

The  risk  resulting from these market activities is strictly managed through a set of limits for several indicators:\n\n- the  Value-at-Risks  (VaR)  and  stressed  Value-at-Risks  (sVaR):  these p global indicators are used for market risk calculations for RWA and for  the  day-to-day  monitoring  of  the  market  risks  incurred  by  the Group within the scope of its trading activities;\n- stress test measurements, based on decennial shock-type p indicators, which make it possible to restrict the Group's exposure to systemic risk and exceptional market shocks. These measurements can  be  global,  multi-risk  factor  (based  on  historic  or  hypothetical scenarios),  by  activity  or  risk  factor  in  order  to  take  into  account extreme risks on a specific market, or event-driven, to temporarily monitor a particular situation;\n- sensitivity  and  nominal  indicators  used  to  manage  the  size  of p positions:\n- sensitivities  are  used  to  monitor  the  risk  incurred  locally  on  a -given type of position ( e.g. sensitivity of an option to changes in the underlying asset),\n- while  nominal  indicators  are  used  for  significant  positions  in -terms of risk;\n- additional  indicators  such  as  concentration  risk  or  holding  period, p maximum maturity,/uni00A0etc. \u25b2\n\nThe  Market  Risk  Department  is  responsible  for  the  assessment  and validation  of  the  limit  requests  submitted  by  the  different  business lines. These limits ensure that the Group complies with the market risk appetite  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  further  to  a  proposal from General Management (1) .\n\n## MAIN MARKET RISK MEASURES 4.7.3\n\n## Stress test assessment\n\nAudited/uni00A0I Societe  Generale  monitors  its  exposure  using  stress  test simulations to take into account exceptional market disruptions.\n\nA  stress  test  estimates  the  loss  resulting  from  an  extreme  change  in market parameters over a period corresponding to the time required to unwind or hedge the positions affected.\n\nTwo major metrics are defined and used:\n\n- the  Global  Stress  Test  on  market  activities,  which  estimates  the p losses  linked  to  market  risks,  market/counterparty  cross-risk,  and dislocation  and  carry  risk  on  exotic  activities,  that  could  arise simultaneously in the event of a severe but plausible systemic crisis. This stress test is modeled on five scenarios;\n\n## Determining and monitoring limits\n\nThe  choice  and  calibration  of  these  limits  ensure  the  operational transposition  of  the  Group's  market  risk  appetite  through  its organisation:\n\n- these limits are allocated at various levels of the Group's structure p and/or by risk factor;\n- their calibration is determined using a detailed analysis of the risks p related to the portfolio managed. This analysis may include various elements such as market conditions, specifically liquidity, position maneuverability, risk/rewards analysis,/uni00A0etc.;\n- regular  reviews  make  it  possible  to  manage  risks  according  to  the p prevailing market conditions;\n- specific limits, or even bans, may be put in place to manage risks for p which the Group has little or no risk appetite.\n\nThe  desk  mandates  and  Group  policies  stipulate  that  traders  must have a sound and prudent management of positions and must respect the  defined  frameworks.  The  allowed  transactions,  as  well  as  risk hedging  strategies,  are  also  described  in  the  desks  mandates.  The limits  set  for  each  activity  are  monitored  daily  by  the  Market  Risk Department. This continuous monitoring of the market risk profile is the object of regular discussions between the risk and business teams, further to which various risk hedging or mitigation initiatives may be taken by the front office in order to remain within the defined limits. In the event of a breach of the risk framework, and in compliance with the limits follow-up procedure, the front office must detail the reasons, and  take  the  necessary  measures  to  return  within  the  defined framework, or otherwise request a temporary or permanent increase of  limit  if  the  clients  requests  and  if  market  conditions  justify  such  a course of action.\n\nIn addition to the governance structure in place between the various departments of the Risk function and business lines, the monitoring of limits usage, due to the products/solutions provided to clients and the market-making activities, also contributes to ensuring that market risk to which the Group is exposed are properly managed and understood.\n\n- the  Market  Stress  Test,  which  focuses  solely  on  market  risks, p applying the same scenarios as the Global Stress Test and additional scenarios corresponding to different market conditions.\n\nThe various scenarios for those stress tests are reviewed by the Risk Division  on  a  regular  basis.  These  reviews  are  presented  during dedicated biannual Committees,  chaired  by  the  Market  Risk Department  and  attended  by  economists  and  representatives  of Societe  Generale's  trading  activities.  These  Committees  cover  the following  topics:  changes  in  scenarios  (introduction,  removal,  shock review),  appropriate  coverage  of  the  risk  factors  by  the  scenarios, review  of  the  approximations  made  in  terms  of  calculation,  correct documentation of the whole process. The delegation level needed to validate  the  changes  in  stress  test  methodology  depends  on  the impact of the change in question.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

It  covers  all  the  risks  on  market  activities  that would occur simultaneously in case of a severe, but plausible, market crisis.  The  impact  is  measured  over  a  short  period  of  time  with  an expected occurrence of once per decade. The Global Stress Test uses five  market  scenarios  and  has  three  components,  each  of  which  are considered in each of the five scenarios in order to ensure consistency within the same scenario:\n\n- market risk; p\n- dislocation and carry risks on exotic activities related to concentration p effects and crowded trades;\n- market/counterparty  cross-risks  arising  in  transactions  with  weak p counterparties (hedge funds and proprietary trading groups).\n\nThe Global Stress Test corresponds to the least favorable results arising from the five scenarios and their respective components.\n\n## Market risk component\n\nIt corresponds to:\n\n- the  results  of  the  Market  Stress  Test (1) restricted  to  scenarios  that p could cause dislocation effects on market positions and default by weak counterparties. These scenarios all simulate a sharp fall in the equity markets and a widening in credit spreads which could trigger dislocation effects. Following the last review of the scenarios at the end of 2020, it was decided to use for the calculation of the stress test  three  theoretical  scenarios  (generalised  ( i.e. financial  crisis scenario),  eurozone  crisis,  general  decline  in  risk  assets)  and  two historical  scenarios  focusing  respectively  on  the  period  of  early October/uni00A02008 and early March/uni00A02020;\n- the  impact  of  the  stress  test  scenario  on  CVA  (Credit  Value p Adjustment) and FVA (Funding Value Adjustment) reserves, as their variations affect trading results.\n\n## Dislocation and carry risk component\n\nAdditional market risks to those assessed in the Market Stress Test can occur in market situation in which one or more participants - generally structured  products  sellers  -  have  concentrated  or  crowded  trades. Dynamic risk hedging strategies can cause larger market dislocations than those calibrated in the Market Stress Test, and these dislocations can  extend  beyond  the  shock  timeline  used  due  to  an  imbalance between supply and demand.\n\nEquity, credit, fixed income, currency and commodity trading activities are  regularly  reviewed  to  identify  these  areas  of  risk  and  to  define  a scenario that takes into account the specific features of each activity and position. Each scenario associated with an identified area of risk is added to the market risk component if - and only if - it is compatible with the market scenario in question.\n\n## Market/counterparty cross-risk component on weak counterparties\n\nSome counterparties may be significantly affected by a major crisis on the financial markets and their probability of default may increase. The third component of the Global Stress Test therefore aims to take into account  this  increased  risk  on  certain  types  of  weak  counterparties (hedge funds and proprietary trading groups).\n\nTwo measurements are used:\n\n- the collateralised financing stress test: this  stress test focuses on p collateralised  financing  activities  and  more  specifically  on  weak counterparties. It applies a dislocation shock to several asset classes with  the  assumption  of  extremely  tight  liquidity  conditions. Collateral and counterparty default rates are stressed concomitantly, taking into account any consanguinity with the collateral posted;\n- the adverse stress test on hedge funds and proprietary trading p groups (PTG): this stress test applies three pairs of stress scenarios to  all  market  transactions  generating  replacement  regarding  this type of counterparty. Each set of scenarios consists of a short-term scenario (scenario derived from the Market Stress Test) applied to positions with margin calls, and a long-term scenario (whose shocks are  generally  more  severe)  for  positions  without  margin  calls. Stressed  current  exposures  are  weighted  by  the  probability  of default  of  each  counterparty  and  by  the  loss  given  default  (LGD), then aggregated. \u25b2\n\n## AVERAGE CONTRIBUTION OF THE COMPONENTS IN 2021 GLOBAL STRESS TEST ON MARKET ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Measurement of the impact in the Net Banking Product in case of shocks on all risk factors (refer to description below).

This stress test is based on  11/uni00A0scenarios (1) (four  historical  and  seven  hypothetical).  The  main principles are as follows:\n\n- the scenario considered in the market stress test is the worst of the p different scenarios defined;\n- the shocks applied are calibrated on time horizons specific to each p risk  factor (the time horizon can range from five days for the most liquid risk factors to three months for the least liquid);\n- risks are calculated every day for each of the Bank's market activities p (all products together), using each of the historical and hypothetical scenarios.\n\n## Historical scenarios\n\nThis method consists of an analysis of the major economic crises that have affected the financial markets: changes in the prices of financial assets  (equities,  interest  rates,  exchange  rates,  credit  spreads,/uni00A0etc.) during  each  of  these  crises  have  been  analysed  in  order  to  define scenarios  for  potential  variations  in  these  main  risk  factors  which, when  applied  to  the  Bank's  trading  positions,  could  generate significant  losses.  Accordingly,  this  approach  makes  it  possible  to determine the historical scenarios used for the calculation of the stress test. This set of scenarios is also the subject of regular reviews. In 2020, two  new  historical  scenarios  related  to  the  Covid-19  crisis  were integrated: a crisis scenario (marked by a decline in equity indices and an increase in credit spreads) as well as a rebound scenario (marked by an increase in equity indices and a decrease in credit spreads). Societe Generale is currently using four historical scenarios in the calculation of the  stress  test,  which  cover  the  periods  from  October  to December/uni00A02008 and March/uni00A02020.\n\n## Hypothetical scenarios\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  hypothetical  scenarios  are  defined  with  the  Group's  economists and are designed to identify possible sequences of events that could lead  to  a  major  crisis  in  the  financial  markets  ( e.g. a  major  terrorist attack,  political  instability  in  the  main  oil-producing  countries,/uni00A0etc.). The Group's aim is to select extreme but plausible events which would have  major  repercussions  on  all  international  markets.  Accordingly, Societe Generale has defined seven hypothetical scenarios. \u25b2\n\n| Main risk factors   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest rates      | Risk resulting from changes in interest rates and their volatility on the value of a financial instrument  sensitive to interest rates, such as bonds, interest rate swaps,/uni00A0etc.                                               |\n| Share prices        | Risk resulting from variations in prices and volatility of shares and equity indices, in the level  of dividends,/uni00A0etc.                                                                                                         |\n| Exchange rates      | Risk resulting from the variation of exchange rates between currencies and of their volatility.                                                                                                                                       |\n| Commodity prices    | Risk resulting from changes in prices and volatility of commodities and commodity indices.                                                                                                                                            |\n| Credit Spreads      | Risk resulting from an improvement or a deterioration in the credit quality of an issuer on the value  of a financial instrument sensitive to this risk factor such as bonds, credit derivatives (credit default  swaps for example). |\n\nWithin the framework described above, the one-day 99% VaR, calculated according to the 260 scenarios, corresponds to the weighted average (2) of the second and third largest losses computed, without applying any weighting to the scenarios.\n\n## Regulatory indicators\n\n## 99% VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR)\n\n## Methodology\n\nAudited/uni00A0I The  Internal  VaR  Model  was  introduced  at  the  end  of  1996 and has been approved by the French regulator within the scope of the regulatory capital requirements. This approval was renewed in 2020 at the Target Review of Internal Models (TRIM).\n\nThe Value-at-Risk (VaR) assesses the potential losses on positions over a  defined  time  horizon  and  for  a  given  confidence  interval  (99%  for Societe  Generale).  The  method  used  is  the  'historical  simulation' method, which implicitly takes into account the correlation between the various markets, as well as general and specific risk. It is based on the following principles:\n\n- storage in a database of the risk factors that are representative of p Societe  Generale's  positions  ( i.e. interest  rates,  share  prices, exchange  rates,  commodity  prices,  volatility,  credit  spreads,/uni00A0etc.). Controls are regularly performed in order to check that all major risk factors for the trading portfolio of the Group are taken into account by the internal VaR model;\n- definition  of  260/uni00A0scenarios  corresponding  to  one-day  variations  in p these  market  parameters  over  a  rolling  one-year  period;  these scenarios are updated daily with the inclusion of a new scenario and the  removal  of  the  oldest  scenario.  There  are  three  coexisting methods  for  modeling  scenarios  (relative  shocks,  absolute  shocks and hybrid shocks), the choice between these methods for a given risk factor is determined by its nature and its historical trend;\n- the application of these 260/uni00A0scenarios to the market parameters of p the day;\n- revaluation of daily positions, on the basis of the 260 sets of adjusted p market  parameters:  in  most  cases  this  calculation  involves  a  full repricing.  Nonetheless,  for  certain  risk  factors,  a  sensitivity-based approach may be used.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Regulatory  capital  requirements,  however,  oblige  us  to  take  into account a ten-day horizon, thus we also calculate a ten-day VaR, which is obtained by multiplying the one-day VaR aggregated at Group level by the square root of ten. This methodology complies with regulatory requirements and has been reviewed and validated by the regulator.\n\nThe  VaR  assessment  is  based  on  a  model  and  a  certain  number  of conventional assumptions, the main limitations of which are as follows:\n\n- by definition, the use of a 99% confidence interval does not take into p account  losses  arising  beyond  this  point;  VaR  is  therefore  an indicator  of  the  risk  of  loss  under  normal  market  conditions  and does not take into account exceptionally significant fluctuations;\n- VaR  is  computed  using  closing  prices,  meaning  that  intraday p fluctuations are not taken into account;\n- the use of a historical model is based on the assumption that past p events are representative of future events and may not capture all potential events.\n\nThe Market Risk Department mitigates the limitations of the VaR model by performing stress tests and other additional measurements.\n\nThe  same  model  is  used  for  the  VaR  computation  for  almost  all  of Global Banking & Investor Solution's activities (including those related to the most complex products) and the main market activities of Retail Banking and Private Banking. The few activities not covered by the VaR method, either for technical reasons or because the stakes are too low, are  monitored  using  stress  tests,  and  capital  charges  are  calculated using the standard method or through alternative in-house methods. For example, the currency risk of positions in the banking book is not calculated with an internal model because this risk is not subject to a daily  revaluation  and  therefore  cannot  be  taken  into  account  in  a VaR/uni00A0calculation.\n\n## Backtesting\n\nThe relevance of the model is checked through continuous backtesting in order to verify whether the number of days for which the negative result exceeds the VaR complies with the 99% confidence interval. The results of the backtesting are audited by the Risk Department in charge of the validation of internal models, which, as second line of defence, also assesses  the  theoretical  robustness  (from  a  design  and development standpoint), the correctness of the implementation and the adequacy of the model use. The independent review process ends with  (i)/uni00A0review  and  approval  Committees  and  (ii)/uni00A0an  Audit  Report\n\n- 'Actual P&L' by agreement hereinafter.

The  model  control  mechanism  gives  rise  to  reporting  to  the appropriate authorities.\n\nIn compliance with regulations, backtesting compares the VaR to the (i)/uni00A0actual and (ii)/uni00A0hypothetical change in the portfolio's value:\n\n- in  the  first  case  (backtesting  against  'actual  P&L'),  the  daily  P&L (1) p includes the change in book value, the impact of new transactions and  of  transactions  modified  during  the  day  (including  their  sales margins) as well as provisions and parameter adjustments made for market risk;\n- in  the  second  case  (backtesting  against  'hypothetical  P&L'),  the p daily  P&L (2) includes  only  the  change  in  book  value  related  to changes in market parameters and excludes all other factors. \u25b2\n\nIn 2021, we observed:\n\n- one VaR backtesting breach in Q1 21, against actual P&L; p\n- three VaR backtesting breaches in Q4 21, against hypothetical P&L. p\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF THE DAILY (3) P&L OF MARKET ACTIVITIES (2021, IN EURM)\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  line  with  the  end  of  2020,  the VaR  in  2021  continued  its  gradual  decline  over  the  year,  reaching historically low levels in the 4 th /uni00A0quarter. The decline was visible across all asset classes, which are also at low levels. \u25b2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STRESSED VAR (SVAR)\n\nAudited/uni00A0I The  Internal  Stressed  VaR  model  (SVaR)  was  introduced  at the  end  of  2011  and  has  been  approved  by  the  Regulator  within  the scope of the regulatory capital requirements on the same scope as the VaR. As with the VaR model, this approval was renewed in 2020 at the Target Review of Internal Models (TRIM).\n\nThe calculation method used for the 99% one-day SVaR is the same as as the one for the VaR. It consists in carrying out a historical simulation with one-day shocks and a 99% confidence interval. Contrary to VaR, which  uses  260/uni00A0scenarios  for  one-day  fluctuations  over  a  rolling one-year  period,  SVaR  uses  a  fixed  one-year  historical  window corresponding to a period of significant financial tension.\n\nThe method for determining the fixed historical stress window in effect in  2021,  which  has  been  approved  by  the  regulator (1) ,  is  based  on  a review of the historic  shocks  on  the  risk  factors  representative  of  the Societe  Generale  portfolio  (related  to  equity,  fixed  income,  foreign\n\nexchange, credit and commodity  risks): historical shocks are aggregated  to  determine  the  period  of  highest  stress  for  the  entire portfolio.  Each  risk  factor  is  assigned  a  weighting  to  account  for  the weight of each risk factor within its asset class and the weight of the asset class in the Group's VaR. The historical window used is reviewed annually. In 2021, this window was 'September/uni00A02008-September/uni00A02009'.\n\nThe ten-day SVaR used for the computation of the regulatory capital is obtained, as for VaR, by multiplying the one-day SVaR by the square root of ten.\n\nThe  continuous  backtesting  performed  on  VaR  model  cannot  be replicated to the SVaR model as, by definition, it is not sensitive to the current market conditions. However, as the VaR and the SVaR models rely  on  the  same  approach,  they  have  the  same  advantages  and limitations.\n\nThe  relevance  of  the  SVaR  is  regularly  monitored  and  reviewed  by  the Risk Department in charge of the validation of internal models, as second line of defence. The independent review process ends with (i)/uni00A0review and approval Committees and (ii)/uni00A0an Audit Report detailing the scope of the review, the tests performed and their outcomes, the recommendations and the conclusion of the review.  The  model  control  mechanism  gives rise to recurrent reporting to the appropriate authorities.\n\n|",

CRM (Comprehensive Risk Measure), for the same scope as for VaR. As with the VaR model, the approval of the IRC (2) model  was  renewed  in  2020  at  the  Target  Review  of  Internal Models (TRIM).\n\nThey estimate the capital charge on debt instruments that is related to rating  migration  and  issuer  default  risks.  These  capital  charges  are incremental, meaning they are added to the charges calculated based on VaR and SVaR.\n\nIn terms of scope, in compliance with regulatory requirements:\n\n- IRC  is  applied  to  debt  instruments,  other  than  securitisations  and p the  credit  correlation  portfolio.  In  particular,  this  includes  bonds, CDS and related derivatives;\n- CRM exclusively  covers  the  correlation  portfolio, i.e. CDO  tranches p and  First-to-Default  products  (FtD),  as  well  as  their  hedging  using CDS and indices.\n\nSociete  Generale  estimates  these  capital  charges  using  internal models (3) .  These  models  determine  the  loss  that  would  be  incurred following  especially  adverse  scenarios  in  terms  of  rating  changes  or issuer defaults for the year that follows the calculation date, without ageing  the  positions.  IRC  and  CRM  are  calculated  with  a  confidence interval of 99.9%: they represent the highest risk of loss obtained after eliminating 0.1% of the most unfavorable scenarios simulated.\n\nThe internal IRC model simulates rating transitions (including default) for each issuer in the portfolio, over a one-year horizon (4) .  Issuers  are classified into five categories: US-based  companies,  European companies,  companies  from  other  regions,  financial  institutions  and sovereigns.  The  behaviours  of  the  issuers  in  each  category  are\n\ncorrelated  with  one  other  through  a  systemic  factor  specific  to  each category. In addition, a correlation between these five systemic factors is  integrated  to  the  model.  These  correlations,  along  with  the  rating transition  probabilities,  are  calibrated  from  historical  data  observed over the course of a full economic cycle. In case of change in an issuer's rating, the decline or improvement in its financial health is modeled by a shock in its credit spread: negative if the rating improves and positive in  the  opposite  case.  The  price  variation  associated  with  each  IRC scenario is  determined after  revaluation  of  positions via a  sensitivity approach, using the delta, the gamma as well as the level of loss in the event of default (Jump to Default), calculated with the market recovery rate for each position.\n\nThe CRM model simulates issuer's rating transitions in the same way as the internal IRC model. In addition, the dissemination of the following risk factors is taken into account by the model:\n\n- credit spreads; p\n- basis correlations; p\n- recovery rate excluding default (uncertainty about the value of this p rate if the issuer has not defaulted);\n- recovery rate in the event of default (uncertainty about the value of p this rate in case of issuer default);\n- First-to-Default  valuation  correlation  (correlation  of  the  times  of p default used for the valuation of the First-to-Default basket).\n\nThese dissemination models are calibrated from historical data, over a maximum period of ten years. The price variation associated with each CRM scenario is determined thanks to a full repricing of the positions. In addition, the capital charge computed with the CRM model cannot be less than a minimum of 8% of the capital charge determined with the standard method for securitisation positions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

More specifically:\n\n- an  ongoing  monitoring  allows  to  follow  the  adequacy  of  IRC  and p CRM  models  and  of  their  calibration.  This  monitoring  is  based  at least  on  a  yearly  review  of  the  modeling  hypotheses.  As  these metrics are estimated via a 99.9% quantile over a one-year horizon, the low frequency of breaches means that a backtesting as the one performed on VaR model is not possible. In particular,  this  review includes:\n- a check of the adequacy of the structure of the rating transition -matrices used for IRC and CRM models,\n- a  backtesting  of  the  probabilities  of  default  used  for  these  two -models,\n- a check of the adequacy of the models for the dissemination of -recovery rates, spread dissemination and dissemination of basic correlations used in the CRM calculation;\n\nRegarding the checks on the accuracy of these metrics:\n\n- the  IRC  calculation  being  based  on  the  sensitivities  of  each -instrument - delta, gamma - as well as on the level of loss in the event  of  default  (Jump  to  Default)  calculated  with  the  market recovery rate, the accuracy of this approach is checked against a full repricing every six months,\n- such  a  check  on  CRM  is  not  necessary  as  its  computation  is -performed following a full repricing;\n\nTABLE 31: IRC (99.9%) AND CRM (99.9%)\n\n| (In EURm)                          | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Incremental Risk Charge (99.9%)    |              |              |\n| Period start                       | 101          | 93           |\n| Maximum value                      | 205          | 172          |\n| Average value                      | 116          | 103          |\n| Minimum value                      | 51           | /uni00A0 53  |\n| Period end                         | /uni00A067   | 112          |\n| Comprehensive Risk Measure (99.9%) |              |              |\n| Period start                       | 66           | 95           |\n| Maximum value                      | 102          | 462          |\n| Average value                      | 64           | 116          |\n| Minimum value                      | 40           | /uni00A0 51  |\n| Period end                         | 57           | /uni00A0 70  |\n\n|\n\n- these metrics are compared to normative stress tests defined by the p regulator.  In  particular,  the  EBA  stress  test  and  the  risk  appetite exercise  are  performed  regularly  on  the  IRC  metric.  These  stress tests  consist  of  applying  unfavorable  rating  migrations  to  issuers, shocking  credit  spreads  and  shocking  rating  transition  matrices. Other stress tests are also carried out on an ad hoc basis  to  justify the correlation hypotheses between issuers and those made on the rating transition matrix;\n- a weekly analysis of these metrics is carried out by the production p and certification team for market risk metrics;\n- the  methodology  and  its  implementation  have  been  initially p validated  by  the  French  Prudential  and  Resolution  Supervisory Authority  ( Autorit\u00e9  de  contr\u00f4le  prudentiel  et  de  r\u00e9solution -  ACPR). Thereafter, a review of the IRC and the CRM is regularly carried out by  the  Risk  Department  in  charge  of  the  validation  of  internal models as second line of defence. This independent review process ends  with  (i)/uni00A0review  and  approval  Committees  and  (ii)/uni00A0an  Audit Report  detailing  the  scope  of  the  review,  the  tests  performed  and their  outcomes,  the  recommendations  and  the  conclusion  of  the review.  The  model  control  mechanism  gives  rise  to  recurrent reporting to the appropriate authorities.\n\nMoreover, regular operational checks are performed on the completeness of the scope's coverage as well as the quality of the data describing the positions.",

The trading interest is documented as part of the traders' mandates.\n\nThe prudential classification of instruments and positions is governed as follows:\n\n- the Finance  Department's  prudential  regulation  experts  are p responsible for translating the regulations into procedures, together with the Risk Department for procedures related to holding period and liquidity. They also analyse specific cases and exceptions. They share these procedures to the business lines;\n- the business lines comply with these procedures. In particular, they p document the trading interest of the positions taken by traders;\n- the  Finance  and  Risk  Departments  are  in  charge  of  the  control p framework.\n\nThe following controls are implemented in order to ensure that activities are managed in accordance with their prudential classification:\n\n- new product process: any new product or activity is subject to an p approval  process  that  covers  its  prudential  classification  and regulatory capital treatment for transactions subject to validation;\n- holding period: the Market Risk Department has designed a control p framework for the holding period of certain instruments;\n- liquidity:  on  a  case-by-case  basis  or  on  demand,  the  Market  Risk p Department  performs  liquidity  controls  based  on  certain  criteria (negotiability/transferability, bid/ask size, market volumes,/uni00A0etc.);\n- strict  process  for  any  change  in  prudential  classification,  involving p the business line and the Finance and Risk Divisions;\n- internal  audit:  through  its  various  periodic  assignments,  Internal p Audit  verifies  or  questions  the  consistency  of  the  prudential classification  with  policies/procedures  as  well  as  the  suitability  of the prudential treatment in light of existing regulations.\n\n## Quantitative information\n\nAlmost  90%  of  Societe  Generale  capital  requirements  related  to market  risk  are  determined  using  an  internal  model  approach.  The standard approach is mainly used for the Collective Investment Units (CIU), for securitisation positions, but also for the positions presenting a foreign exchange risk, which are not part of the trading book, as well as for the Group's subsidiaries that do not have access to the core IT tools  developed  internally.  The  main  entities  concerned  are  some International Retail Banking and Financial Services entities such as SG Maroc, Rosbank, BRD, SG Tunisie, SG Alg\u00e9rie,/uni00A0etc.\n\nCapital requirements for market risk decreased in 2021. This decline is reflected in most components:\n\n- VaR continued its year-over-year decline, which began at the end of p 2020, reaching historically low levels in Q4. This decline is reflected in all activities, including interest rates, credit and equity;\n- IRC and CRM, whose decrease is mainly due to the reduction in debt p instruments positions by the front office;\n- RWAs calculated under the standard approach, which have mainly p benefited  from  a  reduction  in  interest  rate  risk  especially  to  the reduced exposure of several subsidiaries.\n\nThe  increase  in  capital  requirements  for  risk  assessed  for  ownership positions can be explained by both the front office activity (positions in options) and methodological changes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This  Committee,  chaired  by  the  Finance Department  and  organised  by  its  valuation  expert  team  (Valuation Group) has global accountability with respect to the approval of the valuation policies;\n- on  a  quarterly  basis,  the  Global  Valuation  Review  Committee, p chaired  by  the  Finance  Department,  reviews  changes  in  reserves, valuation adjustment figures, and related accounting impacts. This analytical review is performed by the Valuation Group.\n\nThe  topics  related  to  Prudent  Valuation  are  dealt  with  during methodological  committees  and  validation  committees,  organised quarterly,  and  both  chaired  by  the  Finance  Department  and  both attended  by  representatives  of  the  Global  Markets  Division  and  the Market Risk Department.\n\nLastly,  a  Valuation  Policy  describes  the  valuation  framework  and  its governance, specifying the breakdown of responsibilities between the stakeholders.\n\n## Valuation principles and associated controls\n\nIn  terms  of  valuation,  market  products  are  marked  to  market,  when such market prices exist; otherwise, they are valued using parameter-based  models,  in  compliance  with  the  IFRS/uni00A013  principles defining fair value.\n\nOn the one hand, each model designed by the front office is subject to independent validation by the Market Risks Department as second line of defence that especially checks the theoretical aspects of the model (relevance  of  the  hypotheses,  analytical  calculations,  numerical methods), its performance (for instance in case of stressed conditions) and its implementation in systems. Following this review, the validation status of the model, its scope of use and the recommendations to be dealt with are formalised in a report.\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  the  parameters  used  in  the  valuation  models  whether  or  not  they  come  from  observable  data  -  are  subject  to controls by the Market Risks Department and the Finance Department (Independent Price Verification).\n\nIf necessary,  the  valuations  are  supplemented  by  reserves  or adjustments  (this  mainly  concerns  liquidity,  parameter  or  model uncertainties)  using  calculation  methods  developed  in  consultation with the front office, which are subject to approval by the Market Risk Department and the Finance Department during the Global Valuation Committees.\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nFurthermore, regarding the prudential component, Additional Valuation  Adjustments  (AVAs)  are  computed  on  fair  value  assets,  in compliance with the Regulatory Technical  Standards  (RTS)  published by  the  European  Banking  Authority  (EBA),  which  lay  out  the requirements related to Prudent Valuation, in addition to the principles already  specified  in  the  CRD  (Capital  Requirements  Directive).  These Regulatory Technical Standards define the various uncertainties which have to be taken into account in the Prudent Valuation and set a target level of confidence to reach.\n\nWithin this framework, in order to take into account the various factors which could generate additional exit costs compared to the expected valuation (model risk, concentration risk, liquidation cost, uncertainty on  market  prices,/uni00A0etc.),  Prudent  Valuation  Adjustments  (PVAs)  are computed  for  each  exposure.  The  Additional  Valuation  Adjustments (AVAs)  are  defined  as  the  difference  between  the  Prudent  Valuation obtained  and  the  accounting  fair  value  of  the  positions,  in  order  to comply  with  the  target  level  of  confidence  to  reach  (the  confidence interval is equal to 90%). These amounts of AVA are deducted from the Common Equity Tier/uni00A01 capital.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The  regional  hubs  report back  to  the  department,  providing  all  information  necessary  for  a consolidated  overview  of  the  Bank's  risk  profile  that  is  holistic, prospective  and  valid  for  both  internal  oversight  purposes  and regulatory reporting.\n\nThe  regional  hubs  are  responsible  for  implementing  the  Operational Risk  Division's  briefs  in  accordance  with  the  demands  of  their  local regulators.\n\nThe Operational Risk Department communicates with the first line of defence through a network of operational risk correspondents in each Business /Service Units.\n\nConcerning  risks  specifically  linked  to  business  continuity,  crisis management  and  information,  of  persons  and  property,  the Operational  Risk  Department  carries  out  the  critical  review  of  the management  of  these  risks  in  connection  with  the  Group  Security Division. Specifically, regarding  IT risks, the Operational  Risk Department carries out the critical review of the management of these risks  in  connection  with  the  Resources  and  Digital  Transformation Department.\n\n## Second-level control\n\nLevel  2  control  consists  of  verifying  the  definition  and  actual performance of level 1 controls, and in particular the examination of the results of level 1 controls in quantitative and qualitative aspects, in particular  with  regard  to  completion  rate,  anomaly  levels,  etc.  This review also ensures the effectiveness and relevance of the deployment of  controls  by  control  needs  and  risk  type  and  of  corrective  action plans.\n\nAccording to the internal control system, the level 2 permanent control Risk teams carry out this mission on the risks operational covering the risks  specific  to  the  various  businesses  (including  operational  risks related to credit risks and market risks), as well as the risks associated with  purchases,  communication,  real  estate,  human  resources  and information system.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Risk related to security of persons and property\n\nProtecting  persons  and  property,  and  compliance  with  the  laws  and regulations  governing  security  are  major  objectives  for  Societe Generale  group.  It  is  the  mission  of  the  Group  Security  Division  to manage  human,  organisational  and  technical  frameworks  that guarantee the smooth operational functioning of the Group in France and  internationally,  by  reducing  exposure  to  threats  (in  terms  of security and safety) and reducing their impact in the event of crisis.\n\nThe security  of  persons  and  property  encompasses  two  very  specific areas:\n\n- Security  is  all  the  human,  organisational  and  technical  resources p brought  together  to  deal  with  technical,  physical,  chemical  and environmental accidents that can harm people and property,\n- Safety  is  all  the  human,  organisational  and  technical  resources p brought together to deal with spontaneous or thoughtful acts aimed at harming or impairing with the aim of psychic or / and financial profit.\n\nThus, in this context, the Security of persons and property ensures in particular:\n\n- the  application  of  the  security  benchmark  in  the  design  and p operation of our buildings;\n- drafting  and  updating  of  procedures  and  security  instructions  on p each of our sites;\n- drafting  of  security  programs  and  acceptance  of  the  work  of  this p security equipment;\n- the management of operations in operational security; p\n- management of events affecting the physical security of employees, p buildings or datacenters;\n- securing travel and special events; p\n- good respect for the protection of national defense secrets as far as p the Group is concerned;\n- development of travel policy and its control; p\n- development of country risk mapping; p\n- conducting safety and security audits, especially for sensitive sites; p\n- management of significant events and major crises; p\n- expatriates training. p\n\nThe management of all these risks is based on operational risk systems and the second line of defence is provided by the Risk Department.\n\n## Risks related to information security and information and communication technologies\n\nGiven the importance for the Group of its information system and the data  it  conveys  and  the  continuous  increase  in  the  cybercriminal threat, the risks related to information and communication technologies and to security (ICT) are major for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Generale. Their supervision, integrated into the general operational risk management system,  is  steered  as  the  first  line  of  defence  by  a  dedicated  area  of expertise  (Information  and  Information  Systems  Security  -  ISS)  and the second line of defence is provided by the Risk Department. They are subject to specific monitoring by the management bodies through sessions  dedicated  to  Group  governance  (Risk  Committee,  CORISQ,\n\nCCCIG,  DTCO)  and  a  quarterly  dashboard  which  presents  the  risk situation  and  action  plans  on  the  eight  main  themes  of  information and communication technologies risks.\n\nThe  Department  Security  of  the  Group,  housed  within  the  General Secretariat, is responsible for protecting information. The information provided by customers, employees and also the collective knowledge and  know-how  of  the  bank  constitute  Societe  Generale's  most valuable information resources. To this end, it is  necessary  to  put  in place  the  human,  organisational  and  technical  mechanisms  which make  it  possible  to  protect  the  information  and  ensure  that  it  is handled, disseminated, shared by only the people who need to know. To  this  end,  the  Group  safety/security  department  ensures  in particular:\n\n- the publication and maintenance of the Group information security p policy which encompasses both human and technical aspects;\n- the  publication  and  maintenance,  with  the  teams  of  legal  experts p and the Group's human resources functions, of the 'Charter for the Protection of Information and IT Resources';\n- the  co-construction  with  the  Service  Unit  Resources  &  Digital p Transformation  of  the  Data-Protection  program,  which  aims  to provide employees with a tool for classifying and protecting office documents,  to  promote  good  practices  in  the  classification  of information  and  in  the  use  of  property  tools  adapted  to  the sensitivity of documents;\n- the  mapping  of  the  most  sensitive  information  of  the  Group p (information classified C3-Secret);\n- the  awareness  raising  of  information  security  through  a  set  of p permanent actions promoting employee ownership of information security issues: distribution of an e-learning on information security to all of the Group's employees in France and abroad, conferences, specific workshops on the risks associated with social engineering, on the use of social networks, etc..\n\nThe person in charge of risks related to information and communication technologies (ICT) and security of information systems is  housed  at  the  Corporate  Resources  and  Digital  Transformation Division.  Under  the  functional  authority  of  the  Director  of  Group Security,  he  recommends  the  strategy  to  protect  digital  information and heads up the IT security department. The IT security framework is aligned with the market standards (NIST, ISO 27002), and implemented in each Business /Service Unit.\n\nRisk  management  associated  with  cybercrime  is  carried  out  through the tri-annual Information Systems Security (ISS) master plan.\n\nIn order to take into account the evolution of the threat, in particular that  related  to  ransomware,  and  in  line  with  the  Group  strategy,  the ISS  2021-2023  master  plan  is  structured,  with  a  budget  of  EUR  650 million  over  the  period  2021-2023,  around  two  pillars  that  guide actions by 2023:\n\n- protect  the  data  of  our  customers  and  our  ability  to  operate  the p banking services, by integrating the threats, the requirements of the regulators, and the need to support the Business Units and Service Units in their digital transformation and the evolution of uses that accompanies it. A risk-based approach allows us to concentrate our efforts  on  the  most  critical  elements  and  data,  in  connection  with the work of the Security Department cited above. We are preparing to  manage  a  major  cyber  crisis  by  improving  in  particular  our detection  capacity,  our  ability  to  control  our  IT  links  with  our partners and subsidiaries, and our ability to rebuild the information system;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

In particular  by  developing  the  management  of  the  cyber  security department, by optimising our processes and our tools to be able to deploy new protections at constant cost. Finally, by working on the management of human resources in the filiere, in particular on the development of skills and networks of expertise.\n\nAt  the  operational  level,  the  Group  relies  on  a  CERT  (Computer Emergency Response Team) unit in charge of incident management, security  watch  and  the  fight  against  cybercrime.  This  team  uses multiple  sources  of  information  and  monitoring,  both  internal  and external.  Since  2018,  this  unit  has  also  been  strengthened  by  the establishment of an internal Red Team whose main tasks are to assess the  effectiveness  of  the  security  systems  deployed  and  to  test  the detection and reaction capabilities of the defence teams (Blue Teams) during  an  exercise  simulating  a  real  attack.  The  services  of  the  Red Team  enable  the  Group  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  the weaknesses in the security of the Societe Generale information system, to help in the implementation of global improvement strategies, and also to train cybersecurity defence teams. CERT works closely with the Security  Operation  Center  (SOC),  which  is  in  charge  of  detecting security events and processing them.\n\nA team at the Resources and Digital Transformation Department is in charge  of  the  consistency  of  the  implementation  of  operational  risk management  systems  and  their  consolidation  for  IT  processes.  The main tasks of the team are as follows:\n\n- identify  and  evaluate  the  major  IT  risks  for  the  Group,  including p extreme  risk  scenarios  (eg.  cyberattack,  failure  of  a  provider),  to enable  the  Bank  to  improve  its  knowledge  of  its  risks,  be  better prepared  for  extreme  risk  scenarios  and  better  align  their investments with their IT risks;\n- produce the indicators that feed the IT risks monitoring dashboard, p intended  for management  bodies  and  Information  Systems directors.  They  are  reviewed  regularly  with  the  second  line  of defence in order to remain aligned with the IS and SSI strategy and their objectives;\n- more  generally,  ensure  the  quality  and  reliability  of  all  devices p addressing  IT  operational  risks.  Particular  attention  is  paid  to  the permanent  control  system  for  its  IT  risks,  which  is  based  on  the definition of normative IT and security controls and the support of the  Group  in  the  deployment  of  managerial  supervision  on  this\n\ntopic. As part of the 'PCT' program to transform permanent control, the normative controls were reviewed, i.e. around thirty controls on IS/SSI  subjects.  The  IT  Department  monitors  the  deployment  of these  controls  across  the  Group,  the  progress  of  which  is  aligned with the objectives set by the Group.\n\nIn  terms  of  awareness,  a  multilingual  online  training  module  on information security is mandatory for all internal Group staff and for all service  providers  who  use  or  access  our  information  system.  It  was updated  in  early  2020  in  order  to  incorporate  changes  to  the  new Group Information Security Policy. At the end of August 2021, 98% of Societe  Generale  group  employees who were notified of the training module had performed it.\n\n## Risks related to fraud and non-authorized market activies (rogue trading)\n\nThe  supervision  of  fraud  risk,  whether  internal  or  external,  is integrated  into  the  general  operational  risk  management  framework which allows the identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring of the risk, whether it is potential or actual.\n\nIt  is  steered  in  the  first  line  of  defense  by  dedicated  expert  teams dedicated  to  fraud  risks  management  in  addition  to  the  teams  in charge of operational risk management specific to each of the banking businesses.  These  teams  are  in  charge  of  the  definition  and operational  implementation  of  the  means  of  raising  awareness, preventing,  detecting  and  dealing  with  frauds.  The  second  line  of defense is provided by the Operational Risks Department with a fraud risk manager. The second line defines and verifies compliance with the principles of fraud risk management in conjunction with the first line teams, and ensures that the appropriate governance is in place.\n\nFinally,  the  teams,  whether  they  are  in  the  first  or  second  line  of defense,  work  jointly  with  teams  of  experts  in  charge  of  information security, the fight against cyber crime, customer knowledge, the fight against  corruption  and  money  laundering.  Likewise,  the  teams  work closely  with  the  teams  in  charge  of  credit  risk  and  market  risk.  The sharing of information contributes to the identification and increased responsiveness in the presence of a situation of proven fraud or weak signals.  This  active  collaboration  makes  it  possible  to  initiate investigative  measures,  blocking  attempted  fraud  or  initiating  the recovery of funds or the activation of guarantees, associated insurance in the event of successful fraud.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISK MONITORING PROCESS 4.8.2\n\nThe Group's main frameworks for controlling operational risks are as follows:\n\n- collection of internal losses and significant incidents and analysis of p external losses;\n- self-assessment of risks and controls; p\n- oversight of risk indicators; p\n- development of scenario analyses; p\n- framing new products; p\n- management of outsourced services; p\n- crisis management and business continuity; p\n- management  of  risks  related  to  information  and  communication p technologies.\n\n## Collection of internal loss and significant incident data\n\nInternal losses have been compiled throughout the Group since 2003, in addition to significant incident data since 2019. The process:\n\n- defines and implements the appropriate corrective actions; p\n- achieves a deeper understanding of risk areas; p\n- enhances awareness and vigilance with respect to operational risks p in the Group.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "Losses  (or  gains  or  near-misses)  are  reported  from  a  minimum threshold  of  EUR/uni00A010,000/uni00A0throughout  the  Group,  except  for  global market activities, where the threshold is EUR/uni00A020,000.\n\nIncidents  without  financial  impact  are  also  reported  when  they  are deemed  significant  according  to  their  impact,  in  particular  on contractual  commitments,  reputation,  day-to-day  operations,  risk appetite or the level of regulatory compliance of the Group.\n\n## Analysis of external losses\n\nExternal  losses  are  data  that  are  public  and  /  or  shared  within  the banking  sector,  in  particular  within  consortia  frameworks.  These external data include information on the amount of actual losses, the importance of the activity at the origin of these losses, the causes and circumstances and any additional information that could be used by other establishments to assess the relevance of the event as far as they are  concerned  and  enrich  the  identification  and  assessment  of  the Group's operational risk.\n\n## Risk and control self-assessment\n\nUnder  the  Risk  and  Control  Self-Assessment  (RCSA),  each  manager assesses the exposure to operational risks to which each entity within the  relevant  scope  is  exposed  through  the  activities  in  order  to improve their management.\n\nThe  method  defined  by  the  Group  consists  of  taking  a  homogeneous approach to identifying and evaluating operational risks and frameworks to  control  these  risks,  in  order  to  guarantee  consistency  of  results  at Group level. It is based notably on repositories of activities and risks in order to facilitate a comprehensive assessment.\n\nThe objectives are as follows:\n\n- identifying  and  assessing  the  major  operational  risks  (in  average p amount  and  frequency  of  potential  loss)  to  which  each  activity  is exposed (the  intrinsic  risks,  i.e.  those  inherent  in  the  nature  of  an activity, while disregarding prevention and control systems). Where necessary, risk mapping  established  by  the  functions  (e.g. Compliance, Information Systems Security, etc.) contributes to this assessment of intrinsic risks;\n- assessing  the  quality  of  major  risk  prevention  and  mitigation p measures;\n- assessing  the  risk  exposure  of  each  activity  that  remains  once  the p risk prevention and mitigation measures are taken into account (the 'residual risk'), while disregarding insurance coverage;\n- remedying any shortcomings in the prevention and control systems, p by  implementing  corrective  action  plans  and  defining  key  risk indicators;  if  necessary,  in  the  absence  of  an  action  plan,  risk acceptance will be formally validated by the appropriate hierarchical level;\n- adapting the risk insurance strategy, if necessary. p\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the risk assessment also feeds on the results of other  operational  risk  management frameworks in order to ensure a relevant  and  consistent  assessment.  The  assessment  methods  for certain risks are increasingly based on in-depth approaches adapted to the  type  of  underlying  risk  while  incorporating  the  results  on assessment  scales  and  shared  benchmarks  allowing  the  comparison and prioritization of areas of risks or scope of activities.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\nKey  risk  indicators  (KRIs)  supplement  the  overall  operational  risk management system by providing a dynamic view (warning system) of changes in business risk profiles.\n\nTheir follow-up provides managers of entities with a regular measure of improvements or deteriorations in the risk and the environment of prevention and control.\n\nA  cross  analysis  of  Group-level  KRIs  and  losses  is  presented  to  the Group's  Executive  Committee  on  a  quarterly  basis via a  specific dashboard.\n\n## Analyses of scenarios\n\nThe analyses of scenarios serve two purposes: informing the Group of potential significant areas of risk and contributing to the calculation of the capital required to cover operational risks.\n\nThese  analyses  make  it  possible  to  build  an  expert  opinion  on  a distribution  of  losses  for  each  risk  category  and  thus  to  measure  the exposure to potential losses in scenarios of very severe severity, which can be included in the calculation of the prudential capital requirements.\n\nIn practice, various scenarios are reviewed by experts who gauge the severity  and  frequency  of  the  potential  impacts  for  the  Group  by factoring  in  internal  and  external  loss  data  as  well  as  the  internal framework  (controls  and  prevention  systems)  and  the  external environment  (regulatory,  business,/uni00A0etc.).  Analyzes  are  carried  out either at Group level (transversal scenarios) or at business level.\n\nGovernance is established in particular, to:\n\n- allow the approval of the annual scenarios update program by the p Risk Committee (CORISQ);\n- allow the approval of the scenarios by the businesses (for example p during  the  internal  control  coordination  committees  of  the departments concerned or during ad hoc meetings) and a challenge of scenario analyses by LOD2;\n- conduct an overall review of the Group's risk hierarchy and of the p suitability of the scenarios through CORISQ.\n\n## New product Committees\n\nEach division submits its plans for a new product for customers to the New Product Committee.\n\nThe  Committee,  jointly  coordinated  by  the  Risk  Division  and  the relevant  businesses,  is  a  decision-making  body  which  decides  the production and marketing conditions of new products to customers.\n\nThe  Committee  aims  to  ensure  that,  before  any  product  launch,  all types  of  induced  risks  (credit,  market,  liquidity  and  refinancing, country,  operational,  legal,  accounting,  tax,  financial,  information systems  risks  as  well  as  the  risks  of  non-compliance,  reputation, protection  of  personal  data  and  corporate  social  and  environmental responsibility  risks,/uni00A0etc.) have  been  identified,  assessed  and,  if necessary, subjected to mitigation measures allowing the acceptance of residual risks.\n\nThe  definition  of  'new  product'  extends  from  the  creation  of  a  new product or service to the development of an existing product or service as  soon  as  this  development  is  likely  to  generate  different  or  higher risks.  The  development  may  be  linked  to  matters  such  as  a  new regulatory environment, to marketing on a new scope or to a new type of clientele.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

These  two  subcontracting channels are supervised in a manner adapted to the risks.\n\n- A  framework  with  standards  and  a  tool  helps  ensure  that  the operational  risk  linked  to  outsourcing  is  controlled,  and  that  the conditions set by the Group's approval are respected.\n- It  helps  to  map  the  Group's  outsourcing with an identification of the activities and BU/SU concerned, and to put outsourcing under control with knowledge of risks and with suitable supervision.\n\nDuring  the  study  phase,  the  business/service  units  decide  on  the outsourcing of services within the framework of standards set by the Group.  Outsourcing  projects  are  led  by  a  project  manager  and validated by the sponsor who accepts the residual risk level after a risk analysis based on expert opinions. This ensures the consistency of the assessments and the consistency of decisions across the Group.\n\nThe analysis includes operational risks (including fraud, execution risk, etc.),  tax,  non-compliance,  supplier,  business  continuity  risks,  risks related  to  data  quality,  and  risks  related  to  information  security  and data protection.\n\nLegal  experts  use  the  same  definition  of  essential  outsourcing  of services as that defined in the Decree of 3 November 2014.\n\nAll outsourced services are then monitored at a frequency defined by their level of risk.\n\nServices  at  Group  level  are  subject  to  reinforced  monitoring  through very  regular  contractual  monitoring.  These  services  are  identified using criteria such as the concept of 'core business activity', financial impact  and  reputation  risk.  These  services  are  validated  by  a dedicated Committee, chaired by the Operational Risk Department.\n\nA closing phase is used to manage the ends of services.\n\nThe  reinforcement  of  the  system  will  continue  in  2022,  in  particular with the addition of clarifications on the methodological framework, a greater involvement of senior management in the supervision of this risk and the intensification of the role of the 2nd line of defense in the management, review and control of outsourced services.\n\n## Crisis management and business continuity\n\nBusiness  continuity  is  managed  by  developing  in  each  Societe Generale  group  entity,  organisations,  procedures  and  resources  that can deal with natural or accidental damage, or acts of deliberate harm, with  a  view  to  protect  their  personnel,  assets  and  activities  and  to allow  the  provision  of  essential  services  to  continue,  if  necessary temporarily in reduced form, then restoring service to normal.\n\nThe aim is not only to meet regulatory obligations but also to minimise as far as possible any harm to personnel, clients or infrastructure and so  preserve  intact  the  Group's  image,  goodwill,  brands,  products, procedures  and  know-how  and  limit  the  impact  of  events  on  the Group's financial position and solvency.\n\nBased on the identification of threats to the Group and their possible effects  and,  making  due  allowance  for  preventative,  protective  and dissuasive measures, management of business continuity consists of:\n\n- defining various crisis scenarios, including extreme shocks; p\n- being able to respond efficiently to these scenarios of crisis, loss or p unavailability of human or operational resources;\n- maintaining  these  frameworks  to  ensure  they  remain  efficient p (reviewing the appropriateness of scenarios, allowing for changes to the organisation, adjustments to resources, functional tests).\n\nThe  approach  used  to  implement  and  track  the  business  continuity systems of each Group entity is based on a methodology that meets international standards.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISK MEASUREMENT 4.8.3\n\nSince  2004,  Societe  Generale  has  used  the  Advanced  Measurement Approach  (AMA)  allowed  by  the  Capital  Requirements  Directive  to measure  operational  risk.  This  approach,  implemented  across the/uni00A0main Group entities, notably makes it possible to:\n\n- identify the businesses that have the greatest risk exposures; p\n- identify the types of risk that have the greatest impact on the/uni00A0Group's p risk profile and overall capital requirements;\n- enhance the Group's management of operational risks. p\n\n## Operational risk modeling\n\nThe statistical method used by the Group for operational risk modeling is  based  on  the  Loss  Distribution  Approach  (LDA)  for  AMA  internal model.\n\nThe frequency and severity of operational risks, based on past internal losses,  external  losses,  the  internal  and  external  environment,  and scenario analyses, are estimated and the distribution of annual losses is  calculated  for  each  segment.  This  approach  is  supplemented  by cross-business scenario analyses that measure cross-business risks for core businesses, such as cybercriminality and the flooding of the river Seine.\n\nAside  from  the  individual  risks  associated  with  each  segment  or cross-business  scenario  analysis,  the  model  takes  into  account  the diversification  between  the  various  types  of  risk  and  the  core businesses, dependency effects between extreme risks as well as the effect of insurance policies taken out by the Group.\n\nThe  Group's  regulatory  capital  requirements  for  operational  risks within the scope covered by the (AMA) internal model are then defined as the 99.9% quantile of the Group's annual loss distribution.\n\nUnder this  approach,  operational  risks  are  modeled  using  segments, each segment representing a type of risk and a Group core business.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "For some Group entities, notably in retail banking activities abroad, the standard method is applied: the calculation of capital requirements is defined as the average over the last three years of a financial aggregate based on the Product Net Banking multiplied by factors defined by the regulator and corresponding to each category of activity. To make the calculation, all of the Group's business lines are broken down into the eight regulatory activities.\n\nSociete Generale's total capital requirements for operational risks were EUR/uni00A03.7/uni00A0billion at  the  end  of  2021,  representing  EUR/uni00A047/uni00A0billion  in risk-weighted assets. This assessment includes the capital requirement of AMA and Standard perimeters.\n\n## Insurance cover in risk modeling\n\nIn  accordance  with  regulations,  Societe  Generale  incorporates  risk cover  provided  by  insurance  policies  when  calculating  regulatory capital  requirements  for  operational  risks,  within  the  limit  of  20%  of said requirements. These insurance policies cover part of the Group's major risks, i.e.  civil  liability,  fraud,  fire  and  theft,  as  well  as  systems interruptions.\n\nRisk reduction through insurance policies resulted in a 6.5% decrease in total capital requirements for operational risks.\n\n## Quantitative data\n\nThe following charts break down operating losses by risk category for the 2017-2021 period.\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES: BREAKDOWN BY SOCIETE GENERALE RISK EVENT TYPE - AMOUNTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver  the  past  five  years,  Societe  Generale's  operational  risks  were concentrated  on  average  on  five  types,  accounting  for  93%  of  the Group's total operating losses:\n\n- fraud and other criminal activities represented 32% of the amount of p operating  losses  over  the  period.  They  are  mainly  composed  of external  frauds  on  financing  files  (falsified  financial  statements  by the  client,  theft  or  misappropriation  of  collateral/guarantees,/uni00A0etc.), fraud on manual means of payment (cash, transfer and cheque) and supplier  fraud  on  financed  equipment;  the  trend  is  downward  in 2021 due in particular to a lower loss experience in external fraud on financing files;\n- execution  errors  represented  20%  of  total  operational  losses, p thereby constituting the second leading cause of loss for the Group. After two consecutive years of increase (including the Covid effect in 2020), the amount of losses in this category is falling back to values close to the average; the proper execution of the remediation plans explains the decline observed in 2021;\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISK LOSSES: BREAKDOWN BY SOCIETE GENERALE RISK EVENT TYPE - NUMBER OF EVENTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- litigation  with  authorities,  the  third  largest  category,  represented p 17%  of  the  Group's  operational  losses  over  the  period;  the  2021 provisions relate to files born before 2016;\n- pricing  or  risk  assessment  errors,  including  model  risk,  represent p 13%  of  the  total  amount  of  losses.  The  main  cases  concern  the pricing and ALM models;\n- commercial disputes represented 11% of total Group operating losses. p The  trend  is  down  for  this  category  over  the  period  considered;  the 2021 provisions mainly relate to files born before 2015.\n\nThe  other  categories  of  Group  operational  risk  (activities  not authorised  on  the  markets,  system  interruptions,  loss  of  operating environment/capability) were still relatively insignificant, representing 6% of the Group's losses on average over the 2017 to 2021 period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Policies  are  taken  out  with  leading insurers.  Where  required  by  local  legislation,  local  policies  are  taken out,  which  are  then  reinsured  by  insurers  that  are  part  of  the  global program.\n\nIn addition, special insurance policies may be taken out by entities that perform specific activities.\n\nA Group internal reinsurance company intervenes in several policies in order  to  pool  high-frequency,  low-level  risks  between  entities.  This approach contributes to the improvement of the Group's knowledge and management of its risks.\n\n## Description of main general risk coverage\n\nBuildings  and  their  contents,  including  IT  equipment,  are  insured  at their  replacement  value.  The  guarantee  covering  acts  of  terrorism abroad has been renewed.\n\nLiability  other  than  professional  liability  (i.e.  relating  to  operations, Chief Executive Officers and Directors, etc.) are covered. The amounts insured  vary  from  country  to  country,  according  to  operating requirements.\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Description of main risks arising from operations\n\nInsurance is only one of the measures used to offset the consequences of  the  risks  inherent  in  the  Group's  activity.  It  complements  the Group's risk management policy.\n\n## THEFT/FRAUD\n\nThese  risks  are  included  in  the  'Banker's  Blanket  Bond'  policy  that insures all the Group's financial activities around the world.\n\nInternal  fraud  (committed by an employee or by a third party acting with the aid of an employee) and external fraud (committed by a third party acting alone), with the intent to obtain illicit personal gain or to harm the Group, are covered.\n\n## PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY\n\nThe  consequences  of  any  legal  on  staff  or  managers  in  the  Group's professional activities are insured under a global policy.\n\n## CYBER ATTACKS\n\nA cyber risk insurance policy has been taken out amid an environment not specific to the banking sector which is seeing a rapid development of new forms of crime mainly involving data theft or the compromise or destruction of computer systems.",

Structural  and  market exposures  constitute  the  Group's  total  interest  rate  and  exchange rate/uni00A0exposure.\n\nThe general principle is to reduce structural interest rate and exchange rate  risks  to  the  greatest  possible  extent  within  the  consolidated entities. Within  the  entities,  commercial  and  corporate  centre operations must therefore be matched in terms of interest rates and exchange  rates  as  much  as  possible.  At  the  consolidated  level,  a structural  foreign  exchange  position  is  maintained  in  order  to minimise the sensitivity of the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio to exchange rates fluctuations.\n\n## ORGANISATION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF STRUCTURAL 4.9.1 INTEREST RATE AND EXCHANGE RATE RISKS\n\nThe principles and standards for managing these risks are defined at the  Group  level.  The  entities  are  first  and  foremost  responsible  for managing  these  risks.  The  ALM  (Asset  and  Liability  Management) Department  within  the  Group's  Finance  Division  leads  the  control framework of the first line of defense. The ALM department of the Risk Department assumes the role of second line of defense supervision.\n\n## The Group Finance Committee, a General Management Body\n\nThe purpose of the Group Finance Committee is to:\n\n- validate  and  ensure  the  adequacy  of  the  system  for  monitoring, p managing and supervising structural risks;\n- review changes in the Group's structural risks through consolidated p reporting;\n- review and validate the measures proposed. p\n\n## The ALM Department, within the Group's Finance Department\n\nThe ALM (Asset and Liability Management) Department is responsible for:\n\n- defining  the  structural  risk  policies  for  the  Group  and  formalising p risk appetite;\n- analysing the Group's structural risk exposure and defining hedging p strategies;\n- monitoring the regulatory environment concerning structural risk; p\n- defining the ALM principles for the Group; p\n- defining  the  modelling  principles  applied  by  the  Group's  entities p regarding structural risks;\n- identifying, consolidating and reporting on Group structural risks; p\n- monitoring compliance with structural risk limits. p\n\n## The ALM Risk Control Department within the Risk division\n\nThe second-level supervision of the ALM models used within the Group and  of  associated  frameworks  is  provided  by  a  dedicated  service within  the  Risk  department,  the  Asset  Liability  Management  Risk  Structural and Liquidity Risk department. Accordingly, this department is in charge of:\n\n- defining the steering indicators and overall stress test scenarios of p the different types of structural risks and setting the main limits for the  business  divisions  and  the  entities  and  Business  Units (BU)/Service Units (SU);\n- defining  the  normative  environment  of  the  structural  risk  metrics, p modelling and framing methods;\n- reviewing  the  ALM  models  by  delegation  of  the  Model  Risk p Management department.\n\nFinally,  the  Risk  Department  chairs  the  Group  model  validation Committee and the Group ALM norms validation Committee.\n\n## The entities and BU/SU are responsible for ALM risk management\n\nEach  entity,  each  BU/SU,  manages  its  structural  risks  and  is responsible  for  regularly  assessing  risks  incurred,  producing  the  risk report and developing and implementing hedging options. Each entity, each BU/SU is required to comply with Group standards and to adhere to the limits assigned to it.\n\nAs such, the entities and the BUs/SUs apply the standards defined at Group level and develop the models, with the support of the central modelling teams of the Finance Department.\n\nAn  dedicated  ALM  manager  reporting  to  the  Finance  Department  in each entity, BU/SU, is responsible for monitoring these risks (first-level control).  This  manager  is  responsible  for  reporting  ALM  risks  to  the Group  Finance  Department.  All  entities,  BU/SU,  have  an  ALM Committee responsible for implementing validated models, managing exposure  to  interest  rate  and  exchange  rate  risks  and  implementing hedging programmes in accordance with the principles set out by the Group  and  the  limits  validated  by  the  Finance  Committee  and  the BU/SU ALM Committees.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## STRUCTURAL INTEREST RATE RISK 4.9.2\n\nStructural  interest  rate  risk  is  generated  by  commercial  transactions and their hedging, as well as the management operations specific to each of the consolidated entities.\n\n## The Group's objective\n\nThe objective of managing structural interest rate risk is to reduce of exposure of each Group entity as much as possible.\n\nTo  this  end,  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  Finance  Committee  and  the ALM Committee set sensitivity limits (in terms of value and income) for the Group, the BUs/SUs and the entities respectively.\n\n## Measuring and monitoring structural interest rate risk\n\nSociete  Generale  uses  several  indicators  to  measure  the  Group's overall interest rate risk.\n\nThe three most important indicators are:\n\n- the sensitivity of the net present value (NPV) to the risk of interest p rate  mismatch. It  is  measured  as  the  sensitivity  of  the  net  present value of the static balance sheet to a change in interest rates. This measure  is  calculated  for  all  currencies  to  which  the  Group  is exposed;\n- the sensitivity of the interest margin to changes in interest rates in p various interest rate scenarios. It takes into account the sensitivity generated by future commercial production;\n- the sensitivity of NPV to basis risk (risk associated with decorrelation p between different variable rate indices).\n\nLimits  on  these  indicators  are  applicable  to  the  Group,  the  BUs/SUs and the various entities.  Limits  are  set  for  shocks  at  +/-0.1%  and  for stressed  shocks  (+/-1%  for  value  sensitivity  and  +/-2%  for  income sensitivity)  without  floor  application.  Only  the  sensitivity  of  income over  the  first  two  years  is  framed.  The  measurements  are  computed monthly  10  months  a  year  (with  the  exception  of  the  months  of January  and  July  for  which  no  Group-level  closing  is  acheved).  An additional synthetic measurement of value sensitivity - all currencies is framed for the Group. To comply with these frameworks, the entities combine several possible approaches:\n\n- orientation  of  the  commercial  policy  so  as  to  offset  interest  rate p positions taken on the asset and liability side;\n- implementation of a swap operation or - failing this in the absence p of such a market - use of a loan/borrowing operation;\n- purchase/sale of options on the market to cover optional positions p taken vis-\u00e0-vis our clients.\n\nAssets and liabilities are analysed without a prior allocation of resources to uses. Maturities of outstanding amounts are determined by taking into account the contractual characteristics of the transactions, adjusted for the  results  of  customer  behaviour  modelling  (in  particular  for  demand deposits,  savings  and  early  loan  repayments),  possibly  differentiated according to the rate scenario considered, as well as a certain number of disposal agreements, in particular on equity items.\n\nAs  of  31  December,  the  modeling  of  deposits  with  no  maturity  date, sometimes  integrating  a  dependence  on  the  rate  level,  leads  to  an average duration of 4.5 years, with a maximum duration of 20 years.\n\nChanges in OCI or P&L of instruments recognised at fair value are not included in the controlled income sensitivity measures.\n\nHedging  transactions  are  mainly  documented  from  an  accounting viewpoint: this can be carried out either as micro-hedging (individual hedging  of  commercial  transactions  and  hedging  instruments)  or  as macro-hedging  under  the  IAS  39  'carve-out'  arrangement  (global backing  of  portfolios  of  similar  commercial  transactions  within  a Treasury  Department;  macro-hedging  concerns  essentially  French retail network entities).\n\nMacro-hedging derivatives are essentially interest rate swaps in order to maintain networks' net asset value and result sensitivity within limit frameworks,  considering  hypotheses  applied.  For  macro-hedging documentation, the hedged item is an identified portion of a portfolio of commercial client or interbank operations. Conditions to respect in order to document hedging relationships are reminded in Note 3.2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nMacro-hedging  derivatives  are  allocated  to  separate  portfolios according  to  whether  they  are  used  to  hedge  fixed-rate  assets  or liabilities in the accounting books. The hedging instrument portfolios allocated to liability elements are net fixed-rate receiver/variable-rate payer  whereas  the  hedging  instrument  portfolios  allocated  to  asset elements are net fixed-rate payer/variable-rate receiver.\n\nThe non-over-hedging tests and hedged items non-disappearing tests make the link between the balance sheet available assets or liabilities outstanding  and  the  amount  of  assets  and  liabilities  outstanding designated  as  hedged.  The  prospective  non-over-hedging  test  is satisfied  when the net outstanding amount of the swaps is lower for each  maturity  band  and  on  each  measurement  date  than  the determined outstanding amount of items eligible to fair value hedge. The estimated outstanding may be defined as the outstanding amount resulting from ALM projections. The non-over-hedging a posteriori test is  performed in two stages: the first stage is the same as the a priori test  but  on  the  outstanding  amount  eligible  to  fair  value  hedge  on closing date, new production excluded, then the second stage is called the  non-disappearance  of  the  hedged  item  test  and  consists  in verifying that the hedgeable position is always at least as significant as the maximum position that had initially been hedged.\n\nThe  effectiveness  of  the  hedge  is  then  determined  using  the  dollar offset method. The sources of ineffectiveness result from the last fixing of  the  variable  leg  of  the  hedging  swaps,  the  bi-curve  valorisation  of the  collateralised  hedging  instruments,  possible  mismatches  in  the cash  flows  payment  dates  and  counterparty  risk  on  hedging instruments valorisation.\n\nThe  Group's  sensitivity  to  VAN  at  31  December  2021  was  EUR  -20 million (for an instantaneous and parallel increase in interest rates of 0.1%). \u25b2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

In the event of a parallel rise in the yield curve of +10 bps,  it  is  positive  and  represents  approximately  1%  of  net  banking income.\n\nThe sensitivity of the net interest margin is mainly due to the impact on:\n\n- customer  deposits:  generally  low  or  non-interest-bearing,  with p customer  rates  only  partially  impacted  by  interest  rate  changes, their margin is mainly the result of the replacement rate;\n- new credit loan production. p\n\nThe  sensitivity  of  the  margin  on  the  stock  of  customer  transactions results from the renewal of matured tranches of deposit replacements and  the  residual  sensitivity  of  the  balance  sheet  to  interest  rate changes.\n\nFrench Retail Banking's activities in France and abroad are favourably exposed by a rise in interest rates over the first three years enabling them  to  replace  their  deposits  at  higher  rates,  with  the  margin  on loans  in  stock  remaining  stable.  However,  this  increase  in  margin  is partially offset by higher refinancing costs.\n\nRetail Banking activities are unfavourably exposed to the decrease in rates as their deposits are then replaced at lower rates and the margin on loans in stock decreases due to early repayments. This decline in margin was partially offset by lower refinancing costs.\n\nCalculations are based on the aggregate estimates at 31 December of consolidated entities of the Group.\n\n| (In EURm)                                    | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Parallel increase in interest rates of 10 bp |              |              |\n| Year 1                                       | 27           | 62           |\n| Year 2                                       | 84           | 107          |\n| Year 3                                       | 153          | 184          |\n| Parallel decrease in interest rates of 10 bp |              |              |\n| Year 1                                       | (7)          | (74)         |\n| Year 2                                       | (85)         | (124)        |\n| Year 3                                       | (148)        | (201)        |\n\n|",

FX  positions  generated  by  an imperfect hedge are valued through other comprehensive income;\n- exposures  related  to  activities  made  by  entities  in  currencies  that p are not their reporting currency.\n\nThe Group's policy is to make the CET1 ratio insensitive to fluctuations in exchange rates against the euro.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the CET1 ratio amounted to 13.53%. Of the EUR 363 billion in RWA, EUR 111 billion relates to exposures in currencies other than the/uni00A0euro.\n\n## As such:\n\n- Group entities are asked to individually hedge the results related to p activities in currencies other than their reporting currency;\n- the  exposures  related  to  net  investments  in  foreign  currencies  and p the  associated  net  results  are  partially  hedged  at  central  level.  A position  in  each  foreign  currency  generating  RWA  is  intentionally maintained open by the Finance Department at the Group CET1 ratio targeted level. Hedges are realised using cash lending and borrowing, forward  and  swap  instruments  in  the  subsidiaries'  currencies  and accounted  for  as  net  investment  hedges  (see  Note  3.2.2  of consolidated financial statements in chapter 6);\n- the Group's net consolidated structural foreign exchange position as p at  31  December 2021 is equivalent to EUR 12,832 million, of which 45% comes from the USD, and around 79% is concentrated  in  six currencies: USD, GBP, RUB, CZK, MAD and XOF.\n\nFor each currency, the difference between actual and target exposure is governed by limits validated by the General Management in Finance Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimilarly, the sensitivities of the CET1 ratio to shocks of +/-10bps per currency are

It is measured across different time horizons, under various assumptions (normal conditions and stressed scenarios). Funding risk is defined as the risk that the Group cannot maintain over time the appropriate amount of funding to support its assets and at a reasonable cost.\n\n## OBJECTIVES AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES 4.10.1\n\nThe liquidity and funding management set up at Societe Generale aims at ensuring that the Group can (i) fulfil its payment obligations at any moment  in  time,  during  normal  course  of  business  or  under  lasting financial  stress  conditions  (management  of  liquidity  risks)  ;  (ii)  raise funding  resources  in  a  sustainable  manner,  at  a  reasonable  cost (management  of  funding  risks).  Doing  so,  the  liquidity  and  funding management  set  up  ensures  that  both  regulatory  requirements  and the risk appetite set by the Group are met.\n\nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  Societe  Generale  has  adopted  the following guiding principles:\n\n- mutualising resources, optimising costs and ensuring consistent risk p management by centralising liquidity and funding management at the  Corporate  centre  level,  mainly  in  the  name  of  the  mother company  (Societe  Generale  SA).  For  that  purpose,  Business  Units have tight constraints in terms of the transformation position they can  run,  hence  need  to  match  their  assets  and  liabilities  by transacting  with  the  Corporate  centre,  along  a  Funds  Transfer Pricing  mechanism.  Assets  or  liabilities  which  do  not  have  a  set contractual  maturity  (e.g.  sight  deposits)  have  their  maturity assessed along quantitative models or conventions proposed by the Finance Division and by the Business Units and validated by the Risk Division (see below);\n- planning for funding resources in consideration of both the business p development  objectives  and  the  risk  appetite  set  by  the  Board  of Directors. See below the 'Funding Plan' chapter in section 2;\n- ensuring  that  funding  risks  are  mitigated  through  a  proper p diversification of funding resources in terms of currencies, investor pools,  maturity  buckets,  liability  format  (e.g.  benchmark  bond issuance, with a split along various seniority levels, issuance in the form  of  structured  notes,  issuance  in  the  form  of  unsecured  and secured notes). In order to optimise funding costs, the majority of bond  issuance  is  made  in  the  name  of  the  mother  company. However,  a  degree  of  diversification  is  sought  by  leveraging  the capacity  of  some  subsidiaries  to  raise  funds  in  a  way  which complements the mother company's funding, i.e. raising funds from local investors in local currencies;\n- ensuring  that  Societe  Generale  keeps  liquid  reserves  in  sufficient p amount to comply with the survival horizon under stress set by the Board of Directors. Liquid reserves are in the form of cash held at central  banks  and  highly  liquid  securities,  split  between  the Banking Book (under the direct or indirect ownership of the Group Treasury  Department)  or  the  Trading  Book  (mainly  within  the Global  Markets  division,  under  a  permanent  control  of  the  Group Treasury Department);\n- ensuring Societe Generale has readily available remediation options p to face potential stress situations, through a Group-wide contingency  plan  (which  leaves  aside  insurance  activities,  which have their separate contingency arrangements) aimed at detecting any stress signals at an early stage and defining in advance the crisis management setup and mitigation options.\n\n## THE GROUP'S PRINCIPLES AND APPROACH TO LIQUIDITY 4.10.2 RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe  key  operational  steps  of  liquidity  and  funding  management  are as/uni00A0follows:\n\n- risk  identification is  a  process which is set out and documented by p the Risk Department, in charge of establishing a mapping of liquidity risks. This process is conducted yearly with each Business Unit and within  the  Group  Treasury  Department,  aimed  at  screening  all material risks and checking their proper measurement and capturing the control framework. In addition, a Reverse Stress Testing process exists,  which  aims  at  identifying  and  quantifying  the  risk  drivers which  may  weigh  most  on  the  liquidity  profile  under  assumptions even more severe than used in the regular stress test/uni00A0metrics;\n- definition,  implementation and periodic review of liquidity models p and conventions used to assess the duration of assets and liabilities without a set contractual maturity and to assess the liquidity profile under stress. Liquidity models are managed along the overall Model Risk Management governance, also applicable to other risk factors (market, credit, operational), controlled by the Group Risk division;\n\n- definition of risk appetite: The Board of Directors validates, on the p proposal  of  General  Management,  the  limits  and  associated  alert thresholds, which are then applied to the businesses. Liquidity risk risk appetite covers the following metrics:\n- key regulatory indicators (LCR, with a specific focus on the LCR in -US dollar, and NSFR),\n- the  footprint  of  the  Group  in  Short-Term  Wholesale  funding -markets,\n- the survival horizon under an adverse stress scenario, combining -a severe market and systemic shock and an idiosyncratic shock. In  addition  to  the  main  adverse  scenario,  Societe  Generale also checks its survival horizon under an extreme stress scenario. For both scenarios, the idiosyncratic shock is characterised by one of its  main  consequences,  which  would  be  an  immediate  3-notch downgrade  of  Societe  Generale's  long-term  rating.  In  such adverse or extreme scenarios, the liquidity position of the Group is assessed over time, taking into account the negative impacts of the scenarios, such as deposit outflows, drawing by clients of the committed  facilities  provided  by  Societe  Generale,  increase  in margin  calls  related  to  derivatives  portfolios,  etc.  The  survival horizon  is  the  moment  in  time  when  the  net  liquidity  position under such assumptions becomes negative,",

In particular, the General Management chairs the Finance  Committee,  held  every  6  weeks  and  attended  by representatives  from  the  Finance  and  Risk  Departments  and Business  Units,  which  is  responsible  for  monitoring  structural risks and managing scarce resources:\n\n\u00b7\n\n- validation  and  monitoring  of  the  set  of  limits  for  structural risks, including liquidity risk,\n- monitoring  of  budget  targets  and  decisions  in  case  of  a deviation from the budget,\n\nreassessed on a weekly basis and can be analysed along multiple axes (per  product,  Business  Unit,  currency,  legal  entity).  Each  key  metric (LCR,  NSFR,  transformation  positions,  net  liquidity  position  under combined stress) is reviewed formally on a monthly basis by the Group Finance and Risk divisions. Forecasts are made and revised weekly by the Strategic and Financial Steering Department and reviewed during a Weekly Liquidity Committee chaired by the Head of Group Treasury. This Weekly Liquidity Committee gives tactical instructions to Business Units,  with  the  objective  to  adjust  in  permanence  the  liquidity  and funding risk profile, within the limits and taking into account business requirements and market conditions;\n\n- preparation  of  a  Contingency  Funding  Plan,  which  is  applicable p Group-wide,  and  provides  for:  (i)  a  set  of  early  warning  indicators (e.g.  market  parameters  or  internal  indicators);  (ii)  the  operating model and governance to be adopted in case of an activation of a crisis  management mode (and the interplay with other regimes, in particular Recovery management); (iii) the main remediation actions to be considered as part of the crisis management.\n\nThese various operational steps are part of the ILAAP (Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process) framework of Societe/uni00A0Generale.\n\nEvery  year,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  produces  for  its  supervisor,  the  European Central  Bank  (ECB),  a  self-assessment  of  the  liquidity  risk  framework  in which  key  liquidity  and  funding  risks  are  identified,  quantified  and analysed  with  both  a  backward  and  a  multi-year  forward-looking perspective.  The  adequacy  self-assessment  also  describes  qualitatively the  risk  management  set  up  (methods,  processes,  resources,  etc.), supplemented by an assessment of the adequacy of the Group's liquidity.\n\n\u00b7\n\n- definition  of  principles  and  methods  related  to  liquidity  risk management (e.g. definition of stress scenarios),\n- assessment of any regulatory changes and their impacts;\n\n\u00b7\n\n- the Group Finance Department, which is responsible for the liquidity p and  funding  risks  as  First  Line  of  Defence,  interacting  closely  with Business  Units.  Within  the  Group  Finance  Department,  there  are three main departments involved respectively in the preparation and implementation of decisions taken by the abovementioned bodies:\n- the  Strategic  and  Financial  Steering  Department  is  responsible -for  framing  and  overseeing  management  of  the  Group's  scarce resources,  including  liquidity,  within  the  Group's  risk  appetite and budget targets,\n- the Group Treasury Department is in charge of all aspects of the -operational  management  of  liquidity  and  funding  across  the Group,  including  managing  the  liquidity  position,  executing  the funding  plan,  supervising  and  coordinating  treasury  functions, providing  operational  expertise  in  target  setting,  managing  the liquidity reserves and the collateral used in funding transactions, managing the corporate centre,\n- the  Asset  and  Liability  Management  Department  is  in  charge  of -modelling  and  monitoring  structural  risks,  including  liquidity  risk alongside  interest  rate  and  foreign  exchange  risks  in  the  Banking Book;\n- also  sitting  with  the  Group  Finance  Department,  the  Metrics p Production  Department  runs  the  management  information  system regarding  liquidity  and  funding  risks  across  the  Group.  For  liquidity metrics, the Group relies on a centralised system architecture, with all Business  Units  feeding  a  central  data  repository  from  which  all metrics are produced, either regulatory metrics (e.g. the LCR or the NSFR) or metrics used for internal steering (e.g. stress test indicators);\n- the ALM Risk Department, which performs all second line of defense p functions, in particular leads the risk identification process, designs the  structure  and  the  calibration  of  the  liquidity  and  funding  risks control framework and monitors compliance with related thresholds and limits. It also validates liquidity models and conventions.\n\n\u00b7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The reserve assets are available, i.e. not used in guarantee or as collateral on any transaction. They are included in the reserve after applying a haircut to reflect their expected valuation under stress. The Group's liquidity reserve contains assets that can be freely transferred within the Group or used to cover subsidiaries' liquidity outflows in the event  of  a  crisis:  non-transferable  excess  cash  (according  to  the regulatory ratio definition) in subsidiaries is therefore not included in the Group's liquidity reserve.\n\nThe liquidity reserve includes:\n\n- central bank deposits, excluding mandatory reserves; p\n- High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLAs), which are securities that can be p quickly monetised  on  the  market  via  sale  or repurchase\n\ntransactions; these include government bonds, corporate bonds and equities listed on major indices (after haircuts). These HQLAs meet the  eligibility  criteria  for  the  LCR,  according  to  the  most  recent standards known and published by regulators. The haircuts applied to HQLA securities are in line with those indicated in the most recent known texts on determining the numerator of the LCR;\n\n- non-HQLA  Group  assets  that  are  central  bank-eligible,  including p receivables  as  well  as  covered  bonds  and  securitisations  of  Group receivables held by the Group.\n\nThe  composition  of  the  liquidity  reserve  is  reviewed  regularly  by  a special  committee  comprising  the  Finance  Department,  the  Risk Department and the Management of the MARK Business Unit, and is adjusted by authorisation of the Finance Committee.\n\nTABLE 38: LIQUIDITY RESERVE\n\n| (In EURbn)                                                               |   31.12.2021 |   31.12.2020 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Central bank deposits (excluding mandatory reserves)                     |          168 |          154 |\n| HQLA securities available and transferable on the market (after haircut) |           58 |           82 |\n| Other available central bank-eligible assets (after haircut)             |            3 |            7 |\n| TOTAL                                                                    |          229 |          243 |\n\n## REGULATORY RATIOS 4.10.5\n\nThe Basel Committee recommends the international implementation of two standard ratios with harmonised parameters to regulate bank liquidity risk profiles:\n\n- the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) aims to ensure that banks hold p sufficient liquid assets or cash to survive a significant stress scenario combining a market crisis  and  a  specific  crisis  and  lasting  for  one month;\n- the  Net  Stable  Funding  Ratio  (NSFR)  is  a  transformation  ratio  which p compares funding needs with stable resources over a one-year period.\n\nThe European transposition of Basel 3, CRD4 and CRR1 published on 27  June  2013  has  been  amended  by  Directive  2019/878  of  the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 (CRD5) and the Capital  Requirements  Regulation:  Regulation  (EU)  2019/876  of  the\n\nEuropean  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  20  May  2019  (CRR2).  Its French version was published in the Official Journal on 7 June 2019.\n\nThe LCR regulation issued on 10 October 2014 has since been updated by  a  Delegated  Act  which  entered  into  force  on  30  April  2020.  The corresponding  minimum  requirement  was  set  at  100%  from 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02018.\n\nThe  NSFR  requirement  included  in  the  CRR2  (EU)  2019/876  of 20/uni00A0May/uni00A02019  entered into force in June 2021. The required level stands at/uni00A0100%.\n\nSince the implementation of the European regulatory LCR requirement in October 2015, Societe Generale's LCR has consistently stood at over 100%. The LCR was 129% at end-2021 ( vs . 149% at end-2020). Since the NSFR  intered  into  force,  it  has  consistently  stood  at  over  100%  and stands at 110% at end-2021.\n\n|",

These  rules  aim  to  ensure  a  transparent  and  balanced  relationship between  the  Bank  and  all  of  its  stakeholders.  Compliance  is  the cornerstone of trust between the Bank, its customers, its supervisors and its staff.\n\nCompliance  with  rules  is  the  responsibility  of  all  Group  employees, who must demonstrate compliance and integrity on a daily basis. The rules must be clearly expressed, and staff have been informed and/or trained to understand them properly.\n\nThe  compliance  risk  prevention  system  is  based  on  shared responsibility  between  the  operational  entities  and  the  Group Compliance Department:\n\n- the  operational  entities  (BU/SUs)  must  incorporate  into  their  daily p activities  compliance  with  laws  and  regulations,  the  rules  of professional best practice and the Group's internal rules;\n- the Compliance Department manages the Group's compliance risk p prevention  system.  It  ensures  the  system's  consistency  and efficiency, while  also  developing  appropriate  relationships  alongside  the  General  Secretary  -  with  bank  supervisors  and regulators. This independent department reports directly to General Management.\n\nTo support the businesses and supervise the system, the Compliance Department is organised into:\n\n- Standards  and  Consolidation  teams responsible  for  defining  the p normative  system  and  oversight  guidelines,  consolidating  them  at Group  level,  as  well  as  defining  the  target  operational  model  for each compliance risk;\n\n## Financial Security\n\nRegulatory risks\n\nData and Digital\n\nCompliance has set up an extensive compulsory training programme for  each  of  these  risk  categories,  designed  to  raise  awareness  of compliance risks among all or some employees. The training has been completed by high-level employees within the Group.\n\nIn  addition  to  its  LoD2  function  with  regard  to  the  aforementioned risks,  Compliance  oversees  the  regulatory  system  for  all  regulations applicable to credit institutions, including those implemented by other departments, such as prudential regulations.\n\n- Departmental/business  compliance  teams which  are  aligned p across the Group's major business lines (Corporate and Investment Bank,  French  Retail  Banking,  International  Retail  Banking,  Private Banking  and  Corporate  Divisions),  responsible  for  the  relationship with  BU/SUs,  including  dealflow,  advisory,  and  risk  oversight  of BU/SUs;\n- teams responsible for cross-business functions, including p second-level controls.\n\nThe Compliance Department is organised into three main compliance risk categories:\n\n- financial  security:  Know  Your  Customer  (KYC)  processes;  the p observance  of  international  sanctions  and  embargo  rules,  and anti-money  laundering  and  counter-terrorism  financing  rules, including issuing declarations of suspicion to the relevant authorities where applicable;\n- regulatory  risks:  these  cover  mainly  customer  protection,  market p integrity, anti-bribery and corruption, ethics and conduct, compliance with tax transparency regulations (based on knowledge of  the  customers'  tax  profile),  compliance  with  corporate  social responsibility regulations and Group commitments;\n- data  protection,  including  personal  data,  in  particular  those  of p customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Placed under the responsibility of the Compliance Department, this programme is closely and regularly monitored at the highest bank level. Work carried out in this regard has made it possible to redefine a standardised normative framework country by country in terms of KYC due diligence, to develop new customer rating models, and to launch an industrialised system for the screening and processing of negative customer news. This allowed the anti-corruption system  to  be  upgraded  in  line  with  the requirements  of  the  French  anti-bribery  agency.  The  transformation programme will be fully implemented by the end of 2022.\n\n## ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND COUNTER-TERRORISM FINANCING (AML/CTF)\n\nThe  Group  has  transposed  all  the  measures  linked  to  Directive  (EU) 2015/849  on  anti-money  laundering  and  counter-terrorism  financing (referred  to  as  \"the  5th  anti-money  laundering  directive\"),  as  well  as European Regulation 2015/847 on the quality of payment information and the Order of 6/uni00A0January 2021 on the system and internal controls to fight money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nThe  system  for  the  detection  of  suspicious  or  unusual  transactions continued  to  be  strengthened  in  2021  with  the  roll-out  of  more sophisticated monitoring tools, the optimisation of scenarios used and the launch of initiatives to switch to new-generation monitoring tools, with priority given to International Retail Banking and Boursorama.\n\n## FINANCIAL EMBARGOES AND SANCTIONS\n\nIn 2021,  the  international  environment  was  impacted  by  the reinforcement  of  US  sanctions  on  China,  with  greater  complexity  in terms  of  implementation  that  may  generate  substantial  operational risks  for  financial  institutions.  More  broadly,  Societe  Generale  Group has confirmed its position to abstain from any trading activity with Iran and to maintain transactions with Russia within a strict framework.\n\nThe  Group  continued  to  strengthen  its  Embargoes/Sanctions  system under  the  established  remedial  programme  following  agreements entered into with the US authorities (see page/uni00A0258), notably in terms of screening  third  parties  and  transactions,  training  employees  and industrialising all processes involved in controlling this risk.\n\n## Regulatory compliance risk\n\n## CUSTOMER PROTECTION\n\nCustomer  protection  is  a  major  challenge  for  the  Societe  Generale Group, which is committed to respecting and protecting the interests of its customers.\n\nThe  prevention  of  financial  vulnerability  (early  detection),  banking inclusion (the right to hold an account) and the replacement or removal of insurance taken out on a real estate loan were priorities in 2021.\n\nInformation provided to customers was strengthened with new rules on ESG (Environmental and Social Governance) labelling and designations.\n\nThe  system  keeping  track  of  obligations  laid  down  in  European consumer protection regulations (MIF2 and the Insurance Directive or DDA)  is  in  place  for  product  governance  and  advisory,  as  well  as  to ensure compliance with information requirements.\n\nIn  an  environment  still  dominated  by  the  health  and  social  crisis, significant measures are being implemented in the Group's system in terms of:\n\n- strengthening  internal  rules  regarding  key  aspects  of  customer p protection  (marketing  rules,  cross-border  sales,  customer  claims, conflicts  of  interest,  product  governance,  protection  of  customers' assets, along with compensation and qualification of employees);\n- specific training and increased staff awareness; the importance the p Group places on this issue is largely addressed in the Group's Code of Conduct;\n- adapting  as  a  matter  of  necessity  existing  tools  to  new  regulatory p requirements,  in  particular  the  Shareholder  Rights  Directive/uni00A0II (SRD2), applicable as of 2021.\n\n## Customer claims\n\nProcessing  a  claim  is  a  commercial  act  that  impacts  customer satisfaction. Accordingly, it has received much coverage in the Code of Conduct.\n\nThe 'Customer claim processing' Group instruction incorporates the recommendations  of  the  national  supervisor  (French  Prudential Supervisory  and  Resolution  Authority  -  ACPR)  and  the  regulatory requirements  (MIF2,  DDA  and  DSP  -  the  Payment  Services  Directive) relative  to  the  strengthening  of  customer  protection  measures  at European level. The bank's businesses have an ad hoc governance, an organisation, human resources and applications, formalised procedures, and quantitative and qualitative monitoring indicators.\n\nIndependent mediation supplements this internal system. Mediation, a measure  aimed  at  amicable  settlement,  is  brought  to  customers' awareness  on  multiple  information  media,  in  particular  through  a permanent  notice  on  the  back  of  bank  account  statements.  Every entity involved is obliged to comply with the independent mediator's decision.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe  Group  has  a  clear  normative  framework  in  place  to  prevent  and manage  conflicts  of  interest.  This  framework  specifies  the  principles and  mechanisms  that  have  been  implemented.  This  robust  system covers three categories of potential conflicts of interest: those that may arise  between  the  Group  and  its  customers  or  between  the  Group's customers;  those  occurring  between  the  Group  and  its  employees (particularly  in  relation  to  activities  involving  an  employee's  personal interest and/or their professional obligations); and, lastly, those arising between  the  Group  and  its  suppliers.  The  system  has  been supplemented by the reporting of conflicts of interest ( D\u00e9claration des Conflits d'int\u00e9r\u00eats - DACI) required of Group employees most exposed to the risks of corruption.\n\n## Product governance\n\nSystematic reviews ahead of and during the marketing process ensure compliance  with product governance  obligations. As product originator,  Societe  Generale  sets  up  Product  Review  Committees  to ensure  the  target  market  has  been  defined  correctly  and,  if  not,  to adjust it accordingly. As distributor, Societe Generale checks that the criteria  match  the  customers'  situation  and  communicates  with product originators to track products during their life cycle. Updated in 2021, Societe Generale's investment services policy now includes new offers in terms of sustainable finance, the supervision of crypto-assets, and  detailed  notes  on  the  target  markets  of  the  main  instruments produced or distributed by each business.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Vulnerable customers\n\nSociete Generale has established practices and usages to comply with legislation  vis-\u00e0-vis  vulnerable  customers,  in  particular  customers benefiting from the offer tailored to financially vulnerable customers. To contribute to the national effort to boost the purchasing power of French citizens in challenging financial circumstances, the Group has added  to  its  practices  by  introducing  additional  measures  in  2019, notably:  i)  freezing  bank  fees;  ii)  capping  bank  intervention  fees  for vulnerable clients; and iii) organising follow-up and support suited to the  situation  of  customers  experiencing  difficulties  in  the  wake  of recent events. These measures are closely monitored and covered in action plans aimed at identifying financially vulnerable customers.\n\n## MARKET INTEGRITY\n\nThe  main  regulatory  risks  concerning  market  integrity  involve  the following:\n\n- interest rate benchmarks; p\n- market  manipulation  and  the  protection  of  privileged  information p (market abuse regulations);\n- regulations  for  transparency  and  to  reduce  the  systemic  risk p inherent in over-the-counter ('OTC') derivatives;\n- separation  of  proprietary  trading  by  banks  (US  Volcker  Rule  and p French Banking Law on the Separation and Regulation of Banking Activities).\n\nThe overall system for hedging Market Integrity risk was strengthened in  2021,  in  particular  with  respect  to  processes  and  controls  on  OTC derivatives activities in accordance with the relevant regulations, and on preventive measures concerning personal staff transactions.\n\n## Market abuse\n\nThe system continued to be strengthened in 2021 with the extension and improvement of tools identifying market manipulation risks and an extensive employee training programme on the subject.\n\nRegarding  staff  transactions,  Societe  Generale  implemented  a  new pre-authorisation tool based on classifying employees in terms of their exposure to confidential information on investment services customers or on the Bank as issuer.\n\nRegarding market indices: the Group has implemented an action plan to monitor contributions to benchmarks and ensure their Group-wide administration.  In  addition  to  contributions  to benchmark  indices and the administration of indices, the use of indices has been subject to regulatory restrictions since January/uni00A02020. This system is monitored Group-wide.\n\nThe  year  was  also  characterised  by  the  Group's  preparation  for  the IBOR transition in order to replace IBOR interest rate benchmarks with alternative, risk-free rates.\n\n## Separation of banking activities\n\nThe US Volcker Rule - which established a prohibition in principle for certain institutions in the financial services sector, such as the Societe Generale  Group,  to  conduct  speculative  trading  and  hold  covered funds (1) on its own account - was subject to two major amendments in 2019 and 2020. These amendments ease the Societe Generale Group's regulatory obligations.\n\nThe  system  overseeing  compliance  with  the  Volcker  Rule  and  the Separation  and  Regulation  of  Banking  Activities  Act  has  been  made permanent and stabilised following the aforementioned developments in  2020.  Moreover,  the  system  providing  a  regulatory  framework  for market  activities  (regarding  activity  indicators,  in  particular)  was reformed in March/uni00A02019 (Order of 18/uni00A0March 2019). These changes were incorporated into the internal normative and control system.\n\n## OTC derivatives\n\nRegulatory risks related to derivatives market activities are covered by European  regulations  (MIFIR,  EMIR  regulation)  and  US  regulations (Dodd-Frank Act).\n\nThese regulations remain subject to changes. Combined with business and  technological  developments,  they  require  constant  updates  and adjustments to the compliance management system. The year 2021 was characterised by the continued implementation of new requirements.\n\n## Transaction reporting\n\nIn  light  of  the  many  regulatory  requirements attached to transaction reporting,  and  regulators'  heightened  interest  in  the  quality  of  such reports, Societe Generale is continuing to deploy a new Group policy dedicated to  mandatory compliance reporting (including transaction reporting).  This  policy  defines  the  governance  and  control  standards applicable to these reports.\n\n## COMPLIANCE/TAX TRANSPARENCY\n\nSociete  Generale  Group's  principles  on  combating  tax  evasion  are governed  by  the  Tax  Code  of  Conduct.  The  Code  was  updated  in March/uni00A02017  and  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors  after  review  by  the Executive  Committee. It  is  a  public  document  and  can  be  consulted  on the Bank's institutional investor portal (https://www.societegenerale.com/ sites/default/files/documents/Code%20de%20conduite/tax\\_code\\_of\\_ conduct\\_of\\_societe\\_generale\\_group\\_uk.pdf) .\n\nThe five main principles of the Code of Conduct are as follows:\n\n- Societe Generale ensures compliance with the tax rules applicable p to  its  business  in  all  countries  where  the  Group  operates,  in accordance with international conventions and national laws;\n- in its customer  relationships,  Societe  Generale  ensures  that p customers  are  informed  of  their  tax  obligations  relating  to transactions  carried  out  with  the  Group,  and  the  Group  complies with the reporting obligations that apply to it as bookkeeper or in any other way;\n- in its relations with the tax authorities, Societe Generale is committed p to  strictly  respecting  tax  procedures  and  ensures  that  it  maintains open and transparent relations to maintain its reputation;\n- Societe  Generale  does  not  encourage  or  promote  tax  evasion  for p itself, its subsidiaries or its customers;\n- Societe  Generale  has  a  tax  policy  in  line  with  its  strategy  of p sustainable  profitability  and  refrains  from  any  operation,  whether for  its  own  account  or  for  its  customers,  whose  main  purpose  or effect is tax motivated, unless this is consistent with the intention of the legislation.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  annually  reviews  the  application  of  the  Code and the procedures and systems in place within the Group to ensure that  new products and new establishments comply with the Group's tax principles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

No Group entity is authorised in a state or territory on the official French list  of  ETNCs  ( \u00c9tats  et  territoires  non  coop\u00e9ratifs in  French) (1) and internal rules have been in place since 2003 to monitor an expanded list of countries or territories.\n\nThe  Group  follows  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and Development's  (OECD)  transfer  pricing  standards.  However,  local constraints  may  require  deviations  from  OECD  methodologies,  in which case the local constraints must be documented.\n\nThe Group publishes information on its entities and activities annually on  a  country-by-country  basis (Section  2.12  -  page/uni00A058) and  confirms that its presence in a number of countries is for commercial purposes only,  and  not  to  benefit  from  special  tax  provisions.  The  Group  also complies with the tax transparency rules for its own account (CbCR country-by-Country Reporting).\n\nThe  Group  is  fully  committed  to  implementing  regulations  aimed  at ensuring  tax  transparency  for  its  customers'  accounts  (in  particular FATCA and the Common Reporting Standard - CRS, DAC6).\n\nSome  of  the  tax  regulations  define  tax  transparency  requirements. FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act), CRS (Common Reporting Standard),  QI  (Qualified  Intermediary)  and  DAC6  (Directive  on Administrative  Cooperation/uni00A06)  regulations  have  the  common  goal  of combating  fraud  and  tax  evasion  by  customers.  The  risks  borne  by financial  institutions  are  financial,  commercial  and  reputational  in nature.  The  Group's  main  challenges  involve  adapting  to  regulatory developments,  which  are  becoming  increasingly  stringent  over  the years, and strengthening its control systems.\n\nSociete  Generale  complies  with  tax  transparency  standards.  The Common  Reporting  Standard  (CRS)  enables  tax  authorities  to  be systematically  informed  of  income  received  abroad  by  their  tax residents, including where the accounts are held in asset management structures. Moreover, Societe Generale complies with the requirements  of  the  United  States  FATCA  (Foreign  Account  Tax Compliance Act), which aims to combat tax evasion involving foreign accounts  or  entities  held  by  US  taxpayers.  Non-US  financial intermediaries  are  thus  responsible  for  identifying  US  taxpayers  in their  customer  base  in  order  to  declare  the  income  received  by  said taxpayers, directly or indirectly, to the US tax administration, thereby enabling an automatic reconciliation with their individual tax returns. The tax transparency objectives have been achieved by generating a tax report filed at national level and sharing tax information between partner  countries  on  the  basis  of  existing  bilateral  tax  treaties  and inter-governmental agreements (IGAs).\n\nLastly,  the  Group  has  implemented  the  new  European  Directive  on transparency between intermediaries (referred to as DAC6), which will require  the  reporting  of  cross-border  tax  arrangements.  The  Group Compliance  Division  has  supported  the  Group  Tax  Department  in implementing  DAC6,  more  specifically  the  D/uni00A0regulatory marker regarding  schemes  aimed  at  circumventing  the  CRS  and  those involving opaque chains of beneficial owners.\n\nImportantly,  the  account-keeping  entities  of  the  Private  Banking business line are established exclusively in countries with the strictest tax  transparency  rules  imposed  by  G20/uni00A0member  countries  and  the OECD. These countries ratified the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance  in  Tax  Matters,  introduced  the  automatic  exchange  of information  in  financial  accounts  (CRS)  and  obtained  the  'largely compliant'  and  'compliant'  rating  as  part  of  the  peer  review  process conducted  under  the  aegis  of  the  OECD.  Assets  deposited  in  Private\n\nBanking books are subject to enhanced scrutiny using comprehensive due diligence procedures to ensure they are tax compliant.\n\nIn  accordance  with  regulatory  requirements,  Societe  Generale  also includes tax fraud in its anti-money laundering procedures.\n\n## ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES\n\nSociete  Generale  is  fully  committed  to  fighting  corruption  and  has given  clear  undertakings  in  this  respect  by  participating  in  the Wolfsberg Group and the Global Compact.\n\nThe  Group  applies  strict  principles  that  are  included  in  its  Code  of Conduct and its 'Anti-Corruption and Influence Peddling Code'.\n\nSociete  Generale's  anti-corruption  programme  is  built  around  the following themes:\n\n- code of conduct; p\n- risk mapping; p\n- appropriate  training  at  all  levels  (senior  management,  exposed p persons, all employees);\n- control systems; p\n- accounting procedures; p\n- evaluation of third parties; p\n- disciplinary system; p\n- right to whistleblow. p\n\nWithin this context, processes and tools continue to be strengthened with the provision of staff dedicated to anti-corruption practices within the Group, and the creation of monitoring indicators and new controls - including accounting and operational controls to reduce the risk of corruption.\n\nThe  Group's  anti-corruption  instructions  have  been  revised  and expanded  to  include  a  new  version  of  the  Anti-Corruption  and Influence  Peddling  Code,  which  was  incorporated  into  the  Internal Rules in April/uni00A02021.\n\nThe Societe Generale Group now has several tools at its disposal, such as  the  tool  for  declaring  gifts  and  invitations  (GEMS),  the  tool  for whistleblowing  management  (WhistleB),  and  the  annual  conflict  of interest declaration tool (DACI).\n\nTraining measures have been strengthened, in particular with respect to  persons  most  exposed  to  the  risk  of  corruption,  accounting controllers,  and  members  of  General  Management  and  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nThird-party knowledge procedures have been improved, with special focus on intermediaries, as well as the introduction of due diligence for suppliers  and  associations  benefiting  from  donations  or  sponsorship initiatives.\n\n## CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nEuropean  financial  regulations  have  seen  significant  changes  from  a social and environmental perspective, in particular with the entry into force  in  March/uni00A02021 of Regulation  (EU)  2019/2088  -  SFDR  on sustainability-related  disclosures  in  the  financial  services  sector,  and the  Taxonomy  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852  on  the  establishment  of  a framework  to  facilitate  sustainable  investment.  The  Compliance Division  is  developing  the  normative  framework  relative  to  the European  Union  regulations  on  sustainable  investment.  A  dedicated programme is  helping  the  business  lines  to  comply  with  regulations and is producing deliverables pertaining to normative documentation, training, controls and supervision.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "Over and above the regulations, the Group is making voluntary, public commitments  in  this  area.  To  manage  the  implementation  of  the environmental  and  social  risk  management  system  and  ensure  the Group's commitments are upheld, the Compliance Division has taken the following measures:\n\n- developing normative controls; p\n- deploying e-learning on environmental and social risk management. p The training was made compulsory for all employees having a direct or indirect relationship with corporate customers. Moreover, specific workshops  were  conducted  with  targeted  employees  in  the Compliance Division to foster an understanding of and compliance with the criteria for applying voluntary commitments;\n- defining  an  environmental  and  social  escalation  procedure  with p respect  to  corporate  customers  to  set  out  the  criteria  requiring business lines to reach out to the Compliance Division and, where applicable,  the  Responsible  Commitments  Committee,  to  connect with a company or during situations likely to present a reputational risk arising from environmental or social factors.\n\n## DATA PROTECTION\n\nAs  a  trusted  partner  of  its  customers,  Societe  Generale  is  especially sensitive to personal data protection.\n\nFollowing  the  entry  into  force  of  the  General  Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR), which increases the Company's obligations and the level of sanctions in case of non-compliance with these obligations (up to  4%  of  revenue),  the  Societe  Generale  Group  has  considerably strengthened its personal data processing management system.\n\nAcross  all  Group  entities,  internal  instructions  and  associated procedures in line with local and European regulations define the rules to  apply  and  the  measures  to  take  to  guarantee  the  protection  and security of customer and staff data. In particular, measures to inform data  subjects  (customers,  employees,  shareholders,  suppliers,/uni00A0etc.) and  process  their  demands  are  in  place  so  that  such  persons  can exercise  their  rights,  notably via dedicated  digital  platforms.  A personal data security policy has been defined, which fits in with the Group's overall security strategy, especially as regards cybersecurity. Moreover, there has been a specific effort to increase staff awareness via dedicated training.\n\nLastly, Societe Generale Group has appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who reports to the Head of Group Compliance and is the main contact person for the Personal Data Protection Authority ( Commission Nationale  de  l'Informatique  et  des  Libert\u00e9s -  CNIL).  The  DPO  is responsible  for  ensuring  sound  Group  compliance  for  personal  data protection. Alongside the network of local DPOs and correspondents throughout  the  Group  entities,  the  DPO  assists  them  with  security issues and personal data usage. As part of his or her duties, the DPO regularly  reviews  a  number  of  indicators,  notably  the  number  and nature  of  requests  by  persons  seeking  to  exercise  their  rights  under GDPR,  the  internal  training  completion  rate,  and  the  local  DPO certification programme.\n\n## Other regulatory risks\n\n## RISK AND COMPENSATION POLICY\n\nIn  keeping  with  the  regulatory  framework  defined  by  European Directive  CRD4,  Societe  Generale  has  had  a  specific  governance  in place to determine variable compensation since the end of 2010. The rules  introduced  by  this  directive  apply  not  only  to  financial  market professionals,  but  to  all  persons  whose  activity  is  likely  to  have  a substantial impact on the risk profile of the institutions which employ them, including those exercising control functions.\n\nThe regulatory framework defined by European Directive CRD4 since 2014  and  by  European  Directive  CRD5  which  has  applied  since 1/uni00A0January  2022  does  not  modify  the  rules  determining  the  variable compensation of persons whose activity is likely to have an impact on the risk profile of the Group and of the employees who exercise control functions. The above-mentioned principles and governance remain in place within the Group.\n\nAccording  to  the  principles  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors  as proposed  by  the  Compensation  Committee,  the  compensation mechanisms  and  processes  for  the  identified  population  not  only factor in the financial results of the transactions undertaken, but also the broader context and how these results are generated, especially in terms  of  control  and  management  of  all  risks  and  adherence  to compliance  rules.  Control  function  employees  are  compensated independently of the results of the transactions that they control, and according to criteria specific to their activity.\n\nVariable compensation includes a non-deferred portion and a deferred portion.  The  acquisition  of  the  deferred  portion  of  the  variable compensation  is  subject  to  three  conditions:  a  minimum  length  of service,  a  minimum  level  of  financial  performance  of  the  Company and/or  the  activity,  and  appropriate  management  of  risks  and compliance (malus and clawback provisions). All deferred variables of the  regulated  population  are  subject  to  a  non-payment  clause  to sanction any excessive risk-taking or behaviour deemed unacceptable. Subject to applicable regulations, a clawback clause enables Societe Generale to request the return of deferred variables, in part or in full, after the holding period and for a five-year period after their allocation was included in the Group's plan for deferred variable compensation allocated for 2021.\n\nAt  least  50%  of  this  compensation  is  paid  in  shares  or  equivalent securities.  The  purpose  of  these  payment  methods  is  to  align  the compensation with the Company's performance and risk horizon.\n\nThe Risk Division and Compliance Division help define and implement this  policy.  In  particular,  every  year  they  independently  assess  the main activities of Wholesale Banking, and of French and International Retail  Banking,  and  the  principal  risk  takers,  together  with  the  desk managers  subject  to  the  Separation  and  Regulation  of  Banking Activities Act and the Volcker Rule in relation to their risk management and  compliance.  These  assessments  are  reviewed  by  General Management and taken into account when determining the amounts of variable compensation.\n\nFurthermore, Societe Generale has implemented a specific system and governance aimed at the holders of trading mandates to ensure that the compensation policy genuinely factors in the requirements of the Separation and Regulation of Banking Activities Act of 26/uni00A0July 2013 and the Volcker Rule.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nIn  keeping  with  our  historical  approach  and  in  accordance  with  the recommendations of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, several regulatory principles - the portion of deferred compensation, the  acquisition  of  which  is  subject  to  conditions  of  presence,  the minimum performance of the Group and the activity, and appropriate risk and compliance management - apply to a wider population than the regulated  population  depending  on  the  level  of  variable compensation, notably across the scope of Wholesale Banking.\n\nIn addition, the Group's annual employee appraisal tool has included a Conduct  and  Compliance  section  since  2018,  enabling  managers  to factor in cases of non-compliant employee behaviour with respect to risk  management,  quality  of  service  and  respecting  customers' interests.  Where  an  employee  has  failed  to  observe  conduct  and compliance rules, the manager must draft and implement a dedicated action plan to assist him or her. The results of this specific appraisal measure  are  crucial  in  determining  the  employee's  career  path  and compensation.\n\nThe  consideration  given  to  risks  in  the  compensation  policy  is presented every year to the Risks Committee and a Director sitting on the Risks Committee also sits on the Compensation Committee.\n\n## Management of reputational risk\n\nThe reputational risk management system is described in the Societe Generale Code.\n\nIt is coordinated by the Compliance Department, which:\n\n- supports the Compliance Control Officers of the businesses in their p strategy  for  preventing,  identifying,  assessing  and  controlling reputational risk;\n- develops  a  reputational  risk  dashboard  that  is  communicated p quarterly to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, based on information  from  the  businesses/Business  Units  and  support functions/Service  Units  (in  particular  the  Human  Resources, Communications,  Legal,  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  and  Data Protection Departments).\n\nMoreover, Chief Compliance Officers dedicated to Business Units take part  in  the  various  bodies  (new  product  Committees, ad  hoc Committees,/uni00A0etc.)  organised  to  approve  new  types  of  transactions, products, projects or customers, and formulate a written opinion as to their  assessment  of  the  level  of  risk  of  the  planned  initiative,  and notably the reputational risk.\n\n## COMPLIANCE REMEDIATION PLAN IN THE WAKE OF AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO WITH FRENCH AND US AUTHORITIES\n\nIn  June/uni00A02018,  Societe  Generale  entered  into  agreements  with  the  US Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  and  the  US  Commodity  Futures  Trading Commission (CFTC) to resolve their investigations into IBOR submissions, and with the DOJ and the French Financial Prosecutions Department  ( Parquet  National  Financier  PNF)  to  resolve  their investigations into certain transactions involving Libyan counterparties.\n\nIn November/uni00A02018, Societe Generale entered into agreements with the US  authorities  to  resolve  their  investigations  into  certain  US  dollar transactions  involving  countries,  persons  or  entities  subject  to  US economic sanctions.\n\nAs  part  of  these  agreements,  the  Bank  committed  to  enhance  its compliance  system  in  order  to  prevent  and  detect  any  violation  of anti-corruption  and  bribery,  market  manipulation  and  US  economic\n\nsanction  regulations,  and  any  violation  of  New  York  state  laws.  The Bank also committed to enhance corporate oversight of its economic sanctions compliance programme.\n\nMoreover,  the  Bank  agreed  with  the  US  Federal  Reserve  to  hire  an independent  consultant  to  assess  the  Bank's  progress  on  the implementation of measures to strengthen its compliance programme with respect to sanctions and embargoes.\n\nTo meet the commitments made by Societe Generale as part of these agreements,  the  Bank  developed  a  programme  to  implement  these commitments  and  strengthen  its  compliance  system  in  the  relevant areas. This programme has been placed under the direct supervision of the Group Head of Compliance. In addition, the programme's Steering Committee  is  chaired  by  a  member  of  the  Bank's  General Management,  and  a  programme  progress  report  is  presented  to  the Board of Directors on a monthly basis.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Programme  was  rolled  out  according  to  the  schedule presented  to  the  internal  Governance  bodies  and  the  various authorities  who  have  received  regular  reports  on  the  progress  of remedial  actions.  Moreover,  the  external  audits  provided  for  in  the agreements have been conducted or are under way.\n\nOn 30/uni00A0November and 2/uni00A0December 2021, the US federal court confirmed the termination of legal proceedings by the DOJ, which confirmed that Societe  Generale  complied  with  obligations  relating  to  the  deferred prosecution  agreements  (DPA)  of  June  and  November/uni00A02018.  In December/uni00A02020, the PNF  resolved  proceedings  against  Societe Generale  and  acknowledged  that  Societe  Generale  had  fulfilled  its obligations with respect to the public interest judicial convention.\n\n## UNITED STATES COMPLIANCE REMEDIATION PLAN\n\nOn  19/uni00A0November  2018,  Societe  Generale  Group  and  its  New  York branch (SGNY) entered into an agreement (enforcement action) with the  NY  State  Department  of  Financial  Services  regarding  the  SGNY anti-money  laundering  compliance  programme.  This  agreement requires (i)/uni00A0submitting an enhanced anti-money laundering programme,  (ii)/uni00A0an anti-money  laundering  governance  plan,  and (iii)/uni00A0the performance of an external audit in 2020.\n\nAs  background  information,  on  14/uni00A0December  2017,  Societe  Generale and SGNY on the one hand, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  on  the  other  hand,  agreed  to  a  Cease  and  Desist  order  (the 'Order') regarding the SGNY compliance programme to adhere to the Bank  Secrecy  Act  ('BSA')  and  its  anti-money  laundering  ('AML') obligations (the 'Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Program'), and regarding some aspects of its Know Your Customer (KYC) programme.\n\nThis Cease and Desist Order signed on 14/uni00A0December 2017 with the US Federal  Reserve  supersedes  the  Written  Agreement  entered  into  in 2009 between Societe Generale Group and SGNY on the one hand, and the  US  Federal  Reserve  and  the  New  York  State  Financial  Services Department on the other.\n\nOn  17/uni00A0December  2019,  Societe  Generale/uni00A0SA  and  SGNY  signed  an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRB) regarding compliance risk management. This agreement included the submission and approval by the FRB, followed by the implementation, of  (i)/uni00A0an action  plan  to  strengthen  supervision  by  the  US  Risk Committee  of  the  compliance  risk  management  programme,  (ii)/uni00A0an action plan to improve the compliance risk management programme in the  US,  and  (iii)/uni00A0revisions of  the  internal  audit  programme concerning  compliance  risk  management  audits  in  the  US.  As  at  the end of 2021, these actions were being implemented.\n\n|",

Model risk is defined as the risk of losses due to decisions reached based on results of internal modeling due to errors in development, implementation or use of these models. It can take the form of model uncertainty or errors in the implementation of model management processes.\n\n## MODEL RISK MONITORING 4.12.1\n\nThe  Group  is  fully  committed  to  maintaining  a  solid  governance system  in  terms  of  model  risk  management  in  order  to  ensure  the efficiency and reliability of the identification, design, implementation, modification monitoring processes, independent review and approval of the models used. An MRM ('Model Risk Management') Department in  charge  of  controlling  model  risk  was  created  within  the  Risk Department  in  2017.  Since  then,  the  model  risk  management framework has been consolidated and structured and is based today on the following device.\n\n## Actors and responsibilities\n\nThe  model  risk  management  system  is  implemented  by  the  three independent lines of defence, which correspond to the responsibility of  the  business  lines  in  risk  management,  to  the  review  and independent supervision and evaluation of the system and which are segregated and independent to avoid any conflict of interest.\n\n## The device is as follows:\n\n- the first line of defence (LoD1), which brings together several teams p with  diverse  skills  within  the  Group,  is  responsible  for  the development, implementation, use and monitoring of the relevance over time of the models, in accordance with model risk management system;  these  teams  are  housed  in  the  Business  Departments  or their Support Departments;\n- the second line of defence (LoD2) is made up of governance teams p and independent model review teams, and supervised by the 'Model Risk' Department within the Risk Department;\n- the  third  line  of  defence  (LoD3)  is  responsible  for  assessing  the p overall  effectiveness  of  the  model  risk  management  system  (the relevance  of  governance  for  model  risk  and  the  efficiency  of  the activities  of  the  second  line  of  defence)  and  independent  audit  of models: it is housed within the Internal Audit Department.\n\n## Governance, steering and monitoring\n\nA  MRM  Committee  chaired  by  the  Risk  Director  meets  at  least  every three  months  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  management system  and  monitor  the  risk  of  models  at  Group  level.  Within  the second line of defence and the 'Model risk' Department, a governance team  is  in  charge  of  the  design  and  management  of  the  model  risk management system at Group level.\n\n## As such:\n\n- the normative framework applicable to all of the Group's models is p defined, applied when necessary to the main families of models to provide details on the specifics, and maintained while ensuring the consistency  and  homogeneity  of  the  system,  its  integrity  and  its compliance with regulatory provisions; this framework specifies in particular  the  definition  of  expectations  with  regard  to  LoD1,  the principles  for  the  model  risk  assessment  methodology  and  the definition  of  guiding  principles  for  the  independent  review  and approval of the model;\n- the  identification,  recording  and  updating  of  information  of  all p models within the Group (including models under development or recently  withdrawn)  are  carried  out  in  the  model  inventory according to a defined process and piloted by LoD2;\n- the monitoring and reporting system relating to model risk incurred p by  the  Group  in  Senior  Management  has  been  put  in  place.  The appetite for model risk, corresponding to the level of model risk that the Group is ready to assume in the context of achieving its strategic objectives,  is  also  formalised  through  statements  relating  to  risk tolerance,  translated  under  form  of  specific  indicators  associated with warning limits and thresholds.\n\n|",

The  independent  review  by  the  second  line  of  defence  is  triggered  in particular for new models, periodic model reviews, proposals to change models and transversal reviews in response to a recommendation:\n\n- it corresponds to all the processes and activities which aim to verify p the conformity of the functioning and use of the models with respect to the objectives for which they were designed and to the applicable regulations, on the basis of the activities and controls implemented by LoD1;\n- it  is  based  on  certain  principles  aimed  at  verifying  the  theoretical p robustness (evaluation of the quality of the design and development of  the  model),  the  conformity of the implementation and use, and the relevance of the monitoring of the model;\n- it  gives rise to an Independent Review Report, which describes the p scope of the review, the tests carried out, the results of the review, the conclusions or the recommendations.\n\nMODEL RISK\n\nThe  approval  process  follows  the  same  approval  scheme  for  all models,  the  composition  of  governance  bodies  being  able  to  vary according  to  the  level  of  model  risk,  the  family  of  models,  the applicable  regulatory  requirements  and  the  Business  Units/Service Units in which model is applicable. Responsible for LOD2, the approval process consists of two consecutive instances:\n\n- the  Review  Authority  which  aims  to  present  the  conclusions p identified by the review team in the independent Review Report and to  discuss,  allowing  for  a  contradictory  debate  between  LoD1  and LoD2.  Based  on  the  discussions,  LoD2  confirms  or  modifies  the conclusions  of  the  review  report,  including  the  findings  and recommendations, without being limited thereto;\n- the Approval Authority, a body which has the power to approve (with p or without reservation) or reject the use of a model, changes made to the existing model or continuous monitoring of the relevance of the model along the time proposed by the LOD1, from the Independent Review Report and the minutes of the Review Authority.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

In addition  to  balance  sheet  management  risks  (interest  rate,  valuation,  counterparty  and  exchange  rate  risk),  these  risks  include  premium pricing risk, mortality risk and the risk of an increase in claims.\n\n## MANAGEMENT OF INSURANCE RISKS 4.13.1\n\nThere are two main types of insurance risks:\n\n- underwriting risks, particularly risk through life insurance, individual p personal  protection  and  non-life  insurance.  This  risk  can  be biometrical: disability, longevity, mortality, or related to policyholders'  behavior  (risk  of  lapses).  To  a  lesser  extent,  the Insurance business line is also exposed to non-life and health risks. Such risks can come from pricing, selection, claims management or catastrophic risk;\n- risks  related  to  financial  markets  and  ALM:  the  Insurance  business p line, mainly through life insurance on the French market, is exposed to  instabilities  on  the  financial  markets  (changes  in  interest  rates and  stock  market  fluctuations)  which  can  be  made  worse  by policyholder behavior.\n\nManaging these risks is key to the Insurance business line's activity. It is carried out by qualified and experienced teams, with major bespoke IT resources. Risks are monitored and regularly reported, they are framed by risk policies validated by the Board of Directors of each entity.\n\nRisk management techniques are based on the following:\n\n- heightened security for the risk acceptance process, with the aim of p guaranteeing that the price schedule matches the policyholder's risk profile and the guarantees provided;\n- regular monitoring of indicators on product claims rates in order to p adjust  certain  product  parameters,  such  as  pricing  or  the  level  of guarantee, if necessary;\n- implementation of a reinsurance  plan  to  protect  the  business  line p from major/serial claims;\n- application of policies on risk, provisioning and reinsurance. p\n\n## INSURANCE RISK MODELING 4.13.2\n\nThe models are reviewed by the Insurance Risks Department, which is the second line of defence in the context of model risk management. The review works relate to the theoretical robustness (evaluation of the quality  of  design  and  development)  of  the  models,  the  use  of  the model,  the  conformity  of  the  implementation  and  the  continuous\n\nmonitoring of the relevance of the model over time. The independent review process ends with (i)/uni00A0a report describing the scope of the review, the  tests  performed,  the  results  of  the  review,  conclusions  or recommendations and by (ii)/uni00A0validation Committees. The model control system gives rise to recurring reporting to the appropriate bodies.\n\n|\n\nManagement of risks linked to the financial markets and to ALM is an integral  part  of  the  investment  strategy  as  long-term  performance objectives. The optimisation of these two factors is highly influenced by  the  asset/liability  balance.  Liability  commitments  (guarantees offered  to  customers,  maturity  of  policies),  as  well  as  the  amounts booked  under  the  major  items  on  the  balance  sheet  (shareholders' equity, income, provisions, reserves,/uni00A0etc.) are analysed by the Finance and Risk Departments of the Insurance business line.\n\nRisk  management  related  to  financial  markets  (interest  rates,  credit and shares) and to ALM is based on the following:\n\n- monitoring short- and long-term cash flows (match between the term p of a liability and the term of an asset, liquidity risk management);\n- particular monitoring of policyholder behavior (redemption); p\n- close monitoring of financial markets; p\n- hedging against exchange rate risks (both rising and falling); p\n- hedging downside equity risk; p\n- defining  thresholds  and  limits  per  counterparty,  per  issuer  rating p and assets class;\n- stress tests, the results of which are presented annually at entities' p Board of Directors' meetings, as part of the ORSA Report (Own Risk and Solvency Assessment), transferred to the ACPR after approval by the Board;\n- application of policies related to ALM and investment risks. p",

The types of admissible private equity operations chiefly relate to:\n\n- commercial support for the network through the private equity arm p of  the  Societe Generale and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord networks and those of certain foreign subsidiaries;\n- shareholdings  in  innovative  companies,  either  directly  or  through p private equity funds;\n- shareholdings in financial services companies such as Euroclear and p Cr\u00e9dit Logement.\n\nPrivate  equity  investments  are  managed  directly  by  the  networks concerned (Societe Generale, Cr\u00e9dit du Nord and foreign subsidiaries) and  are  capped  at  EUR  25  million.  Any  investments  above  this threshold must be approved by the Group Strategy Department based on  a  file  submitted  by  the  Business  Unit  in  conjunction  with  the Finance  Department.  The  file  must  include  arguments  justifying  a private equity investment of the allotted size, the projected outcome and  the  expected  profitability  based  on  the  consumption  of  the associated capital, the investment criteria (criteria, typology, duration,/uni00A0etc.), risk  analysis  and  the  proposed  governance.  The Group's General Management must approve the investment amount if\n\n## RESIDUAL VALUE RISK 4.14.2\n\nThrough  its  Specialised  Financial  Services  Division,  mainly  in  its long-term vehicle leasing subsidiary, the Group is exposed to residual value  risk  (where  the  net  resale  value  of  an  asset  at  the  end  of  the leasing contract is less than expected).\n\n## Risk identification\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  Group  holds,  inside  its  ALDA  Business  Units (automobile leasing activity) cars on its balance sheet with a risk related to the residual value of these vehicles at the moment of their disposals. This residual value risk is managed by ALD Automotive (ALDA).\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential losses in a given reporting period caused by (i) the resale of vehicles associated with leases terminated in the reporting period where the used car resale price is lower than its net  book  value  and  (ii)  additional  depreciation  booked  during  the lease term if the expected residual values of its vehicles decline below the contractual residual value. The future sales results and estimated losses are affected by external factors like macroeconomic, government  policies,  environmental  and  tax  regulations,  consumer preferences, new vehicles pricing, etc.\n\nit  exceeds  EUR  50  million  and  base  its  decision  on  the  opinion delivered  by  the  Strategy  Department,  the  Finance  Department,  the General Secretary and the Compliance Department./uni00A0Every six months, the  relevant  Business  Unit  must  submit  a  report  to  the  Strategy Department which tracks the operations and the use of the allocated investment amount.\n\nOther  private  equity  minority  investments  undergo  a  dedicated validation  process  for  both  the  investment  and  divestment  phases. They  are  approved  by  the  Heads  of  the  Business  Units  and  of  the entities  concerned  and  by  their  Finance  Department,  the  Strategy Department  and  also  the  Group's  General  Management  for  amounts exceeding  EUR  50  million,  in  addition  to  the  Board  of  Directors  for amounts  above  EUR  250  million.  These  files  are  assessed  by  the Strategy Department with the assistance of experts from the Services and Business Units involved in the operation, comprising at least the Finance  Department,  the  Corporate  Secretary's  Legal  and  Tax Departments  and  the  Compliance  Department.  The  assessment  is based  on  a  review  of  the  proposed  shareholding,  the  arguments  in favour  of  such  an  investment  and  its  context,  the  structuring  of  the operation,  its  financial  and  prudential  impacts,  the  assessment  of identified risks and the resources employed to track and manage them.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe residual value setting procedure defines the processes, roles and responsibilities  involved  in  the  determination  of  residual  values  that will be used by ALDA as a basis for producing vehicle lease quotations.\n\nA Residual Value Review Committee is held at least twice a year within each  operating  entity  of  ALDA.  This  Committee  debates  and  decides residual  values,  taking  into  account  local  market  specificities, documenting its approach, ensuring that there is a clear audit trail.\n\nA  central  ALDA  team  dedicated  to  control  validates  the  proposed residual  values  prior  to  their  being  notified  to  the  operating  entities and updated in the local quotation system. This team informs ALD's Group Finance Director and Risk Manager in case of disagreements.\n\nAdditionally,  the  fleet  revaluation  process  determines  an  additional depreciation  in  countries  where  an  overall  loss  on  the  portfolio  is identified. This process is performed locally twice a year for operating entities owning more than 5,000 cars (once a year for smaller entities) under the supervision of the central team and using common tools and methodologies.  This  depreciation  is  booked  in  accordance  with accounting standards.\n\nALDA  gross  operating  income  derived  from  car  sales  totalled  EUR  437.7 million at 31 December 2021 versus EUR 61.1 million at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

They  are  monitored  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  which approves  the  Group's  strategic  trajectory  and  reviews  them  at  least once  a  year.  Moreover,  the  Board  of  Directors  approves  strategic investments and any transaction (particularly disposals and acquisitions)  that  could  significantly  affect  the  Group's  results,  the structure of its balance sheet or its risk profile.\n\nStrategic  steering  is  carried  out  under  the  authority  of  General Management,  by  the  General  Management  Committee  (which  meets weekly without exception), by the Group Strategy Committee and by the Strategic Oversight Committees of the Business Units and Service Units.  The  composition  of  these  various  bodies  is  set  out  in  the Corporate  Governance  chapter  of  the  present  document,  Chapter  3 (see  pages/uni00A061  and  following).

CSR concerns all its businesses and is both an opportunity for innovation and a factor of sustainability.\n\n'Building  together,  with  our  clients,  a  better  and  sustainable  future through  responsible  and  innovative  financial  solutions'  is  Societe Generale's corporate purpose and is the embodiment of our collective ambition,  the  bedrock  of  the  Group's  strategic  choices  and  the compass  that  guides  our  actions  on  a  daily  basis.  It  embodies  the Group's  vision  and  values,  its  team  spirit,  innovation,  responsibility and  commitment,  and  is  the  cornerstone  of  Societe  Generale's banking model.\n\nFollowing  on  from  its  previous  strategy,  Societe  Generale  used  the findings of its materiality survey to guide its CSR actions in 2021. The materiality survey is outlined in the following section. Survey findings placed the focus on four areas. Two of them form the framework for responsible banking:\n\n- the  culture  of  responsibility  (see  Creating  a  robust  sustainability p management framework, page/uni00A0272);\n- the  responsible  employer  (see  Being  a  responsible  employer, p page/uni00A0314).\n\nThe other two areas are the springboards for positively transforming the Group's actions as a responsible bank:\n\n- supporting  the  environmental  transition  (see  Being  committed p through action to the environmental transition, page/uni00A0296);\n- making a positive impact on local communities (see Contributing to p local communities, page/uni00A0299).\n\n## Core themes of the Group's CSR policy\n\n## Culture of responsibility\n\nBy  complying  with  legislation  and  ethical  obligations  in  force  and  by  introducing  its  own commitments, Societe Generale's objective is to work to make a genuinely positive impact on the environment, standing shoulder to shoulder with and being attuned to the various stakeholders of its global ecosystem (see Creating a robust sustainability management framework, page/uni00A0272).\n\n## Responsible employer\n\nMonitoring quality of working life, and the diversity and professional development of its teams are crucial to encouraging  employee  engagement  within  the  Group  and  optimising performances.  Societe  Generale  has  undertaken  to  move  the  Group  forward  with  five  Human Resources priorities: Corporate Culture and Ethics Principles, Professions and Skills, Diversity and Inclusion,  Performance  and  Compensation,  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  (see  Being  a responsible employer, page/uni00A0314.\n\n## Supporting the environmental transition\n\nBeing  committed  through  action  to  the  climate  and  environment  by  supporting  fair, environmental and inclusive transition (see Being committed through action to the environmental transition, page/uni00A0296).\n\n## Making a positive impact on local communities\n\nSociete Generale is committed to supporting the development and resilience of local economies by taking part in community-focused innovations emerging locally and in its markets. One of the Group's  actions  is  to  make  positive  transformations  by  supporting  businesspeople,  working  to develop sustainable cities and infrastructures and promoting green mobility (see Contributing to local communities, page/uni00A0299). This initiative has particular significance in Africa where the Group supports positive transformations on the continent through its Grow with Africa programme.\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough its geographic presence, the diversity of its businesses and its  responsible  engagement,  Societe  Generale  helps  achieve  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the UN (for more information, see https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/\n\nsustainable-development-goals/ ),  and  specifically  through  the  four focus areas of its CSR ambition, each of which contributes directly to the successful outcome of one or several objectives:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## CONSULTING STAKEHOLDERS TO UNDERSTAND 5.1.2 THEIR EXPECTATIONS\n\nThe Group consulted key internal and external stakeholders at the end of  2020  to  update  the  priorities  of  the  Group's  CSR  ambition  and ensure  that  it  was  aligned  with  risks  and  opportunities.  The  survey findings were aggregated into a materiality matrix, which is presented below. The materiality matrix was interpreted in accordance with the Group's values and company purpose in order to define the four focus areas of the CSR ambition.\n\nThe Group used a qualitative approach to take the stakeholders' pulse: in-depth one-on-one interviews were conducted with a representative panel of  Group stakeholders. More than 80 employee managers were specifically trained to conduct  the  campaign,  which  involved 141/uni00A0interviews.  Interviewees  were  selected  from  a  diverse  sample  of professionals spanning the entire range of businesses and geographical zones  where  the  Group  operates.  Some  1,000  Group  managers  were also interviewed. In order to compare their expectations with those of other stakeholders who participated in the survey, ten more interviews focused on Group Management, including three members on the Board of Directors. These findings were subsequently enriched with responses provided  during  image  and  client  satisfaction  surveys  performed regularly  by  Societe  Generale  and  with  submissions  from  dedicated focus groups composed of internal and external participants.\n\nSociete  Generale  performed  materiality  analysis  according  to  three complementary levels:\n\n- stakeholders surveyed ranked the 17 materiality considerations 1. identified  by  an  Internal  Group  Work  Committee  according  to their impression of relative importance;\n- Group  Management  also  ranked  the  materiality  considerations 2. according  to  their  impact  on  the  different  value  creation dimensions for the Company;\n- the  recurrence  of  the  considerations  under  review  was  analysed 3. during  stakeholder  interviews.  All  their  contributions  were subsequently  studied  on  a  qualitative  basis.  The  study  was conducted in line with the main materiality assessment standards, i.e. the GRI*, AA1000*, IIRC* and ODD standards.\n\nThe materiality  matrix  classifies  the  issues  according  to  their  impact (evaluated  by  General  Management)  on  the  different  dimensions  of value creation in the Company (x/uni00A0axis) and according to their relative importance for internal and external stakeholders (y axis). As a result, four issues manifested in the core circle, followed by five issues in the second inner circle, six issues in the third circle and, last, two issues of minor impact in the outermost circle.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO EXTRA-FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS 5.1.3\n\nIn  addition  to  the  materiality  matrix  substantiating  the  strategic analysis,  the  Group  conducts  a  number  of  extra-financial  risk identification procedures. The Group approaches these procedures by applying  the  double  materiality  concept, i.e. by  first  analysing  the environmental  and  social  materiality,  which  pinpoints  the  impact  of Societe Generale's activities on the environment and on human rights and,  second,  the  financial  materiality,  which  identifies  the  risks  that stand to affect the Group's economic and financial activities as a result of  Environmental  Social  and  Governance  (ESG)  factors.  Accordingly, Societe  Generale  considers  that  environmental,  social  and  human rights  risks  do  not  belong  to  a  new  category,  but,  rather,  are  factors aggravating  certain  previously  identified  risks,  such  as  credit  risks, non-compliance  risk  and  reputation  risk.  Details  concerning  each  of these categories are cross-referenced in the dedicated sections of the present Universal Registration Document.\n\nAs  a  result  of  these  assessments,  the  principal  extra-financial  risk factors  are  ranked  according  to  two  criteria,  namely,  their  potential severity and the probability of them materialising. This identification process examines the intrinsic risk, i.e. before internal action is sought to minimise its impact. A time frame is applied to certain risk factors; a risk that is perceived as low today may intensify in future.\n\nThe  methodology  and  findings  of  this  evaluation,  which  were submitted  to  the  Independent  Third-Party  Body  (ITB)  during  a  prior study, are still valid for the purposes of this document.\n\nThe  most  meaningful  extra-financial  intrinsic  risk  factors  emanating from the study are as follows:\n\n- IT systems failure, including cybercrime (see Chapter/uni00A04.8 Operational p risk,  section  Risks  related  to  information  security  and  information and  communication  technologies,  page/uni00A0235  and  the  IT  systems security master plan 2021-2023, page 235;\n- non-compliance  with  business  ethics,  including  corruption,  tax p evasion  and  money  laundering  (see  Chapter/uni00A04.11  Compliance  risk, litigation, section Anti-corruption measures, page/uni00A0256);\n- data protection (see Chapter/uni00A04.11 Compliance risk, litigation, section p Data protection, page 257);\n- the Environmental and Social (E&S) challenges that stand to impact p the  Group's  reputation  as  a  result  of  other  operational  risks  or arising  from  negative  stakeholder  perception,  especially  among external stakeholders (see E&S risk management in the businesses to promote fair and responsible growth, page/uni00A0285);\n- non-compliance with E&S legislation or the Group's E&S p commitments,  including  non-compliance  with  labour  regulations, and health and safety standards (see Being a responsible employer, page/uni00A0314).\n\nA number of moderate extra-financial risk factors were also identified:\n\n- E&S issues that may affect the Group's credit risk, especially climate p change  issues, i.e. transition  risks  and  physical  risks.  These  risks could  escalate  over  a  longer  time  frame  (see  Supporting  the environmental transition, page 296);\n- inappropriate  employee  behaviour, e.g. non-compliance  with  the p Group's  Code  of  Conduct  and  Guidelines  (see  Being  a  responsible employer, page/uni00A0314);\n- a  risk  factor  relating  more  specifically  to  Human  Resources p management, i.e. lack  of  qualified  staff  (see  Being  a  responsible employer, page/uni00A0314).\n\nThe Group's Human Resources Department created a specific mapping to  identify  the  key  risk  factors  related  to  Societe  Generale's  Human Resources (HR) and those of its subsidiaries. The chosen HR focus areas were  listed  according  to  their  potential  impact  in  the  event  of materialised risk in five areas: financial, compliance/legal, reputation, employee health and safety, and loss of skills/business disruption. The focus  areas  impacting  at  least  one  of  these  areas  were  then cross-referenced with external risk analyses using Maplecroft (1) quantitative databases specific to banks and a risk panel identified by the Danish Institute for Human Rights (2) , which pinpointed five chief HR risks for Societe Generale (see Being a responsible employer, page/uni00A0314).\n\nThe present Universal Registration Document includes the changes in the procedures implemented by the Group to minimise these risks. A DNFP (declaration of non-financial performance) cross-reference table appears in  Chapter/uni00A09  of  the  present  document  (see  page/uni00A0654)  and  a  summary  of non-financial risk factors and emerging risks can be found on the Societe Generale corporate website: https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/ default/files/documents/Document%20RSE/summary-of-non-financial-risk-\n\nfactors-and-emerging-risks.pdf.\n\nWords followed by an asterisk have a specific definition and appear in the Glossary , page/uni00A0658.\n\nQuantified indicators can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/ Document%20RSE/corporate-social-responsibility-group-keyfigures.xlsx\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Group  has  also  made CSR  the  linchpin  of  its governance  and  compensation  policy .  In addition, as part of its quest to be a vehicle for transformation towards a more sustainable world, Societe Generale participates in numerous\n\ncoalitions which debate environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues  and  enable  it  to  make genuine  and  concrete  commitments. Last,  the  Group  has  developed  a strict  framework  to  manage environmental  and  social  (E&S)  risks to  ensure  it  rolls  out  these commitments throughout the entire organisation.\n\n## CSR IN THE GROUP'S GOVERNANCE 5.2.1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFive bodies play a specific role in CSR:\n\n- the Board  of  Directors approves  the  Group's  strategies  and 1. supervises  their  rollout,  in  particular  with  regard  to  CSR.  These strategies  embody  the  Group's  values  and  Code  of  Conduct,  as well as the main thrusts of its environmental and social strategy, its HR  policy,  its  information  systems  and  organisational blueprints.  CSR  achievements  and  issues  are  regular  agenda items at Board of Director meetings and those of its Committees (see  Chapter/uni00A03.1.2  Board  of  Directors , sections  The  Board  of Directors' expertise (page 80) and The Board of Directors' work, page/uni00A081). The Group Compensation Committee also explores CSR issues  under  its  remit;  see  Chapter/uni00A03.1.2  Board  of  Directors,\n\nrespectively at pages 83 and 86. Ever mindful of the challenges related  to  energy  transition,  the  Group  decided  in  2021  to appoint to the Board of Directors a non-voting Director specially dedicated  to  these  areas  for  a  two-year  term;  see  Chapter/uni00A03.1 Board  of  Directors'  report  on  corporate  governance,  page/uni00A063. Since  2020,  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  have  received regular progress reports on the Group's CSR initiatives, as well as news  of  regulatory  developments via a  monthly  Key  Facts  and Figures update on the topics;\n\n- at  least  once  a  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  review  the  Group's 2. strategic approaches to CSR and their rollout;\n\n|",

It formerly reported to the Corporate Secretary;\n- The Group  BU/SU  entities are  tasked  with  implementing  and 5. aligning their initiatives with Societe Generale's CSR policy.\n\n## Application of the principles of separation of responsibilities in the lines of defence\n\nGovernance was strengthened in 2019 when E&S risks were integrated in  a  Group  standard  policy  document.  The  roles  of  the  first  line  of defence  and  the  second  line  of  defence  (Risk  and  Compliance Departments), as well as the those of the CSR Department were clearly articulated:\n\n- the  BU/SUs  are  in  charge  of  deploying  the  E&S  risk  management p system throughout their scope of activities, and must comply with the Group's counterparty and transaction assessment recommendations. They can call on the E&S service experts of other businesses to carry out these assessments. They define their own governance bodies to review  complex  cases,  request  guidance  and  direction  from  their manager  where  necessary  and  help  keep  Societe  Generale's  E&S standards up to date;\n- the Risk and Compliance Departments are in charge of the second p line of defence with respect to E&S risk management. As such, they perform  level/uni00A02  controls  on  non-alignment,  reputation,  credit  and E&S  risks  and  assess  the  quality  of  the  first  line  of  defence procedures on the E&S risks.\n\nAgainst  this  backdrop,  the  Responsible  Commitments  Committee (CORESP),  which  was  created  in  2019,  met  twelve  times  in  2021. CORESP explored the following topics:\n\n- the  change  in  the  Group  standards  with  regard  to  managing  E&S p risks, notably in the oil and gas sector, and preserving biodiversity;\n- the latest Group commitments, such as aligning its credit portfolios p and the Group's own operations with the Paris Agreement's terms;\n- reviewing particularly sensitive clients and transactions from an E&S p standpoint.\n\n## E&S RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFIRST-LEVEL PERMANENT CONTROL\n\nPERMANENT CONTROL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Wherever possible, an internal  enquiry  is  conducted,  and  a  documented  response  is  given, either in writing or during meetings convened for that purpose. Societe Generale uses the Sustainable Development Department to centralise communication or contact from NGOs or other stakeholders informing it about the E&S impact of its financing services or other services.\n\nIn the course of 2021, Societe Generale consulted with or participated in  working groups with some ten NGOs, either in writing, in bilateral meetings or through broader, more global consultations organised by the  associations  themselves,  by  the  French  Banking  Federation ( F\u00e9d\u00e9ration bancaire fran\u00e7aise - FBF) or Companies supporting Human Rights  ( Entreprises  pour  les  Droits  de  l'Homme -  UNEP-FI),  amongst others.\n\nSociete Generale has a 'Statements' section on its corporate website. In  2021,  the  Group  responded  to  questions  regarding  its  minority shareholding  in  Cofig\u00e9o.  For  more  information,  the  document  is available at https://www.societegenerale.com/en/news/statements.\n\nThe Group also maintains open dialogue with civil  society  through  its Dialogue  &  Transparency  rubric  on  its  website.  Societe  Generale published  its  position  on  three  occasions  in  2021:  first,  in  response to/uni00A0the 'Banking  on  climate  chaos'  report  (a  joint  publication  by Reclaim/uni00A0Finance, Rainforest Action, Network, BankTrack, Indigenous/uni00A0Environmental/uni00A0Network, Oil/uni00A0Change International and the/uni00A0Sierra  Club)  following the 'Fossil assets; second, following the new subprimes' report by the Institut Rousseau, Amis de la Terre France and Reclaim Finance; and third, in reaction to the OXFAM report on banks' carbon footprint. The Bank's stance in response to these reports can be found on the Group's website: https://www.societegenerale.com/en/ responsibility/csr-ambition/dialogue-transparency .\n\nAt 17/uni00A0January 2022.

        "page_content": "## A CODE OF CONDUCT UNDERPINNED BY SHARED VALUES 5.2.4\n\nThe Group seeks to establish a culture of responsibility and apply the strictest  control  and  compliance  standards  in  the  banking  sector.  It commits  its  employees  to  act  with  integrity  and  in  accordance  with applicable law in all its activities. To that end, the Group has defined a Code  of  Conduct  describing  the  standards  to  be  observed  and constituting  a  commitment  towards  each  stakeholder.  This  Code applies  to  all  its  employees  worldwide.  In  addition  to  its  Code  of Conduct,  Societe  Generale  also  possesses  a  Charter  for  Responsible Advocacy (see below) and a Sustainable Sourcing Charter (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/construire-demain/ 12112018\\_sustainable\\_sourcing\\_charter\\_vf\\_eng.pdf) .\n\nSociete  Generale  has  built  a  strong  culture  based  on  its  values,  its Leadership  Model and  the Code  of  Conduct .  Societe  Generale  is guided by four key values which is shared by all employees - Team Spirit,  Innovation,  Responsibility  and  Commitment  -  and  which  is defined  with  a  common  objective  in  mind:  the  client,  for  whom  the Group  strives  to  achieve  the  highest  possible  standards  of  service quality.\n\n## The Leadership Model 5.2.4.1\n\nSociete Generale's values feed into its Leadership Model, which defines the behaviour and skills expected within the Group, emphasising that the way in which results are achieved is every bit as important as the results themselves.\n\nThe  behavioural  skills  reflected  in  the  Leadership  Model  are  divided into three categories corresponding to the main levels of responsibility within the Company (senior executives, managers and employees) and are shared throughout the Group.\n\nThe four key values thus translate into key skills (see diagram below), which  are  in  turn  reflected  in  certain  observable  and  measurable behaviours.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nINNOVATION\n\nI know how to think out of the box and create the conditions that breed innovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTEAM SPIRIT\n\nI focus my energy collective\n\nand talent on success\n\nI WORK TO INCREASE OUR IMPACT ON CLIENTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCOMMITMENT\n\nRESPONSIBILITY\n\nI lead ethically and with courage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI provide inspiration and encourage commitment through my example and consideration of others\n\nThe  annual  appraisal  targets  are  set  based  on  the  four  Leadership Model  values.  One  of  the  values  is  attached  to  each  behavioural objective and employees can use the Leadership Model to formulate their annual targets.\n\n## The Code of Conduct, a vehicle for 5.2.4.2 the Group's values\n\nThe Group conducts its operations in accordance with the values and principles set out in the following major international conventions:\n\n- the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  and  its  additional p commitments;\n- the fundamental conventions of the International Labour p Organization (ILO);\n- the Unesco World Heritage Convention; p\n- the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) p Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises;\n- the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. p\n\nThe values espoused in the Code of Conduct policy document span the entire  spectrum  of  Group  activities  and  the  countries  where  it operates. The Code  describes our commitments  towards  all stakeholders:  clients,  employees,  investors,  shareholders,  suppliers, the  regulator  and  supervisory  bodies,  the  general  public  and  civil society,  as  well  the  principles  of  expected  individual  and  collective behaviour.  It  refers  directly  to  the  whistleblowing  procedure  which forms part of the mechanism to combat inappropriate behaviours.\n\nAvailable  in  the  main  languages  spoken  in  the  Group,  the  Code  of Conduct is the cornerstone of professional ethics at Societe Generale. It  promotes  respect  for  human  rights  and  the  environment,  the prevention  of  conflicts  of  interest  and  corruption,  anti-money laundering  and  counter-terrorist  financing  measures,  respect  for market integrity, data protection, proper conduct regarding gifts and invitations, and responsible sourcing.\n\nCode  of  Conduct  rules  go  beyond  the  minimum  statutory  and regulatory  requirements  in  force,  especially  in  countries  whose  laws and  regulations  are  not  as  stringent  as  the  Group's  high  ethical standards.\n\nStakeholders  can  view  the  Code  of  Conduct  on  the  Societe  Generale corporate website: https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/ documents/Code%20de%20conduite/code\\_of\\_conduct\\_eng.pdf. Further information  is  provided  in  the  Tax  Code  of  Conduct  and  the  Code governing  the  Fight  Against  Corruption  and  Influence  Peddling (see: https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/Code%20 de%20conduite/code-governing-the-fight-against-corruption-and-influence -peddling-uk.pdf) .\n\nThe  Group  undertakes  to  operate  with  the  utmost  integrity  and transparency, and to comply with the applicable laws and regulations in  all  the  countries  where  it  operates,  in  particular  regarding  the offering and receipt of gifts, and the organisation of or participation in business meals or external events as part of its professional activities (and  in  the  event  that  these  events  involve  public  and/or  politically exposed persons - PEPs) in connection with business relationships.\n\nThe  Leadership  Model's  internal  skills  guide  describes  the  expected behaviour  corresponding  to  each  of  these  skills.  In  conjunction  with the guide, a self-assessment tool available on the intranet asks twenty questions through which respondents can see how they rate in relation to appropriate conduct and provides leadership development tools to work through the various skills.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "DEFINING A ROBUST SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\nThe whistleblower tool, which  is  accessible  on  the  Societe  Generale website  at https://report.whistleb.com/en/societegenerale and  on  the Societe  Generale's  intranet,  is  a  global  channel  for  submitting whistleblowing reports. With WhistleB, anyone may raise the red flag when they believe that they have good reason to suspect the existence of  a  situation  or  an  action  that  manifestly  violates  an  international treaty, law, regulation, the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms,  health  and  safety  of  persons  and  the  environment.  The whistleblower may be any employee, external or part-time collaborator and  any  service  provider  with  whom  an  established  commercial relationship is maintained (subcontractors or suppliers). The reporting tool, which is based on a secure platform guaranteeing the protection of personal data and strict confidentiality required by the provisions of the  law  on  transparency,  the  fight  against  corruption  and  the modernisation of economic activity (law No./uni00A02016-1691 of 9/uni00A0December 2016, known as the 'Sapin/uni00A02'  law).  The  right  to  report  is  a  basic  right afforded to everyone to express themselves and whistleblowers will be protected from any sanctions for having made a report in good faith.\n\nOn  2/uni00A0December  2021,  the  US  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ) moved to permanently end legal proceedings brought against Societe  Generale  for  the  Libyan  Investment  Authority  ('LIA') case.  In  so  doing,  the  DOJ  confirmed  that  the  Bank  had  fully complied  with  its  obligations  under  the  related  deferred prosecution agreement.\n\nThe deferred prosecution agreement reached in June/uni00A02018 with the  DOJ  was  entered  into  contemporaneously  with  a  French settlement  ( Convention  judiciaire d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public , 'CJIP') between Societe Generale and the French Financial Prosecutions Department ( Procureur National Financier , 'PRF'). The  PRF  terminated  the  public  proceedings  against  Societe Generale on 14/uni00A0December 2020 following its acknowledgement that Societe Generale had fulfilled its obligations under the CJIP after receiving the final audit report of the French Anticorruption Agency ('AFA') regarding the rollout of anti-corruption and anti-influence peddling procedures.\n\nIn  addition  to  complying  with  obligations  under  French,  European  and local laws, Societe Generale has also signed the following commitments:\n\n- Transparency International France's joint statement p (https://transparency-france.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2015\\_ D%C3%A9claration-commune-sur-le-lobbying.pdf);\n- the Responsible Lobbying Charter for responsible representation to p public authorities and representative institutions (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/ Document%20RSE/sg\\_memorandum\\_responsible\\_advocacy\\_ activities.pdf) ;\n- the Transparency Register of European Institutions p (https://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/ displaylobbyist.do?id=34369111614-57&locale=en#en) , jointly with the European Parliament and the European Commission, supplemented by a Code of Conduct;\n- French Senate's Code of Conduct (https://www.senat.fr/ fileadmin/ p Fichiers/Images/sgp/Code\\_de\\_conduite.pdf) ;\n- the digital transparency register administered by the High Authority p for Transparency in Public Life ( Haute Autorit\u00e9 pour la transparence de  la  vie  publique -  HATVP).  The  Group  created  its  'interest representative' sheet (https://www.hatvp.fr/fiche-organisation/ ?organisation=552120222) ;\n- compliance  with  local  codes  of  conduct  and  registration  with  the p authorities  of  its  interest  representation  activities  on  any  other existing register with which Societe Generale operates locally.\n\nThe full list of these commitments appears:\n\n- for  internal  use,  in  Societe  Generale's  normative  documentation p (Societe  Generale  Codes)  in  a  dedicated  section  available  to employees and is also available to the service providers;\n- for public  consultation,  in  a  document  describing  measures p governing interest representation which is available in English only on  the  Group's  corporate  website  at  the  following  address: https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/ Document%20RSE/sg\\_memorandum\\_responsible\\_advocacy\\_ activities.pdf.\n\n## The Culture & Conduct approach 5.2.4.3\n\nAt  the  end  of  2016,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  launch  of  a Group Culture & Conduct programme aimed at supporting the Group's cultural  transformation,  ensuring compliance  with  the  strictest integrity standards, and establishing a lasting relationship with its stakeholders built on trust .\n\nThe programme was shared with all employees, making it possible to reaffirm and promote collective and individual behaviour aimed at the ethical and responsible performance of our activities. Since the launch of the initiative, numerous actions have been successfully carried out in  the  following seven areas: implementation of a Culture & Conduct governance system at the highest level of the organisation and in the businesses, publication of a dashboard to monitor changes in Culture & Conduct indicators, implementation of a conduct risk management system,  alignment  of  Human  Resources  processes,  training  and awareness-raising among  employees,  development  of  cultural transformation,  and  communication  aimed  at  integrating  Culture  & Conduct issues into the daily lives of employees.\n\nPlaced from the outset under the supervision of the Board of Directors and  General  Management  and  steered  by  a  cross-business  project team, the programme has achieved the targets it had set for this first stage.  Project  mode  management  came  to  an  end  on  31/uni00A0December 2020 and evolved into a long-term system, with the Culture & Conduct approach remaining a major consideration for the Group.\n\nNow that the programme has been fully implemented, all BU/SUs are expected  to  push  further  ahead  with  integrating  Culture  &  Conduct considerations  into  the  performance  of  their  daily  activities.  To  help achieve this, a Culture & Conduct website dedicated to BU/SUs has set up a toolbox for them containing a summary of Group best practices to enhance the teams' knowledge on culture- and conduct-related topics, as well as a list of contacts to facilitate the exchange of best practices in  the  Group.  In  2021,  each  BU/SU  formalised  its  own  Culture  & Conduct road map.\n\n- French National Assembly's Code of Conduct p (https://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/dyn/pages-statiques/pagessimples/decouvrir-l-assemblee/code-de-conduite-applicable-auxrepresentants-d-interets) ;\n\n|",

        "page_content": "Central  oversight  of  these  topics  has  been  maintained  at  Group level.  Since  1/uni00A0January  2021,  the  role  has  been  coordinated  and performed  jointly  by  two  departments:  Human  Resources  for culture-related topics and Compliance for conduct-related matters. They intend to continue cementing a solid and lasting culture of responsibility throughout the Group, and to ensure that BU/SUs roll out the necessary measures to encourage appropriate behaviour and protect  the  Group's  interests  in  the  long  term.  Culture  &  Conduct Supervision  Committee  meetings,  chaired  by  General  Management, are  held  quarterly.  At  the  meetings,  the  Human  Resources  and Compliance Departments must report jointly on cross-business action plans  and  achievements.  Two  BUs  and  SUs  also  present  progress reports on the rollout schedule of Culture & Conduct themes according to a single assessment grid. Last, General Management received a third Culture & Conduct dashboard, which was also submitted to the Board of Directors. It provides an overview of the main conduct risks in the businesses,  identifies  the  action  plans  necessary  to  improve  risk management in these areas and helps track indicator trends.\n\nGeneral Management supervises the entire programme and prepares an annual dashboard on the results for the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Report  on  Corporate  Culture  and  Ethics  Principles  sets  out  the Culture & Conduct approach (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/ default/files/documents/Employeur\\_responsable/corporatecultureand-ethics principles-2019-report.pdf) .\n\nThe main Culture & Conduct achievements in 2021 were:\n\n- the annual compulsory Code of Conduct learning module that deals p with  four  areas:  the  Group's  Culture  &  Conduct  ambitions stakeholder  expectations,  content  of  the  Code  of  Conduct  and additional  Codes  regarding  tax  and  anti-corruption  measures, together  with  ethical  reasoning.  In  addition,  new  training  was organised for key risk evaluation contributors as part of the annual Risk  and  Control  Self-Assessment  (RSCA)  which  is  aimed  at improving the 2021 results of each Business and Service Unit;\n- the continued alignment of the main Human Resources management p processes  with  the  Group's  Culture  &  Conduct  ambitions:  the  fight against inappropriate behaviour (new HR alert tool), appropriation of the  Group's  policy  on  disciplinary  sanctions,  procedure  describing the  management  of  disciplinary  action;  see  the  Corporate  Culture and  Ethics  Principles  report  available  on  the  Group's  website: https://www.societegenerale.com/en/responsability/responsibleemployer/corporate-culture-and-ethics-principles ;\n\n- Culture  &  Conduct  Awareness  actions  carried  out  by  the  Human p Resources and Communication Departments aimed at fostering an environment supportive of appropriate behaviour and which mirror the Group's values. A roadmap was devised and has four strategic targets:  1)  communicate  Group  Culture  &  Conduct  expectations (values, normative framework, definitions, and roles and responsibilities),  2)  encourage  the  BUs  and  SUs  to  share  best practices  more  and  make  use  of  them,  3)  promote  a  speak-up culture  at  Group  and  BU  and  SU  levels,  and  4)  keep  in  touch  with other culture-related initiatives, such as Diversity and Inclusion, CSR and the Life@work programme;\n- continued work on defining a methodology to ensure full awareness p of Culture & Conduct issues (review of the normative framework, risk interpretation,  RCSA-exposure  to  risks),  Permanent  Control  within Compliance (CPLE/REO) and by the third line of defence (LoD3) in the Audit Department.\n\n## CULTURE & CONDUCT KEY FIGURES\n\n- One  single  Code  of  Conduct  for  all  Group  employees, p available in 18/uni00A0languages.\n- 92%  of/uni00A0employees  had  validated  their  Code  of  Conduct p module training for the 2021-2022 campaign at end-December 2021 (campaign ending in March/uni00A02022), i.e. 88,700/uni00A0employees.\n- 27,400/uni00A0Group managers and employees in the HR Department p were  targeted  for  compulsory  training  on  the  Group's disciplinary framework.\n- 100% of the BU/SUs have a Culture & Conduct correspondent. p\n- At end-2021, 89% of employees believed that their manager p encouraged ethical and responsible behaviour.\n- At  end-2021,  84%  of  employees  confirmed  that  they  were p ready  to  whistleblow  if  they  witnessed  or  experienced inappropriate behaviour.\n- At  end-2021,  86%  of  employees  said  they  could  confidently p express themselves to team members.\n- At end-2021,  80%  of  employees  confirmed  that  their p managers encouraged BU/SUs to work together.\n- Whistleblowing  mechanism:  a  total  of  122/uni00A0admissible  alerts p were  reported  in  the  whistleblowing  tool  in  2021  ( vs. 80  in 2020), 75% of which concerned HR issues ( vs. 60% in 2020).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The principles include aligning activities with the Paris\n\nAgreement and the SDGs, setting targets in terms of positive impacts and  reduction  of  negative  impacts,  providing  responsible  support  to clients,  consulting  and  cooperating  with  stakeholders,  developing  a responsible banking culture and governance, and making targeted and public  commitments  and  subsequently  reporting  transparently  on their achievement.\n\nSociete  Generale's  CSR  ambition  aims  to  align  the  Bank  with  the Principles  for  Responsible  Banking  and  ensures  it  contributes  to positive  change  for  a  sustainable  future,  as  reflected  in  the  Group's fourth Integrated Report (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/ default/files/documents/2021-07/Integrated-Report-2020-2021.pdf) .\n\n## 2021 UPDATE\n\n- Principle 1 - 'Alignment' and Principle 2 - 'Impact & Target Setting': Societe Generale joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) p in/uni00A02021. For details of its progress towards net-zero, see section/uni00A05.2.6.2 below.\n\nThe Group continued to strengthen its in-house frameworks, tightening up the checks and balances on its business in sensitive sectors. It updated its E&S General Principles and appended three new statements setting out its commitments on human rights, the climate and biodiversity.  It  also  updated  its  E&S  policies  (for  more  details  see  E&S  risk  management  in  the  Group's  businesses  to  promote  fair  and resonsible  growth,  page  290).  In  addition,  the  Group  stepped  up  its  actions  in  favour  of  preserving  biodiversity,  adding  to  its  list  of protected areas ( i.e. areas in which it has undertaken not to finance new projects in sectors covered by its sector policies and considered particularly sensitive from a biodiversity standpoint).\n\nThe Group also continued to support the energy transition:\n\n- energy transition financing - with a broad range of sustainable financing solutions (loans, bonds, advisory services), the Group met its -goal of raising EUR/uni00A0120/uni00A0billion for the energy transition between 2019 and 2023 ahead of schedule;\n- renewable energies -  the  Group  has  supported  renewables  as  a  way  of  promoting  the  energy  transition  for  over  20/uni00A0years,  and  was -acclaimed No./uni00A01 for renewable energy financing within the EMEA* region at the end of June/uni00A02021 (Dealogic).\n\nLast, Societe Generale made a new commitment aiming to reduce its carbon emissions by 50% from 2019 levels by 2030 . To achieve this,  it  plans  to  make  its  buildings,  IT  equipment  and  vehicle  fleet  more  energy  efficient  and  reduce  air  travel.  It  also  decided  to  ban single-use plastics in its work environments by 2025 (and even earlier, if possible, in certain countries).\n\n- Principle 3 - 'Clients & Customers': Societe Generale continued to enhance its client protection policy and is working on cementing p responsible relationships with all clients. For more information on the Group's relationships with its clients and how it protects their data and assets, see Applying the highest standards in client relationship management.\n- Principle 4 - 'Stakeholders': In addition to its ongoing policy of dialogue with its stakeholders, the Group conducted a large-scale survey p with  its  key  internal  and  external  stakeholders  over  2020  and  2021  to  help  it  update  its  materiality  matrix  and  the  priorities  of  its  CSR ambition (see Consulting shareholders to understand their expectations, page 306).\n- Principle 5 - 'Governance & Culture': The Group strengthened its CSR governance. In particular: p\n- the Board of Directors appointed a non-voting Director for a two-year term from 18/uni00A0May 2021 to assist it on matters regarding the energy -transition (see Chapter/uni00A03.1, Board of the Directors' Report on Corporate Governance, section Organisation of the governance, page 63);\n- Board members received training on ESG topics (see Chapter/uni00A03, Board of Directors, section Training, page/uni00A089). -\n- Principle 6 - 'Transparency & Accountability': Striving for ever greater transparency and going beyond its regulatory obligations ( i.e. the p Declaration of Extra-Financial Performance and Duty of Care Plan), the Group published the following documents in 2021:\n- its first self-assessment report on its progress in implementing the Principles for Responsible Banking; -\n- its fourth Integrated Report; -\n- its first report on its tax contribution (relating to 2020) (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/2021-07/ -Report-on-our-2020-tax-contribution.pdf) ;\n- its first Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) mapping report. -\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Net-Zero Banking Alliance 5.2.6.2\n\nAs a Founding Member of the UNEP-FI's Net-Zero Banking Alliance in 2021,  alongside  42  other  international  banks,  Societe  Generale  has committed to:\n\n- aligning  its  portfolios  and  activities  with  pathways  to  net-zero  CO2 p emissions  by  2050  (consistent  with  a  maximum  temperature  rise of/uni00A01.5\u00b0C);\n- setting itself targets to be met by 2030 (or sooner) and 2050; p\n- focusing  as  a  priority  on  its  most  GHG-intensive  sectors, i.e. those p that will have a major impact in transitioning towards net-zero;\n\n- basing its alignment efforts on credible climate scenarios published p by recognised bodies;\n- being  transparent,  through  annual  reporting  on  its  progress  and p action plans.\n\nOver  the  next  36/uni00A0months,  Societe  Generale  will  set  itself  a  series  of targets, beginning with the priority macro-sectors in which it can make the  greatest  impact, i.e. the  most  carbon-intensive  sectors  in  its portfolios.  Societe  Generale's  reference  scenario  so  far  has  been  the International  Energy  Agency's  Sustainable  Development  Scenario (SDS).  It  will  gradually  shift  all  its  alignment  targets  over  to  a  2050 net-zero scenario.\n\n## 2021 UPDATE\n\nSociete Generale began work on aligning its loan portfolios in the coal sector several years ago. Continued efforts in this area are bearing fruit, with sound progress being made towards the goal of reducing to zero its exposure to thermal coal by 2030 for companies operating in the sector within the European Union or OECD member countries, and by 2040 elsewhere. In the Oil and Gas sector, the Group was among the first banks to announce the goal of reducing overall exposure by 10% in absolute terms by 2025. At the COP26 climate conference, the Group announced further commitments to address global warming, particularly regarding shale oil and gas, oil sands, extra heavy crude oil, and Arctic oil and Ecuadorian Amazon oil. Accordingly, Societe Generale will no longer:\n\n- provide new financing for the exploration and production of these types of oil and gas; p\n- work with pure upstream players for which the above resources represent more than 30% of their global production; p\n- work  with  diversified  players  (upstream,  midstream  and  downstream)  who  derive  more  than  30%  of  their  overall  revenues  from  the p production of above resources;\n- accept  new  mandates  for  new  liquefied  natural  gas  production  projects  in  North  America  (whether  greenfield  projects  or  significant p expansions of existing capacity), extending the effects of changes further down the value chain.\n\nAs regards power generation, the Group has undertaken to reduce the average CO2 emission intensity of its power portfolio to 67/uni00A0gCO2/kWh by 2040, with interim targets of 212 and 163/uni00A0gCO2/kWh, respectively, for 2025 and 2030.\n\nIn shipping, Societe Generale is working with the International Maritime Organization to apply the Poseidon Principles, designed to reduce CO2 emissions from the sector (targeting a 50% reduction on 2008 levels by 2050).\n\nLast, in steel production, the Group is actively involved in defining shared standards for greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nLooking ahead to its next steps, Societe Generale is also a member of the NZBA's Sectorial Work Track working group, tasked with deciding which sectors to prioritise next when aligning portfolios and devising action plans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## The UN Global Compact's CFO 5.2.6.3 Taskforce\n\nIn  December/uni00A02019,  the  UN  Global  Compact's platform for sustainable financial action set up a working group of Chief Financial Officers from large  companies  to  discuss  how  they  could  push  for  and  facilitate\n\nimplementation  of  sustainable  strategies  within  their  businesses. Alongside  peers,  investors,  financial  institutions  and  the  United Nations, these CFOs have shared ideas, developed new concepts and made  recommendations  on  how  to  unlock  investment  in  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For more information on the CFO Taskforce, visit: https://www.cfotaskforce.org .\n\n## 2021 UPDATE\n\nThe  Societe  Generale  Group's  Deputy  General  Manager  and  Head  of  Finance  joined  the  UN  Global  Compact's  CFO  Taskforce  in September/uni00A02020, not long after it had been set up, making Societe Generale the first commercial bank to join.\n\nSince then, the cross-sector working group has developed the first UN-backed CFO Principles on Integrated SDG Investments and Finance.\n\nThe taskforce has pinpointed four key areas critical to SDG-aligned investments:\n\n- SDG impact thesis and measurement; p\n- integrated SDG strategy and investments; p\n- integrated corporate SDG finance; and p\n- integrated SDG communications and reporting. p\n\nThis  taskforce  includes  the  CFOs  of  60  companies  from  around  the  world.  In  September/uni00A02021,  its  members  set  themselves  the  target  of investing a combined total of USD/uni00A0500/uni00A0billion  towards  SDGs over the next five years and to fostering the necessary environment to attract more capital towards sustainable development. The taskforce's members have also pledged to strengthen their governance frameworks to integrate sustainability in their commercial operations and align their activities with the SDGs most relevant to their respective businesses.\n\n## Equator Principles 5.2.6.4\n\nAdopted by the Group in 2007 and since revised several times, the Equator  Principles  (EP)  are  one  of  the  initiatives  underpinning Societe  Generale's  E&S  General  Principles. In  their  latest  version, dubbed  the  EP4,  which  entered  into  force  on  1/uni00A0October  2020,  the\n\nEquator  Principles  serve  as  a  common  framework  for  the  financial sector and are designed to help signatories (126 international financial institutions  across  38/uni00A0countries  as  at  15/uni00A0December  2021)  identify, assess  and  manage  the  E&S  risks  associated  with  the  major infrastructure projects they advise on and finance.\n\n## 2021 UPDATE\n\nHaving worked with the EP Association to prepare the launch of the EP4, Societe Generale continued to adapt its own tools and procedures accordingly in 2021, training its E&S experts and sales teams on this new version of the EP to ensure its smooth rollout.\n\nAs in previous years, the Group published a report on its Wholesale Banking website describing how it had applied the Equator Principles over the year and listing those of its project financing transactions that fell within their scope. This report is available on the Group's website at https://wholesale.banking.societegenerale.com/fileadmin/user\\_upload/SGCIB/pdf/2020-Equator-Principles-Report.pdf/ .\n\n## Green Investment Principles (GIP) 5.2.6.5\n\nSociete Generale signed the Green Investment Principles in November/uni00A02019.  Defined  by  the  China  Green  Finance  Committee  and the City of London's Green Finance Initiative, the GIP comprise seven principles  for  green  investment,  covering  matters  such  as  strategy, operations  and  innovation.  They  are  intended  to  guide  financial institutions in adopting responsible practices in E&S risk management and positive impact financial products for the Belt and Road* region. The  GIP  Secretariat  is  also  planning  to  compile  a  database  of  green projects  to  make  investments  within  the  Belt  and  Road  region  more\n\ntransparent,  while  bridging  the  information  gap  between  financiers and project developers.\n\nThe GIP overlap with and bolster certain other commitments made by Societe Generale, such as the Principles for Responsible Banking, the Equator Principles and the UN-PRI, signed by Societe Generale Private Banking and Societe Generale Assurances.\n\nThey  come  into  play  mainly  in  connection  with  investments  in  Asia, making the Group's rollout of its E&S risk management framework in the region key when implementing them.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## 2021 UPDATE\n\nAt the third plenary meeting of the Green Investment Principles for the Belt and Road, held in Beijing in 2021, Societe Generale was presented with the Best Implementation Award. The award recognises the overall performance of signatories as regards the four main aspects of the GIP: governance and strategy, risk assessment and management, investment and corporate footprint, disclosure and engagement.\n\nThe Group submitted its second report to the GIP Secretariat. The GIP Secretariat uses the information gleaned from these reports from its members to prepare consolidated annual progress reports. It released its second such report in 2021, entitled Stepping into the Net Zero Era. This report features a project in which Societe Generale was involved, namely an infrastructure project in Vietnam. A number of the Group's best practices are also included in the form of case studies, e.g. a case study on monitoring progress towards climate goals.\n\nThe  Societe  Generale  teams  also  contribute  to  the  GIP's  working  group  created  to  compile  a  database  on  sustainable  investment  to encourage green investment and financing.\n\n## Poseidon Principles 5.2.6.6\n\nSociete  Generale  is  one  of  the  founding  signatories  of  the  Poseidon Principles, launched in 2019 together with other banks that finance the shipping industry and in collaboration with the Global Maritime Forum. The Poseidon Principles aim to promote a low-carbon future for the global  shipping  industry by  integrating  climate  decision-making  into\n\nportfolio  management  and  lending  decisions  in  respect  of  ship financing.  The  Poseidon  Principles  are  consistent  with  the  goal  of  the International  Maritime  Organization  (IMO)  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions from the shipping sector by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 levels. Societe Generale has also announced that it has joined the Getting  to  Zero  coalition,  which  aims  to  develop  and  deploy commercially viable deep-sea zero-emission vessels by 2030.\n\n## 2021 UPDATE\n\nIn September/uni00A02021, Societe Generale signed the Call to Action for Shipping Decarbonization, the launch of which was timed to coincide with the UN General Assembly.\n\nIt has also updated the indicator used to monitor the alignment of its shipping portfolio. Details of this change will be given in the Group's Climate Disclosure Report, in the societegenerale.com corporate website.\n\n## Hydrogen Council 5.2.6.7\n\nIn August/uni00A02019, the Group became a member of the Hydrogen Council, a  global  initiative  launched  in  connection  with  the  2017  World Economic  Forum  in  Davos  by  major  companies  operating  in  the energy,  transport  and  industrial  sectors.  The  Hydrogen  Council  now has  more  than  120/uni00A0member  companies  from  across  the  various industrial  and  energy  sectors  involved  in  the  hydrogen  value  chain: energy,  oil  and  gas,  chemicals,  commodities,  metals  and  mining, equipment  manufacturers,  cars  and  trucks,  and  other  forms  of transport  (air,  rail,  shipping).  The  Council  estimates  that,  by  2050, low-carbon hydrogen solutions could meet 18% of the world's energy\n\nSociete  Generale  has  joined  the  Hydrogen  Council's  new  Investor Group, thereby reiterating its commitment to playing a key role in the energy transition. Hydrogen can make low-carbon supply chains a reality and Societe Generale intends to make  an  active contribution  to  developing  these  solutions ,  just  as  it  did  with  the financing  of  renewable  energies.  The  Group's  robust  innovation, advisory, financing, and debt and equity structuring franchises will all come into play in developing this energy of the future.\n\n## 2021 UPDATE\n\nSociete Generale helps hydrogen project leaders better understand how to attract investors and get long-term financing for their large-scale projects. The Hydrogen Council's members work on a wide range of projects; as part of the Investor Group, Societe Generale focuses more specifically  on  financing  for  hydrogen  transmission  infrastructure  and  large  captive  fleets  of  hydrogen  trucks.  The  Group  gets  involved upstream and discusses issues of financing and fixed assets with project leaders.\n\n2021 saw Societe Generale act as the sole financial advisor on the creation and structuring of the world's largest fund dedicated to clean hydrogen  infrastructure.  The  target  fund  size  totalled  EUR/uni00A01.5/uni00A0billion,  with  initial  commitments  of  EUR/uni00A0800/uni00A0million  already  secured  from investors  and  industrial  sponsors.  Founded  on  solid  industrial  expertise  and  offering  significant  investment  potential,  the  fund  will  be uniquely placed to unlock large-scale projects under development and accelerate the scaling-up of hydrogen markets.\n\nThe Group's discussions with public and state bodies are invaluable in this respect, allowing it to offer an expert's perspective on questions surrounding how best to set up public financial support to facilitate the ramp-up of these new low-carbon technologies.\n\ndemand  and  reduce  annual  CO2  emissions  by  6/uni00A0Gt,  illustrating  its enormous  potential  for  the  energy  transition  (see  the  Hydrogen Council's November/uni00A02017 report entitled Hydrogen, Scaling Up).\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  aims  to  support  the  banking\n\nsector in its efforts to combat deforestation by transforming the supply chains  of  certain  agricultural  commodities  such  as  palm  oil,  soy, timber and beef.\n\nThe  signatory  banks  -  which,  since  2015,  have  included  Societe Generale - undertook to help their main clients in these sectors achieve zero net deforestation by the end of 2020.\n\n## 2021 UPDATE\n\nAlthough the target of zero net deforestation in 2020 was not met - signatory banks collectively recognised the complexity of the challenges involved - Societe Generale nonetheless forged ahead with its own efforts to combat the deforestation and biodiversity loss stemming from exploitation of the commodities covered by the Soft Commodities Compact.\n\nIn 2020, the Group published a study of its own impact on deforestation and the level of maturity shown by its Corporate and Investment Banking clients concerning this issue (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/2020-12/SG-Tackling-deforestationSoft-commodities-report-12.2020.pdf) . The study formed the basis for a review of its agricultural sector policies in 2021.\n\n## Sustainable IT Charter 5.2.6.9\n\nIn November/uni00A02019, Societe Generale was one of the first companies to sign the Sustainable IT Charter to help limit the environmental impact of technology and promote digital inclusion.\n\nThis  Charter  is  a  French  initiative  developed  by  the Institut  du Num\u00e9rique  Responsable (the  INR,  a  French  think  and  do  tank)  in partnership with the General Commission on Sustainable Development (CGDD)  of  the  French  Ministry  for  the  Ecological  and  Solidarity Transition,  WWF*,  ADEME*  (the  French  Environment  and  Energy Management  Agency)  and  Fing*  (a  leading  think  tank  on  digital transformation).  It  was  launched  in  June/uni00A02019  and  now  has  82 signatories  spanning  companies,  non-profit  associations,  VSBs  and SMEs,  and  public  entities.  For  more  information  on  the  Charter,  see https://charte.institutnr.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/english-chartersustainable-it.pdf .\n\nIn signing the Charter, Societe Generale committed to:\n\n- optimising  digital  tools  to  limit  their  environmental  impact  and p consumption;\n- developing accessible, inclusive and sustainable service offerings; p\n- disseminating ethical and responsible digital practices; p\n- making  digital  technologies  and  services  measurable,  transparent p and readable; and\n- fostering the emergence of new behaviours and values. p\n\n## 2021 UPDATE\n\nHaving defined its strategy, launched its CSR by IT programme and developed the first key deliverables in 2020, the IT Function focused in 2021 on delivering and rolling out the tools needed for the 'CSR by design' approach:\n\n- it  optimised  digital  tools  by  adding  CSR  criteria  to  the  parameters  used  when  comparing  IT  architecture  scenarios  and  assessing  IT p proposals;\n- It  worked  on  ethical  and  responsible  digital  practices  by  commissioning  reviews  of  its  digital  accessibility  from  a  number  of  service p providers in the social and solidarity sector;\n- it promoted the development of accessible, inclusive and sustainable service offerings and the adoption of the corresponding mindset by p making the MOOC on responsible digital technology part of the training programme for all IT Function employees;\n- it  circulated  ethical  and  responsible  digital  practices  by  coordinating  several  campaigns  to  promote  eco-friendly  practices  and  digital p accessibility,  and  recorded  four  masterclasses  which  it  posted  online  (in  French)  for  Group  employees  and  anyone  else  interested  in learning more about responsible digital practices (https://careers.societegenerale.com/green-it-program?xtor=AD-122-[link-masterclass]) ;\n- it worked on making digital technology measurable, transparent and comprehensible by launching a new version of the carbon footprint p calculator for its IT systems;\n- it fostered the emergence of new behaviours and values by pushing ahead with its efforts to reduce electronic waste in France, focusing in p particular on finding new uses for decommissioned IT equipment and offering Societe Generale employees refurbished mobile phones.\n\nFor more information, see IT systems and Infrastructures, page/uni00A0337.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## E&S RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE BUSINESSES TO PROMOTE FAIR 5.2.7 AND RESPONSIBLE GROWTH\n\nThe Group constantly strives to boost the positive impacts and reduce or manage the negative impacts of its activities, products and services on people and the environment. One of the main premises of its CSR ambition  is  to  consider  the  economic,  social,  environmental  and ethical  impacts  linked  to  its  operational  activities  (both  direct  and indirect) as well as its commercial activities.\n\nEnvironmental, social or human rights risk factors may also trigger or aggravate  various  other  risks  for  the  Group,  such  as  compliance, reputation or credit risks.\n\nE&S  issues  may  dent  the  Group's  credit  risk.  Climate  change,  in particular, can hinder the capacity of borrowers to repay loans.\n\nInadequate  E&S  risk  management,  such  as  a  framework  that  is  not  a good fit for the Group's activities, that does not go far enough, or one that lacks diligent implementation, could lead to a risk of non-compliance with laws governing E&S issues or with the Group's E&S commitments. This compliance risk could, in turn, trigger a reputation risk  for  the  Group.  Reputation  risk  could  also  arise  from  a  negative perception by stakeholders, particularly external  stakeholders,  of  how the Group handles E&S issues.\n\n## A strengthened E&S risk 5.2.7.1 management framework\n\nE&S  risk  management  is  an  important  factor  in  the  processes governing how Societe Generale conducts business. The Group works with  its  partners  to  identify  and  assess  its  E&S  impacts  and  the associated risks, so as to adopt appropriate prevention or mitigation strategies.  E&S  impact  and  risk  assessment  is  also  included  in  its decision-making  processes  through  a  multi-pronged  approach: identification,  quantification,  determination  of  risk  appetite,  control and mitigation.\n\nThe  framework  for  and  governance  of  E&S  risk  management  are regularly  reviewed  to  consider  developments  in  E&S  issues  or associated  regulations,  as  well  as  any  new  commitments  for  Societe Generale. They were significantly strengthened at Group level in 2019 before being adopted operationally within the Business Units in 2020.\n\nThe E&S risk management framework was further reviewed over 2020 and  2021  in  light  of  the  Duty  of  Care  Act  and  the  Group's  gradual implementation of the Principles for Responsible Banking.\n\n## E&S General Principles 5.2.7.2 and sector policies\n\nThe  E&S  General  Principles apply  to  all  financial  and  banking transactions and services provided by Societe Generale entities. They set out the framework applicable to those Group activities that could have an E&S impact due to their product and service offering.\n\nThe  E&S  General  Principles  were  updated  in  2021.  The  updated version  and  the  appendices  are  available  on  the  Group's  corporate website ( https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/ documents/2021-03/Environmental-and-Social-General-Principles.pdf).\n\nThe updated principles include the addition of three statements on major cross-sector issues:\n\n- human rights (updating the previous statement); p\n- the climate (new statement); and p\n- biodiversity (new statement). p\n\nThese  statements  set  out  the  main  reference  standards  for  these issues, as well as Societe Generale's undertaking to comply with these standards and encourage its clients to do likewise. They also detail the various  initiatives  the  Group  has  joined  to  improve  how  it  handles these issues in its economic activities.\n\nThe sector-specific  and  cross-sector  policies,  referred  to  as  the E&S/uni00A0policies, define  the  standards  that  the  Group  agrees  to  apply in/uni00A0sectors considered  potentially  sensitive  from  an  E&S  or  ethics perspective,  including  oil  and  gas,  and  mining.  The  E&S  policies  are public/uni00A0and available on the Group's corporate website (https://www.societegenerale.com/en/responsibility/ethics-and-governance) . The E&S General Principles and policies are updated in line with regulatory, scientific  or  societal  developments,  peer  practices  and  the  Group's strategy.  All  updates  are  approved  by  the  Responsible  Commitments Committee (CORESP).\n\nSociete  Generale's  E&S  policies  cover  sensitive  sectors  in  which  the Group operates. Several policies deal with energy and mining due to the importance of these sectors for both the economy and for Societe Generale, and the potential they offer for significant progress in terms of atmospheric  emissions  as  well  as  impacts  on  the  natural environment  and  on  local  communities  (dams  and  hydroelectric power,  thermal  power  plants,  thermal-  and  coal-fired  power  plants, mines,  civil  nuclear  power,  and  oil  and  gas)  -  see  Supporting  the environmental  transition,  page/uni00A0296. Policies exist covering  the defence, shipping, farming and forestry sectors.\n\nThe E&S policies all follow the same structure: they identify E&S risk factors, list sector-specific or thematic reference standards, specify the scope  of  the  activities  covered  (subsectors,  financial  and  banking products and services) and define for each sector or theme the criteria in respect of:\n\n- the  Group's  corporate  clients  (excluding  financial  institutions  and p sovereigns);\n- transactions:  products  and  services  with  a  known  underlying  (for p example, asset or project finance);\n- securities  held  for  the  Bank's  own  account  or  on  behalf  of  third p parties;\n- specific  products  or  services,  such  as  agricultural  commodity p derivatives.\n\nThe  E&S  sector  policies  define  three  sets  of  criteria  for  each  of  the above-listed categories:\n\n- E&S  exclusion  criteria are  designed  to  exclude  from  the  Group's p activities certain types of corporate clients, issuers, and banking or financial  products,  dedicated  services  and  transactions  associated with  underlying  practices  or  activities  that  are  damaging  to  the environment and/or human rights in ways that make improvement within a reasonable timeframe impossible;\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "DEFINING A ROBUST SUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\n- E&S  priority  assessment  criteria address  priority  risk  factors p requiring  a  targeted  and  systematic  response  as  part  of  the assessment  process.  If  a  client  does  not  satisfy  the  assessment criteria, it must improve its practices within a reasonable timeframe (steps required may include a formal action plan or the signature of contractual  undertakings).  For  dedicated  transactions  or  projects, satisfaction of the criteria must form part of the project development phase. For dedicated advisory services ahead of project development,  the  Group  must  assess  the  client's  commitment  to developing a project that will satisfy these criteria;\n- other E&S assessment criteria are  designed  to  identify  other  risk p factors associated with the sector in question that also need to be considered as part of the E&S assessment, and to set out the best practices the Group wishes to promote:\n- its  E&S  policies  were  reviewed  in  2021,  bringing  them  into  line -with  the  changes  made  to  its  E&S  risk  management  system,  as detailed in the Group's normative documentation (the SG Code and the recently updated E&S General Principles), as well as with the Group's  new  commitments  (under  the  Principles  for Responsible Banking and Poseidon Principles, and as part of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance),\n- in addition, the updates to the Oil and Gas sector policy reflected -the  Group's  targets  in  its  latest  commitments  regarding  this sector,  while  the  Industrial  Agriculture,  Agri-food  and  Forestry policy,  which  henceforth  covers  the  palm  oil,  fisheries,  soy  and South  American  livestock  sectors,  deepened  Societe  Generale's commitments in these sectors by insisting on a more ambitious framework regarding deforestation risks,\n- the previous cross-sector biodiversity policy has been abandoned, -given that tougher, more specific criteria on biodiversity are now included in the sector-specific policies for sensitive sectors.\n\n## Operational implementation 5.2.7.3 procedures\n\nE&S risk management procedures have been in place within the Group for  several  years.  2019  was  marked  by  the  updating  of  the  E&S  risk management principles  and  their  integration  into  its  new  normative documentation  (the  Societe  Generale  Code).  The  idea  behind  the revision  and  implementation  process  was  to  integrate  E&S  risk management  into  existing  risk  management  processes,  such  as transactional  processes,  onboarding  processes  and  periodic  client review  processes.  Aspects  relating  to  E&S  issues  are  thus  gradually being  included  in  the  Business  Units'  credit  and  reputation  risk management  policies  and  processes.  These  efforts  continued throughout 2020 and 2021, with the gradual integration of the latest changes into BU and SU processes.\n\nE&S risk management comprises three main steps:\n\n- E&S risk identification: this step consists in identifying whether the p counterparty's  activities  or  the  transaction  with  that  counterparty could present an E&S risk. This is done primarily by checking whether the counterparty or its underlying activities are on the E&S exclusion list or the E&S identification list, whether they are the subject of any E&S-related  controversy  and  whether  they  are  covered  by  a  sector policy  (some  Business  Units  limit  this  to  sector  policies  containing exclusion  criteria).  This  process  is  designed  to  confirm  compliance with the exclusion criteria from the sector/uni00A0policies.\n\nAn  E&S  identification  list  is  regularly  updated  by  in-house  experts and sent to all businesses concerned. This internal list details any projects, company, activity sectors or countries that are the object of severe controversy or public campaigns on the part of civil society for  E&S  reasons,  irrespective  of  whether  they  are  financed  by Societe  Generale.  The  purpose  of  this  internal  list  is  to  alert  the operational  teams  to  potential  concerns  ahead  of  the  client  and transaction  review  process,  so  that  they  can  be  prepared  to  carry out  a  more  in-depth  E&S  assessment  of  any  transactions  and clients/uni00A0concerned.\n\nIn  addition to the E&S identification list, there is also an exclusion list,  which  is  likewise  regularly  updated  and  sent  out  to  the operational  teams  at  least  once  a  year.  This  internal  list  indicates companies that have been excluded under the Defence sector policy due  to  their  involvement  in  the  production,  storage  or  sale  of controversial  weapons,  especially  antipersonnel  mines  or  cluster bombs.  Societe  Generale  has  pledged  that  it  will  not  knowingly supply banking or financial services to such companies, their parent companies or their subsidiaries.\n\nThis  exclusion  list  is  gradually  being  extended  to  reflect  the  new exclusion  criteria  added  to  certain  E&S  policies  when  they  were updated. Going forward, the aim is to eventually incorporate this list directly into the Group's IT processing systems. Companies can also be  excluded  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  for  example  further  to  E&S assessments  conducted  as  part  of  onboarding  processes  or  in relation  to  processes  for  certain  types  of  specific  activity  such  as coal, oil sands and Arctic oil;\n\n- E&S assessment (of counterparties or transactions identified as p presenting  an  E&S  risk): when  an  E&S  risk  is  identified,  the business  line  assesses  compliance  with  the  criteria  from  the applicable E&S policy(ies) and the Group's other E&S commitments, and  weighs  up  the  severity  of  any  E&S  controversies.  This assessment  may  include  a  prospective  analysis  of  these  criteria. Based on the conclusions of the assessment, an E&S opinion is then issued.  The  opinion  may  be  positive,  conditional  (subject  to contractual conditions, action plans, restrictions) or negative;\n- E&S  actions: E&S  mitigation  actions  may  be  recommended  to p mitigate the risks identified.\n\nE&S  assessments  and  actions  are  reviewed  by  the  second  line  of defence  (the  Risk  or  Compliance  Department,  depending  on  the process) and may, where necessary, be mediated by the heads of the business lines  or  by  General  Management,  through  the  CORESP.  The business units are also gradually introducing monitoring and controls into their E&S risk management processes.\n\nIn  addition  to  identifying,  assessing  and  defining  actions  to  mitigate potential  negative  impacts,  these  processes  also  serve  to  identify counterparties and transactions for positive impact financing regarding  sustainable  development.  This  dual  approach  underpins Societe  Generale's  efforts  in  respect  of  Sustainable  and  Positive Impact Finance (see A Bank committed to sustainable and responsible finance, page/uni00A0290.\n\nTo  ensure  a  smooth  and  systematic  rollout  of  this  E&S  risk management framework across the Group, a new compulsory online training module was developed in 2021 for all BUs and SUs covered by the framework. It is available in 11 languages, ensuring that the same content is consistently available to everyone in the Group wherever it operates. At the end of 2021, 11,065 Group employees had completed the training module.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Operational implementation 5.2.7.4 in the Group's Business Units\n\nIn the Corporate and Investment Banking arm, a dedicated team of experts  assists  the  sales  teams  to  assess  E&S  issues  in  respect  of clients.  This  E&S  analysis  was  until  recently  underpinned  by  a risk-based  approach,  with  in-depth  E&S  assessments  being  reserved for  clients  deemed  to  be  a  priority.  This  situation  has  evolved  since 2020,  however,  with  the  aim  now  being  to  eventually  extend  this analysis  to  all  Corporate  and  Investment  Banking  clients  (excluding financial  institutions  and  sovereigns),  regardless  of  their  sector  of activity.  The  purpose  is  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  their portfolios  so  as  to  be  able  to  support  them  in  transitioning  towards sustainable  development.  This  dedicated  team  of  experts  helps  the sales  teams  assess  and  better  understand  the  E&S  impacts  of transactions,  which  reflects  the  Group's  voluntary  commitments, notably its E&S policies and the Equator Principles.\n\nCorporate and Investment Banking has also voluntarily implemented procedures  to  manage  the  E&S  risks  associated  with  dedicated projects and assets not currently covered by the Equator Principles (as last  amended in 2020), namely in capital market transactions (equity or  debt),  mergers  and  acquisitions,  and  acquisition  financing.  The Group  modified  the  E&S  assessment  form  in  its  IT  systems  in  2021, optimising  the  assessment  process  for  transactions  and  how information  is  shared  with  the  Risk  Division.  Over  500/uni00A0employees across the various regions and business lines concerned were trained in  the  new  process  when  it  entered  into  effect.  A  recording  of  the training session remains available for those who need it.\n\nThroughout  2021, Private  Banking began  work  on  centralising CSR/ESG  governance  for  all  of  its  pillars  (France,  Private  Banking Europe  and  United  Kingdom).  Certain  existing  initiatives  have  now been transferred to this new centralised governance structure, which, for example, has:\n\n- taken over the operational rollout of E&S risk monitoring policies; p\n- stepped  up  employee  training  on  CSR  issues:  some  1,700  training p hours were dispensed in 2021.\n\nFrench Retail Banking strengthened its  E&S  assessment  process  for corporate  clients  in  2020  to  reflect  recent  changes  in  the  Societe Generale Code. The main tools, such as the E&S assessment procedure and client assessment forms, were improved and updated. In the same year,  a  new  Customer  Experience,  Responsibility  and  Ethics  Division was  also  created  within  French  Retail  Banking  to  better  coordinate actions designed to improve client experience, while adhering to CSR and  ethics  standards.  This  division  liaises  with  regional  business centres through a team of corporate customer officers.\n\nThis  team  supervises  the  achievement  of  Retail  Banking's  CSR  goals and  produces  metrics,  including  for  E&S  risk  management.  It  also organises an assimilation programme, designed to make all employees fully aware of the ethics and responsibility issues involved in banking and to ensure they adhere to them.\n\nIn  2021,  Retail  Banking  added  three  new  themes  to  the  CSR  training programme available to its 21,000/uni00A0employees:\n\n- the  first  concerns  the  energy  transition  (2,720/uni00A0employees  working p with  corporate  clients  completed  this  module  between  June  and September);\n- the second covers the basics of CSR and the Group's strategy, and is p now  compulsory  training  for  all  Retail  Banking  employees (completed by 18,241/uni00A0employees);\n- the  third  theme  deals  with  the  Group's  culture  as  regards  climate p change and biodiversity (completed by 409/uni00A0employees).\n\nWithin International  Retail  Banking since  2019,  E&S  experts  have been appointed in both of the regional divisions in sub-Saharan Africa and both structured finance platforms in North Africa, as well as in the main  subsidiaries  in  Eastern  Europe,  Russia  and  Asia.  These  experts support  local  sales  departments  and  work  closely  with  Sustainable Development Department experts at Group and BU level.\n\nThe  Group's  normative  documentation  has  been  transposed  into  a procedure  for  the  Business  Unit  covering  subsidiaries  in  Africa  and overseas France. E&S experts were on hand to provide training when the procedure was rolled out in these subsidiaries throughout 2021 to guide  the  supplementaire  training  initiatives.  A  new  procedure  was also introduced in 2021 for the structured financing platforms in Africa, detailing  how  their  middle  offices  should  manage  E&S  clauses  in contracts./uni00A0A  total  of  315  team-lead  employees  received  training  with regard to the regulatory framework.\n\nE&S  experts  have  been  tightening  up  due  diligence  processes  on projects  covered  by  the  Equator  Principles,  in  line  with  the  latest version (EP4). Through their work and with the help of other in-house experts and training from outside providers such as IBIS Consulting in Africa, these experts also continue to perfect their own skills.\n\nThe  Group's  subsidiaries  in Europe  and  Russia (BRD*,  KB*  and Rosbank*)  have  transposed  the  Group's  regulatory  documentation into their own  respective  regulatory  documentation,  ensuring compliance with local laws. These new procedures were deployed and implemented over the course of 2021. Employees in these subsidiaries were offered training on E&S policies.\n\nWithin Financial  Services , Societe  Generale  Equipment  Finance* (SGEF)  is  in  the  process  of  adapting  the  E&S  risk  assessment framework  to  its  clients  and  transactions.  SGEF  also  performs  E&S assessments  on  the  main  assets  it  finances,  especially  those manufactured by Vendor partners. Green financing is a growth area for SGEF and is the subject of regular discussions with the other entities.\n\nAt ALD Automotive *, client E&S risk identification has been part of KYC (Know Your Customer) processes for several years, as with all Group entities. The corporate E&S experts conduct in-depth E&S assessments of  priority  clients.  For  more  information,  see  ALD's  Statement  of extra-financial performance: (https://www.aldautomotive.com/Portals/ international/Documents/ALD\\_URD2020\\_EN\\_MEL\\_21-04-27.pdf?ver= 2021-04-27-142150-220#page=115) .\n\n<!-- image -->",

The asset  management  arm  applies  both  the  Group's  Coal  and  Weapons exclusion list and Private Banking's own exclusion list - issuers subject to  a  particularly  severe  ESG  controversy  (MSCI  red  flags)  as  well  as those with the poorest ESG ratings - for all direct security investments (shares and bonds). The principles apply to all assets under advisory or discretionary  management.  Private  Banking  has  also  applied  these same exclusion rules to its advisory services since 2020, i.e. it no longer provides advisory on the most controversial or least favourably rated securities, although  all  investment  and  disinvestment  decisions ultimately  lie  with  the  end  client.  Societe  Generale  Private  Banking's investment policy is publicly available on its website ( https://www.privatebanking.societegenerale.com/fileadmin/user\\_ upload/SGPB/PDF/SGPB\\_Investment\\_Policy-Sustainability\\_risk\\_and\\_ adverse\\_impacts.pdf) . As  an  extension  of  its  responsible  investor approach, Societe Generale Private Banking has defined a proxy voting policy  for  voting  rights  attached  to  securities  held  by  the  collective investment schemes (AIFs and UCITS) it manages. This policy sets out the  main  principles  of  corporate  governance  with  which  the  asset management  company  agrees  to  comply,  and  establishes  Societe\n\nGenerale Private Banking's voting principles on key issues. The Proxy Voting Policy is reviewed annually to consider any legal developments or changes in Corporate Governance Codes and market practices that may  have  occurred  over  the  year.  It  is  approved  by  the  Internal Governance Committee. The policy is publicly available on the Societe Generale Private Banking website, as is the corresponding policy for the management company, SG29: https://sgpwm.societegenerale.com/ fileadmin/user\\_upload/sgpwm/PDF\\_doc\\_funds/SGPWM\\_-\\_Proxy\\_Voting \\_2020\\_11\\_EN.pdf; https://sg29haussmann.societegenerale.fr/fileadmin/ user\\_upload/SG29H/pdf/NEW\\_REG/Politique\\_d\\_engagement\\_et\\_de\\_ vote\\_2021\\_SG\\_29\\_Haussmann.pdf [in French] .\n\nIn  the Insurance  activities ,  extra-financial  risks  are  managed  using risk  management  and  internal  control  systems.  The  aims  of  these systems are, respectively to:\n\n- manage  risk  at  all  times  through  identification  and  assessment, p followed by the implementation of appropriate mitigating measures, where necessary;\n- prevent  malfunctions,  ensure  the  suitability  and  effectiveness  of p internal  processes,  and  guarantee  the  reliability,  integrity  and availability  of  financial,  prudential  and  management  information. These systems are based in particular on policies approved by the Sog\u00e9cap Board of Directors which defined the principles, processes and  procedures  implemented,  as  well  as  the  governance  and  key metrics, for each type of risk.\n\nMore information on the risk management and internal control systems can  be  found  in  the  Solvency  Reports  (pages/uni00A019-32  of  the  Sog\u00e9cap report on the life insurance activity:\n\n|",

As a result,  climate-related  risks  can  be  integrated  using  its  existing governance  and  processes  and  managed  according  to  the  standard approach  of  identification,  quantification,  definition  of  risk  appetite, control and mitigation.\n\nThe  impacts  of  climate  change  on  the  world's  physical,  social  and economic  systems  are  becoming  ever  more  apparent.  They  include both  direct  impacts  (the  physical  effects  of  climate  change)  and indirect impacts (measures to transition to a low-carbon economy or to adapt to or minimise the negative effects of climate change).\n\nSociete  Generale  has  adopted  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related Financial  Disclosures'  (TCFD)  definitions  for  transition  risks*  and physical risks*.\n\nThe Group uses the following indicators to assess climate-related risks and to act accordingly.\n\n## CORPORATE CLIMATE VULNERABILITY 5.2.7.6.1 INDICATOR\n\nThe impact of transition risk* on the credit risk of Societe Generale's corporate clients has been identified as the main climate-related risk for  the  Group.  In  order  to  assess  this  impact,  the  Group  is  gradually incorporating  a  Corporate  Climate  Vulnerability  Indicator  (CCVI)  into the  credit  risk  assessments  it  performs  on  its  most  exposed counterparties in particularly vulnerable sectors. The idea is to assess transition risks by quantifying the impact of a given climate scenario on the credit rating of borrowers in a set of priority sectors, assuming that  the  borrowers  do  not  implement  any  adaptation  measures. Assessing  transition  risk  is  a  five-stage  process:  identify  priority sectors,  select  a  single  climate  scenario,  define  homogeneous segments  within  each  sector,  assign  borrowers  to  segments,  and assess the borrowers' climate vulnerability. The CCVI pinpoints clients that  are  vulnerable  to  transition  risks.  These  clients'  transition strategies will subsequently be reviewed, and an opinion issued.\n\n## INDUSTRY CLIMATE VULNERABILITY 5.2.7.6.2 INDICATOR\n\nThe Industry Climate Vulnerability Indicator (ICVI) assesses the ability of  the  industry  sectors  covered  to  withstand  the  consequences  of climate-related  risks  or  adapt  to  moderate  potential  damage.  It expresses how vulnerable each sector is to the physical and transition risks of climate change, making it possible to identify both the sectors that are most at risk and those that stand to gain from the situation. Each sector is awarded a score for physical and transition risks, adding to the information gleaned through other sector assessments.\n\n## SOVEREIGN CLIMATE VULNERABILITY 5.2.7.6.3 INDICATOR\n\nThe  Sovereign  Climate  Vulnerability  Indicator  (SCVI)  assesses  the vulnerability  of  sovereign  counterparties  to  physical  and  transition risks.  It  has  been  developed  for  use  with  various  climate  change scenarios. It expresses how vulnerable a country is to climate-related risks, with a view to understanding the direct impact on the associated country risk, i.e. on the country's ability and willingness to honour its external debt commitments.\n\n## IDENTIFYING HOW PHYSICAL RISK* 5.2.7.6.4 AFFECTS CREDIT RISK, USING SCENARIO ANALYSIS\n\nThe Group has opted to focus on developing its own in-house tools to identify  physical  climate-related  risks.  It  began  its  R&D  work  on  the physical  impacts  of  these  risks  on  its  portfolios  by  looking  at  the French  retail  mortgage  portfolio,  where  the  precise  location  of  the financed  assets  was  known.  The  Group  has  also  developed  a  web application capable of identifying municipalities at risk of drought or flooding  (coastal  or  inland),  as  well  as  French  administrative  areas (d\u00e9partements) subject to wildfire risk.\n\n## TREATING PHYSICAL RISK AS PART 5.2.7.6.5 OF THE GROUP'S OPERATIONAL RISK\n\nSociete Generale defines operational risk as the risk of losses resulting from  human  error,  external  events,  or  inadequacies  or  failures  in processes  or  systems.  It  assesses  the  physical  risks  to  its  assets  and operations as part of its operational risk analysis. The Group performs analysis  region  by  region  and  the  results  feed  into  the  business continuity  plans  (BCPs)  designed  to  address  local  risks.  The  existing BCPs  therefore  cover  the  consequences  of  weather  events,  whether affecting the entirety of the Group's human, technical and installation resources or solely one part thereof.\n\nFor  more  information,  see  the  Group's  Climate  Disclosure  Report: https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/2020-12/ societe-generale-climate-disclosure-report.pdf.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To  this  end,  the  Group  has developed  a comprehensive  approach  to  incorporating  CSR considerations into  its  range  of  products  and  services.  It  has  also developed sustainable  finance  indicators to  monitor  how  this offering  performs  with  its  customers.  In  addition  to  this  broad approach, Societe Generale has decided to focus its Corporate Social Responsibility  efforts  on  two  major  areas: the  environmental transition and contributing to local communities. As a long-standing  leader  in  energy,  the  Group  has  made  the  energy transition a priority and is supporting its customers in this regard. As a major  player  in  economic  development,  Societe  Generale  has  made sustainable regional development the second priority area in its action plans,  especially  in  Africa,  where  the  Group  enjoys  a  strong  foothold and a presence spanning more than 100/uni00A0years.\n\n## A holistic approach to 5.3.1.1 sustainability\n\nSociete Generale has structured responsible and  innovative investment  and  financing  solutions  contributing  to  the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a way of fostering activities with a positive impact on the development of the economy and  society,  beyond  the  challenges  of  the  energy  transition.  As  a responsible  bank,  Societe  Generale  is  determined  to  work  with  its clients, whether or not they currently meet all its sustainability criteria, to help them progress towards a fair, green and inclusive transition in keeping with its own commitments.\n\nSustainability concerns are an integral part of the offer and are suited to all the Group's clients , covering corporate and investment banking as well as financial services.\n\nIt is based on an innovative approach that merges Societe Generale's expertise  in  working  ESG  criteria  into  its  financial  products  and services  with  the  analysis  of  its  customers'  financial  sustainability requirements, as illustrated in the following chart.\n\n|",

The range of products aimed at Global Banking  and  Investor  Solutions  clients  relies  on  the  expertise  of  a dedicated  team  of  experts  in  the  E&S  Advisory  and  Impact  Finance Solutions department. They are responsible for analysing the specific needs of customers and for helping them  with  their own positive-impact  projects*  in  order  to  select  or  structure  appropriate solutions in keeping with the Group's own commitments.\n\nAccordingly, the Group offers a wide range of products tailored to its customers' ESG strategies, including:\n\n- green,  social  and  sustainable  loans,  bonds  and  securitisation*: p Societe Generale has developed a range of green loans and bonds generating social benefits and including a sustainability component. The range links the financing structure to the achievement of ESG\n\ngoals, encouraging customers to step up their sustainability efforts. Sustainability  mechanisms  offer  multiple  structuring  possibilities that are set on a case-by-case basis. Goals are discussed with clients and supported by incentives. With this tailor-made structured offer, the Group works hand in hand with its clients to help them achieve their sustainability goals and CSR targets;\n\n- green,  sustainable  export  finance*: the  Group's  finance  offer p focuses  on  five  main  sectors:  renewable  energy,  hydrogen,  clean transport, waste management and sustainable water use. Compared to the previous offer, the sustainable export finance offer now aims to support the Group's customers who have embarked on a genuine transition  to  a  more  sustainable  business  model.  Based  on  an incentive  mechanism,  Societe  Generale  undertakes  to  adapt  its financial  terms  to  the  CSR  targets  set  with  our  customers.

In  conjunction  with  manufacturers, energy  service  suppliers  and  specialised  financial  intermediaries, Societe Generale Equipment Finance incorporates circular economy principles  into  its  financing  solutions.  In  so  doing,  it  fosters  the transition  from  a  model  based  on  asset  ownership  to  models connected to an asset's life cycle.\n\nMoreover, the Group has developed a dedicated ESG Advisory offer to guide its clients in stepping up their extra-financial performance with a view to accessing financial markets.\n\n## Impact-based finance approach\n\nIn  addition  to  sustainable  finance  products,  experts  from  the  E&S Advisory and Impact Finance Solutions team are working to develop new ways of financing high-impact investment with the business lines where no suitable package exists in the traditional markets.\n\n## IMPACT AND STRUCTURING ADVISORY TO JOINTLY CREATE AND FINANCE NEW ECONOMIC MODELS\n\nIncreased bankability and market size\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  impact-based  finance  approach  for  global  clients  focuses  on analysing impacts to address global clients' need for advisory as they shift  towards  incorporating  the  United  Nations  SDGs  into  their business  model,  but  struggle  to  finance  their  investments.  We  help clients take a detailed look at environmental and social aspects with the ultimate aim of augmenting the positive impact of their projects, facilitating  funding  and  achieving  economies  of  scale.  The  model  is built on three steps:\n\n- augment  impact: by  providing  multiple  services  and  pooling 1. costs,  projects  can  generate  more  social,  environmental  and economic impacts, as well as additional revenues. Reducing the 'cost-to-impact'  increases  profitability,  strengthens  resilience and generates an appetite for finance;\n- improve  credit  quality: Societe  Generale  provides  expert 2. structuring  advice  to  improve  credit  quality  using  blended finance* mechanisms and aggregation vehicles* to reach critical mass for placement in the global private debt and equity markets;\n- make the most of  digital: throughout  the  process  of  analysis, 3. the  Group  focuses  on  using  digital  technologies  to  combine services, create more value, as well as to collect and analyse data on operational performance, payment track records and impacts to demonstrate the project's potential and support its scale up.\n\nThe  Impact-based  finance  approach  acts  as  a  catalyst  to  pool  all Societe  Generale's  know-how  to  deliver  the  best  financing  solutions for  corporate  customers  and  offer  suitable  sustainable  investment opportunities.  Societe  Generale  is  a  founder  member  of  the  Global Impact  Platform*  which  lists  impact-driven  funds  to  facilitate institutional investors seeking to source impact investment opportunities.  This  approach  is  supplemented  by  the  Social  Impact Solutions  offer.  This  offer  engineers  solutions  to  unlock  public  and private  funding  for  social  projects  developed  by  customers  as  they make the transition towards sustainability and work towards the SDGs. In  this  type  of  project,  where  social  impacts  and  business  interest mingle,  corporates  typically  join  forces  with  non-governmental organisations, but also with public-sector institutions. The dedicated Social  Impact  Solutions  team  assists  and  advises  customers  on  the design of social projects that align private-,  public-  and  social-sector interests,  and  offers  tailor-made,  innovative  financing  mechanisms driven by results-based principles. The financial instruments employed typically use blended finance*, social impact bonds* and other hybrid tools to arrange  financing  that  involves  development  finance institutions, impact investors and foundations motivated by the strong and demonstrated social impact of the project.\n\n|",

Sustainability-linked derivatives* can be used to hedge sustainability-linked loans* and bonds*;\n- Sustainability-Screened  Collateral  and  Sustainability-Linked 2. Financing: the Group believes in the importance of supporting its institutional  clients  to  achieve  their  sustainability  aims.  It  does this  by  completing  ESG-rated  financing  transactions  whose features match its clients' agenda.\n\n## Sustainable and Positive Investment\n\nSocially responsible deposits are another element of our Sustainable and  Positive  Investment  offering  for  corporate  customers.  Societe Generale  matches  the  funds  collected  with  an  equivalent  amount  in short-term loans to corporates with high ESG ratings (according to an internal methodology), or for commodity finance transactions selected for their ESG qualities (evaluated internally). We offer a comprehensive range of products and services for our institutional customers to give access to a wide gamut of issuers - sovereign, supranational, agencies and large corporates - picking from solutions that stretch from vanilla to tailored. For example, the Group offers ESG-indexed products based on  internal  research  or  our  partner  network.  Moreover,  Societe Generale issues structured ESG Notes in the five main sustainable and positive investment formats:\n\n- positive Impact notes*: Societe Generale has created a range of 1. products to give customers the opportunity to invest in tailored products and promote positive impact financing. These products are  flexible  to  adapt  to  a  wide  range  of  investment  objectives (maturity,  capital  guarantee  at  term, /uni00A0 etc . ). The  Group  is committed to holding in its books an amount in Positive Impact Finance loans equivalent to 100% of the nominal amount of the Positive Impact notes in the green or social categories;\n- repackaging green or social bonds: Societe Generale can issue 2. bond-repacked  notes  whose  funding  source  is  the  yield  on  a third-party green bond;\n- green, social or sustainable notes issued by a third party: The 3. issuer earmarks the note's proceeds for green or social projects, or is a recognised pure player which exclusively funds such projects;\n- charity  notes: The  issuer  undertakes  to  sponsor  a  charitable 4. organisation for a proportion of the amount raised on the notes;\n- positive  contribution  notes: The  investor  contributes  by 5. investing in positive-impact initiatives, such as agro-forestry and CO2 emission reduction, through the voluntary carbon market.\n\n## Equity research\n\nLastly, as of 2020, Equity  research  (part  of  Global  Markets) systematically  builds  in  ESG  analysis  as  part  of  the  overall  financial analysis.  ESG  Research  was  established  in  2006  and  has  consistently featured  in  the  Institutional  Investor  Research  survey  Top  10  in  the past ten years, as well as receiving the ESG Research of the Year - 2021 award from Environmental Finance magazine.\n\n## ENABLING SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED 5.3.1.1.2 ENTERPRISES, PROFESSIONAL AND INDIVIDUAL CLIENTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO POSITIVE TRANSFORMATION IN SOCIETY\n\nConscious of its role in supporting the economy, Societe Generale has made VSEs and SMEs one of its priorities in France and abroad. They are offered  dedicated  guidance:  see  Supporting  business  and entrepreneurs, page 300.\n\nThe Group is actively marketing the responsible products offered by its various countries of operation to its individual customers , in keeping with their wishes. In France, for example, Societe Generale is enabling individual customers to access government-subsidised loans (Eco-PTZ+*) or to channel their savings into savings passbooks with a strong environmental and social dimension (Livret A*, LDDS* and PEA PME/ETI*). In addition to these regulated products, Societe Generale has  entered  into  agreements  with  several  asset  managers  to  offer  a range  of  responsible  savings  products.  Alongside  Amundi,  new partnerships  have  been  established  with  BlackRock,  DNCA,  La Financi\u00e8re de l'\u00c9chiquier, Lyxor, Mirova and  Primonial  REIM. Accordingly,  the  Group  offers  a  range  of  20  SRI  or  environmentally geared  funds.  The  first  category  allows  customers  to  invest  in companies  that  comply  with  environmental,  social  and  governance criteria in their management,  while  the  second  focuses  on considerations  like  combating  climate  change,  the  environmental transition, developing renewable energies and reducing pollution.\n\nSociete Generale Assurances provides a range of protection policies that  encourage  responsible  behaviour  by  policyholders  (in  terms  of mobility,  health, /uni00A0 etc . ).  Accordingly,  the  networks  distribute  suitable products,  such  as  lower  insurance  rates  for  owners  of  low-emission vehicles,  and  offer  a  free  weather  alert  service  for  holders  of  a multi-risk home, car or life accident insurance policy alerting them to the weather events in their area. With the entry into force of the '100% Sant\u00e9'  health  reform  programme  in  2020,  they  also  distribute 'responsible'  health  insurance  policies  with  more  modular  cover  to adjust  guarantees  in  line  with  the  customer's  requirements  and budget.  Lastly,  the  heath  crisis  triggered  exceptional  measures  to protect customers: rates were not increased in 2020, and all recovery processes  and  contract  terminations  due  to  outstanding  payments were suspended during the protected period (March to September/uni00A02020),  allowing  customers  to  continue  to  enjoy  cover despite their financial difficulties.\n\n## Socially responsible investments\n\nAll the Group's asset management entities have signed the Principles of  Responsible  Investment  (PRI)  developed  by  the  United  Nations (www.unpri.org) , committing  them  to  adhere  to  the  following  six principles: incorporation of ESG issues, active shareholders, transparent disclosures, promotion of the PRI, working together, and ESG  reporting.  The  UNPRI  are  the  most  important  international blueprint  for  responsible  investment.  They  aim  to  promote  the incorporation  of  ESG  factors  in  investment  decisions  and  by  the companies  invested  in.  This  signature  marks  a  major  step  forward towards  more  responsible  management  and  positive  impact  private banking.  It  demonstrates  Societe  Generale's  commitment  to  socially responsible investment (SRI*) and to supporting our private customers on the path to a more sustainable future.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In accordance  with  the  Pacte  law,  all  Societe  Generale  Assurances' French  contracts  offered  at  least  one  vehicle  backed  by  a  solidarity fund:  either  an  SRI*  or  a  Greenfin*  (energy  and  environmental transition  financing)  certified  fund  since  the  end  of  2019.  These  are supplemented  on  a  regular  basis  and  cover  a  wide  range  of  asset classes and risk profiles. They offer an ideal opportunity for customers to  imbue  their  savings  with  meaning:  at  the  end  of  2021,  more  than 1,000 responsible financial products  (labelled or with similar characteristics) were listed , for a total amount outstanding of almost EUR/uni00A013  billion.  In  2021,  Societe  Generale  Assurances  launched  a  new generation of socially responsible savings (dubbed \"new generation\") for  its  policyholders,  made up exclusively of funds with a strong ESG dimension  (18  of  the  20  funds  offered  have  an  ISR  or  Greenfin certification).\n\nIn  addition  to  its  range  of  unit-linked  supports,  Societe  Generale Assurances looks to the long term. As such, it has significant leverage when  it  comes  to  benefiting  the  environment  and  civil  society.  Its investment  policy  has  long  included  ESG  factors,  alongside  financial and credit ratings. Every year, asset portfolios are formally scrutinised according to these three criteria, their carbon footprint measurement, and  their  alignment  with  a  global  warming  trajectory  that  is  well below/uni00A02\u00b0C.\n\nPrivate  Banking continued  to  develop  its  range  of  positive  and sustainable investments, initiated in 2017 and available across all its entities  in  France,  Europe  and  the  United  Kingdom.  It  is  structured around three areas:\n\n- responsible portfolio  management through  its  two  management p companies (SG29 Haussmann for French customers and SGPWM in Luxembourg for European customers), which offer CIUs* that have been  awarded  well-known  certifications:  the  French  government's SRI*  label  and  Luxembourg's  LuxFLAG*  label.  The  discretionary portfolio  management  solution  launched  recently  through  SG29 Haussmann  with  renowned  third-party  management  companies (BlackRock,  DNCA,  La  Financi\u00e8re  de  l'Echiquier,  Mirova,  Primonial REIM and Lyxor) also expand this certified offering. Moreover, Private Banking was recently distinguished in France with the launch of the first  discretionary  management  solution  to  receive  the  French government's SRI* label. At end-2021, the funds managed by these two management companies and rewarded with a government label amounted  to  45%  in  Luxembourg  and  85%  in  France  of  total outstandings for said two companies;\n- the positive and sustainable structured product range with ESG p underlyings  (EUR/uni00A0100/uni00A0million in 2021)  or  participating  in  the following programmes: 1) positive-impact finance developed by the Group  and  to  which  Private  Banking  contributed  EUR/uni00A0220/uni00A0million this year, 2) the charity programme (with nearly EUR/uni00A0900/uni00A0million in nominal value, for nearly EUR/uni00A02.5/uni00A0million in donations in 2021), and 3) the 'Let's Plant Trees' programme (32,000 trees planted in 2021). Nearly  50%  of  the  structured  products  distributed  by  Private Banking  in  2021  formed  part  of  this  'positive  and  sustainable' category;\n- the  advisory  management  offering, which  now  incorporates  an p increasing  proportion  of  funds  or  securities  showing  strong extra-financial  performance.  Since  2020,  Private  Banking  has continued  to  apply  exclusions  to  the  suite  of  stocks  it  directly\n\nadvises  on:  those  taken  from  the  Environmental  &  Social  General Principles  defined  in  the  Group's  policy  (stocks  linked  to  thermal coal  or  controversial  weapons)  and  those  connected  to  the  most serious  ESG  controversies,  tobacco  activities,  or  having  the  lowest ESG ratings. Lastly, the expertise in open architecture fund selection continued to incorporate a growing share of labelled funds or funds associated with new regulatory categorisations.\n\nAt the same time, Cr\u00e9dit du Nord offers its private and high-net-worth customers  sustainable  investments  incorporating  ESG  characteristics across  various  asset  classes.  These  offers,  which  provide  clear  and legible information for investors, represent oustandings of EUR/uni00A018/uni00A0billion and 90% of all assets under custody at/uni00A031 December 2021.\n\n## MEASURING CUSTOMER GUIDANCE 5.3.1.1.3 IN SUSTAINABLE TRANSFORMATION\n\nTo monitor its positive impact and progress in guiding its customers, the  Group  developed  a  standard  several  years  ago  to  measure  the distribution  of  its  Sustainable  and  Positive  Impact  Finance  offer  SPIF*  (see  Glossary,  page/uni00A0658  and  Methodology  note,  page/uni00A0331) dedicated to  financing  the  economy  and  enterprises,  and  a  range  of Sustainable  and  Positive  Investments  -  SPI*  (see  Glossary,  page/uni00A0658 and Methodology note, p.337). Changes in the standard are presented in the Methodology note, page 331.\n\nSociete Generale has also been a key mover in the UNEP-FI's Positive Impact Initiative, which brings together 26 financial institutions from around the world with a view to closing the financing gap for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Positive Impact Manifesto was published at the end of 2015, and the Positive Impact Principles in early  2017.  The  manifesto  and  principles  define  Positive  Impact Finance as that which serves to deliver a positive contribution to one or  more  of  the  three  pillars  of  sustainable  development  (economic, environmental and social), once any potential negative impacts to any of  the  pillars  have  been  duly  identified  and  mitigated,  across  all sectors.\n\nWithin  the  Corporate  and  Investment  Bank,  a  methodology  has  been developed and aligned with the Model Framework: Financial Products for  Specified  Use  of  Proceeds  published  by  UNEP-FI  (available  here: https://www.unepfi.org/positive-impact/unep-fi-impact-analysis-tools/ model-frameworks/ ),  which  sets  out  the  major  steps  and  criteria  for identification,  assessment  and  monitoring  of  funding  in  support  of specific  Positive  Impact  projects  or  assets.  During  the  identification phase, transactions are pre-selected based on the business sector, the geographic location of projects or assets, and their ability to generate a material  positive  impact  on  various  impact  categories  ( e.g. improved energy  efficiency  and  circular  economy).  This  phase  is  useful  in pre-empting  the  significant  positive  impacts  triggered  by  eligible transactions. The assessment phase involves evaluating the materiality and demonstrability of the positive impacts generated by the projects or assets in the impact categories selected in the UNEP-FI Impact Radar (https://www.unepfi.org/positive-impact/impact-radar-mappings/) . To this  end,  the  team  of  E&S  experts  has  developed  a  series  of performance indicators and analysis tools to measure positive impacts while  ensuring  the  acceptable  identification  and  management  of  any negative  impacts  in  the  three  areas  of  sustainable  development.  The methodology  for  analysing  Positive  Impact  Finance  is  updated regularly to factor in market developments and changes in standards, such as the EU taxonomy.\n\n|",

Accordingly, the  Group  undertakes  to  align  its  portfolios  and  proprietary activities  with  trajectories  aiming  at  carbon  neutrality  by  2050 (limiting  global  warming  to  1.5\u00b0C),  setting  itself  targets  for  2030  (or sooner)  and  2050.  It  focuses  as  a  priority  on  its  most  GHG-intensive sectors,  which  will  have  a  major  impact  in  transitioning  towards net-zero.  The  Group  has  extended  its  efforts  beyond  fossil  fuel reduction and the decarbonation of the shipping industry, which it has been  working  towards  in  recent  years,  to  include  the  steel  sector in/uni00A02021.\n\nIn  2015,  Dutch  financial  institutions  launched the  PCAF  initiative to develop a standard for measuring and reporting the greenhouse gas emissions  generated  by  their  credit  portfolios  and  investments.  This initiative was extended to North America in 2018 and taken up globally in  2019.  The  PCAF  standard  provides  methodological  guidance  for different asset classes. A company's emissions are assessed based on public disclosures or estimated according to the GHG Protocol. They are  then  allocated  to  the  financial  institutions  based  on  the proportional  share  of  lending  or  investment  in  the  borrower  or investee (for more information, see the PCAF Standard -https://carbonaccountingfinancials.com/files/downloads/PCAF-GlobalGHG-Standard.pdf ).  In  2021,  the  Group  used  this  methodology  to measure the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  of  95%  of  its  loans  to  major companies.  The  calculations  are  currently  based  on  monetary emission factors in the PCAF database, but Societe Generale aims to enhance the data's accuracy and granularity in the next few years.\n\nIn  2016,  the  Group  developed  an  initial  methodology  and  set\n\nalignment targets for  the  coal  sector  (see  below).  Following  on  from this first step,  in  2018  Societe  Generale  signed  the  Katowice Commitment (see https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/ documents/Document%20RSE/the\\_katowice\\_commitment.pdf ) alongside four other international banks (BBVA, BNP Paribas, ING and Standard Chartered). These signatory banks have been working with the  2\u00b0C  Investing  Initiative  (2DII)  since  2018  on  adapting  the  PACTA (Paris Agreement  Capital  Transition  Assessment)  methodology, initially  developed  for  equity  and  bond  portfolios,  for  use  on  credit portfolios.  This  led  to  the  publication  of  a  first  report  on  the application of this methodology in September/uni00A02020 (https://2degrees-investing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Katowice -Banks-2020-Credit-Portfolio-Alignment.pdf) .\n\n## Aligning credit portfolios in various sectors\n\nT\"Rc\n\nIn 2016, Societe Generale set an example as one of the first banks to reduce  its  exposure  to  the  coal  sector  by  deciding  not  to  grant  any further financing for coal mining or coal-fired power plant projects.\n\nIn 2019, the Group stepped its commitments up a level, announcing a goal  of  zero  exposure  to  thermal  coal  by  2030  in  the  EU  and  OECD countries,  and  by  2040  for  the  rest  of  the  world.  To  achieve  this, Societe  Generale  published  a  new  sector  policy  for  thermal  coal  in July/uni00A02020.  This  policy  sets  out  strict  guidelines  on  how  to  support customers in the transition phase.\n\nThis policy comprises two stages:\n\n- first,  the  Group  has  disengaged  from  those  companies  most 1. exposed  to  the  sector  ( i.e. for  which  thermal  coal  accounts  for more than 25% of revenue), unless they have themselves already committed  to  withdrawing  from  the  sector.  Accordingly,  it  has tightened its criteria for prospects in the sector;\n- in  2021,  Societe  Generale  reviewed  its  total  portfolio  and 2. discussed transition plans and a timeline for phasing out thermal coal  with  all  of  its  corporate  client  that  have  mining  or  power generation assets.\n\n## \"glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>c Reglyph<c=23,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> glyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>Ri\n\nIn 2018, Societe Generale decided to end financing for the production of  oil  from  oil  sands  around  the  world,  as  well  as  for  all  types  of  oil production in the Arctic.\n\nThe Group embarked on a new stage in its climate strategy in 2020, announcing the commitment to reduce its exposure to the oil and gas extraction sector worldwide by at least 10% between 2020 and 2025. Societe Generale is one of the first banks in the world to publicly set itself  a  concrete,  near-term  target  in  this  sector.  Moreover,  this commitment  reflects  the  Group's  gradual  transition  to  carbon neutrality  by  2050,  since  it  goes  further  than  required  under  the International  Energy  Agency's  Sustainable  Development  Scenario (SDS). To achieve its goal, the Group will no longer finance onshore oil and gas extraction in the US.\n\nLastly,  at  COP26  in  2021,  Societe  Generale  announced  that  it  was strengthening  its  commitments  in  several  segments  related  to unconventional  hydrocarbons  and  the  protection  of  biodiversity  in protected areas. As such, the Group will no longer finance:\n\n- new projects with underlying activities involving the exploration and p production  of  shale  oil  and  gas,  oil  sands,  extra-heavy  crude  oil, Arctic oil or Ecuadorian Amazon oil;\n- pure upstream players for which these categories of hydrocarbons p (shale  oil  and  gas,  oil  sands,  extra-heavy  crude  oil,  Arctic  oil  or Ecuadorian  Amazon  oil)  represent  more  than  30%  of  their  overall production; and\n- diversified  players  (upstream,  midstream,  downstream)  for  which p the production of these categories of hydrocarbons represent more than 30% of their revenues.\n\nMoreover,  no  new  mandates  will  be  accepted  for  new  greenfield projects to produce liquefied natural gas in North America, in order to extend efforts down the value chain. Lastly, the Group undertakes to increase its protection of biodiversity by expanding the categories of protected  areas  in  which  no  new  hydrocarbon  exploration  and production projects will be financed.\n\nThese  commitments  are  set  out  in  the  Oil  and  Gas  Policy  revised  in 2022,/uni00A0available on the Group's corporate website: https://www.societege nerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/CSR/Oil-Gas-sector-policy.pdf.\n\n## f\"*glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>h glyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>eglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>hR'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"e\n\nIn 2020, the Group also committed to cutting back on its financing for power generation  projects  by  18%  by  2025,  and  by  76%  by  2040,  as compared to end-2019 levels. This 2025 target goes further than the SDS requirements set by the International Energy Agency for the same period. The Group will achieve its goal by adjusting the energy mix it finances, reflecting both its decision to gradually exit the coal sector and its leading position in renewable energies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The working group aims to establish a joint climate-aligned finance agreement modelled after the Poseidon Principles.

Accordingly,  the  Group  markets  initiatives  that  address environmental priorities:\n\n- structured  products  linked  to  equity  indices that  incorporate p environmental filters such as CO2 emission levels to redirect capital flows towards companies that are leaders in this area. Indices used include  the  Solactive  Environmental  Footprint  index  and  Societe Generale's own Climate Risk Control index;\n\n- linear  products  linked  to  equity  baskets that  incorporate p environmental filters such as CO2 emission levels to redirect capital flows towards companies that are leaders in this area;\n- positive impact notes that allow customers to invest in a structured p note while promoting positive impact finance. Some of the positive impact  loans  financed  by  Societe  Generale  contribute  to  reducing global warming. For more information, see https://www.societegene rale.com/sites/default/files/documents/2021-06/SG-SPIF-Reporting-as -of-2020-12-31.pdf ;\n- structured notes that allow investors to contribute to reforestation p projects to improve carbon sequestration.\n\n## EMBLEMATIC EXAMPLES OF THE GROUP'S COMMITMENT TO THE ENERGY TRANSITION IN 2021\n\nSociete Generale acted as sole financial advisor in the creation and structuring of the Hy24 Fund, the world's largest investment platform dedicated to low-carbon hydrogen infrastructure. The fund, which aims to accelerate growth of the hydrogen ecosystem by investing in large strategic projects and leveraging the alliance of industrial and financial players, has already secured initial commitments of EUR/uni00A0800/uni00A0million out of the EUR/uni00A01.5/uni00A0billion total target. With this significant investment potential and a strong industrial expertise at its heart, the fund will have a unique capacity to accelerate the scaling up of hydrogen markets. With the announced support of public policies and some use of debt financing, the fund should be able to participate in the development of hydrogen projects with a total value of about EUR/uni00A015/uni00A0billion. This landmark transaction in the hydrogen sector demonstrates the Group's commitment to leveraging its expertise in innovative financing and energy advisory to help create tomorrow's low-carbon hydrogen solutions.\n\nAs an important player in the credit market for local and multinational companies, BRD* (a Societe Generale subsidiary in Romania) granted Hidroelectrica  (the  largest  producer  of  green  energy  in  Romania)  approximatively  EUR/uni00A0250/uni00A0million  -  the  largest  green  loan  granted  to  the country to date. The credit facility, granted for a period of seven years, will finance the realisation of direct investments in operational projects based on wind and solar energy production.\n\nIn 2021, Komer\u010dn\u00ed banka* - the Group's subsidiary in the Czech Republic - established a partnership with \u010cEZ, the largest energy producer in the country.  \u010cEZ  and  KB  began  working  together  on  rooftop  solar  panel  installations  for  households,  municipalities  and  companies.  \u010cEZ Prodej (household installations) will provide one solar panel free of charge to KB's clients for whom it will install a rooftop photovoltaic power plant. \u010cEZ ESCO, in partnership with KB and SGEF*, will enable municipalities, businesses and larger consumers to install solar panels on their roofs at no initial investment cost.\n\n\u010cEZ is also collaborating with KB on other products and in areas related to decarbonation and emission reduction. \u010cEZ ESCO has already installed 12 wall-mounted charging stations for electric vehicles in KB branches. More are currently being negotiated.\n\nSociete Generale Real Estate Finance (SGFI), the French Retail Banking entity specialised in financing business property, signed its first loan linked to CSR performance with its long-standing client FM Logistic - a global leader in logistics. This allowed the Company to launch the major  refinancing  of  six  French  logistics  platforms  in  the  summer  of  2020,  for  a  total  amount  of  EUR/uni00A0222/uni00A0million.  As  it  is  linked  to  CSR performance, this loan enables the Company to enjoy better financial terms. The loan is based on three E&S performance indicators: energy performance,  reduced  Greenhouse  Gas  (GHG)  emissions,  and  maintaining  its  leading  industry  position  in  terms  of  extra-financial performance.  The  interest  rate  is  indexed  to  the  achievement  of  these  three  indicators.  Every  year,  upon  monitoring  the  performance indicators,  the  customer's  margin  will  be  increased  or  decreased  depending  on  the  results  and  thresholds  set  out  in  the  agreement.  FM Logistic Group is one of the first logistics businesses indexing its financing costs to environmental and social goals.\n\nMAIF Solutions Financi\u00e8res, the asset management subsidiary of the insurance group MAIF, offers structured notes with ESG underlyings that include a contribution to a greenhouse gas emission reduction project in sub-Saharan Africa - a Societe Generale innovation.\n\n## Contributing to local communities 5.3.1.3\n\nOver and above its commitments to fighting climate change, the Group is  eager to make a positive impact on local communities as a way of helping customers to achieve their own transformation and innovation goals.  It  does  so  through  efforts  to support  entrepreneurship, develop  sustainable  cities,  and  contribute  to  the  scaling  up  of low-carbon mobility.\n\nThe  Group  contributes  to  social  innovations  that  are  shaping  the communities  of  the  future,  with  a  special  focus  on  the  African continent. The Grow with Africa programme launched in November/uni00A02018  illustrates  and  sets  out  a  framework  for  Societe Generale's  ambition  to  become a  leading  player  on  the  continent, focused on promoting sustainable economic development in Africa and accelerating positive change. Based on its local knowledge in its areas  of  operation,  Societe  Generale  continued  its  work  in  the  four priority areas identified for its Grow with Africa programme in 2021, all of  which  represent  drivers  of  sustainable  growth:  multi-dimensional support  for  African  SMEs,  infrastructure  financing  (including  the on-grid  energy  sector),  innovative  financing  solutions  for  the  off-grid energy and agricultural sectors, and financial inclusion.

It therefore aims to  become  the leading  partner  bank chosen  for  the  quality  and commitment of its  teams  and  its  offering.  To  guarantee  a  long-term partnership,  the  Group  has  established  a  dedicated  organisation relying  on  more  than  31  regional  business  centres,  a  longer  term  of office  for  Business  Advisors,  and  more  than  300  Customer  Relations Advisors.  Moreover,  Societe  Generale  is  guided  by  more  than  190 experts to meet specific requirements in terms of cash and cash flow, payroll,  employee  savings  schemes,  factoring,  international  business and investments, and provides its customers with regional Corporate and  Investment  Banking  hubs.  In  this  respect,  Societe  Generale devotes more than EUR/uni00A020/uni00A0billion every year to financing the economy.\n\nIn  addition,  through  its 'Societe  Generale  Entrepreneurs'  sales strategy, the  French  Retail  Banking  network  provides  corporate executives  and  shareholders  with  a  range  of  services  and  solutions geared to addressing strategic issues.

The offer combines a fully online bank account with  support  in  administrative  management  for  entrepreneurs (billing, calculation of taxes and contributions, simplified accounting, /uni00A0 etc . ) .  Shine  has  received  the  international  Certified  B Corp. label, which recognises its commitment  in  six  areas: environmental  performance,  social  performance,  staff,  governance, community  and  customers.  The  Group  markets  Shine  products  to professional  customers  that  prefer  100%  online  management  and low-cost services. The Shine acquisition positions the Bank to offer a broader  range  to  business  customers  as  their  business  and  needs change, including expert advisors - without changing banks. As well as their complementarity, the tie-up between Societe Generale and Shine is  generating  broad  synergies  across  the  Group.  Services,  such  as credit, insurance, and payments, can be offered to neobank clients, in accordance  with  Shine's  mission  to  simplify  banking  for  business. Against  this  backdrop,  in  2021,  Shine  developed  a  range  of  loans designed specifically for self-employed individuals and small businesses. This unprecedented offering has two goals: continuing to simplify entrepreneurs' daily activities through easier access to loans, and promoting a responsible vision of entrepreneurship by supporting businesses  committed  to  an  entrepreneurial  approach.  For  the  first time,  this  fully  online  offering  allows  self-employed  individuals  and small businesses committed to improving society and protecting the environment to enjoy a special rate based on a list of predetermined social  and  environmental  criteria,  such  as  conducting  a  carbon assessment,  organising  training  for  greater  diversity  and  inclusion, setting up a responsible sourcing policy, and qualifying for labels like B Corp, Lucie or ISO/uni00A026000. Entrepreneurs meeting some of these criteria will benefit from preferential terms. This approach aims to reward the most  committed  businesses  and  to  motivate  others  to  undertake  a similar commitment.\n\n## S\"\"&'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>eglyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> S(&glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>eglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>&& T%glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>R'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"e\n\nThe  French  Retail  Banking  network  is  also  a  partner  to  84  local branches of  the  nationwide  non-profit  organisation  Initiative  France. These 84 branches were behind the creation or takeover of a total of 7,034 companies in 2020, thus creating or saving 18,239 direct jobs. In addition  to  Initiative  France's  own  interest-free  loans,  Societe Generale  Retail  Banking  in  France  granted  370  loans  for  a  total  of EUR/uni00A032.3/uni00A0million to  entrepreneurs  supported  by  the  association (figures  disclosed  by  Initiative  France).  In  partnership  with  France Active Garantie, the leading solidarity finance provider, the Group has been  working  to  help  VSEs  and  solidarity-based  companies  secure bank  loans.  As  part  of  this  partnership,  Societe  Generale  funded projects  to  the  tune  of  EUR/uni00A02.5/uni00A0million as  at  end-October/uni00A02021 ( vs./uni00A0 EUR/uni00A03.7/uni00A0million in 2020).\n\nMoreover,  Societe  Generale  Factoring  offers  reverse  factoring  to mid-caps  and  large  corporations.  Reverse  factoring  (also  known  as supply chain finance) allows suppliers of large contractors to be paid faster  and  under  better  conditions  than  if  they  had  applied  for factoring directly. For large corporates, reverse factoring is one way of being responsible to its smaller suppliers.\n\n|",

Government-backed loans granted up to the summer of 2021 aimed to help businesses and professionals meet  their cash flow requirements  to  better  tackle  the financial  repercussions  of  the Covid-19  pandemic . These  funds  are  intended  to  help  maintain business and jobs in France. Since 2021 and until the summer of 2022, the  Group  also  distributes participating  loans  ( Pr\u00eat  Participatif Relance - PPR) intended to boost economic recovery, with a focus on companies  working  on  development  projects  and  needing  to strengthen  their  solvency.  These  loans  also  bolster  the  Company's financial  solidity  by  providing  long-term  financing  with  a  structure made  up  of  equity  and  debt  (thanks  to  its  4-year  minimum  grace period).  They  are  used  for  the  long-term  financing  of  investments (whether to strengthen and modernise the production tool or for R&D investment)  and  development  projects  (digital  or  energy  transition, commercial  development  in  France  or  abroad,  external  growth opportunities). This support  scheme  offers  an  alternative  for companies unable to access market instruments and preferring not to change their governance structure, at an attractive cost on account of the  government  backing.  Lastly,  the  Group  also  offers  its  customers access  to  recovery  bonds ( Obligations  Relance,  OR ) , another government-led  support  scheme.  The  recovery  bonds  aim  to strengthen the balance sheet of French companies and reinforce the financial  position  of  SMEs  and  mid-caps  to  simplify  their  access  to additional financing and help them to bounce back. The bonds have an 8-year term and are repaid in full at maturity.\n\nSociete  Generale  Assurances  has  protected  its  policyholders  and supported  the  French  economy  with  respect  to  the  health  crisis  by contributing  EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0billion  to  the  participating  loan  and  recovery  bond schemes, along with EUR/uni00A075/uni00A0million to the insurer investment programme in  favour of mid-caps, SMEs and the health and tourism sectors, and by taking  extra-contractual  and  solidarity  measures  to  support  the  most affected customers (healthcare professionals and staff).\n\n## iRglyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>(R%glyph<c=23,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>eglyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> Rglyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>Rglyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>ei' T,Sglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>% %glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>iglyph<c=30,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>i\n\nLastly,  given  that  our  customers'  security  is  a  key  priority,  Societe Generale launched a new start-up Oppens in 2020. Oppens advises particularly vulnerable VSEs and SMEs, and helps them to ramp up their  cybersecurity through  a  digital  platform.  Oppens  is  currently the  first  player  in  the  French  market  to  make  comprehensive  and tailored cybersecurity expertise available to this client segment. The start-up helps them to better understand the risks and to assess their vulnerability  through  a  simple,  personalised  process  built  on three/uni00A0steps:\n\n- assessing their level of cybersecurity via a free, online self-diagnosis p based  on  five  considerations:  password,  data  protection,  raising employee awareness, securing devices, and protecting websites;\n- free recommendations based on the priority areas identified during p the self-diagnosis;\n- support with a catalogue of mainly French and European products p and services,  selected  and  tested  by  Societe  Generale  experts  and distributed via Oppens.fr .

Societe Generale's  insurance  arm  contributes  to  funding  companies  and innovation by investing in French funds such as Nova, Novi, Novo and in fintech funds. These investments totalled EUR/uni00A01,009/uni00A0million in 2021, an increase of 41% compared with 2020.\n\n## Internationally\n\nSmall-  and  medium-sized  companies  are  at  the  heart  of  the development process for African economies. They account for 90% of private companies and hire 70% of the rural population. As such, they are essential in driving the emergence of the African middle class and greater access to jobs. SMEs represent two thirds of Societe Generale's African  corporate  customer  base.  The  Bank  is  deeply  attached  to adapting  its  processes  to  support  them  more  efficiently  and  thus better  contribute  to  their  success,  while  also  playing  a  part  in  the dynamic  local  economic  fabric.  This  ambition  was  reflected  in  the decision  to  increase  its  outstanding  loans  to  African  SMEs  by  60% between end-2018 and end-2022. The achievement of this target was impeded by the effects of the health and economic crisis in 2020 and 2021.  By  relying  on  several  revitalised  systems,  however,  Societe Generale  maintains  its  ambition  to  help  and  support  SMEs  with  a strong  growth  target  for  this  market  by  2025.  SMEs  are  already showing successful results, notably in West Africa, and this encourages the Group to continue its efforts.\n\nThis initiative is characterised by the unique concept of SME Centres, with the very first SME Centre opening its doors in 2018. SME Centres are now serving the needs of SMEs and VSEs in eight African countries: Senegal,  Burkina  Faso,  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  Benin,  Ghana,  Cameroon, Guinea-Conakry  and  Madagascar.  Societe  Generale  has  teamed  up with a number of local partners to set up these SME Centres, which are specifically  suited  to  the  needs  of  sub-Saharan  African  businesses, offering  financial,  legal  and  accounting  advice,  training,  mentoring programmes and a co-working space, all under one roof.\n\nAlongside various players supporting the development of SMEs, such as  AFD-Proparco,  Bpifrance,  Investisseurs  &  Partenaires,  the  R\u00e9seau Entreprendre  and  local  players  in  each  country,  Societe  Generale  is eager  to  launch  an  initiative  pooling  the  strengths  of  each  player  in support of the SMEs. Helping SMEs to organise their efforts to obtain funding, giving them access to comprehensive resources, covering all funding  channels  and  helping  them  to  get  training  to  expand  their business  are  all  challenges  of  the  multidimensional,  coordinated support provided by the players involved. Accordingly, the Group has already  set  up  several  partnerships,  such  as  AFD-Proparco  and  the ARIZ guarantee, with Societe Generale being the first to use the AFD risk-sharing mechanism on the continent; Bpifrance Universit\u00e9, which has posted online training sessions dedicated to business managers in C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire  and  Senegal;  Investisseurs  &  Partenaires;  ADEPME  in Senegal; the Upgrade Office in Senegal; and the R\u00e9seau Entreprendre (partnership in Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia).\n\nMoreover, professional customers can now identify themselves and log into  the  PRO  app  by  way  of  Face  ID  and  Touch  ID  biometric authentication. They can block, lock and unlock their Business cards directly from the app.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0billion  budget  is  funded  by  the  French  government  and  distributed  by  AFD/Proparco to support  African  micro-enterprises,  VSEs  and  SMEs  affected  by  the  health  crisis  and  meeting  eligibility  criteria.  Through  its  subsidiaries  in Africa,  Societe  Generale  is  the  leading  partner  in  this  initiative.  As  at  end-2021,  seven  Societe  Generale  subsidiaries  (Burkina,  Cameroon, Congo, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Senegal, Madagascar and Tunisia) distribute loans that are 80% guaranteed by AFD/Proparco as part of this budget, valid until the end of 2022.\n\nAllocated to Societe Generale Mozambique, the EUR/uni00A03/uni00A0million EURIZ portfolio guarantee should allow the Bank to support nearly 90 VSEs and SMEs, as well as 270 jobs in the next few years. Launched in May/uni00A02019 with the support of the European Union, the European Development Fund and the Organization of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS), the EURIZ guarantee aims to provide VSEs and SMEs with easier access to loans, especially in high-impact sectors in terms of economic growth and job creation. VSEs and SMEs owned by women and those operating in the agricultural sector will be targeted as a priority. By supporting women entrepreneurs, this project contributes to the Bank's achievement  of  the  fifth  sustainable  development  goal  (gender  equality)  and  the  2XChallenge,  an  initiative  launched  by  a  group  of development finance institutions to promote gender equality.\n\n## SUPPORTING BUSINESS AND ENTREPRENEURS: KEY FIGURES\n\n|                                                     | 2020             | 2021       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------|\n| Loan production for SMEs/mid-caps and professionals |                  |            |\n| o/w France                                          | EUR/uni00A04.5bn | EUR 4.7 bn |\n| o/w International                                   | EUR/uni00A04.2m  | EUR 443 m  |\n\n## SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE 5.3.1.3.2 AND MOBILITY\n\n## Sustainable cities and infrastructure\n\nToday, cities are required to meet several challenges: optimise urban development  and  infrastructure  projects  and  develop  an  inclusive, joined-up  urban  planning  approach  aligned  with  environmental  and social  issues.

It also relies on its regional foothold to guarantee the local integration of its building projects, thereby supporting the ambitions of  local  representatives  working  to  enhance  urban  areas.  Sogeprom focuses  on  five  key  indicators  that  are  at  once  ambitious  and achievable: reducing the carbon footprint of its programmes, factoring the  circular  economy  and  innovation  into  its  choice  of  materials, adopting a frugal water management strategy, respecting biodiversity and achieving the highest levels of certification.\n\nBy  pursuing  these  goals,  Sogeprom  works  to  develop  social  and affordable housing in the Greater Paris area and throughout France. It cares about building affordable housing for all - especially in pressure areas where homes are needed most - and about making a difference by promoting eco homes, contributing to positive changes in society and to social diversity. Sogeprom has ten regional divisions in France engaged in the study and building of new homes that meet the needs of  individuals  and  local  communities.  The  real-estate  specialist develops  mixed-use  urban  developments  and  upgrades  existing properties  using  sustainable  techniques  and  materials.  Accordingly, Sogeprom  measures  its  carbon  footprint  and  assesses  the  CO2 emissions  across  all  areas  of  its  own  and  its  subsidiaries'  business  office activities, project development, construction and operation and mobility  -  with  its  partner  Carbone/uni00A04.  Moreover,  a  'Low-Carbon Community' of some 60/uni00A0staff was launched in early 2020, divided into four  working  groups  representing  all  of  Sogeprom's  businesses  and Regional  Departments.  The  community  pools  intelligence  to  define and promote a set of ambitious and practical commitments in several key  areas  (purchasing,  impact  of  real  estate  projects,  travel, /uni00A0 etc . ). Lastly, Sogeprom  is  also  promoting  low-environmental  impact solutions. It is firmly committed to aiming higher than the regulatory standards  (RT  2012)  by  incorporating  some  criteria  included  in  the upcoming RE2020* regulation applicable in France at the end of 2021. It  aims  to  build  best-in-class  developments  with  the  top  green, energy-efficient  and  sustainable  technical  solutions  available.  All  its office  buildings  are  either  labelled  or  certified  since  2007.  The developer  is  also  taking  a  proactive  approach  and  integrating  the circular economy, biodiversity, virtuous resource management, use of renewable  energies  and  construction  methods  that  help  cut  CO2 emissions (dry construction techniques, bio-sourced materials, /uni00A0 etc . ) as much as possible in its projects, while also promoting the wellness and health of users.\n\n|",

Positive impact  financing  concerns  both  environmental  (frugal consumption habits, biosourced materials, respect for biodiversity, /uni00A0 etc . ) and  social  aspects  (non-profit  organisations, regional authorities, health, education, social and affordable housing, disabilities, /uni00A0 etc . ).  More  and  more  of  the  Group's  customers  have worked it into their social commitments. SGFI produced EUR/uni00A01.201/uni00A0billion  in  positive  impact  financing  in  2021,  representing 47%  of  its  annual  production.  Moreover,  the  real  estate  sector  is responsible for 38% of global greenhouse gas emissions (1) ; as such, it is one  of  the  main  sectors  that  should  adopt  an  ambitious  low-carbon transition strategy. Within this context and in keeping with the Group's commitment  to  align  its  portfolio  with  the  targets  of  the  Paris Agreement, SGFI has decided to manage its portfolio on the basis of 'energy'  (kWh/m 2 ) and  'carbon'  (kgCO2/m 2 ). These  are  two  key components in asset valuation, as included in the Energy Performance Diagnosis (DPE), which will henceforth be collected from customers for each  building  financed.  Over  and  above  its  importance  in  valuing  a property  asset,  the  DPE  rating  will  now  enable  SGFI  to  assess  the carbon footprint of the current portfolio and to define the sales policy to be adopted to gradually align this portfolio with a view to achieving carbon neutrality in 2050. Lastly, to be most effective as a responsible bank,  SGFI  has  included  CSR  considerations  into  its  due  diligence processes for customers and transactions, and carries out awareness-raising  and  training  initiatives  for  the  benefit  of  its employees. It also ensures that the CSR dimension is incorporated into its  sales  approach  -  from  customer  canvassing  through  to  follow-up appointments - making it a differentiating commercial advantage.\n\nLaVilleE+ *  is  Societe  Generale's  urban  strategic  consulting  firm, created  four  years  ago  as  a  start-up  through  an  intrapreneurship programme.  Committed  to  building  sustainable  cities,  this  start-up supports  regional  development  projects  in  France  and  Africa  every day, with a view to helping local representatives to address the three following questions:\n\n- How do  you  build  a  regional  development  project  with  a  holistic, p overarching  approach  (rather  than  a  siloed  one)  based  on  impact (rather than solutions)?\n- How  do  you  make  this  regional  development  project  inclusive, p robust and efficient, working together with stakeholders?\n- How do you eliminate the risk of controversy, opposition or appeal p proceedings in response to a regional development project?\n\nThe team at LaVilleE+ has developed methods and tools to help local communities  and  their  representatives  to  address  these  three challenges.\n\nThe method is based on the organisation of collaborative workshops approached  as  'serious  games',  which  aim  to  leverage  collective intelligence through panels (non-mixed) on subjects selected beforehand  with  the  project  governance  (mayors  and  their  close advisors in most cases), along with the various stakeholders affected and involved (representatives, services, citizens, merchants, associations, and more).\n\nThe  relevant  tools  are  intended  to  assess  the  impact  (economic, environmental,  social, /uni00A0 etc . )  of  the  solutions  developed  through  this joint  process  and  to  develop  a  clear,  robust  roadmap  with  tangible targets firmly rooted in the region.\n\nFor  its  part, Societe  Generale  Assurances also  contributes  to  local communities and infrastructure development in France and in Europe. When  making  property  investments,  the  Group  looks  for  highly energy-efficient  assets  and  the  most  respected  certifications  (for construction,  renovation  and  operating  efficiency).  The  Group's environmentally  certified  property  assets  were  valued  at  a  total  of EUR/uni00A03.4/uni00A0billion at  the  end  of  2021  ( vs. EUR/uni00A03.1/uni00A0billion at  the  end of/uni00A02020).\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2021\n\nTogether with LCL and Ark\u00e9a Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels, Societe Generale has granted a green loan of EUR/uni00A0100/uni00A0million to INEA, a real estate developer specialised in new office buildings and green building in the regions. This seven-year loan will finance or refinance office buildings meeting at least a performance level of RT2012 -15% ( i.e. energy use 15% lower than the RT2012 regulatory requirement) and whose energy use is also less than required by the \u00c9co-\u00e9nergie tertiaire (EET) French regulation on office buildings set for 2030 ( i.e. the obligation for building  landlords  and  occupiers  to  cut  energy  use  by  at  least  40%  by  2030  for  buildings  exceeding  1,000/uni00A0m 2 in  size).  Moreover,  INEA undertakes to reinvest a share of the potential savings secured by this approach into reforestation projects.\n\nSetting up training focused on the real estate sector: the Group's Real Estate Division contributes to developing its employees' CSR culture and  skills  by  way  of  training  sessions  that  analyse  the  major  environmental  and  social  challenges  of  the  real  estate  sector  (structural regulations, certifications, strategy, /uni00A0 etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Societe Generale also reiterated its determination to be a proactive player in developing sustainable real estate by joining the Observatoire de l'Immobilier Durable (OID, the French sustainable real estate observatory). OID is a renowned non-profit organisation that has become a key CSR player in the real estate sector. Through the Group's membership, the BDDF/IMM entities are able to converse with all market players through working groups on various subject areas (carbon, energy, biodiversity, /uni00A0 etc . ) and, accordingly, to make a greater contribution to the sustainable transformation of the real estate sector.\n\nIn 20201, the Group also furthered its commitment to help finance the Greater Paris project. Active in the real economy, the Societe Generale Group finances the Greater Paris project and contributes to its development through its subsidiaries - whether alongside public or private stakeholders. Its commitment is expressed in three major areas: the public economy - Societe Generale partners with local authorities in the Paris region and with social housing operators; real estate development and urban planning strategic advisory via Sogeprom, the Group is involved in mixed-use urban developments that create value for the Greater Paris region and meet the demand for dense, sustainable and desirable  cities;  specialised  financing  -  by  addressing  the  needs  of  small,  medium  and  large  companies  working  on  Greater  Paris infrastructure sites (construction and public works, civil engineering and more), and those of real estate firms (developers and landowners) working on this major transformative endeavour. At the end of 2021, 67% of the EUR/uni00A05.5/uni00A0billion committed by the Group by 2023 had already been contributed.\n\n## T\"!'%glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>S('glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>!glyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> '\" 'Yglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> glyph<c=23,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>)glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=31,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"# glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>!' \"glyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> &(&'Rglyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>!RSglyph<c=31,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>!glyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>%R&'%(T'(%glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>! glyph<c=23,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>)glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=31,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"#glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>!glyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> Rglyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>%glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>TR!

Based in  Algeria, Morocco and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, these platforms comprise some 50  experts.  They  aim  to  deploy  Societe  Generale's  expertise  in structured financing in the Group's countries of operation, as close as possible to its customers  and  their  projects. This set-up is complementary to what Societe Generale offers through its Investment\n\nBanking teams in Europe. It allowed the Group to increase its financial commitments  related  to  structured  finance  in  Africa,  including infrastructure financing by 20% between 2018 and 2021. At end-2021, structured  finance  commitments  totalled  EUR/uni00A012.1  billion  ( vs. EUR/uni00A07 billion  at  end-2018),  enabling  the  Group  to  achieve  its  target.  Societe Generale  is  the  leading  French  bank  financing  infrastructure  in  Africa over  the  last  five  years.  The  infrastructure  in  question  covers  several sectors,  in  particular  energy,  transport,  telecommunications,  the environment, and healthcare.\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS AND MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2021\n\nIn  Benin,  Societe  Generale  acted  as  Joint  Sustainability  Structuring  Advisor  and  Joint  Bookrunner  on  an  innovative  EUR/uni00A0500/uni00A0million transaction: the first ever sustainable bond issue out of Africa and one of the first in the world. The country opted for bonds dedicated to financing projects with a strong impact on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to support the reforms and investments necessary to ensure that the population has suitable work conditions, an adequate healthcare system, the food and clean water they need, but also access to clean energy.\n\nIn  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  thanks  to  EUR/uni00A0177/uni00A0million  and  FCFA/uni00A023/uni00A0billion  loan  facilities  (about  EUR/uni00A035/uni00A0million),  the  Ministry  of  Equipment  and  Road Maintenance  will  finance  the  rehabilitation  of  the  Eastern  Corridor  road  as  well  as  the  construction  of  four  new  bridges  to  enhance commercial  trade  and  the  Ivorian  population's  mobility.  The  construction  work  will  be  completed  by  2024.  This  financing  obtained  the Positive Impact Finance label.\n\nSociete Generale also arranged a EUR/uni00A0443/uni00A0million syndicated loan for C\u00f4te d'Ivoire to finance roadworks and water treatment projects. The purpose of this financing is aligned with the National Development Plan of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, which aims in particular to improve the population's quality of life through the development of social infrastructure and basic facilities.\n\nIn Rwanda, Bugesera International Airport is expected to start handling 1.7/uni00A0million passengers a year to reach 3/uni00A0million passengers by 2030. The new airport will serve as a world-class gateway to Rwanda, with the potential to become a key hub for airlines operating to and from the regional airports of Rwanda and other neighbouring East African nations. The national airline, RwandAir, has already planned to open new routes, including the United States of America, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Angola. This extensive project should allow Rwanda to enjoy a rebound in tourism and business travel. Societe Generale acted as fronting and issuing bank of an advance payment bond, and the Group also acted as participating bank to the issuance of a performance bond.\n\nIn Burkina Faso, the Group was mandated Arranger and Lead Bookrunner by the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Development, acting as lender and agent for the financing and construction of a Regional University Hospital in Gaoua (south-east of the country) and the addition of 300 beds for EUR 83 million.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable mobility\n\nSociete Generale subsidiary ALD Automotive* is a European leader in long-term vehicle lease solutions, with sustainable mobility being the linchpin  of  its  strategy.  It  furthers  this  goal  through  the  vehicle technology  offered  to  its  customers  and  the  responsible  use  of  said vehicles. ALD's commitments are recognised by the main extra-financial ratings agencies (top 3 in the Business Support Services sector as per Vigeo Eiris, top 3 Sustainalytics, top 5 Ecovadis). These extra-financial  assessments  recognise  ALD's  capacity  to  successfully build  environmental,  social  and  governance  criteria  into  its  strategy and the day-to-day conduct of its business. ALD has also committed to the Science-Based Targets initiative for the validation of its direct and indirect emissions trajectory.\n\nOn the strength of its positioning as facilitator/leader, ALD has a major role  to  play  in  supporting  its  customers  to  reduce  mobility-related emissions by offering a suitable and competitive product and service. ALD  is  making  a  strong  contribution  to  the  energy  transition  by supporting customers with an approach guided by TCO (total cost of ownership), an all-in-one solution for electric vehicles including access to  smart  charging  infrastructure  (ALD  Electric  offer  available  in  more than  20  European  countries),  targeted  partnerships,  and  a  global programme dedicated to electric vehicles.\n\nAs part of its 2025 plan, ALD has set itself specific targets: the share of electric vehicles (1) in new vehicle deliveries is set to rise to 30% by 2025. And by 2030, ALD's target is for electric vehicles with battery to make up  around  50%  of  deliveries.  This  would  cut  CO2  emissions  per vehicle (2) for  new  contracts  by  at  least  40%  on  average  in  2025, compared  with  2019.  In  practice,  the  efforts  made  to  improve  the product offer, growing customer demand and a favourable regulatory environment position  ALD  ahead  of  the  market,  whether  in  terms  of electrification or CO2 emissions. The share of electric vehicles in new\n\nvehicle deliveries in 2021 was 27% at end-September ( vs. the  market average of 14%), already nearing the 2025 target. The continuation of this  momentum  and  the  conquest  of  new  growth  drivers,  such  as commercial  vehicles  (last-mile  delivery,  in  particular),  which  are essential  to  vehicle  leasing  companies,  will  make  ALD  one  of  the leading  electric  vehicle  operators  in  the  world  and  a  major  player  in the energy transition for new and second-hand vehicles. In the future, the operational vehicle leasing sector will be one of the only channels bringing  a  considerable  volume  of  recent  and  more  financially accessible  electric  vehicles  (compared  to  new  vehicles)  to  the second-hand market, thus benefiting society.\n\nSustainable  mobility  is  not  just  about  vehicle  technology,  it's  also about  transforming  how  we  use  transport.  It  requires  tailoring  our offering to new customer expectations. ALD is investing in new, shared mobility  solutions,  available  on  demand  or  multimodal.  Take  ALD Move, a mobility-as-a-service app: users can tap into daily advice on the best options for their travel needs (car, public transport, bike). ALD recently acquired share capital in Skipr, which will help accelerate the ramp-up of ALD's solutions in this area.\n\nALD  is  also  seeking  to  meet  its  customers'  requirements  in  terms  of flexibility.  As  such,  it  has  developed  ALD  Flex,  a  service  providing  a broad range of vehicle categories, from compact to light commercial, on demand. Users can select their vehicle by budget, transmission, fuel and  CO2  emissions  rating.  Fleetpool,  the  leading  German  car subscription company and ALD's most recent acquisition, will broaden ALD's capabilities in this new generation of flexible solutions.\n\nOver  and  above  its  leasing  and  fleet  management  activities,  Societe Generale  supports  sustainable  mobility  players  through  dedicated financing. Accordingly, the Group regularly helps its customers to set up  infrastructure  promoting  sustainable  mobility,  such  as  public transport solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## HIGHLIGHTS AND MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2021\n\nALD Automotive has been chosen as Tesla Group's preferred operational leasing partner in 16/uni00A0countries across Europe. Tesla's professional customers (large corporates and SMEs) opting for a long-term vehicle leasing solution are directed to ALD Automotive. They can now benefit from a long-term leasing package for passenger cars Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model/uni00A0X.\n\nSmart, the pioneer in urban mobility, has selected ALD Automotive, the leading vehicle leasing company in Europe, as its exclusive fully digital operational leasing services partner for its new generation of all-electric vehicles. Starting with Smart's new premium compact SUV from Q1 2023, corporates and private individuals will have access to a fully integrated digital leasing offering in Europe. ALD Automotive's full-service leasing packages will be available with flexible durations and mileage for the all-electric vehicles directly on Smart's website and via the smart local network.\n\nIn 2021, ALD Automotive developed a long-term leasing package for bicycles (ALD Bike) to transition to soft mobility. Based on a full catalogue (+200 models) ranging from urban to folding bikes, including cargo bikes, the ALD Bike solution includes the long-term leasing (36/uni00A0months) of the VAE e-bike and its accessories, its servicing and maintenance, theft/breakage insurance and assistance. The ALD Bike solution enables companies  to  further  develop  their  Employer  Mobility  Plan  by  offering  employees  a  'company  bike'  or  a  'soft  mobility'  alternative  for employees currently using a company car.\n\nIn  the  new  area  of  electromobility,  Societe  Generale  acted  as  financial  advisor  and  lender  alongside  the  Meridiam  infrastructure  fund  to finance the establishment of a network of fast and ultra-fast electric vehicle charge points across more than 200 Carrefour hypermarkets in France. The EUR/uni00A0124/uni00A0million financing, structured by Societe Generale as a green loan with contributions from seven European banks, is one of  the  very  first  special-purpose  project  finance  vehicles  to  develop  charging  infrastructure.  Carrefour  and  Meridiam  will  thus  offer  a  full electromobility solution, ranging from 22/uni00A0kW to 300/uni00A0kW,  to  address  various user requirements. This network of 2,000 charge points will be powered entirely by green energy. Carrefour's good regional coverage means this charging service will be one the most extensive networks in France, in additional to offering excellent quality, with 56% superchargers. This project is an example of a very practical contribution to the energy transition in France, in the service of regions and their inhabitants.\n\nRosbank*, the Group's subsidiary in Russia, worked with the City of Moscow to issue a green bond (for RUB 70/uni00A0billion, or EUR/uni00A0825/uni00A0million, with a maturity period of seven years). The funds will finance several projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions: creating a modern, environmentally friendly transport system; reducing the energy intensity of the Gross Regional Product; creating a full-service solid municipal waste  treatment  system, /uni00A0 etc . The  plans  for  2021-2023  include  the  purchase  of  approximately  1,675  electric  buses  and  the  building  of 18/uni00A0stations  and  43.8/uni00A0kilometres  of  lines,  as  well  as  the  reconstruction  of  three  stations  and  four  kilometres  of  underground  metro  lines. Rosbank acted as a co-arranger of this issue traded on the Moscow Exchange.\n\n## APPLYING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS IN CLIENT RELATIONSHIP 5.3.2 MANAGEMENT\n\n## Aiming for the highest level 5.3.2.1 of client satisfaction\n\nServing the economy for more than a hundred and fifty years, Societe Generale  supports/uni00A030  million (1) individual  customers,  businesses  and institutional (2) investors  worldwide  on  a  daily  basis.  At  a  time  when technology can be leveraged to personalise products, services and the customer  experience,  the  quality  of  the  customer  relationship  is  the most  important  differentiating  factor.  The  customer  relationship  is central to the Group's business model, and customer satisfaction and protection  objectives  are  integrated  into  its  CSR  policy.  Accordingly, continuous improvement in customer satisfaction, the Net Promoter Score \u00a9 and the customer experience are all factored into the variable remuneration  of  the  members  of  the  Management  Committee (61/uni00A0people (3) ).\n\nIn 2021,  Societe  Generale's  team  responsible  for  its  customer relationships on social networks was awarded Customer Service of the Year  by  Vis\u00e9o  Customer  Insights.  The  service  provided  was  audited over a period of six weeks by mystery customers who assessed their conversations on the basis of twenty criteria, including the form and quality of replies received, level of personalisation, tone and response time. The Group obtained the seventh best score for its social network services among more than 150 participants, all categories included.\n\n## Measuring client satisfaction\n\nIn order to measure and monitor client satisfaction and to identify the practical  actions  to  be  taken,  Societe  Generale  has  implemented various measurement processes to gain a full overview of the quality delivered and the quality perceived by customers. The Group uses the Net  Promoter  Score \u00a9 (NPS),  considered  an  indicator  of  customer satisfaction  and  loyalty  based  on  the  customer's  probability  of recommending the Bank, the product or the service used.\n\nEvery  year, Societe  Generale  and  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  Group jointly commission  a  competitive  satisfaction  survey  by  the  CSA*  research institute, the  results  of  which  are  taken  into  account  in  its improvement  initiatives.  This  survey  is  conducted  on  the  top  ten  or eleven banks (depending on the market) and includes an NPS. In 2021, 6,569  individuals,  5,113  professionals  and  3,202  corporates  were polled. For Societe Generale, the NPS has increased over the last five years for individuals (below the market average) while it continues to lag for professional customers. It improved among corporates amid a particularly strong market. For Cr\u00e9dit du Nord, the overall satisfaction score was stable in 2021 across the three client markets.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "Internationally ,  a  client  satisfaction  survey  (which  includes  an  NPS and  competitive  surveys)  is  conducted  every  year  by  Ipsos  on individual and corporate clients. This is rounded out at KB*, BRD* and Rosbank*  by  on-the-spot  surveys  conducted  among  individual customers  after  they  interact  with  the  Bank  to  measure  their satisfaction level. The Group adapted the schedule in each country to take account of the health situation.\n\nCorrespondingly, the NPS of the Group's banks in Central Europe and Russia  showed  positive  trends  in  2021  in  increasingly  competitive markets for both individual and professional clients. In Romania and the  Czech  Republic,  BRD  and  KB  showed  significant  progress  in  a context  of  accelerated  digital  transformation  while  Rosbank's  score remained  stable.  In  the  corporate  segment,  the  Group's  subsidiaries obtained  very  high  recommendations  and  confirmed  their  leading positions in their markets.\n\nIn Africa, the Group's banking network delivered volatile NPS scores, in line  with  the  market  in  general.  In  the  individual  client  segment,  the score was stable in North Africa, with more moderate recommendation levels in Morocco after a particularly strong year in 2020. Trends were more  mixed  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  where  the  Group's  subsidiaries scored  above  the  market  average.  In  the  corporate  segment,  North Africa  saw  an  increase  in  its  score  while  that  of  sub-Saharan  Africa displayed a negative trend.\n\nSociete  Generale  Assurances has  set  up  a  NPS  measurement procedure  for  its  main  French  and  international  markets.  Its  NPS increased in 2021 due in particular to a simplification of the customer\n\nexperience and the implementation of regular personalised communication at key life milestones.\n\nALD* has  implemented  a  global  NPS  measurement  mechanism  to determine  the  satisfaction  of  fleet  managers  and  drivers  across 41/uni00A0countries. Its NPS fell slightly in 2021 but still reflects a high level of customer satisfaction.\n\nSGEF* (Societe Generale Equipment Finance) focuses on a qualitative survey of the satisfaction of its main vendors. Its NPS rose in relation to 2019  (last  comparable  survey),  confirming  a  high  level  of  vendor recommendation.\n\nFor  its Global  Banking segment  (large  corporates  and  financial institutions),  Societe  Generale  carried  out  its  seventh  satisfaction survey (1) between  June  and  December/uni00A02021,  which  included  NPS measurement.  In  2021,  Societe  Generale  involved  members  of  the Group Management Committee in this process, by carrying out nearly 150  satisfaction  surveys  among  the  Bank's  largest  clients.  The  large corporates  and  financial  institutions  polled  again  gave  Societe Generale  high  scores,  highlighting  strong  relationship  management, the  quality  of  products  and  services  offered,  and  the  high  level  of balance  sheet  commitments  with  them.  They  also  emphasised  the value of the support provided by the Group during the health crisis and its positive impact on their level of satisfaction. Overall, the customers polled  represent  almost  71%  of  the  Group's  NBI  from  this  segment. Finally,  themed  surveys  were  conducted  among  key  accounts  to understand their expectations and better serve them in areas such as the intensification of digital relationships.\n\n## NUMBER OF SOCIETE GENERALE CLIENTS IN FRANCE POLLED ON THEIR SATISFACTION IN LOCAL SURVEYS AND ON-THE-SPOT FEEDBACK\n\n|                       | 2019                                   | 2020                                                | 2021                                           |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Individual clients    | 150,000 (2% of the Bank's client base) | 180,000 (greater than 2% of the Bank's client base) | 239,200 (approx. 3% of the Bank's client base) |\n| Professional  clients | 15,000                                 | 9,000                                               | 11,600                                         |\n| SMEs                  | 3,500                                  | 3,000                                               | 3,100                                          |\n\n## Protecting clients and their assets 5.3.2.2 in all circumstances\n\nThe  Group  pays special  attention  to  issues  relating  to  client protection , implementing strong employee training and awareness-raising  initiatives,  developing  tools  and  strengthening internal  rules  related  to  client  claim  processing,  including  on  social networks. The processing of a claim is a commercial act that impacts client  satisfaction.  As  such,  it  is  covered  in  the  Group's  Code  of Conduct.\n\nWhen an ongoing disagreement occurs with a client, Societe Generale offers  them  free  and  direct  access  to  the  Customer  Relations Department. This has been the case since 1996 ( i.e. before it became compulsory further to the French Act of 2001). The Customer Relations Department responds within two months, and refers any unresolved claims  to  the  ombudsman,  who  then  responds  within  90/uni00A0days.  A\n\nmediation team under the ombudsman's hierarchical and functional authority  works  for  nearly  all  Group  entities  in  France,  with  two dedicated websites - one dedicated to Societe Generale and the other to Cr\u00e9dit du Nord and its subsidiaries. Boursorama uses the mediation services of the French Banking Federation - FBF.\n\nMediation,  a  measure  aimed  at  amicable  settlement,  is  brought  to customers'  awareness  on  multiple  information  media,  in  particular through a permanent notice on the back of bank account statements. The  decisions  taken  by  the  ombudsman  independently  of  the  sales teams are binding on the entities concerned, which have undertaken in advance to comply with them.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  strengthened  its  client  data  protection  systems (see Chapter/uni00A04.11 Compliance  risk,  Data  protection  paragraph, page/uni00A0257).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Bank responds to requests to exercise rights, manages violations  of  personal  data  and  rolls  out  supplier  management procedures,  and  has  strengthened  personal  data  security  and  data erasure measures within the more general framework of the Group's security policy, and has created processing registers. In addition, the Group's normative documentation has been updated to reflect these changes.  Last,  the  Group  Data  Protection  Officer  (DPO)  function  was created in September/uni00A02017 and reports to the Compliance Division.\n\nFor  more  information  on  this  matter,  see  Chapter/uni00A04.11  Compliance Risk, Data Protection paragraph, page/uni00A0257.\n\nSociete  Generale  has  set  up  an  information  security  risk  management system coordinated by the Security Department. Working in conjunction with the teams of the Resources and Digital Transformation Division, it strives to continuously improve the Information Security Policy and its implementation.\n\nFor  more  information  on  cybersecurity  measures,  see  Chapter/uni00A04.7 Operational  risk,  Risks  related  to  information  security  paragraph, page/uni00A0238 and IT security master plan 2021-2023, page/uni00A0235.\n\n## THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION, 5.3.2.2.2 TAX EVASION AND MONEY LAUNDERING\n\nThis information is provided in Chapter/uni00A04.11 Compliance risk, The fight against corruption , page/uni00A0261, Anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF), page/uni00A0259 and Tax compliance, page/uni00A0260. Societe  Generale  published  a  report  on  its  2020  tax contribution  during  2021.  This  document  completes  the  Group's  Tax Code of Conduct and can be viewed on its website at https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/202107/Report-on-our-2020-tax-contribution.pdf.\n\n## A marketing policy that takes 5.3.2.3 the client's interests into account\n\nSociete  Generale  offers  banking  products  and  services  suited  to  the needs of its clients, in compliance with the European and French legal framework.\n\nThe  responsibility  of  Group  employees  with  regard  to  the  sale  of banking products and services to customers is covered in the Code of Conduct (see page/uni00A08: https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/ files/documents/Code%20de%20conduite/code\\_of\\_conduct\\_eng.pdf ). Stakeholders can view the Code of Conduct on the corporate website. It  is  based  on  the  four  core  values  that  drive  Societe  Generale  and which are shared by all its employees, namely team spirit, innovation, responsibility  and  commitment.  These  values  were  defined  out  of  a shared  objective  to  serve  clients  by  striving  to  reach  the  highest possible  standards  of  service  and  form  the  basis  of  our  employees' annual  evaluations.  They  are  also  incorporated  into  the  HR recruitment process.\n\nEvery  year,  a  Group-wide  extensive  training  programme  on  the  Code  is dispensed  to  employees  in  all  countries  in  which  Societe  Generale operates  (see  A  Code  of  Conduct  underpinned  by  shared  values, page/uni00A0275).  It  stresses  that  the  products  and  services  offered  to  clients must suit their situation and needs to best anticipate their projects and expectations. Societe Generale enters into contracts only with corporate clients  whose  practices  comply  with  the  Group's  Environmental  and Social General Principles (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/ files/documents/2021-03/Environmental-and-Social-General-Principles.pdf) or  aim  to  comply  with  them.  The  Group  has  also  established  rigorous procedures to prevent conflicts of interest.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "The Group's employees advise clients and inform them of the terms and risks associated with certain transactions, taking into consideration their level of expertise and their objectives. The Bank's products  and  services  are  proposed  only  after  an  in-depth  meeting with  the  advisor.  For  instance,  clients  can  avail  themselves  of  an investment  and  savings  profiling  service  in  their  branch  which evaluates  their  profile,  taking  into  account  their  personal  situation, assets, budget, financial expertise and risk profile to propose suitable advisory services and personalised solutions.\n\nIn French Retail  Banking ,  the  Operational  Risk  Committee  (COROC) has added the risk of misconduct to its remit, including tied selling. It examines the root causes and proposes an action plan. The 'Client' and  'Human  Resources'  teams  send  out  guidelines  on  sales  targets and  appropriate  conduct  to  managers  every  year,  stressing  the  core concept of responsible sales. Mystery customer visits throughout the year are another tool used to reinforce this policy. To further improve the  customer's  experience  and  satisfaction,  a  customer  satisfaction target  was  added  to  the  sales  force  evaluation  criteria  in  2021.  A specific internal procedure expressly states that tied selling cannot be part  of  the  criteria  for  individual  performance  bonuses.  The  issue  is also  tackled  in  initial  training  for  sales  operators  and  in  Excellence Client  (the  Societe  Generale  sales  training  attended  by  all  sales personnel  and  their  managers).  The  module  includes  a  presentation and explanation of the Eight Golden Rules of Retail Banking in France.\n\nThe  Markets  in  Financial  Instruments  Directive  (MiFID),  which  came into force in 2007, introduced  a  customer  classification  and information obligation for investment service providers. The reason for the obligation is that the less experienced a customer is, the more he or  she  is  entitled  to  protection.  The  Directive  defines  three  types  of clients:  eligible  counterparties  (banks  and  financial  institutions), professional  clients  (businesses)  and  retail  clients  (individuals). Societe Generale has set out a formal policy describing its processes for  executing  the  orders  of  financial  market  players.  This  policy document  is presented to investors for acceptance and is accompanied by a best execution obligation.\n\nIn accordance with commitments made to the authorities in 2019, the Group has also made efforts to protect financially vulnerable clients by implementing fee capping systems. In parallel, specific training in this regard  has  been  put  in  place  for  advisors  dealing  with  vulnerable customers.  For  more  information  on  the  protection  of  financially vulnerable  clients,  see  the  Chapter  on  Inclusive  banking  (and  the Social and Solidarity Economy), page/uni00A0316.\n\nSociete  Generale  has  also  strengthened  its  client  data  protection systems (see Chapter/uni00A04.11, Compliance risk, Data Protection paragraph, page/uni00A0257).\n\n## Clarity of information\n\nTo  ensure  transparency,  the  retail  banking  service  complies  with  its display  obligations  by  making  a  pricing  brochure  available  on  the website and at all Group branches.\n\nTo make contracts easier to understand, efforts are being made to use plain, clear language in respect of all banking offers. For example, the contractual documentation regarding the cash management services offered  to  companies  has  been  harmonised  to  make  the  legal commitment clearer.\n\n## Tackling discrimination 5.3.2.4\n\nIn  line  with  its  Environmental  and  Social  General  Principles,  the  Group proposes  financial  products  and  services  to  all  customers  pursuant  to French  law,  which  penalises  all  forms  of  discrimination  (for  more information, see Articles/uni00A0225-1 to 225-4 of the French Criminal Code (Code p\u00e9nal) https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/id/LEGISCTA000006165298/ [in French]). These obligations are transposed into the Group's standards documentation  (Societe  Generale  Code)  and  its  Code  of  Conduct  and must  be  complied  with  by  all  permanent  and  temporary  employees. Societe Generale's standards documentation makes specific reference to discrimination and extends compliance with French law to all entities; it states that situations involving the rejection of a client's request may not be motivated by discrimination based on gender, ethnic origin or religion.\n\nIn 2021, as part of the measures to raise employee awareness around the rules of client  protection  and  efforts  to  combat  discrimination,  a library  of  the  instructions  and  rules  that  are  in  force  at  national  and international  level  was  made  available  on  the  intranet  for  Societe Generale's employees:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| MiFID 2 regulation                     |\n|----------------------------------------|\n| Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD) |\n| Products and Services offering         |\n| Protection of retail customers         |\n| Con/flicts of interest - customers     |\n| Protection of customer assets          |\n| Customer complaints                    |\n| Employee compliance                    |\n\n## Supporting vulnerable clients\n\nIn France, the Group provides a free package of basic banking services in  accordance  with  Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0312-1 of  the  French  Monetary  and Financial Code (on the right to hold a bank account). Favourable terms are offered to young people on student loans to pay for their tuition, housing, equipment and other requirements. In 2021, Societe Generale renewed its partnership with Bpifrance, offering loans to students who have  no  income  and  nobody  to  act  as  guarantor  for  them.  The maximum amount of the government-backed student loan offered to students aged under 28 with Bpifrance was EUR/uni00A020,000 in 2021 ( versus EUR/uni00A015,000  in  2020)  to  fund  university  studies,  while  the  overall amount  allocated  was  doubled.  The  share  of  government-backed student loans offered in conjunction with Bpifrance in 2021 to students in  technical  courses  and  universities  was/uni00A037%  ( vs. 35%  in  2020).  The percentage  was/uni00A039  ( vss 41%  in  2020)  for  students  in  5-year  higher education programmes and engineering schools.\n\nIn  2021,  the  French  Retail  Banking  business  galvanised  around  the '1/uni00A0Jeune 1/uni00A0Solution' programme created by the government under its 'France Relance' stimulus plan to facilitate employment and inclusion among young people. Around ten recruitment events were organised in  France,  in  Paris,  Marseilles,  Rennes,  Lyons,  Strasbourg,  Lille, Bordeaux and Orl\u00e9ans. Societe Generale invited ten or so recruitment companies to participate in the events and help candidates with their job search.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  services  cover  different  themes  such  as  learning  a  new language, searching for a job or preparing for the driving theory test.\n\nTo help start-up clients launch their business, the 'devenir entrepreneur'  (become  an  entrepreneur)  programme  is  a  unique four-step process aimed at potential entrepreneurs to help them take their first steps. The 'start-up' section of the professional clients' web page  has  been  completely  revamped  and  now  offers  more  than  80 pages of educational content for business creators, while the advisory section  proposes  dedicated  e-learning  courses  and  a  series  of  four meetings with the prospective entrepreneur depending on the stage of their project.\n\nIn  accordance  with  Article/uni00A0R./uni00A0312-4-3  of  the  French  Monetary  and Financial  Code (Code  mon\u00e9taire  et  financier) ,  introduced  pursuant  to Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0312-1-3,  paragraph/uni00A02  of  said  Code, the French Retail Banking business  has  developed  a  system  to  identify  financially  vulnerable clients.  These  clients  can  sign  up  to  G\u00e9n\u00e9ris,  a  day-to-day  banking services package designed to help them manage their finances, for just EUR/uni00A03 a month. At the end of 2021, 55,831 Societe Generale clients had signed up for the G\u00e9n\u00e9ris package ( vs. 57,086 at the end of 2020).\n\n2020 saw the Group introduce a new inclusive offer, Kapsul, targeting clients  seeking  more  independent  services  on  a  budget.  Available online or in-branch, this new account costs EUR/uni00A02 per month with no income conditions and no other account charges. Kapsul clients can pay for products and services from anywhere in the world and can also get  an  international  Visa  card  with  insurance  and  assistance  cover. Some 5,170/uni00A0clients  had  signed  up  for  a  Kapsul  account by the end of December/uni00A02021 (3,553 at the end of 2020).\n\nThe  Group's  Boursorama  subsidiary  also  offers  solutions  tailored  to clients experiencing temporary financial difficulties. In 2020, the 'least expensive bank in France' for thirteen consecutive years added a new free-of-charge,  easy-to-use  and  educational  financial  management coaching  service via its  Wicount \u00ae Budget  account  offering.  Wicount \u00ae Budget helps customers to manage their day-to-day budget and stay on  top  of  their  finances.  Features  include  income  and  expenditure analysis, payment due alerts for major payments, balance alerts when a particular threshold is exceeded and top savings tips.\n\n## PHYSICAL ACCESSIBILITY (PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, SENIORS)\n\nThe Group strives to ensure that its services are accessible to clients with disabilities, adapting premises where necessary and making its applications more user-friendly:\n\n- access to Societe Generale and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord automated teller machines (ATMs); p\n- bank statements in Braille; p\n- outfitting: 84% of Cr\u00e9dit du Nord branches and 95% of Societe Generale branches were wheelchair accessible by the end of 2020; p\n- digital access to the Societe Generale mobile application. p\n\nSociete Generale is a signatory to the French manifesto for the inclusion of people with disabilities in economic life (Manifeste pour l'inclusion des personnes handicap\u00e9es dans la vie \u00e9conomique) as part of which it is optimising access by people with disabilities to the Company's digital tools and integrating digital accessibility into the design of information system master plans and the development of digital solutions. Digital access is one of the four thrusts of Societe Generale's policy for the integration of people with disabilities, together with recruitment and integration, training and responsible purchasing. For more information on the manifesto, see https://handicap.gouv.fr/le-manifeste-inclusionenclenche-une-nouvelle-dynamique .\n\nThe Group publishes its Multi-annual Accessibility Plan on its corporate website (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/ documents/2021-06/Schema-pluriannuel-2021\\_EN.pdf) .\n\n## INCLUSIVE BANKING (AND THE SOCIAL 5.3.2.4.1 AND SOLIDARITY ECONOMY)\n\nAs part of its policy on financial inclusion, Societe Generale supports innovative  solutions  designed  to  promote  sustainable  economic development incorporating environmental and societal performance, using a variety of set-ups such as companies, cooperatives, non-profit associations and private individuals.\n\n## Financing the non-profit sector in France\n\nSociete  Generale  has  developed  close  relationships  in  this  sector, thanks to its network of non-profit specialists throughout the country. The Group offers its expertise to some 93,000 non-profit structures of\n\nall sizes (representing market share of 7% overall, and as much as 20% in  the  management association segment) to help them achieve their day-to-day management goals.\n\nThrough Societe  Generale's  social  impact  savings  service,  customers can donate part or all of the annual interest on their savings accounts to  up  to  three  non-profits  chosen  from  among  those  with  which  the Group partners for this scheme. All non-profits selected by the Group adhere to high standards and guarantee transparency as regards the use  of  funds.  For  each  donation,  the  Group  adds  an  additional  10% which  it  pays  directly  to  the  association.  The  scheme  has  been awarded the Finansol label.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "The French Retail  Banking  business plans  to  offer  associations  the use  of  its  empty  premises.  For  example,  a  temporary  occupancy agreement  was  signed  in  2021  with  the  Life  Project  for  Youth organisation which fosters professional and social inclusion of young people living in extreme poverty and who are victims of exclusion: the association does not pay any rent and has occupancy of the premises for up to three years.\n\nSince  2018,  Societe  Generale  has  drawn  on  its Private  Banking arm and its philanthropic expertise to provide support in different areas to clients  looking  to  adopt  a  philanthropic  approach.  As  at  the  end  of 2021,  nearly  200  clients  or  families  had  received  support  and  more than 15 foundations or endowment funds were created. At the same time,  the  Private  Banking  business  sealed  a  partnership  with Philanthro-Lab (1) , a  unique  space  and  incubator  for  philanthropic projects in France.\n\nMoreover, since 2018, Societe Generale Private Banking has set itself apart by launching the first charity structured product on the market. To date, EUR/uni00A04/uni00A0million  in  accumulated donations have been collected (EUR/uni00A02.5/uni00A0million  in  2021)  for  distribution  to  non-profit  organisations working in the areas of cancer prevention, services for disabled people, services  for  children  and  inclusion  through  housing,  and  to  help combat exclusion among the most disadvantaged.\n\nSince  January/uni00A02018, Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord's  Private  Banking arm  has adopted  a  truly  'collaborative  philanthropic  approach',  designed  to provide  support  each  step  of  the  way  to  entrepreneurs  looking  to make their investments count (particularly when selling a company) or to  set  up  a  philanthropic  project  for  their  family  business.  Cr\u00e9dit  du Nord's approach is distinctive in that the Bank works closely with the Fondation  de  France  and  the  client's  own  advisers  (lawyers, notaries, /uni00A0 etc . )  throughout  the  entire  process,  from  initial  discussions with the client through to creating and investing in a foundation, and then seeing their funds in action - a potentially complex undertaking. Various projects have since cemented this partnership between Cr\u00e9dit du Nord Private Banking and the Fondation de France:\n\n- with  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  Private  Banking's  support,  various  business p clients have pursued philanthropic projects, resulting in the creation of four foundations sheltered by the Fondation de France in 2019;\n- a specific mutual fund* has been set up for the Fondation de France p and  accepts  investments  from  other  foundations  sheltered  by  the latter.  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  Private  Banking  in  Marseilles  manages  the fund's endowment and investments.\n\nGiven  that  such  projects  are  always  highly  personal  to  each  client, Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord's  communications strategy in this respect focuses on select,  small-scale  events  where the Bank can be most effective as a philanthropy  ambassador.  It  organises  events  together  with  the Fondation de France on a range of philanthropy-related topics (from wealth management strategies to philanthropic projects) and invites previous beneficiaries of the joint approach to share their experience of setting up a foundation and talk about the support they were given. Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  clients  are  also  invited  to  the  Fondation  de  France's major  donor  events  in  Paris  and  throughout  France  (conferences, evenings at the opera, guided museum visits, /uni00A0 etc . ). The FICADE group's Gestion de Fortune magazine awarded its Philanthropy Trophy to this partnership.\n\nIn  2021,  through  its  offering  of  social  impact  products  and  services, Societe  Generale  paid  a  total  of  EUR/uni00A02.6  million  to  some  fifty  French partner  associations  recognised  as  operating  for  the  public  good ( vs ./uni00A0almost EUR/uni00A02/uni00A0million in 2020).\n\n## Microfinance\n\n## glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>e glyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>%ReTglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\n\nThe  Group  has  worked  in  partnership  with  ADIE  (a  non-profit promoting  the  right  to  economic  initiative)  since  2006  to  support microfinance  throughout  both  metropolitan  and  overseas  France.  In 2021, this partnership resulted in the provision of EUR/uni00A018.3/uni00A0million  in credit lines (EUR/uni00A014.8/uni00A0million at end-2020)  and  EUR/uni00A0167,000 in sponsorship aid (the same level as 2020). Overseas loan outstandings with ADIE stood at EUR/uni00A04.3/uni00A0million (EUR/uni00A03.9/uni00A0million in 2020).\n\n## glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>e'glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>%eR'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"eRcc,\n\nIn  Africa,  back  in  2005  Societe  Generale  had  already  identified  the scope  of  requirements  and  the  emergence  of  microfinance  in  Africa, deciding to support the sector and, through its intermediary, to help boost the local rate of bank account penetration of microenterprises and SMEs which did not have access to traditional banking. Its work in this business sector, which is very specific and differs from that carried out  through  its  retail  banking  network,  takes  several  forms:  from traditional  refinancing  of  microfinance  institutions  to  acquiring holdings  in  the  capital  of  certain  local  institutions  in  Madagascar, Cameroon, Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, as well as acting as arranger for funding deals in the markets.\n\nIn  its  Grow  with  Africa  programme,  Societe  Generale  expressed  its resolve to use microfinance as a means to strengthen its work around financial inclusion and made a commitment to double its outstandings between 2018 and 2022. Looking further out to 2025, it reasserted this strategy at the end of 2021 to be present and active in this sector in Africa,  both  through  capital  holdings  and  solid  partnerships,  and  by working alongside professional and responsible players.\n\nThe institutions in which the Group has remained a shareholder from the  beginning  served  more  than  500,000  clients  at  the  end  of  2021, around 20% of whom are borrowers (with an average loan outstanding of less than EUR/uni00A02,200).\n\nToday, Societe General's African teams are the partners of choice for microfinance  institutions  because  they  can  use  their  experience  and knowledge  of  local  players  to  best  meet  the  needs  of  these institutions. Despite a challenging market environment, an encouraging  level  of  new  inflows  were  registered  in  2021,  while  the Group's exposure to microfinance institutions in Africa had surpassed EUR/uni00A0101 million at the end of 2021.\n\nThe  Group's  goal  is  to  leverage  this  franchise  by  developing relationships  with  microfinance  institutions  and  groups  that  offer sound  conditions  in  terms  of  profitability,  risk  and  compliance.  This involves a three-pronged approach:\n\n- bolstering  the  Bank's  relationships  and  role  in  the  financing  of 1. robust institutions in Africa by meeting their local debt financing needs  (or  marginally  through  capital  interests  where  such  an option  is  useful).  This  is  needed  in  North  Africa  where microfinance  institutions  are  not  authorised  to  collect  deposits from  their  clients.  Although  less  structural,  there  is  also  a significant  need  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  by  supporting  growth networks  (Advans,  Baobab,  ACEP,  Cofina, /uni00A0 etc . )  or  as  part  of  an ALM  approach  to  offset  the  volatility  of  deposits  through long-term  financing.  At  the  same  time,  the  Group  will  act  as  a preferred partner for equity financing deals among  the subsidiaries or holding companies of microfinance groups;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Totalling EUR/uni00A08/uni00A0million, this is the biggest crowdfunding venture in France, in accordance with the regulatory limits on this type of project funding. Lumo already obtained half of its overall target amount - EUR/uni00A04.1/uni00A0million - during the first round of funding which opened in June. This funding success is also a triumph for the impact investment platform in favour of the green and social transition: 863 individual investors and more than EUR/uni00A04/uni00A0million collected.\n\n## Educational actions, supporting financial education\n\nThe  Group's  subsidiaries  actively  support  financial  education,  which also helps in combatting discrimination in the distribution of products and  services.  They  make  their  websites  a  valuable  source  of information  to  help  the  general  public  keep  up  to  date  with  and understand all the latest financial news.\n\n## glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>e glyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>%ReTglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\n\nWith visits to its boursorama.com website topping 50/uni00A0million a month, Boursorama is  the  leading portal for economic and financial news in France. It offers agency news dispatches, economic and stock market information,  and  budget  management  content,  making  it  more accessible  through  a  variety  of  resources:  articles,  videos,  podcasts, fact  sheets  and  discussion  forums.  It  is  an  undisputed  free  source  of financial education which is at the fingertips of the everyday person, whatever their background.\n\nBoursorama also helps to educate its customers on financial matters through its products and services (such as the Wicount \u00ae online budget coach), its real-time live economic news broadcasts (Ecorama, Journal des Biotechs, /uni00A0 etc . ),  its  monthly  live  interactive  webinars  with  experts from all  walks  of  life,  its  daily  one-minute  video  offering  viewers  key information and tips on how to manage their money in everyday life ('Parlons  cash'),  and  the  specific  sections  on  its  website  (accessible directly from the home page) and in its mobile apps designed to help customers manage their savings.\n\nIn  2021,  Boursorama  and Liv'Invest , in  partnership  with  l'Or\u00e9al, organised BoursoLive ,  the  first  ever  online  conference  on  the  stock exchange and financial markets open to the general public. During this free  event,  private  individuals,  both  clients  and  non-clients  of Boursorama Bank, had the opportunity to chat directly via chatrooms and video calls with listed companies, asset managers and issuers of financial products (ETF, stock market instruments) to obtain advice on the most appropriate products for them, whether as a first foray into the  stock  markets  or  to  diversify  their  portfolio.  Complementing  the many educational tools and content features on boursorama.com , this exceptional  three-day  event  with  industry  experts  helps  private individual investors to enhance their knowledge of the stock markets, find  out  more  about  risk-taking  and  invest  in  a  more  responsible manner.\n\nSince  2018,  Societe  Generale's French  Retail  Banking activity  has been  offering  twelve  services  through  its  Boost  platform  which  are specifically designed for customers aged 18-24, available as part of its Sobrio package. The platform provides information on a wide range of topics relevant to this age group (getting a first job, developing skills, becoming independent, /uni00A0 etc . ), offering access to job postings, language learning,  training  in  coding,  digital  tutorials,  financial  assistance, housing  ads,  CV  templates,  career  advice  and  even  programmes  to help  them  improve  their  spelling.  At  the  end  of  2020,  the  Group introduced an e-wallet app designed to teach 10-17-year-olds how to manage their pocket money/allowance in a way that is fun, adaptable and reassuring for both parents and youngsters. This free offer, called Banxup,  is  100%  digital  and  only  available  online.  It  allows  users  to view their account activity and request money from their parents and comes with a Banxup Mastercard - a no-overdraft debit card. Parents can view their child's account activity in real time and can configure all of the various features and security options to suit their purposes such as contactless payment, international use and online purchases.\n\nIn  2020,  the  French  Retail  Banking  activity  launched  'Le  5'  des Experts',  a  five-minute  video  programme  on  all  things  related  to money.  Every  Tuesday,  an  expert  from  Societe  Generale  spends  five minutes answering questions from consumers (mainly individuals but also open to professionals once a month, and sometimes businesses) on subjects relating to lending, saving and insurance. The videos are published  on  the  app  (one  video  a  week),  on  the  website  page  for individual clients under 'Nos conseils' (Our advice), and on Facebook and Instagram, and are included in the client newsletters.\n\nSociete Generale Private  Banking has  produced  a  series  of educational videos on 'Understanding Responsible Investment' which are  available  on www.privatebanking.societegenerale.com .  These  are also available on the Spotify and Apple Podcast streaming platforms via the 'Private Talk by Societe Generale Private Banking' programme.\n\nIn 2021, Societe Generale began to offer a training module for young clients  in  responsible  digital  technology,  with  an  emphasis  on  the objectives of green IT. It was prepared by the Group's IT experts and is available at https://careers.societegenerale.com/green-it-program?xtor= AD-122-[lien-masterclass]. This  training  module  is  free  of  charge  for everyone, while students and job seekers can also obtain a certificate of completion free of charge.\n\n|",

Some 76/uni00A0students completed the course, 12 of whom obtained certification. Three  participants  in  the  programme  obtained  a  work  experience placement in Rosbank's IT Department, while one student was hired by the Human Resources Department.\n\nIn Russia, Rosbank* has supported the 'Start differently' programme since  2018.  This  programme  aims  to  help  develop  financially  viable business models for social entrepreneurs and NGOs that either employ or develop products and services for people with disabilities. A request for proposals is organised, which then leads to development support for the successful applicants: two months of intensive work to improve\n\ntheir  business  models,  with  support  from  volunteer  tutors  and consultants in financial planning, marketing, public relations and team management.  In  2021,  some  154  requests  were  submitted  from  69 cities  in  Russia,  of  which 11 were selected for the programme, which won the Finaward prize in the Social Project category.\n\nIn Morocco ,  Societe  Generale  launched  a  new  offer  for  parents  and children in 2021. The SoG\u00e9 Banky account can be used by parents to acquaint their children with the notion of financial autonomy, at a low cost, with no risk and while keeping control of the account at all times. The  offer  comes  with  a  free  'pocket  money'  card  for  each  child. Parents  with  a  SoG\u00e9  account  can  also  avail  themselves  of  an interest-bearing  savings  account  free  of  account  fees,  the  funds  of which are available at all times.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  line  with  the corporate  purpose  announced  at  the  beginning  of  2020,  Societe Generale is committed to five priority Human Resources areas:\n\n- a  culture  of  responsibility  based  on  strong  values  to  foster p constructive  social  dialogue  to  successfully  achieve  the  Group's structural  transformation  in  an  approach  based  on  transparency and  dialogue  (see  the  Report  on  Corporate  Culture  and  Ethics Principles at societe.generale.com);\n- a  robust  approach  to  anticipating  how  professions  and  skills  will p evolve so that the Group can effectively support employees in their career  path  and  development,  and  offer  them  alternative  ways  of working, such as working from home (see the Report on Professions and Skills);\n- a  proactive  diversity  and  inclusion  policy  illustrating  the  Group's p determination to be an inclusive company, reflecting the diversity of the customers it serves and the society in which it operates (see the Report on Diversity and Inclusion: https://www.societegenerale.com/ en/responsibility/responsible-employer/diversity-and-inclusion );\n- an  attractive  and  fair  remuneration  policy  that  encourages p long-term  employee  commitment  and  loyalty  (see  the  Report  on Performance and Compensation);\n- constant attention to health, safety and wellness concerns. Societe p Generale is committed to developing a pleasant and secure working environment  and  seeks  to  continuously  improve  the  work-life balance  of  its  employees  (see  the  Report  on  Occupational  Health and  Safety  and  A  closer  look  at  preventing  psychosocial  risks, page/uni00A0321).\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  ensures  respect  for  human  rights,  including those  of  its  employees,  and  implements  appropriate  measures  to prevent  and  control  the  risk  of  human  rights  violations  (see  Group's Duty  of  Care  Plan,  page/uni00A0339  and  the  Corporate  Culture  and  Ethics Principles report).\n\n## Governance around key HR risks 5.4.1.1\n\nAs  part  of  its  responsibility  as  an  employer  and  to  respect  human rights,  the  Group  takes  care  to  prevent  and  control  social  and operational  risks  related  to  human  resources  management.  This ensures that its operations comply with regulations (labour law, health and  safety  standards,  social  legislation, /uni00A0 etc . )  and  with  the  internal rules it has established, on the one hand, while also ensuring business continuity in satisfactory conditions for employees, on the other.\n\nOverall,  the  risks  related  to  human  resources  management  are included  in  the  Group's  general  risk  management  system,  organised into three lines of defence and shared by all entities (see Chapter/uni00A04.3, Internal control, page/uni00A0173).\n\nThe HR Department and its teams draw on:\n\n- global policies in the various HR areas, governing the management p of human resources in each of the Group's BUs/SUs and subsidiaries;\n- processes on the employer's five key missions: (I)  administrative p management  of  human  resources  and  payroll,  (ii)/uni00A0managing employees' careers, (iii)/uni00A0defining  and  managing  compensation  and benefits, (iv)/uni00A0managing jobs and  skills, and  (v)/uni00A0defining and managing social policies;\n- operational  procedures  and  user  guides aimed  at  securing p operations  and  ensuring  satisfactory  knowledge  management within the Group;\n- indicators to inform internal oversight. p\n\nThe HR Department and its teams are also covered by the Group's risk management and permanent control systems, including:\n\n- a  set  of  controls  on  key  HR  processes deployed  throughout  the p Group;\n- risk identification and prevention exercises; p\n- business continuity plans and crisis exercises. p\n\nPeriodic  controls are  carried  out  on  HR  activities  by  the  Audit  and Inspection teams.\n\n|",

Appropriate career and skills management (integration, mobility and career path, skills management, /uni00A0 etc . ) and the development of key talents and resources have  a  positive  impact  on  the  Group's  business  continuity  and performance, as well as on its ability to attract and retain talent.\n\n## Recruitment policy\n\nSociete  Generale's  recruitment  policy  is  tailored  to  the  specific needs of its business lines, activities and to the local context. Its hiring processes are consistent and standard across the Group and always include a HR interview to assess the candidate's affinity with the  Group's  values  (see  'A  Code  of  Conduct  underpinned  by  shared values', page/uni00A0275).\n\nThe  Group  is  diversifying  its  recruitment  methods  drawing  on  new technological  and  digital  features,  in  addition  to  traditional  ways  of attracting new hires, such as:\n\n- partnerships with target higher education institutions in nearly 59% p of the Group's entities, representing 95% of its employees;\n- funding of teaching programmes and research; p\n- internal development programmes (for interns, voluntary p international  'VIE'  trainees  and  work-study  participants  or  for young graduates in Global Banking and Investor Solutions).\n\n## Principles for mobility and filling positions\n\nSociete Generale has expertise across a broad range of sectors and offers employees a host of career opportunities. Twelve principles underpin the Group's policies on internal mobility and filling positions and apply to all entities.\n\nThey focus on:\n\n- transparency  as  regards  vacancies,  by  systematically  posting p opportunities on the internal job exchange (Job@SG), in 88/uni00A0entities that use this tool;\n- giving priority to filling positions from within the Group; and p\n- strict  adherence to the recruitment process defined by the Human p Resources Department to avoid any potential risk of corruption or conflict of interests, or any form of discrimination or favouritism.\n\n## Employee performance and compensation policy\n\nEmployee  performance  is  monitored  throughout  their  careers, particularly  through  development  plans  and  360\u00b0  assessments.  The development plans  assess  the  level  of  professional  competence,  the level of achievement of operational targets, and how these operational\n\ntargets  were  achieved.  Individual  employee  development  is  also discussed  during  the  annual  appraisal  interview  and  during  regular meetings  between  employees  and  their  manager  or  HR  manager.  In France,  it  is  also  discussed  during  the  employee  interview  with  their manager or HR manager every year.\n\nSociete Generale has a balanced compensation policy that meets regulatory requirements. Adapted to the economic, social, legal and competitive environment of the markets in which the Group operates, this policy is nevertheless based on principles shared by all entities:\n\n- rewarding individual and collective performance; p\n- promoting  healthy  and  effective  risk  management  and  ensuring p employees are not prompted to take inappropriate risks;\n- attracting,  retaining  and  motivating  strategic  talents  and  key p resources;\n- aligning  the  interests  of  employees  with  those  of  the  Group  and p shareholders;\n- checking that employees comply with the applicable internal rules p and regulations while ensuring equal treatment of customers.\n\nThe  principles  governing  Societe  Generale's  compensation  policy,  in particular for the categories of staff whose professional activities are liable to have a significant impact on the Group's risk profile, as per the European Capital Requirements Directive No./uni00A02013/36/EU (CRD/uni00A04), are detailed in the Remuneration Policies and Practices Report. It will be published, as is the case every year, prior to the General Meeting and provided  to  the  French  oversight  body  for  banks  and  prudential supervision ( Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution -  ACPR) in accordance with the provisions  of  EU  Regulation  No./uni00A0575/2013 (1) (see the Report on Performance and Compensation.\n\nIn  addition,  Group  entities  offer  employee  benefits  specific  to  their environment  and  employee  savings  schemes  in  locations  in  France (representing 43% of the workforce).\n\n## Talent management policy\n\nBuilt  around  its  Leadership  Model,  Societe  Generale  implements  the same talent management policy in all its entities, businesses  and regions  to  optimise  and  develop  the  potential  of  its  staff,  while deepening engagement to the Group. The aim of the policy is not only to  identify,  develop  and  retain  high-potential  employees  and  the leaders  of  tomorrow,  but  also  to  ensure  the  Group  has  the  right managers for key Group positions through succession planning.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  further  strengthened  its  policy  of  identifying, managing and developing high-potential talents and future leaders. It:\n\n- reviewed succession plans for the main key positions in the Group; p\n- managed and tracked diversity targets and commitments (see the p Report on Diversity and Inclusion;\n- identified and incorporated talents in the Group tool; p\n- continued to help develop talent, using the tools and solutions set p up in 2020 during the pandemic and which are compatible with an organisation that includes working remotely;\n- provided support to the HR teams to effectively manage the Group's p talent.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also ran a number of projects to adjust its organisation and continued to  take  a  forward-looking  approach  to  adapting  skills  to  changing needs,  based  on  strategic  workforce  planning,  its  internal  mobility policy and training programme.\n\n## Making changes to the organisation while fulfilling our commitments to supporting staff\n\n2021  saw  a  number  of  organisational  adjustment  projects  to  help improve  operational  efficiency  and  structural  profitability,  while strengthening  the  customer  experience  and  digitalisation,  and complying with the highest standards in terms of risk and compliance.\n\nThe  project  to  transform  Securities  Services,  Global  Markets  and some Central Services (Risk, Compliance, HR and Communication) led  to  302/uni00A0employees  leaving  of  their  own  accord  in  2021,  after receiving support to create their own businesses or training leading to qualification.\n\nThese departures took place within the framework of the agreement on the development of professions, skills and employment signed in March/uni00A02019.  Moreover,  Societe  Generale  gives  priority  to  providing alternative employment opportunities in the organisation.

Workshops  focusing  on  preventing psychosocial  risks  were  also  organised  for  the  employees  within  the scopes  most  impacted  by  the  transformation,  together  with  close monitoring by HR.\n\nThe planned merger of Cr\u00e9dit du Nord and Societe Generale brands (VISION 2025) illustrates the Group's ability to look ahead and reinvent its  business  model  to  stay  abreast  of  changing  customer  needs  and developments in the economy and society as a whole.\n\nThis merger is also the ideal opportunity to accelerate delivery on the Group's  CSR  commitments  and  to  stand  by  its  promises  as  a responsible  employer,  which  include  firm  commitments  to  provide support for employees under the/uni00A0VISION 2025 plan.\n\nThe first commitment is to complete the merger with no compulsory redundancies by focusing on natural attrition and offering alternative employment within the organisation.\n\nThe  second  is  to  provide  support  for  each  and  every  employee throughout  the  project.  To  do  this,  a  tailored employee  support programme has been drafted and is being negotiated with the trade unions. In addition, regular and consistent communication on the key aspects  of  the  proposed  merger  explain  why  this  new  bank  is  being created  and  what  it  sets  out  to  achieve.  The  team  organised roadshows  with  general  management  throughout  France  to  meet employees and answer their questions.\n\nAs with any transformation, building the new bank will be underpinned by a major training programme, upskilling, managerial support and change  management  support .  Developing  and  upgrading  skills  are particularly  important  to  address  the  challenges  of  recalibrated business  models,  changes  to  the  businesses  of  both  banks,  staff reclassifications  and  new  IT  tools  and  processes.  The  newly-created\n\nSkills  Academy, based  on  an  analysis  of  the  impacts  of  the transformation  by  employee  group,  will  offer  the  most  relevant support possible matched with the needs of employees and managers. Training programmes will start in 2022. More than EUR/uni00A0100/uni00A0million  is earmarked  for  staff  training  and  upskilling  over  the  period,  which  is three times the budget usually allocated for the same period.\n\nEstablishing a shared culture for the new bank is another priority. The staff of Societe Generale and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord will be treated on a strictly equal basis for all appointments, job moves and promotions.\n\nThe Group will also play close attention to employee engagement and psychosocial  risks.  Risk  management  and  prevention  has  been strengthened  and  measures  taken  to  raise  awareness  amongst  HR officers and managers. The Bank listens to its staff and has systems in place  to  measure  employee  engagement and their experience in the workplace.  Local  managers  play  an  essential  role,  since  they  are  in daily contact with staff.\n\nThe  proposed  disposal  of  Societe  Generale's  asset  management activities  to  Amundi is  in  line  with  its  savings  strategy  to  form partnerships  with  external  asset  managers  to  offer  investment  and asset management solutions to clients.\n\nThe transaction involves transferring all the personnel assigned to this activity.  As  a  responsible  employer,  the  Group  has  made  sure  that these  employees  are  joining  a  major  player  in  the  market  with  bold and ambitious goals to drive the future growth of this business.\n\nSupport  measures have  been  introduced  to  help  managers  and employees through the transition period. They include group support sessions  led  by  internal  and  external  coaches,  digital  breakfast meetings, regular presentations on Amundi's businesses providing the opportunity for staff to project themselves into their new environment, communications  about  the  HR  implications  of  the  transfer  and  a health phone line for staff.\n\n(See the report on Professions and Skills).\n\n## Robust strategic workforce planning\n\nSociete Generale aims to ensure the organisation has the right skills to reach  its  goals  in  the  medium  and  long  term.  To  prevent  risks associated  with  a  talent  shortage  or  mismatch, qualitative  and quantitative Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP) is in place in all our  locations  worldwide. Rolled  out  across  all  the  Group's  key businesses, SWP covers 95% of Societe Generale SA's employees in the core businesses in France, and is being phased in at the Group's other locations  (in  Asia,  the  United  States  and  elsewhere).  In  France, strategic workforce planning is governed by a social agreement signed in  2013,  and  renewed  in  2016  and  in  2019,  which  aims  to  match  HR policies,  particularly  in  terms  of  training  and  filling  positions,  to  the skills required to meet the Group's strategic challenges. SWP provides employees with the means to gain and maintain employment and is organised into three stages:\n\n- defining  a  qualitative  and  quantitative  target  for  the  skills  the 1. Group needs in the medium to long term to deliver on strategic goals;\n- assessing and mapping the skills available to the Group; 2.\n- identifying the gap between the current situation and the target 3. to  put  in  place  the  right  levers  (training,  internal  mobility, recruitment, /uni00A0 etc . ) and action plans to bridge this gap.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "Societe  Generale's  approach  to  skills  mapping  is  a  voluntary  one  that puts the employee first and gives them an active role in developing their career and employability. It is based on two skills self-reporting tools: 'Mondiag'  for  the  French  Retail  Banking  businesses,  and  'ACE' ( App\u00e9tences,  Comp\u00e9tences,  Exp\u00e9riences -or  Aspirations,  Skills  & Experience) destined  for the entire Group.  Today,  more  than 63,500/uni00A0employees worldwide have access to these tools (see Professions and Skills Report).\n\n## Phased deployment of initiatives specifically targeting career support and employability\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  rounded  off  its  internal  mobility  policies  with initiatives  to  ensure  BUs/SUs  have  the  talent  they  need  and  to  help employees  build  and  constantly  upgrade  their  skill  sets  to  be  agile enough in response to rapid change and to seize career opportunities. N ow,  all  Corporate  Division  employees  can  not  only  apply  for vacancies advertised internally, but also be offered opportunities within  the  Group  by  a  recruiter  manager .  The  ACE  self-reporting platform  is  an  essential  tool  for  managers  and  recruiters  to  match employees'  skills  with  talent  needs  and  quickly  identify  the  profiles that  meet  their  requirements.  After  a  pilot  in  2020  and  roll-out  in Corporate  Departments  in  2021,  the  Group  intends  to  extend  the initiative across the organisation.\n\nAt the same time, the Reskilling Initiative was scaled up in 2021. Kicked off in 2020 in consultation with business experts, Reskilling combines professional  training  from  the  Group's  training  catalogue  with\n\ntheoretical  content  delivered  by  academic  partners. As  its  name suggests,  the  Reskilling  Initiative  aims  to  offer  employees  the opportunity to reskill and retrain in growth areas or where there is a  shortage  of  talent. Some  149/uni00A0employees  participated  in  the programme  in  2021  (an  increase  on  the  40  or  so  in  2020)  as  the Reskilling initiative plays its part in ensuring the Group has the skills it needs for  the  digital  revolution  and  to  manage  the  consequences  of the pandemic.\n\n## Rich range of training opportunities to help build the key skill sets of the future\n\nThe training courses offered by various players (cross-business teams or academies specific to Business or Service Units or subsidiaries) in a variety of formats (e-learning, face-to-face, MOOC, videos, /uni00A0 etc.) cover:\n\n- business skills; p\n- the  risk,  responsibility  and  compliance  culture  of  employees. p Compulsory training  for  all  Group  employees  covers  the  following subjects:  information  security,  anti-corruption  measures,  Code  of Conduct,  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation,  international sanctions,  anti-money  laundering  and  counter-terrorism  financing, conflicts of interest and harassment;\n- behavioural  skills  (agile  working,  collaborative  working,  change p management, /uni00A0 etc.);\n- managerial culture and social and environmental responsibility. p\n\n## DELIVERING A CSR TRAINING PLAN FOR ALL EMPLOYEES\n\nA  dedicated  CSR  training  programme  for  all  employees  was  launched  in  mid-2020  by  the  CSR  Department  and  the  Human  Resources Department and rolled out in BUs/SUs and countries. It is based on four pillars:\n\n## Developing a common, cross-business CSR culture. 1.\n\n- New modules have been added to the line-up of digital training available to all staff, structured around a number of key topics: climate -change  and  biodiversity,  responsible  digital  technology  and  ESG  analysis.  There  are  around  30  modules  in  all,  and  some  offer certification when successfully completed.\n- The  Group  ran  climate  awareness  and  education  workshops  attended  by  more  than  2,000/uni00A0employees  in  France  and  abroad.  This -training was delivered by in-house personnel trained to lead these collaborative workshops as part of the Fresques du climat drive to teach people about the essentials of climate change.\n- Each new hire in the Group will be offered an e-learning course, 'The Bank in Brief' , which includes an introduction to the CSR issues -facing banks.\n- French Retail Banking put together a special module on Societe Generale's CSR strategy for its staff. 17,000/uni00A0employees completed the -module.\n\n## Implementing Environmental & Social (E&S) risk management. 2.\n\n- The e-learning course was originated in 2020 to 'raise awareness of environmental and social risks' and train target audiences to -implement the CSR normative framework and, in particular, to take account of E&S risks in the Group's activities. The module has been translated into nine languages and distributed widely in the BUs/SUs to more than 40,000/uni00A0employees in 2021.\n\n## Offering expert modules to the sales functions to reinforce customer support on energy transition. 3.\n\n- The training course focusing on the challenges of the energy transition, which was developed and delivered in 2020 to some of the -Group's sales functions (in Global Banking and Investor Solutions), was switched up to a Group programme with a very wide audience. In addition, all Group employees had the ability to register for live presentations. In all, some 10,000/uni00A0people from 12 BUs/SUs signed up for this programme.\n- Societe  Generale  also  offers  two  training  programmes  on  factoring  ESG  criteria  into  financing  and  investment  activities:  ESG -certification  offered  by  the  SFAF  (the  French  association  of  financial  analysts)  and  the  EFFAS  (European  Federation  of  Financial Analysts  Societies),  as  well  as  a  SFAF  course  that  does  not  offer  certification.  To  date,  54/uni00A0employees  have  earned  certification  in this/uni00A0field.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Training courses were also converted to digital formats in 2021, working with the Risk Division in particular, to leverage the expertise available in the Group.\n\n## CAREER, SKILLS AND TALENT MANAGEMENT RISKS AND THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE BANK'S EMPLOYER BRAND, PERFORMANCE AND ATTRITION: KEY INDICATORS\n\n| At Group level                                                               | 2019    | 2020     | 2021    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|\n| % of positions filled through internal mobility                              | 58%     | 63%      | 56%     |\n| % of employees on permanent contracts changing jobs per year                 | 18%     | 15%      | 14%     |\n| Number of training hours taken by Group employees (in millions)              | 4.0     | 3.0      | 3.7     |\n| Average number of training hours per employee                                | 26.9    | 20.3 (1) | 26      |\n| % of employees having completed at least one training course during the year | 90%     | 85%      | 88%     |\n| Number of employees on permanent contracts who had an appraisal interview    | 113,000 | 108,947  | 106,687 |\n| % of the workforce on permanent contracts                                    | 93%     | 93%      | 94%     |\n| The Group's payroll expenses (in EUR/uni00A0billions)                        | 9,955   | 9,289    | 9,764   |\n| Rate of voluntary staff turnover (permanent contracts)                       | 8.2%    | 6.2%     | 9.4%    |\n| Turnover rate, excluding Russian, Indian and Romanian subsidiaries           | 5.7%    | 4.2%     | 4.4%    |\n\n- The number of training hours dispensed and amounts spent on training were impacted by the unexpected health crisis at the start of 2020. Face-to-face training (1) modules were suspended at the start of the crisis. The Group adapted and transformed its programmes and offered new remote training alternatives to maintain the employee training programmes.\n\nTo tackle high staff turnover (partly attributable to local employment patterns),  the  Group's  subsidiaries  in  some  locations,  particularly  in Russia,  India  and  Romania,  have  launched  targeted  HR  actions  to improve  employee  engagement  and  retention.  Actions  focus  on benefit packages, working conditions and career progression.\n\n## Risks related to non-compliance 5.4.1.3 with internal social regulations and rules and poor working conditions\n\nThe Group must comply with various regulations regarding labour law and,  more  broadly,  human  rights  (compensation  and  social  rights, diversity and non-discrimination, dialogue with employees, freedom of association, /uni00A0 etc . ), around  the  world.  Societe  Generale  has  also adopted  internal  rules  for  human  resources  management.  Failure  to comply could be detrimental to the Group's employees. It could also impact Societe Generale's ability to continue its activities, and expose it to certain legal and reputational risks. In addition, the Group strives to  provide  all  its  employees  with  working  conditions  and  a  work environment that are healthy and safe. Poor working conditions and the associated harm to employees' physical and/or mental health (as a result  of  high  levels  of  stress,  for  example)  would  affect  employee commitment  and  both  individual  and  collective  performance,  thus impacting the Group's ability to implement its strategy.\n\nThe Group has set itself several key objectives in this respect:\n\n- ensure regulatory compliance of employment relationships; p\n- ensure  the  Company's  compliance  with  any  regulations  that  affect p human  resources  management  processes  (health  and  safety standards, duty of care, General Data Protection Regulations, MiFID/uni00A0II Directive, /uni00A0 etc.);\n- maintain a labour relations climate that is favourable to interactions p with the Group's stakeholders (in particular employee representative bodies and employees) by guaranteeing freedom of association and fundamental rights for its employees;\n- fight  against  all  forms  of  discrimination  at  work  and  promote p professional equality and diversity in the Company;\n- guarantee the health and safety of persons in the workplace and in p the exercise of their work.\n\nTo  ensure  compliance  in  its  employment  relations  and  human resources management processes, the Group:\n\n- monitors labour law developments in all countries where it operates; p\n- arranges for Human Resources to be involved in regulatory proposals; p\n- routinely updates its human resources information systems (HRIS) in p line with regulatory developments (on a Group-wide or local basis, as appropriate).\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## MAINTAINING A POSITIVE LABOUR 5.4.1.3.1 ENVIRONMENT\n\nThe Group's commitment to labour relations is demonstrated by:\n\n- a  global  framework  agreement  with  UNI  Global  Union  on p fundamental human rights,  renewed  in  February/uni00A02019 covering all staff (see the Group's Duty of Care Plan, page/uni00A0346). In line with the 2015 agreement on fundamental freedoms and the right to organise, this new agreement includes additional commitments on:\n- preventing misconduct, -\n- countering discrimination and promoting diversity in all human -resources management processes (a subject already introduced in the initial agreement),\n- maintaining a working environment conducive to health, safety -and satisfying working conditions for all employees.\n\nRegular  discussions  are  held  with  UNI  Global  Union  on  the agreement and the application of these commitments. In addition, an  annual  follow-up  meeting  is  held  between  UNI  Global  Union representatives, the Bank's CSR and Human Resources Departments,  and  representatives  of  the  Group's  trade  unions. Several meeting were held in 2021, the most recent in November;\n\n- numerous collective agreements signed with social partners on p working  conditions (working hours, employment  conditions, remuneration  and  benefits, /uni00A0 etc . ) and  the  Company's  strategic projects.  These  agreements  cover  compensation  and  employee benefits  (in  56%  of  the  entities  that  signed  agreements),  working conditions, labour relations practices and equality at the workplace. In 2021, 157 agreements were signed within the Bank, covering 62% of the workforce (compared with 161 in 2020).\n\n## PROMOTING THE HIGHEST STANDARDS 5.4.1.3.2 OF CULTURE & CONDUCT AND APPLYING AN APPROPRIATE SANCTIONS POLICY\n\nSociete Generale is extremely vigilant when it comes to complying with regulations,  internal  rules  and  procedures  and  the  ethical  principles governing its business activities. The policy framework includes:\n\n- a  Group  policy  on  inappropriate  conduct  in  the  workplace, p introduced in 2019 with the aim of preventing and countering any conduct  that  contravenes  the  principles  enshrined  in  its  Code  of Conduct,  especially  any  form  of  bullying  or  sexual  harassment.  It encourages awareness-raising actions on misconduct, in particular through  training  for  managers  and  Human  Resources  teams,  and reminds employees that the perpetrators of such acts will be subject to  disciplinary  measures  that  may  entail  the  termination  of  their employment contract (see report on Corporate Culture and Ethics Principles);\n- a whistleblowing framework , set up for the entire Group, allows an p employee or external and occasional co-worker to report a situation of which they are aware and which does not comply with the rules governing  the  conduct  of  the  Group's  business  or  with  expected ethical  standards,  or  which  could  violate  applicable  laws  and regulations. This may include situations of inappropriate behaviour or  alleged  threats  to  the  health  and  safety  of  individuals  (see  the Group's  Duty  of  Care  Plan,  page/uni00A0339  and  A  Code  of  Conduct underpinned by shared values, page/uni00A0275);\n\n- a  global  disciplinary  policy published  in  2019  formalises  the p principles and best practices in relation to sanctions (right to make a mistake,  non-tolerance  of  misconduct,  sanction  decisions  taken collectively and proportionate to the seriousness of the misconduct, ultimate responsibility of the manager in applying the principles and sanction decisions, follow-up on sanctions). This policy is transposed  in  all  Group  entities  into  operating  procedures  and supplemented by a list of disciplinary actions. The key indicators are communicated to General Management.\n\n## PROMOTING EQUAL EMPLOYMENT 5.4.1.3.3 OPPORTUNITY AND DIVERSITY\n\nSociete  Generale  has  a  range  of  policies,  actions  and  processes  to promote equal opportunities and diversity, including in particular:\n\n- a Diversity and Inclusion policy, reflecting the Group's p determination to recognise and promote all talents, regardless of an employee's  beliefs,  age,  disability,  parental  status,  nationality, sexual  or  gender  identity,  sexual  orientation,  membership  of  a political, religious or trade union organisation, or any other factors that could give rise to discrimination. It aims to create the conditions for  an  inclusive  organisation  offering  equal  treatment,  through various fields of action:\n- communicate, raise awareness, train, -\n- create a work environment and management that is conducive to -inclusion,\n- champion diversity and inclusion at governance-level within the -Group;\n- sponsorship at  the  highest  level  of  the  organisation,  led  by  Diony p Lebot (Deputy Chief Executive Officer);\n- a  Diversity  and  Inclusion  Committee, with  members  from  the p Business  and  Services  Units  Management  Committees.  Its  main mission  is  to  define  the  Group's  diversity  and  inclusion  aims  and guidelines as well priorities on a yearly or multi-year basis;\n- a  special  team tasked  with  promoting  diversity  and  inclusion p through a network of sponsors to roll out the Group's commitments in the Business and Services Units in France and in our international locations;\n- ambitious targets, including a gender equality target of increasing p the  number  of  women  in  senior  management  positions  to  30% by/uni00A02023;\n- even more robust public commitments in 2021: p\n- signing  charters  to  foster  gender  diversity: #JamaisSansElles, -Financi'Elles and Towards the Zero Gender Gap,\n- signing  the Autre  Cercle Charter  (a  French  non-profit  promoting -an inclusive workplace for LGBT+ professionals),\n- signing the new Parenthood in the Company Charter, -\n- taking  part  in  the  first  diversity  survey  conducted  by Club  21 e -si\u00e8cle , an organisation formed to promote diversity at all levels of society,  to  measure  social  and  cultural  diversity  at  the  top echelons of France's large corporates;\n\nfight against all forms of discrimination, -\n\n<!-- image -->",

To achieve this, it relies on certain key measures, including:\n\n- monitoring  indicators  in  respect  of  women  and  international  employees, i.e. their  representation  within  high-potential  pools  and p succession plans, promotions, pay rises, grades and classes, /uni00A0 etc . ;\n- more collegiality in the appointment of senior executives (see Chapter/uni00A03.1.5 Diversity policy within Societe Generale', page 96); p\n- a review of the inclusiveness of certain social policies (to ensure, for example, that they take into account different family models). p\n\nAs part of its commitment to implementing a strong diversity policy, the Group has also rolled out a range of awareness-raising and training initiatives around diversity, including:\n\n- a 'diversity and inclusion' playlist available to all Group employees via the e-learning platform; p\n- awareness campaigns aimed at all employees on why diversity and inclusion are important and the impact of unconscious bias; p\n- development of inter-generational cooperation through specific programmes, reverse mentoring and focus groups. p\n\nThe Group's commitment to diversity is also evident in:\n\n- including questions on diversity and inclusion in the Employee Satisfaction Survey to gauge their experience and introduce targeted actions p to make our environment more inclusive;\n- support for in-house employee networks working to promote inclusion (Women@SG, WAY, Pride&Allies, /uni00A0 etc.). p\n\nStaying with diversity and inclusion, 123/uni00A0entities covering 98% of the Group's workforce are implementing local actions to strengthen gender equality, 78/uni00A0entities covering 87% of the Group's workforce are carrying out local actions to support employees with disabilities, 55/uni00A0entities covering 73% of the Group's workforce have actions under way for employees aged 50 and over, and 70/uni00A0entities covering 85% of the Group's workforce are working to promote inclusion and professional integration. For more information, see the Report on Diversity and Inclusion.\n\n## GUARANTEEING HEALTH AND SAFETY AT 5.4.1.3.4 WORK AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF WORKING CONDITIONS\n\nSociete  Generale's health,  safety  and  satisfactory  prevention policy, applicable Group-wide, aims to provide each employee with a safe  working  environment  in  respect  of  both  the  workplace  and working practices that guarantees their safety and their physical and psychological well-being. The appropriate expertise and resources are mobilised to implement this policy, which involves:\n\n- monitoring  the  office  layout  plans  and  the  ergonomics  of  the p workstations;\n- awareness-raising  and  preventive  actions  to  ensure  physical  and p mental health at work;\n- recommending  regular  medical  check-ups  for  all  employees,  in p accordance with local regulatory requirements;\n- incorporating a set of commitments on health, safety and working p conditions  into  a  global  agreement  on  fundamental  rights  signed with UNI Global Union;\n- ensuring employees are able to exercise their whistleblowing rights p (see the Report on Corporate Culture and Ethics Principles).\n\nThe Group's longstanding commitment to offer the best possible working conditions by:\n\n- ensuring a minimum level of social, health and welfare protection p for all its employees worldwide . To date, nine out of ten employees benefit from a supplementary company health or personal protection plan, and one of the objectives set by the Group is that each employee should  have  coverage  amounting  to  two  years'  salary  in  the  event of/uni00A0death;\n\n|\n\n\u00b7",

Launched in 2015, the Life at Work programme breaks down into six topics: individual and collective efficiency; health and prevention;  remote  working  and  new  organisational  models;  the working environment; support during key life events; and change in managerial  culture,  in  particular  through  training  and  awareness initiatives in connection with the Leadership Model and the Culture & Conduct programme;\n- a raft of measures to make the workplace and working conditions p better, either  through  this  programme  or  in  addition  to  it.  They include  a  charter  on  work-life  balance,  a  flexitime  policy,  making changes  to  the  workspace, /uni00A0 etc . (see  the  Report  on  Occupational Health and Safety);\n- the  opportunity  to  support  partner  organisations through  skills p sponsorship programmes (see the Report on Corporate Culture and Ethics Principles).\n\n## A CLOSER LOOK AT PREVENTING PSYCHOSOCIAL RISKS\n\nSociete Generale established its general policy on preventing psychosocial risks several years ago as part of its ambition to provide a safe and healthy working environment for all employees.\n\nThis policy is applied by:\n\n- all Business Units and Service Units, which are tasked with raising awareness and ensuring employees have good working conditions. BUs p and SUs can draw on the tools available from the Group's Human Resources Department;\n- managers, who receive custom support when they are affected by reorganisation plans. They are trained to detect and handle warning p signals;\n- employees considered to be vulnerable to direct them towards the right supports and help them get back to work. p\n\nPsychologists are also available for employees, in addition to the support available from the Occupational Health Department. The objectives of the Group's policy on psychosocial risk are:\n\n- provide time for employees in complicated situations to talk and be listened to by an external psychologist; p\n- help employees to resolve specific problems, possibly by providing support and guiding them towards appropriate solutions. p\n\nThe Group offers training in preventing psychosocial risks for employees, HR personnel and managers.\n\nAs most people were working from home in 2021, Societe Generale took practical steps to identify, assess and prevent this type of risk:\n\n- providing employees with a kit to help identify psychosocial risks remotely; p\n- raising awareness about psychosocial risks and what resources are available for the HR function to mitigate them; p\n- webinars on the risks of an excessive workload, isolation and stresses that come with working from home. p\n\nStress prevention initiatives are conducted in 118/uni00A0Group subsidiaries and branches, covering 94% of Societe Generale's workforce. The aim is to inform, train and support employees that may encounter situations that pose psychosocial risks. Initiatives include programmes offering free assistance from healthcare or insurance partners, training and/or awareness-raising on psychosocial risks, surveys and evaluations to measure stress, and various leisure and relaxation activities. For example, the French branch network has developed mandatory training on psychosocial  risks  and  a  psychological  support  programme  for  employees  that  are  victims  of  armed  robbery  or  other  forms  of commercial-related attack. The Russian subsidiary Rosbank set up online psychological support for its employees and their families.\n\nAs the pandemic has upended our lives and changed how we work and  how  work  is  organised,  the  Group  has  stepped  up  its commitments  to  protecting  the  health  and  safety  of  its  staff, notably by:\n\n(see the Report on Occupational Health and Safety)\n\n- introducing  remote  working  in  130  Group  entities. Triggered  by p the Covid-19 crisis, the Group successfully implemented group-wide working  from  home  for  all  compatible  positions.  In  January/uni00A02021, General Management signed a Remote Working Agreement with the French trade unions. The agreement entered into force on 4/uni00A0October 2021  and  stipulates  that  working  from  home  is  now  a  working arrangement available to all employees ( i.e. whether on permanent\n\nor  temporary  contracts,  interns,  work-study  participants  or  new hires).  The  agreement  defines  the  principle  and  sets  two  days  of remote working per week as the standard. Each BU/SU will decide how many days a week its employees can work from home, and will be able to increase or decrease the number depending on the activity involved.  In  implementing  this  agreement,  the  Group's  entities adhere to all principles of equality, rules on working hours, the right to disconnect, and health and safety requirements for staff working from  home.  Alongside  this  agreement,  the  Group  also  rolled  out preventive  measures  (particularly  relating  to  the  risks  of  isolation), communication campaigns, training and awareness-raising for both managers  and  employees,  all  adapted  to  each  individual  entity's level of experience with remote working;\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  is  tasked  with ensuring employees are protected and supervising the application or lifting of lockdown restrictions according to the local situation,\n- informing  staff  about  the  public  health  measures  in  place,  in -accordance with government guidelines,\n- offering vaccination to employees in Societe Generale's medical -services in France,\n- e-learning modules for personnel in France on Covid-19 and how -to protect themselves and others;\n\n## FOCUS ON THE EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION SURVEY\n\nSociete  Generale  measures  employee  engagement  through  the  Employee  Satisfaction  Survey,  an  annual  and  anonymous  internal  survey conducted throughout the Group in France and abroad.\n\nEmployees  are  asked  to  freely  give  their  opinion  and  impressions  on  a  range  of  topics  related  to  corporate  life.  All  answers  are  strictly confidential.\n\nShared  with  employees,  the  results  serve  as  the  basis  for  action  plans  and  working  groups,  where  necessary,  in  the  spirit  of  continuous improvement.\n\nThe 2021 survey looked at the following topics:\n\n- engagement, according to an indicator monitored since 2009; p\n- working conditions; p\n- Culture & Conduct; p\n- diversity and inclusion. p\n\nHere are some of the key findings from this year's survey:\n\n- the employee engagement score was 66%, up 3 points on the 2020 figure. This can be notably attributed to an upturn in the employee p satisfaction indicators regarding decisions taken by Societe Generale's Management team (63% vs. 56% in 2020);\n- pride in belonging to Societe Generale came in at 76%, underscoring that employees are proud to work in the Group ( vs . 75% in 2020); p\n- 89% of employees think that their manager encourages ethical and responsible behaviours ( vs. 88% in 2019). p\n\nSince 2018, the members of the Group Management Committee have set shared collective targets including the employee engagement rate, which is measured by the Group's Employee Satisfaction Survey (see Report on Performance and Remuneration).\n\n|\n\n- steps  to  ensure  optimum,  safe  working  conditions  for  hybrid p working:\n- informing employees about information security and cybersecurity -risks and the precautions to take,\n- strengthening  measures  aimed  at  providing  psychological, -medical and social support for employees (remote consultation, tailored  psychological,  direct  lines  to  occupational  health  and social services),\n- workshops  on  managerial  transformation  as  part  of  the  Life  at -Work programme to guide managers in setting up hybrid working.",

Owing to the health crisis, employees (2) had specific indemnities related to child care or due to health reasons requiring them to remain at home that were supported by the Group.\n\n## BEING A RESPONSIBLE PURCHASER: THE POSITIVE SOURCING 5.4.2 PROGRAMME\n\nThe  Sourcing  Function  plays  an  important  role  in  implementing  the Group's  CSR  strategy.  It  helps  give  tangible  form  to  our  values  and strives to ensure the Group's social and environmental commitments are  achieved.  First  launched  in  2006,  Societe  Generale's  responsible sourcing  policy  is  broken  down  into  action  plans  over  several  years and  involves  the  entire  value  chain,  from  expert  partners  to  buyers and/uni00A0suppliers.\n\nThe Sourcing Division's 2021-2023 Positive Sourcing Programme (PSP) follows  on  from  the  2018-2020  PSP.  This  sixth  action  plan  will consolidate what has been gained thus far, working around two main priorities:\n\n- the CSR Duty of Care Plan; p\n- promoting positive impact sourcing strategies. p\n\nIn  support  of  the  plan,  the  Group's  normative  documentation  (the Societe Generale Code) on responsible purchasing actions defines the measures to manage E&S risks.\n\nSociete  Generale's  Sourcing  practices  are  part  of  a  continuous improvement process and in line with the rules of conduct and ethics applicable  to  purchasing  annexed  to  the  Global  Agreement  on Fundamental  Rights  with  the  UNI  Global  Union  (see  Being  a responsible employer, page/uni00A0314).\n\nImplementing  the  PSP  is  also  a  Group  commitment  for  Responsible Sourcing and Supplier Relations certification, awarded by the French National  Ombudsman (M\u00e9diation  des  entreprises) and  National Procurement Council (Conseil  national  des  achats) .  This  certification, which is underpinned by ISO/uni00A020400: 2017 - Sustainable Procurement, attests  to  a  company's  commitment  to  establishing  sustainable  and balanced relationships with its suppliers.\n\nWhen  it  signed  the  Responsible  Supplier  Relations  Charter,  Societe Generale was one of only four large French companies - and the first bank - to be awarded certification in 2012, which was renewed for a further three years early in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Improving E&S risk management 5.4.2.1 during the sourcing process\n\n## E&S RISK IDENTIFICATION 5.4.2.1.1\n\nThis step consists of identifying whether a supplier's practices and/or a product or service purchased presents a potential E&S risk.\n\n## Identifying E&S risks related to products and services: risk mapping\n\nE&S  risk  mapping  for  sourcing  (created  in  2018)  covers  over  150 sub-categories  of  products  and  services  and  allows  purchasers  to assess  the  CSR  risks  inherent  to  their  purchasing  categories.  It identifies four risk levels, from low to high. The categories identified as representing the greatest risk  include  those  related  to  building  work (renovations, interior outfitting and  construction  work),  waste management,  as  well  as  some  categories  related  to  IT  equipment (such as mobile phones and workstation equipment).\n\n## Identifying E&S risks related to suppliers: Know Your Supplier (KYS)\n\nIn May/uni00A02020, the Sourcing Division reinforced the measures it had put in place in 2016 to monitor certain suppliers and manage the risks of corruption and reputational damage. The KYS process was extended to all suppliers representing significant sums or sensitive purchases for the Group. It now routinely conducts KYS checks at the outset of the business relationship as well as periodically over the contract term, in line  with  the  supplier's  risk  level.  Data  protection  is  ensured  by analysing the personal data involved in these measures ahead of time. What is more, supplier contract templates include the personal data protection stipulations required by law.\n\nglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>Ai Riiglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>iidglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>e' B\"glyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> i(ffcglyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>hi \"h fh\"glyph<c=23,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>(T'iglyph<c=8,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>iglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>h)glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>Tglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>i glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=23,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>e'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=23,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> Ri fhglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>iglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>e'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>eglyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>Ai hglyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>ibiC\n\nOnce  the  Sourcing  Division  has  identified  an  E&S  risk,  it  conducts an/uni00A0assessment.\n\n## Assessing E&S risks related to products and services: Inclusion of CSR criteria in calls for tender\n\nBased on the risks identified through E&S risk mapping in the sourcing process,  the  Sourcing  Division  (and  the  entire  international  Sourcing Function for high-risk categories) includes CSR criteria specific to each eligible  purchasing  category  in  its  calls  for  tender.  These  criteria  are weighted in the final choice of supplier according to the level of risk identified.  Adapted  to  suit  an  international  context,  they  are  now available for use throughout the Group.\n\n## Assessing E&S risks related to suppliers: extra-financial evaluation\n\nA non-financial evaluation is required to assess the CSR performance of  suppliers  under  contract,  those  accounting  for  large  purchase volumes  at  Group-level  or  representing  the  brand.  The  audit  is conducted by an independent third party on their environmental and social performance, business ethics and subcontracting practices.\n\n## hglyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>ib dglyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>R'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"e\n\n## Sustainable Sourcing Charter and CSR clauses in contracts\n\nSince  April/uni00A02017,  the  Sourcing  Function  has  routinely  sent  all  its suppliers a copy of the Sustainable Sourcing Charter (https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/construiredemain/ 12112018\\_sustainable\\_sourcing\\_charter\\_vf\\_eng.pdf) . This  Charter  is the result of a joint initiative between French banking and insurance operators  looking  to  involve  their  suppliers  in  the  due  diligence process.  It  sets  out  the  Group's  CSR  commitments,  obligations  and expectations with respect to its suppliers, and has been translated into six different languages.\n\nThe reciprocal commitments set out in the Charter are based on the fundamental  principles  of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  as regards  human  rights,  working  conditions,  the  environment  and countering corruption.\n\nA CSR clause is included in all standard contracts used by the Sourcing Division in France and by the function abroad. It refers to the Group's Code of Conduct, the Sustainable Sourcing Charter and the possibility to  conduct  on-site  CSR  audits,  as  well  as  the  requirement  for non-financial  evaluation  of  certain  suppliers  (see  below).  This  clause aims to involve suppliers in the due diligence process with respect to human rights, working conditions (health and safety), the environment and  the  fight  against  corruption  (see  Chapter/uni00A04.11  Compliance  Risk, section Anti-corruption measures, page/uni00A0256).\n\n## On-site supplier audits\n\nUnder its CSR clause, the Group has the right to conduct CSR audits at suppliers'  sites.  Societe  Generale  has  approved  two  external  audit providers to assist it in this respect. Each year, the Group draws up an audit plan and performs an E&S risk analysis to identify the suppliers it will cover. In 2021, it approved action plans as a result of four supplier audits  implemented with the Bank's peers in 2020. Action plans and remediation actions are currently being monitored with suppliers.\n\n## Training on E&S risks\n\nWithin  the  Sourcing  Division,  the  contribution  to  CSR  performance through  the  implementation  of  the  Positive  Sourcing  Programme  is part  of  the  job  descriptions  of  buyers  and  their  managers.  For categories  involving  high  CSR  risks,  individual  operational  objectives have  been  set.  When  they  take  up  their  positions,  buyers  follow  a Sustainable  Sourcing  training  course,  included  in  the  in-house onboarding training for new hires.\n\nBy end-2021, all the Group's professional purchasers in France and in 16 other countries had received training on responsible sourcing and E&S risk management tools.\n\nIn addition, the Group's short awareness-raising motion-design video, made  in  2020  to  present  its  sustainable  sourcing  programme,  was made  available  to  all  employees  that  are  occasionally  involved  in purchasing on the Group intranet.\n\n|",

Societe Generale was the  first  bank  to  sign  the  SME  Pact  in  December/uni00A02007  and  it continues to uphold its commitment to SMEs, remaining attentive to their  concerns  and  conducting  regular  satisfaction  surveys.  The most recent survey started in December/uni00A02021.

The analysis  reviews  the  major  sources  of  the  Group's  emissions  (energy for  buildings,  IT,  air  travel  and  fleet  of  cars)  and  showed  a  binding pathway for the Group to reduce carbon emissions by 50% (in tonnes of CO2/uni00A0eq.) in the period 2019 to 2030.\n\nThe main levers identified concern:\n\n- energy: use more  renewable  energies and reduce energy p consumption  post-pandemic  in  line  with  new  ways  of  working (remote working, reducing the Group's building footprint);\n- air transport and fleet of cars: travel less and make business travel p greener  (use  cleaner  travel  options,  for  example  by  switching company  cars  to  electric  vehicles,  using  more  efficient  routes or/uni00A0airlines);\n- IT: the Group keeps a very sharp eye on its IT carbon footprint and p has  a  special  programme  in  place  to  reduce  it,  CSR  by  IT  (see  the section  on  the  Responsible  Digital  Charter,  page/uni00A0284  and  on Information Systems and IT infrastructures, page/uni00A0327).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## RESPONSIBLE USE OF RESOURCES 5.4.3.1.2\n\n## Renewable energies\n\nSociete Generale is committed to the energy transition. All the Group's Corporate  Centre  buildings  in  France  have  been  powered  by renewable electricity since 2015, through Guarantees of Origin and the Power  Purchase  Agreement  (PPA)  signed  in  November/uni00A02019  for 27/uni00A0GWh/year, which came into force on 1/uni00A0January 2021 for three years.\n\nIn July/uni00A02021, Societe Generale and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord signed a new PPA to supply  the  Group  with  green  energy  directly  from  a  wind  farm  in France. The two-year contract will cover 20% of the branch network's annual electricity needs as of 2022. The aim is not only to guarantee a fixed tariff for the contract term, but also to provide traceability on the source of the power and to support the development of made-in-France  renewable  energy  by  offering  power  generators  a guaranteed  revenue  over  several  years.  What  is  more,  the  deal  will shrink the French branch network's electricity carbon footprint by 76% - a cut of 874 tonnes of CO2 per year.\n\nSociete Generale and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord also signed their first guarantee of  origin  agreement in 2021 to supply renewable French biomethane gas  to  power  the  545  branches  equipped  with  gas  boilers.  This three-year  contract  will  reduce  the  French  branch  network's  gas carbon footprint by 80% per kWh, which equates to 4,341 fewer tonnes of  CO2  emitted  per  year.  The  agreement  will  support  the  renewable energy sector in France and help to develop the biomethane sector in France and Europe.\n\nALD  Automotive  announced  that  all  of  its  French-based  sites  will  be powered  by  French-sourced  wind  power  from  1/uni00A0January  2021 (guaranteed  by  an  independent  third  party),  under  its  Move 2025/uni00A0strategy to put sustainability at the heart of what it does.\n\nIn  the  international  market,  the  Group's  subsidiaries  are  also  on  a green  trajectory  using  a  range  of  levers,  such  as  better  energy efficiency  in  buildings  and  optimising  their  real  estate  footprint. Several of the Group's international subsidiaries have also embarked on the process of obtaining energy efficiency certificates for some of their  buildings,  such  as  in  Romania,  Germany  and  Luxembourg, something more of our European subsidiaries are doing.\n\nOthers,  located  in  Africa,  generate  their  own  energy  through  solar panels  installed  on  their  buildings  (Ghana  has  been  doing  this  since 2015)  or  by  equipping  their  bank  branches  or  independent  branches (in  Algeria,  Morocco  and  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire)  to  produce  enough  power  to meet all or part of their electricity needs.\n\n## Real estate (optimising the Bank's buildings: surfaces, technologies and accessibility)\n\nMoving  beyond  energy  supply,  Societe  Generale  is  also  intent  on continuing to make its buildings more energy efficient.\n\nFrench regulations (Decree on reducing energy consumption in service sector  buildings,  July/uni00A02019)  require  users  to  reduce  building  energy consumption by 40% by 2030, compared with 2019. The Real Estate Division  has  set  up  an  energy  pilot  programme  to  achieve  this ambitious goal for buildings larger than 1,000/uni00A0sq./uni00A0m.\n\nFor  corporate  centre  buildings  in  the  Paris  region,  carbon  emissions have been cut to 30 gCO2 per kWh.\n\nThe French Networks have set up a system to monitor consumption of utilities at Group sites, installing smart meters for water, electricity and gas  at  the  192  most  energy-intensive  Societe  Generale  sites.  These smart meters provide continuous monitoring and detect any unusually high consumption, which automatically triggers an on-site investigation. In addition, the Group invested in a software program in 2018  that  analyses  the  monthly  consumption  of  all  the  network's branches, enabling them to identify where remedial action is needed.\n\nAs  the  Group  intensifies  its  CSR  efforts,  the  Real  Estate  Division  is working with all sites both in France and abroad to improve building energy efficiency.\n\nThe  Real  Estate  Division's  2021  -2025  programme  to  manage  the changes  to  corporate  buildings  and  workspaces  to  keep  pace  with remote  and  hybrid  forms  of  working  that  emerged  during  the pandemic  illustrates  its  active  embrace  of  Societe  Generale's transformation. The programme seeks to provide answers for BUs/SUs as they grapple with three issues: the need for performance, combined with  the  challenges  of  providing  clients  and  staff  with  a  seamless digital  experience  and  the  changes  to  jobs  and  how  we  work.  The division also works with international entities interested in embarking on similar programmes. Key points include:\n\n- responding to changes in the French Retail Banking business and the p customer  relationship  model,  digitalisation  and  automation  of operations, and reconfiguring the layout of Bank branches;\n- adapting business premises to factor in the needs of the disabled; p\n- using  materials  and  equipment  that  are  compliant  with  the  latest p standards, and eliminating older and less energy-efficient technologies: for example, replacing oil-fired boilers with gas boilers or  high-performance  reversible  air  conditioners  that  emit  less  CO2 and  systematically  installing  low-energy  lighting.  As  part  of  this transformation  programme,  seven  Group  entities  in  Lyon  now occupy approximately 5,000m 2 of office space in the same property complex, chosen partly for its environmental certifications (BREEAM NC 2016: Very Good; HQE B\u00e2timent Durable: Excellent ) - a move that will reduce their CO2 emissions by 50%.\n\nThe  Real  Estate  Division  regularly  works  with  contractors  from  the sheltered employment sector, in particular for facilities management services (removals, cleaning, /uni00A0 etc.).\n\n## Information systems and IT infrastructures\n\nSociete  Generale  has  a  long-standing  commitment  to  responsible digital technology. Since signing the Sustainable IT Charter in 2019, the Group  has  drafted  an  official  policy  with  its  IT  Departments  that focuses  on  nine  key  goals.  This  'CSR  by  IT'  policy  was  rolled  out  in 2020 and 17 working groups formed. Its goals cover the entire life cycle for  IT  systems  and data, from design right through to the end-use of digital services. The Group is working on introducing standards for IT architecture  and  project  management,  defining  KPIs  to  assess  its impacts,  raising  awareness  within  the  IT  Function  and  among  users, reducing electricity consumption, developing green online applications,  reducing  waste  from  digital  services  and  ensuring responsible  use  of  data  and  new  technologies  such  as  artificial intelligence. A sourcing policy and responsible employer commitments round  out  these  measures  (see  also  the  Responsible  IT  Charter, page/uni00A0284).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "SETTING THE EXAMPLE: AN EXEMPLARY FINANCIAL COMPANY\n\nIn  addition,  the  IT  Departments  in  France  have  initiated  their  own campaigns:\n\n- designing a calculator to measure the carbon footprint of the Group's p IT system;\n- migrating legacy datacenters to new-generation, more p energy-efficient datacenters in France and in international locations;\n- gradually introducing green energy to power its IT infrastructures; p\n- reducing digital waste through two complementary partnerships: p\n- giving  a  second  lease  of  life  to  IT  equipment  for  which  the 1. Bank no longer has any use. In France, end-of-life equipment is sent to Recyclea in the supported  and  sheltered employment sector, under a 2019 agreement. Where possible, equipment  is  reconditioned  for  resale  to  other  companies within France and throughout Europe. Any items that cannot be reconditioned are sent for recycling in France,\n- purchasing  reconditioned  devices.  In  2019,  Societe  Generale 2. partnered with a French SME to offer its employees telephones reconditioned in France;\n- promoting  recruitment  of  people  with  disabilities  through  two p parallel initiatives:\n- integrating and supporting employees with disabilities, with 1. assistance from Mission Handicap ,\n- sourcing  from  businesses  in  the  supported  and  sheltered 2. employment  sector.  The  Group's  principal  IT  Departments set themselves targets in 2018 with a view to increasing the proportion  of  IT  services  sourced  from  the  supported  and sheltered employment sector,\n- making the Group's digital services accessible. 3.\n\nThe  priority  in  2021  was  on  developing  modules  and  formats specifically  dealing  with  responsible  digital  technology  to  raise awareness and train IT function staff.\n\n## Travel\n\nFrench  Retail  Banking  launched  Mobility  Transition  in  2020,  an initiative to green its fleet of cars, which accounts for 60% of Societe Generale's entire fleet. It has three aims:\n\n- comply  with  new  government  regulations  designed  to  push p carmakers into producing greener cars. One of the main pieces of legislation is the Mobility Law (1) (LOM);\n- fit  in  with the overall CSR strategy to shrink the Group's impact on p the environment;\n- optimise costs. p\n\nThree  engine  types  were  chosen  after  studying  the  data  -  electric, hybrid and petrol. The type of vehicle depends on need (distance and usage analysis) and priorities. Lease terms have been extended from 48 to 60/uni00A0months. Under these new rules, the Group ordered 47 electric cars in December/uni00A02021. From a financial perspective, reducing the fleet and  switching  to  greener  vehicles  will  save  Retail  Banking's  vehicle budget around 9% in operating expenses over the period 2021-2022.\n\nWith more electric vehicles comes the need for more charging points. Retail  Banking  is  in  the  process  of  a  call  for  tenders  for  large-scale installation of charging points at its branches in France. Optimisation of the fleet should be complete by 2023 with all diesel engines phased out.\n\nIn another pilot to encourage cycling, French Retail Banking installed a shared  electric  bike  station  (only  in  Marseilles  for  now),  using  a solution offered by ALD Automotive and its partner GREEN ON.\n\n## Remote working\n\nA growing number of Group entities are trialling remote working, with more  than  77,671  individuals  worldwide  working  from  home  under normal circumstances (compared to 54,730 in 2020) - an increase of 42% on 2020.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                | 2019      | 2020      | 2021       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Energy consumption                                                                                                                                             |           |           |            |\n| 2025 target: reduce consumption by 35% compared with 2014                                                                                                      | -19%      | -30%      | -32%       |\n| Total energy consumption  (MWh)                                                                                                                                | 687,590   | 589,750   | 580,777    |\n| Total electricity  (mWh)                                                                                                                                       | 512,122   | 441,984   | 421,823    |\n| Share of green energy in Group electricity consumption  (%)                                                                                                    | 48.9      | 50.5      | 52         |\n| Real Estate                                                                                                                                                    |           |           |            |\n| Group real estate  (m 2 )                                                                                                                                      | 4,000,000 | 3,250,000 | 3,170,788  |\n| Corporate centre buildings ISO/uni00A050001 certified (number)                                                                                                 | 22        | 22        | 21         |\n| Mobility                                                                                                                                                       |           |           |            |\n| Km travelled by all employees                                                                                                                                  | 423       | 272       | 201        |\n| Raising awareness on responsible use of digital services                                                                                                       |           |           |            |\n| No. of employees who took the Responsible Digital MOOC (short version  developed in 2020 by the Institut du Num\u00e9rique Responsable (INR), a French  think tank) | N/A       | N/A       | 10,900 (2) |\n\n|",

In  line  with  this  commitment,  the  Group  entered  into  a partnership  with  another  non-profit, Le  Cha\u00eenon  manquant *,  for  the collection of leftover food from its cafeterias at La D\u00e9fense. In 2021, Le Cha\u00eenon manquant collected over 534/uni00A0kg of food ( vs. 2,000/uni00A0kg  in  2020) and used it to distribute 1,068 meals (4,000 in 2020). In the majority of cafeterias,  the  remaining  waste  is  then  sorted  and  methanised.  The Group also works with a third  non-profit, Phenix *,  to  cut  food  waste and raise awareness about more responsible practices. Phenix collects food  left  over  from  the  Group's  big  corporate  events,  which  it  then gives to local charities. In addition, three more cafeterias at La D\u00e9fense and  Val-de-Fontenay  followed  the  Societe  Generale  cafeteria's  lead and signed up for the Too Good To Go app in 2021. Employees can use the app to buy reduced-price salads and sandwiches left over after the lunch rush. 897 meal baskets were sold in 2021 under this partnership.\n\nIn  France,  the  requirement  to  sort  bio-waste  at  source  has  been brought  forward  to  31/uni00A0December  2023  under  new  legislation.  But, without  waiting  for  this  deadline,  the  Group  has  already  acted  to introduce measure to process and reuse bio-waste. Since September/uni00A02020, all leftovers from the Group's cafeterias at La D\u00e9fense have been composted by Les Alchimistes (1) (specialist in the collection and composting of organic waste). It produced 18/uni00A0kg of compost from 100/uni00A0kg  of  food  waste.  Located  close  to  collection sites (no more than 10 and 15/uni00A0km away), Les Alchimistes ' teams collect the waste from the Group's canteens in electric vehicles./uni00A0Last year, it collected 50 tonnes of waste and generated 9 tonnes of compost.\n\n## Paper\n\nSociete Generale  has  reduced  paper  consumption  (the  main consumable used by service activities) by a range of measures in place across  the  Group,  including  good  printing  practices,  moves  towards digital rather than paper resources, and using recycled paper.\n\nA  Societe  Generale  representative  sits  on  the  Board  of  Directors  of CITEO,  a  not-for-profit  company  formed  from  the  merger  between Eco-emballages and Ecofolio that promotes the circular economy.\n\nSociete Generale is increasingly digitising its product offering to make its  services  greener,  more  practical  and  more  economical.  French Retail  Banking  customers  with  life  insurance  or  individual  personal protection  policies  now  have  the  option  to  go  paperless  and  receive secure  online  statements  and  due  date  notices  on  their  website  for private customers. To get the paperless system up and running Retail Banking  offered  customers  the  option  of  digital  statements  and documents. 43% of life insurance and individual personal protection policyholders said yes. Groupe Cr\u00e9dit du Nord introduced paperless for its  customers  in  December/uni00A02019.  It  is  estimated  that  the  move  could amount  to  savings  of  more  than  2/uni00A0million  letters  to  French  Retail Banking and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord customers every year.\n\nIn another innovation for its customers, Societe Generale launched its first  debit  card  made  from  recycled  materials  in  2021.  French  Retail Banking features the Smurfs for the card, echoing the United Nations' Small  Smurfs  Big  Goals  Campaign  (to  call  attention  to  the  17 Sustainable Development Goals). (2)\n\nThese exclusive new Visa Evolution, Visa and Visa Premier cards in the Planet Smurfs Collection are made from 85.5% recycled materials and offered to individual customers. (They use recycled PVC so there is no extra cost involved).\n\nThis  new  manufacturing  process  could  be  extended  to  all  Societe Generale  cards.  The  Group's  new  services  reflect  its  commitment  to protecting the environment and these recycled PVC cards are part of a responsible approach to managing bank cards:\n\n- made in France according to the strictest standards; p\n- limited quantities to avoid overproduction; p\n- eliminating  a  lot  of  correspondence,  using  recycled  paper  and p developing online services;\n- waste  collection,  recycling  and  recovery  system  with  certified p partners.\n\n## Waste management\n\nThe  Group  strives  to  minimise  the  direct  impact  of  its  waste  on  the environment through recycling. Selective sorting in five streams (paper and  cardboard,  metal,  plastic,  glass  and  wood)  is  widespread  in  all Societe Generale branches and central buildings.\n\nTo encourage employees to sort their waste, individual waste bins are no longer provided in the new flexible workspaces in Corporate Centre buildings. Recycling sorted by category in 'print corners', kitchens and cafeterias  are  essential  to  improving  waste  management  in  these buildings. On top of this, waste is further sorted before disposal where possible,  resulting  in  an  additional  20%  improvement  in  sorting  of ordinary industrial waste (OIW).\n\nAll  the  waste  sorted  in  Corporate  Centre  buildings  in  2021  was recycled,  including  paper  (newspapers,  sheets  of  paper,  ads,  boxes), plastic  bottles,  paper  cups,  cans,  glass,  wood,  bulky  equipment  and furniture  items,  and,  since  September/uni00A02020,  bio-waste  from  the cafeterias in Tours Societe Generale at La D\u00e9fense.\n\nFor the most part, non-recycled waste (which includes surgical masks under  government  recommendations)  is  converted  to  energy  in incinerators for use in urban heating.\n\nThe Group is also spreading the word amongst employees about the importance of steering clear of plastics and using recyclable materials. In November/uni00A02021 it committed to banning single-use plastics from the workplace by 2025, and earlier if possible, depending on location.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This methodology is also explained in detail in the Group's reporting protocols, available on request.\n\n## REPORTING PROTOCOLS 5.5.1\n\nInformation included in the Universal Registration Document (URD),/uni00A0the Responsibility section of the Group's website (www.societegenerale.com/en) and other Societe Generale communications, as well as the Group's Integrated Report in respect of financial year 2021 and previous years, has been prepared on the basis of contributions from the Group's internal network of CSR officers and in  accordance  with  the  CSR  reporting  protocols  and  CSR  initiatives programme. Part of the quantitative and qualitative data was provided by  the  Planethic  Reporting  tool,  used  to  standardise  collection  of information on management and monitoring indicators. Reporting is coordinated  by  the  Group's  CSR  Department,  which  reported  to  the Group Corporate Secretary at 31 December 2021.\n\n## DATA COLLECTION 5.5.2\n\nThe  following  data  collection  methods  were  used  for  the  reporting scope:\n\n- for  social,  environmental  and  business  data,  the  bulk  of  the p quantitative indicators are collected by each Group entity using the Planethic  Reporting  tool.  Data  collectors  enter  their  subsidiary's data,  which  are  approved  by  validators  who  perform  post-input checks, then by administrators who check and validate the data at\n- the  Group's  Sustainable  Development  Department  collects  other p data directly from the CSR officers for each core business or from the relevant  division  (Sourcing  Division,  Risk  Department,  Human Resources Department).\n\n## REPORTING PERIODS 5.5.3\n\n## Social, procurement, sponsorship and business data\n\nQuantitative  indicators  are  calculated  for  the  period  running  from 1/uni00A0January  2021  to  31/uni00A0December  2021  (12/uni00A0months),  with  data  taken  as at 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\n## CSR CONSOLIDATION SCOPE 5.5.4\n\nThe entities included in the reporting scope satisfy at least one of the following criteria:\n\n- entity in which the parent company, Societe Generale/uni00A0SA (SGSA), 1. directly or indirectly holds a controlling interest of over 50%. By definition,  all  branches  are  wholly-owned,  since  there  are  no shareholders;\n\n## Environmental data\n\nQuantitative  indicators  are  calculated  for  the  period  running  from 1/uni00A0October 2020 to 30/uni00A0September 2021 (12/uni00A0months), with data taken as at 30/uni00A0September 2021.\n\n- entities in which SGSA holds a controlling interest of at least 20% 2. but less than 50% and over which SGPM has significant influence as  regards  management  and  financial  policy;  in  particular, entities whose management team has been appointed by Societe Generale  and  whose  activity  is  regularly  monitored  by  the Group's core businesses.\n\nThe  CSR  consolidation  scope  included  154  companies  within  the Group's financial consolidation scope at 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\nThe Group regularly organises programmes to bring contributors and managers  on  board  and  familiarise  them  with  the  reporting  process and the tool, with a view to improving data reliability. The reporting protocols are updated on a regular basis. New protocols were drawn up  in  2021  and  include  indicators  designed  to  offer  a  more  precise assessment  of  the  extra-financial  risk  factors  identified  as  being  the most material to Societe Generale.\n\n- core  business  level  and  lastly  by  cross-functional  administrators (Sustainable  Development  Department)  at  Group  level,  who  carry out the final checks prior to consolidation;\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## INDICATORS 5.5.5\n\nAn information campaign aimed at all contributors is rolled out at the start  of  the  data  collection  period,  providing  the  data  collection schedule,  a  Group  guideline  and  a  protocol  for  each  category  of indicators. The protocols serve as a reminder of indicator definitions and application criteria.\n\ndeclaration of extra-financial performance  (Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-102-1, R./uni00A0225-105 and R./uni00A0225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code), as well as in light of the Group's CSR strategy and the decision to align as closely as possible with the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) core option.\n\nThe 2021 indicators were selected with a view to satisfying the legal and  regulatory  requirement  for  the  Group  to  present  a  consolidated\n\nFor  the  most  part,  these  indicators  cover  a  global  scope.  When  not global, the scope is specified in parentheses or in this Methodology Note.\n\n## SCOPE AND RULES FOR CALCULATING EMPLOYMENT-RELATED 5.5.6 INDICATORS\n\nThe  workforce  taken  into  account  for  all  employment-related indicators (unless explicitly stated otherwise) corresponds to the total number  of  employees  on  either  permanent  or  fixed-term  contracts (including  work-study  contracts),  regardless  of  whether  they  are present or on leave.\n\nThe frequency rate of occupational accidents is the ratio of the number of  workplace  accidents  (as  defined  by  local  regulations)  to  the  total number of hours worked (workforce present on either permanent or fixed-term  contracts  multiplied  by  the  number  of  annual  working hours in the entity) multiplied by 1,000,000.\n\nThe  absenteeism  rate  is  the  ratio  of  the  total  number  of  paid  days' leave  (sick  leave,  parental  leave  or  other  types  of  leave,  such  as  for bereavement,  moving  house,  getting  married,  looking  after  a  sick child, as well as any unjustified absence * ) to the total number of days paid,  expressed  as  a  percentage.  It  is  counted  in  calendar  days  and calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  total  headcount  (workforce  present multiplied by 365).\n\nData  were  collected  on  131,293/uni00A0employees.  Societe  Generale  therefore estimates the coverage - i.e. where at least the data on occupants and surface area were provided - to be approximately 100% of the workforce.\n\n## SCOPE AND MAIN MANAGEMENT RULES FOR PROPRIETARY 5.5.7 ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATORS\n\nThe  scope  corresponds  to  the  CSR  consolidation  scope  as  defined above. Coverage of the total data collection scope corresponds to the ratio  of  the  headcount  of  all  entities  that  participated  in  the  data collection campaign to the total Societe Generale headcount. Data were\n\ncollected  on  131,293  employees.  Societe  Generale  therefore  estimates the coverage i.e. where at least the data on occupants and surface area were provided - to be approximately 100% of the workforce.\n\n## RESTATEMENT OF HISTORICAL DATA 5.5.8\n\nIn  the  interests  of  transparency  and  comparability  of  data,  the emissions  for  the  reference  years  and  for  2019-2021  are  given  in  the table of quantitative data published on the Group's corporate website.\n\nReported data for previous financial years do not correspond to data adjusted for changes in scope.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL DATA: GENERAL RULES 5.5.9\n\nEnvironmental  data  are  calculated  on  the  basis  of  invoices,  direct readings,  information  received  from  suppliers  and  estimates.  The reported data is managed by means of the following checks and ratios:\n\n- any variations in environmental indicators compared to the previous p year  are  flagged  and  contributors  receive  alerts  asking  them  to check the data recorded if the variation exceeds 30%;\n- data collected on energy, office paper and transport are expressed p in relation to the number of occupants declared by the entity;\n- energy consumption (electricity, steam, chilled water, oil, gas) is also p expressed in relation to the surface area (per m 2 );\n- Unjustified absence =/uni00A0when an employee misses work but their line manager agrees, exceptionally, not to dock their pay. *",

The Sustainable  Development  Department  centralises  the  reporting  of transport  and  paper  consumption  data  for  France  based  on  data from the Sourcing Division.\n\nThe number of occupants covered corresponds to the average number of  Societe  Generale  employees  or  subcontractors  working  on-site during the reporting period, as at 30/uni00A0September 2021.\n\nCoverage of the data collection scope for each indicator corresponds to the ratio of the headcount of all entities that provided data for the indicator  in  question  to  the  total  Societe  Generale  headcount  at 30/uni00A0September 2021.\n\n## Methodology changes.\n\nIn 2021, the Societe Generale Group decided to review its methodology for calculating its carbon footprint in connection with car travel:\n\n- until 2020, the Group had calculated the resulting emissions based p on the distance travelled, multiplied by an emissions factor for each country  defined  according  to  manufacturer's  data  on  g/km  of  CO2 emitted;\n- this changed in 2021 and the calculation is now, wherever possible, p based  on  the  actual  fuel  consumption  (in  litres),  multiplied  by  a single emissions factor for the specific type of fuel used (as provided by  ADEME*).  If  the  data  needed  to  perform  this  calculation  is  not available,  then  the  previous  method  (distance  travelled  multiplied by  an  emissions  factor  for  each  country  defined  according  to manufacturer's  data  on  g/km  of  CO2  emitted)  is  used  and  an uplift/uni00A0applied.\n\n|                                                       | Unit of measure   | Jan-Dec 2019   | Jan-Dec 2019          | Jan-Dec 2020   | Jan-Dec 2020          | Jan-Dec 2021          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                       |                   |                | New method Car travel |                | New method Car travel | New method Car travel |\n| CARB19C: CO2 emissions due to business  travel by car | tCO2e             | 24,865         | 17,320                | 22,465         | 22,158                | 23,435                |\n\n## CALCULATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 5.5.10\n\nCalculation  of  the  Group's  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  breaks down into three categories:\n\n- Scope/uni00A01 covers direct emissions related to energy consumption and p fugitive emissions of fluorinated gases;\n- Scope/uni00A03  covers  GHG  emissions  from  all  office  paper  consumption, p business travel, transport of goods, waste, and energy consumption of French data centres.\n\nCO2 emissions are calculated according to the GHG Protocol.\n\n- Scope/uni00A02  covers  indirect  emissions  related  to  energy  consumption p (external electricity, steam and chilled water);\n\n## MAIN MANAGEMENT RULES FOR SPIF AND SPI INDICATORS 5.5.11\n\nIn  order  to  support  clients  in  their  sustainable  transformation initiatives,  the  Group  has  devised  two  measurement  standards  to follow up action plans:\n\n- Sustainable  and  Positive  Impact  Finance  (SPIF)  to  monitor  credit p and/or  leasing  activities,  and/or  to  help  customers  develop  their positive impact activities;\n- Sustainable  and  Positive  Investment  (SPI)  for  wealth  and  asset p management activities, including the structuring of products aimed at both institutional and individual investors.\n\n## Scope 5.5.11.1\n\nReporting of SPIF and SPI indicators began in 2018 and was broadened in 2019, 2020 and 2021 with the aim of gradually including as many of the  Group's  businesses  and  regions  as  possible.  The  following\n\nmethodology choices ensure consistency and reliability when filtering reporting results:\n\n- annual production in loan volumes recorded in the Group's balance p sheet  or  off-balance  sheet, i.e. the  SPIF  indicator  is  based  on  the proportion borne by Societe Generale upon closing;\n- annual production in investment products sold to clients; p\n- outstanding  managed  overall  according  to  SPI  criteria  by  Group p entities;\n- advisory activities, client services and/or hedging rates or exchange p rates  on  SPIF  and/or  structured  transactions  with  ESG  indicators, designed  to  promote  a  sustainable  and  inclusive  transition  within the Societe Generale ecosystem, detailed separately from SPIF/SPI volumes ( e.g. bond issuance mandates, custodian services, nominal hedging operations, /uni00A0 etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable and Positive Impact 5.5.11.2 Finance (SPIF)\n\n## ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK 5.5.11.2.1\n\nThe  SPIF  framework  is  based  on  the  UN's  Sustainable  Development Goals (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainabledevelopment-goals/) ,  but  there  are  no  specific  impact  measurements imposed for each SDG.\n\nVarious filters are used to ensure stringent selection of SPIF activities as regards:\n\n- compliance  with  the  three  pillars  of  sustainable  development 1. (economic, environmental and social):\n- financing of a dedicated project satisfying social and/or green -guidelines, or financing of counterparties who primarily pursue activities  contributing  to  the  environmental  transition  and/or management  of  the  common  good  (such  activities  must represent more than 50% of their overall business) and inspired notably by the SDGs,\n- an E&S  risk approach  which,  in  accordance  with  the -commitment  given  in  the  Group's  Duty  of  Care  Plan  (see page/uni00A0346), complies with the environmental, social and human rights risk mapping conducted. This internal mapping serves to ensure  that  any  financing  with  major  negative  externalities  is excluded  from  SPIF-labelled  commitments  and  that  the  Bank adheres  to  its  ESRM  obligations  resulting  from  regulations  or volunatry commitments made by the Group,\n- a financial analysis that takes into account the sustainability of -the  counterparty's  operations  by  monitoring  internal  rules  of engagement;\n- external  guidelines:  work  on  the  green  taxonomy  by  the 2. European  Commission's  high-level  expert  group  (HLEG),  which will  continue  to  be  fed  into  the  Bank's  analysis  process,  as  will the frameworks defined by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and  the  UNEP-FI.  NB:  as  a  co-founding  partner  of  the  Positive Impact  Finance  Initiative  coordinated  by  the  UNEP-FI,  Societe Generale has developed an analysis of this methodology, which it uses  for  dedicated  transactions  in  the  global  banking  segment (Global Banking and Investor Solutions). On that score, the scope of  activities  used  in  the  methodology  was  broadened  in  2021. Following  the  publication  of  the  EU  green  taxonomy,  the  SPIF framework  was  widened  to  include  taxonomy-eligible  activities which were previously out of scope. In addition, on back of the introduction  of  legislation  on  the  energy  consumption  of  new buildings  in  France  (\"RE2020\"),  financing  activities  for  new housing  in  mainland  France  were  also  added  to  the  SPIF framework. Information on the resulting increase in SPIF volumes is  detailed  in  footnote  (2)  under  the  Main  Key  Figures  table  on page 295.\n\n## EXCLUDED ACTIVITIES 5.5.11.2.2\n\nThe  guidelines  on  social  commitments  and  contributions  to  the common  good  are  not  exhaustive.  On  health,  for  example,  the guidelines used are limited to the financing of hospitals/care facilities, retirement  homes  and  medical  equipment  (mainly  radiology  and imaging). Similarly, the Bank's commitment to job creation is only with reference  to  programmes  co-financed  with  multilateral  partners  or pursued within a very specific positive-impact framework.\n\nSPIF  is  a  far  more  restrictive  concept  than  that  of  financing  the  real economy.\n\n## Sustainable and Positive 5.5.11.3 Investment (SPI)\n\n## ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK\n\nTo be considered SPI-compliant, investment products must meet one of the following criteria:\n\n- structured products put together with an ESG selection (positive 1. impact  and/or  exclusion)  that  filters  out  at  least  20%  of  the eligible investment universe;\n- investment  products  involving  Articles  8  and  9  of  the  SFDR* 2. regulation;\n- investment  solutions  for  which  Societe  Generale  commits  to 3. holding  on  its  balance  sheet  an  equivalent  value  in  Positive Impact  Finance  assets  or  loans  to  counterparties  with  a  high rating based on the ESG Research team's criteria (see structured notes or cash investment products for corporates);\n- products  with  a  'solidarity'  or  'sharing'  component,  involving 4. return-sharing  or  a  donation,  or  risk-taking  on  the  amount invested, of more than 20%.\n\nNB: these guidelines have been developed by the Asset Management, Private  Banking  and  Markets  teams  and  by  Societe  Generale Assurances.  They  have  been  prepared  with  reference  to  existing market guidelines.\n\nThe  advisory,  proxy  voting  and  ESG  reporting  services  offered  by Societe Generale Securities Services are mentioned but not included in SPI production.\n\n## PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND QUALITATIVE DATA 5.5.12 TO IMPLEMENT THE EU TAXONOMY REGULATION\n\nUnder the EU's Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), transposed into French law through the Declaration of Extra-Financial Performance (DEFP) ,  credit institutions are required to  report  annually  on  the  alignment  of  their  activities  with  the  EU Taxonomy,  based  on  the  scope  of  their  prudential  consolidation.\n\nAlthough these reporting requirements will not fully enter into effect until 2024, credit institutions must report on certain indicators from Q4 2021. This includes, in particular, disclosing the proportion of Taxonomy-eligible  financing  in  their  portfolios. The  following diagram details the regulatory reporting requirements for Q4 2021.\n\n|",

The difference between the  balance  sheet  used  to  produce  quantitative  data  required  under the Taxonomy Regulation and the prudential balance sheet lies in the different  treatment  of  provisions  for  the  various  assets,  which  are included  in  the  prudential  balance  sheet  but  excluded  when calculating the Taxonomy Regulation metrics. In accordance with the European  Commission's  FAQs,  the  Group  has  not  used  proxies  to identify  eligible  assets.  It  has  taken  a  conservative  approach:  in  the event of any doubt as to a counterparty's eligibility, due to insufficient data,  the  Group  considered  it  non-eligible.  NFRD  eligibility  was assessed  at  the  level  of  both  the  counterparty  itself  and  its  parent company,  based  on  the  following  criteria:  (1)  EU  residency,  and  (2) headcount in excess of 500 at the reporting date, in addition to which the European Commission's FAQs rule out using the main activity ( i.e. the  NACE  code)  as  an  eligibility  criterion,  making  virtually  all  of  the Group's corporate exposures are automatically non-eligible.\n\nThe FAQs also stated that loans to local government authorities were deemed to be non-eligible this year owing to their not being subject to the  Taxonomy  Regulation,  which  was  confirmed  by  the  French  Tax Administration,  making  the  use  of  data  from  these  public  entities impossible. Car loans will only become eligible as from 1/uni00A0January 2022 and  thus  were  deemed  non-eligible  at  31/uni00A0December  2021.  Home improvement  loans  were  deemed  non-eligible  as  they  could  not  be separately identified on the balance sheet, typically being included as part of the overall financing for the property.\n\nMortgage loans secured by a guarantee (such as the Cr\u00e9dit Logement guarantee,  for  example)  were,  however,  considered  eligible  and accounted for most of the Group's Taxonomy-eligible assets.\n\nThe  following  chart  sets  out  the  decision-making  process  used  to determine eligibility for the various FINREP balance sheet items, with a view to producing the performance indicators presented on page/uni00A0296.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the General Assembly,\n\nIn our quality as an independent third party, accredited by the COFRAC under the number n\u00b0/uni00A03-1681  (scope  of  accreditation  available  on  the website www.cofrac.fr), and as a member of the network of one of the statutory auditors of your company (hereafter 'entity'), we conducted our work in order to provide a conclusion expressing a limited level of assurance  on  the  compliance  of  the  consolidated  non-financial statement for the year ended 31st/uni00A0December 2021 (hereafter referred to as the 'Statement') with the provisions of Article/uni00A0R./uni00A0225-105 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )  and  on  the  fairness  of the historical information  (whether  observed  or  extrapolated) provided  pursuant  to  3\u00b0  of/uni00A0I  and/uni00A0II  of  Article/uni00A0R./uni00A0225-105  of  the  French Commercial Code (hereafter referred to as the 'Information') prepared in accordance with the entity's procedures (hereafter referred to as the 'Guidelines'),  included  in  the  management  report  pursuant  to  the requirements  of  articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0225  102-1,  R./uni00A0225-105  and  R./uni00A0225-105-1  of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased  on  the  procedures  performed,  as  described  in  'Nature  and scope of the work', and on the elements we have collected, we did not identify any material misstatements that would call into question the fact that the consolidated non-financial statement is not presented in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements and that the Information,  taken  as  a  whole,  is  not  presented  fairly  in  accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n## Comments\n\nWithout modifying our conclusion and in accordance with article/uni00A0A./uni00A0225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we have the following comments:\n\nThe  management  of  the  E&S  risks  is  implemented  in  the  different Business  Units,  but  the  controls,  and  notably  second-level  controls, must be reinforced  and  systematized  in  order  to  ensure  an  effective and homogeneous implementation across the Group.\n\n## Preparation of the non-financial performance statement\n\nThe absence of a generally accepted and commonly used framework or  established  practices  on  which  to  base  the  assessment  and measurement  of  information  allows  for  the  use  of  different,  but acceptable,  measurement  techniques  that  may  affect  comparability between entities and over time.\n\nTherefore,  the  Information  should  be  read  and  understood  with reference  to  the  Guidelines,  the  significant  elements  of  which  are presented in the Statement.\n\n## Limitations inherent in the preparation of the Information\n\nThe information may be subject to uncertainty inherent in the state of scientific  or  economic  knowledge  and  the  quality  of  external  data used. Certain information is sensitive to the methodological choices, assumptions and/or estimates made in preparing it and presented in the Statement.\n\n## The entity's responsibility\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to:\n\n- select  or  establish  appropriate  criteria  for  the  preparation  of  the p Information;\n- prepare  a  Statement  in  accordance  with  legal  and  regulatory p requirements,  including  a  presentation  of  the  business  model,  a description  of  the  main  non-financial  risks,  a  presentation  of  the policies  applied  with  regard  to  these  risks  as  well  as  the  results  of these policies, including key performance indicators and, in addition, the  information  required  by  Article/uni00A08  of  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852 (green taxonomy); and to\n- implement  the  internal  control  procedures  it  deems  necessary  to p ensure  that  the  Information  is  free  from  material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe  Statement  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  entity's procedures, the main elements of which are presented in the Statement.\n\n## Responsibility of the independent third party\n\nOn  the  basis  of  our  work,  our  responsibility  is  to  provide  a  report expressing a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- the  compliance  of  the  Statement  with  the  requirements  of p article/uni00A0R./uni00A0225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- the  fairness  of  the  information  provided  in  accordance  with p article/uni00A0R./uni00A0225 105/uni00A0I, 3\u00b0 and/uni00A0II of the French Commercial Code, i.e., the outcomes, including key performance indicators, and the measures implemented considering the principal risks.\n\nAs  it  is  our  responsibility  to  form  an  independent  conclusion  on  the Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved  in  the  preparation  of  the  Information,  as  this  could compromise our independence.\n\nHowever, it is not our responsibility to comment on:\n\n- the  entity's  compliance  with  other  applicable  legal  and  regulatory p requirements, in particular the information required by Article/uni00A08 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (green taxonomy), the French duty of care law and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation;\n- the  fairness  of  the  information  required  by  Article/uni00A08  of  Regulation p (EU) 2020/852 (green taxonomy);\n- the  compliance  of  products  and  services  with  the  applicable p regulations.\n\n## Regulatory provisions and applicable professional standards\n\nThe  work  described  below  was  performed  in  accordance  with  the provisions of articles/uni00A0A./uni00A0225-1  et  seq.  of  the  French  Commercial Code, as  well  as  with  the  professional  guidance  of  the  French  Institute  of Statutory Auditors ('CNCC') applicable to such engagements and with ISAE 3000 (revised) (1) .",

This  law  requires  the  Group  to  prepare  and  implement  a duty  of  care  plan  to  identify  risks  and  prevent  serious  breaches  of human rights, fundamental freedoms, or damage to the health, safety and security of persons and the environment as a result of its activities. The plan must include risk mapping, measures to assess and mitigate the risk of serious breaches and monitoring of their implementation, as well as a whistleblowing system. This document sets out a summary of the main aspects of the Duty of Care Plan and includes the report on its effective implementation.\n\nOver  the  years,  the  Societe  Generale  Group  has  voluntarily  adopted procedures and tools to identify, assess and manage risks related to human  rights,  fundamental  freedoms,  health  and  safety  and  the environment as part of how it manages its Human Resources, supply chain and businesses. Over the past four years, implementation of this regulatory  obligation  has  provided  Societe  Generale  with  the opportunity to clarify and strengthen its existing framework as part of a continuous improvement process.\n\n## Scope of application\n\nThe  Group's  approach  to  its  duty  of  care  is  based  on  the  common foundation  of  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  as  well  as environmental  issues.  The  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedom issues  identified  based  on  reference  texts  such  as  the  Universal Declaration  of  Human  Rights  (1948)  and  the  International  Labour Organization's  fundamental  conventions  are:  forced  labour  and slavery;  child  labour;  respect  for  the  rights  of  indigenous  peoples; rights of ownership; discrimination; freedom of association; health and safety; decent  workings  conditions;  decent  pay;  decent  social protection  and  the  right  to  privacy.  Environmental  issues  identified based on The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development (1992) are:  climate  change  and  air  quality;  preservation  of  water  resources and  their  quality;  responsible  land  use;  preservation  of  natural resources; preservation of biodiversity and minimisation and treatment of waste.\n\nThis  Duty  of  Care  plan  is  being  rolled  out  across  all  consolidated companies over which Societe Generale exercises exclusive  control (1) (hereinafter the ' Group '). It is structured around three pillars:\n\n- the Human Resources, Safety and Security pillar, which aims to p prevent  the  risk  of  serious  violations  in  respect  of  human  rights, fundamental  freedoms  or  the  health  of  Societe  Generale  Group employees;\n- the  Sourcing  pillar, which  aims  to  manage  the  risk  of  serious p violations in respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms, health, safety  and  security  and  the  environment  associated  with  the activities of the Group's  suppliers  and  direct (2) ( i.e. level/uni00A01) subcontractors;\n- the  Activities  pillar, which  aims  to  prevent  the  risk  of  serious p violations in respect of human rights, fundamental freedoms, health, safety and security and the environment that are directly associated with the Group's products and services.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe  Duty  of  Care  Plan  was  drawn  up  by  the  Corporate  Social Responsibility  Department,  the  Compliance  Division,  the  Human Resources Department and the Sourcing Division, in association with the Legal Department and the Group Security Division.\n\nThe Plan and progress with implementing its measures are presented to General Management every year.\n\nIt is also included in the Management Report prepared by the Board of Directors and published in the Universal Registration Document.\n\nRoll-out  is  coordinated  by  the  Corporate  Social  Responsibility Department, the Human Resources Department, the Sourcing Division and the Compliance Division. The Business Units and Service Units are responsible for implementing the plan within their scope.\n\nThe Duty of Care Plan was devised in accordance with the principle of continuous improvement. How it evolves over time reflects the results of the risk mapping, regular assessments, developments in the Group's activities,  new  E&S  commitments,  and  updates  to  the  E&S  risk management policies and tools.\n\n- These are subsidiaries controlled directly or indirectly by Societe Generale, pursuant to Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0233-16-II of the French Commercial Code.

        "page_content": "## IDENTIFYING AND PRIORITISING E&S RISKS: MAPPING INHERENT 5.7.2 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RISKS\n\nA  number  of  years  ago,  Societe  Generale  first  began  identifying  the risks  of  breaches  of  human  rights,  fundamental  freedoms,  health, safety  and  security  and  the  environment  that  are  inherent  it  its activities  (referred  to  as inherent  E&S  risks ). This  identification process,  which  served  as  the  basis  for  the  Group's  existing  E&S  risk management tools  and  procedures,  was  completed  by  mapping  the inherent E&S risks (1) for each of the three pillars.\n\nThese risks were assessed and then ranked based on both sector and geographic data. The assessments used information from recognised external databases (2) as well as internal experts.\n\n## Human resources, safety and security pillar\n\nThe Societe Generale Group operates in 64/uni00A0countries and the Human Resources Department sees the local context as critical in the analysis of  intrinsic  risks  and  the  policies  and  measures  implemented  to prevent  them.  The  Group  assesses  exposure  to  risks  of  serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, together with employee health and safety, in all its host countries to identify where and  how  operations  are  at  risk  and  gain  deeper  insights  into local/uni00A0issues.\n\nMapping of  inherent  E&S  risks  for  the  Human  Resources,  Safety  and Security  pillar  was  updated  in  2021  using  an  external  base (3) of indicators  detailing  the  risk  levels  specific  to  the  country  and  to financial sector activities.\n\nFor  each  subject  area  assessed,  the  following  results  present  the proportion  of  Societe  Generale's  workforce  operating  in  countries considered to have a high, medium-high and moderate inherent risk. The remaining employees are thus located in low-risk countries.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n| Risk exposure                                           | Moderate               | Average               | High   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------|\n| Freedom of association and collective bargaining rights | 4.6% of the workforce  | None                  | None   |\n| Discrimination                                          | 29.5% of the workforce | 1% of the workforce   | None   |\n| Health and safety (1)                                   | 27.4% of the workforce | None                  | None   |\n| Working conditions (2)                                  | 34.7% of the workforce | 0.3% of the workforce | None   |\n\n- The figures presented here do not take Covid-19 health risks into account. They are not included in the data used. Employees are exposed to Covid-19 health risks in (1) all the Group's countries of operation, and the Group has put measures in place to contain these risks in the workplace.\n- Covers forced labour and modern slavery, child labour, decent working hours and decent wages. (2)\n\nWith  regard  to  freedom  of  association  and  collective  bargaining, Societe Generale's countries of operation with a moderate risk for the banking sector are as follows: Algeria, Cameroon, China, Congo, United Arab Emirates, United States of America, Equatorial Guinea, Madagascar, Mexico, Turkey and Ukraine.\n\nFollowing on from the global agreement on fundamental rights signed with UNI Global Union, and for the first time this year, Societe Generale dived  deeper  into  the  data  for  additional  analytics,  using  the  ITUC Index developed by the International Trade Union Confederation.\n\nAccording to this index, which covers all sectors, the Group's workforce is  spread  as:  56.8%  in  countries  to  be  low  to  medium  risk,  18.3%  in medium-high risk countries and 22.5% in high-risk countries.\n\nThe differences found between the results based on the ITUC and the Verisk  Mapplecroft  -  Financial  Sector  indices  will  be  examined  with UNI Global Union throughout 2022.\n\nIn  terms  of  discrimination,  Societe  Generale's  countries  of  operation with a medium-high risk for the banking sector are: Cameroon, United Arab  Emirates,  Guinea,  Chad  and  Turkey.  The  Group's  moderate-risk countries  of  operation  are  as  follows:  Algeria,  Benin,  Brazil,  Burkina Faso,  China,  Congo,  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  United  States  of  America,  Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, India, Japan, Madagascar, Morocco, Mexico, Russia, Senegal, Singapore, Tunisia and Ukraine.\n\nTurning to health and safety, Societe Generale's country of operation with a moderate risk for the banking sector are. Algeria, Benin, Brazil, Cameroon, China, Congo, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, United Arab Emirates, Ghana, Guinea,  Equatorial  Guinea,  India,  Madagascar,  Morocco,  Mexico, Russia, Senegal, Chad and Turkey.\n\nRegarding  working  conditions,  Societe  Generale's  countries  of operation with a medium-high risk for the banking sector are Benin, United Arab Emirates and Chad. The Group's moderate-risk countries of  operation  are:  Algeria,  Brazil,  Burkina  Faso,  Cameroon,  China, Congo, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, India, Japan, Madagascar,  Morocco,  Mexico,  Romania,  Russia,  Senegal,  Taiwan, Turkey and Ukraine.\n\n- A distinction is made between inherent and residual risks. The latter are obtained after taking account of applying the measures to avoid the risks or mitigate their (1) consequences.\n- For the HR, Safety & Security and Activities pillars: Verisk Mapplecroft and Reprisk; for the Sourcing pillar: Transparency International, the World Bank Group, the ILO and (2) UNICEF.\n- Verisk Maplecroft.

        "page_content": "## Sourcing pillar\n\nInherent  E&S  risk  mapping  for  the  Sourcing  pillar  was  based  on  the main purchasing categories for the banking sector (from a classification including more than 150 sourcing sub-categories in total). The risk level assessment  for  each  purchasing  category  took  in  three  main  areas: business  practices  and  ethics,  the  environment,  human  rights  and employment conditions. Contextual factors were also built into the risk assessment  for  the  purchasing  category:  supply  chain  characteristics (complexity,  including  the  number  of  actors  and  distance  from  the intermediaries to the end purchaser) and labour intensity.\n\nE&S  risks  specific to purchasing  categories  were  mapped  in conjunction with three other French banks in 2018, with the support of a specialised consulting firm. The mapping was subsequently updated and supplemented within the Group.\n\nThe  inherent  E&S  risk  levels  of  each  purchasing  category  were  then cross-referenced  with  the  corresponding  expenditure  amounts  per category to identify the share of Group purchases in medium-high and high-risk categories.\n\nResults: within  the  scope  analysed  by  the  Sourcing  Division,  around 5% of the spend was on purchasing categories representing a high E&S risk, and  around  9%  on  purchasing  categories  representing  a medium-high E&S risk.\n\nAmongst the high-risk purchasing categories, building work was found to  bear  the  greatest  risk  (renovations  and  outfitting  but  also construction of new buildings), together with waste management and telephone and IT equipment.\n\n## Activities pillar\n\nSociete Generale  provides  financial  products  and  services  to customers in many sectors, and some may expose it to E&S risks. As in prior  years,  the  Group  has  identified  and  ranked  E&S  risks  for  each sector, based on external sources (including information on reputation and controversies) and on expert opinion.\n\nIt  then  cross-referenced  the  risk  ratings  obtained  with  the  Group's activity data to identify the Group's exposure to E&S risk industries.\n\nThe risk management framework includes mitigation measures, in line with  the  more  in-depth  due  diligence  required  for  Societe  Generale products  and  services  directly  associated  with  the  most  exposed activities and regions.\n\nResults: as we noted in prior years, the industries most vulnerable to E&S  are  in  the  energy  sector  (fossil  fuels  and  electricity  generation), transport  and  logistics  (especially  automotive  and  aerospace), agriculture  (especially  upstream)  -  although  risk  has  decreased dramatically  in  the  soya  business,  industry,  construction,  chemicals, mining, forestry, textiles and defence.\n\nThe main risks identified in these sectors include higher climate risks, erosion of biodiversity, risks related to working conditions (including workplace accidents), risks of forced labour and child labour, and the risk of violating community rights.\n\n25% of the Group's exposure (1) (a  slight  decrease  on  2020)  relates  to sectors  with  high  human  rights  and  environment  risks.  Once geography is  taken  into  account  ( i.e. mainly  the  quality  of  local  E&S regulations),  less  than  10%  of  the  Group's  business  as  measured  in terms of sector exposure is conducted in sectors or countries found to present E&S risks.\n\n## REGULAR E&S RISK ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES 5.7.3 AND RISK PREVENTION AND MITIGATING MEASURES\n\nThe  aim  of  the  Duty  of  Care  Plan  is  to  provide  an  appropriate framework for managing E&S risks. In other words it should cover the main risks  pinpointed  by  the  risk  mapping  exercise  and  be  correctly deployed in the Group. Accordingly, Societe Generale regularly reviews its  E&S  risk  management  framework  to  identify  risks  of  serious violations  that  may  not  be  adequately  covered  by  the  existing framework and to step up prevention and mitigation measures.\n\n## Human resources, safety and security pillar\n\nThe Group's assessment and prevention model is underpinned by a set of  operational  processes  and  systems,  which  are  constantly  updated to meet continuous improvement goals.\n\nThe Group defines specific guidelines for the various health and safety issues,  as  well  as  a  set  of  HR  policies  applicable  to  the  entire  Group, which are then implemented by the Business Units and Service Units:\n\n- social dialogue and freedom of association: governance of these p issues  at  Group  level  is  based  on  French  labour  relations  bodies, which  monitor  working  conditions  and  freedom  of  association. Societe Generale renewed its agreement on fundamental rights with the UNI Global Union in February/uni00A02019; This agreement covers 100% of the workforce and is based on implementing commitments that are discussed with the UNI Global Union on a regular basis;\n- staff are also represented through a European Works Council; p\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "GROUP'S DUTY OF CARE PLAN\n\n- discrimination: Societe Generale demonstrates its determination to p recognise and promote all talents through its Diversity and Inclusion policy, in place since 2019. The Group is committed to creating the conditions  of  an  inclusive  organisation  in  all  its  HR  processes  and entities,  and  prohibits  all  forms  of  discrimination.  A  Diversity  and Inclusion Committee,  with  members  from  the  BU  and  SU Management Committees, sets the goal and priorities and oversees progress towards achieving them;\n- health  and  quality  of  life  at  work: the  Group's  Health  policy  is p implemented by the entities working with local support teams (HR, logistics managers, occupational health, /uni00A0 etc . ). Each Group subsidiary defines a level of supplementary health cover depending on  the  compulsory  scheme  in  its  country  and  with  a  level  of protection at least comparable to local market practices. Moreover, since 2019 the Group has been working to ensure a minimum level of social, health  and  welfare  protection  for  all  its  employees worldwide.  To  date,  nine  out  of  ten  employees  benefit  from  a supplementary company health or personal protection plan;\n- safety and security: the  safety  of  people  and  property  on  Societe p Generale  premises  is  supervised  by  the  Group  Security  Division within the Corporate Secretariat. A network of departments in the Group's entities is responsible for implementing policies to protect people, property and intangible assets. These teams aim to tighten the  Group's  safety  culture,  disseminate  policies  and  measures  to make  its  activities  safer,  and  coordinate  relations  with  national, European and international public safety authorities;\n- working  conditions: the  Group  has  set  the  minimum  age  for p employment at 16. Group entities are required to check the age of all new employees at the hiring stage. Furthermore, the Group prohibits all  forms  of  forced  labour.  Societe  Generale  also  strives  to  offer attractive  and  fair  remuneration  to  nurture  employee  loyalty  and boost the Group's performance  over the long term. The compensation  policy  is  based  on  principles  of  non-discrimination and  other  principles  shared  by  all.  It  is  then  adjusted  to  the businesses  and  geographic  areas  in  which  the  Group  operates, taking into account market practices and contexts;\n- in  addition,  the  Group  introduced  further  measures  to  protect p employees'  health  and  facilitate  them  as  the  Covid-19  pandemic accelerated  trends  in  new  ways  of  working.  (See  Guaranteeing employees'  health  and  safety  in  the  workplace  and  in  performing their professional duties, and ensuring continuous improvement of working conditions, page/uni00A0314).\n\nThese  are  backed  by  ensuring  that  everyone  knows  the  rules  and teams are trained in all our host countries. Societe Generale's training offer  primarily  targets  the  Risk  and  Compliance  culture  (including training in the Code of Conduct, ethics and E&S responsibility). It also offers  training  courses  specific  to  each  business  line  or  function, thereby limiting operational risks.\n\n## Sourcing pillar\n\nThe Group's normative documentation governs E&S risk management in terms of Sourcing and supplier relationship management.\n\nOperational  implementation  of  the  normative  documentation  and management  of  E&S  risks  at  all  stages  of  the  sourcing  process  are based on a set of tools to identify, assess and manage E&S risks at a granular  level:  product  or  service  and  supplier  or  service  provider. These  tools  are  used  for  purchases  made  by  the  Group  Sourcing Division and at least for high-risk categories in the Sourcing function in other countries. They are being phased in across the Group. To support effective implementation of these E&S risk management measures in purchasing,  dedicated  training  has  been  provided  to  all  professional buyers.  In  addition,  to  make  sure  occasional  buyers  are  mindful  of what  is  at  stake,  a  motion  design  video  is  available  presenting  the Group's sustainable sourcing programme.\n\nTo identify and assess risks, the Sourcing Division draws primarily on:\n\n- E&S risk mapping for the various purchasing categories to identify p the E&S risk category for the category in question;\n- inclusion  of  E&S  criteria  in  calls  for  tender  involving  purchasing p categories ranked as medium-high or high E&S risk;\n- inclusion of E&S criteria in the KYS (Know Your Supplier) assessment p for  shortlisted  suppliers,  including  verifying  compliance  with  the E&S exclusion list;\n- non-financial  assessment  of  certain  'targeted' (1) suppliers  by p independent third parties;\n- review of controversies. p\n\nManaging and mitigating risks involves:\n\n- including E&S criteria in calls for tender covering the main risks for p the  category  of  purchases  identified  in  the  risk  mapping,  for categories with a medium-high or high E&S risk;\n- weighting  E&S  criteria  according  to  the  degree  of  E&S  risk p represented  by  the  purchasing  category  in  question,  according  to the rating criteria for service or product bids;\n- inclusion  of  a  CSR  clause  into  contracts  that  impose  a  binding p commitment to abide by the Group's Sustainable Sourcing Charter and Code of Conduct, as well as a reference to the right to audit (to perform  E&S  audits  if  necessary)  and  a  request  for  non-financial assessment of 'targeted' suppliers;\n- if E&S performance falls short: p\n- encouraging remedial action plans, -\n- option to conduct on-site E&S audits, -\n- review of E&S controversies or changes in non-financial ratings. -\n\nFurther information on what the Group is doing in this area is available in  the  Group's  Declaration  of  Non-Financial  Performance  (DNFP) (Chapter/uni00A05 of  the  Universal  Registration  Document,  see  Being  a responsible employer, page/uni00A0320).\n\n|",

For  calls  for  tenders  managed  by  the  Sourcing  Function  in  the international  market  for  all  high-risk  E&S  categories,  suppliers  must meet  the  Group's  E&S  requirements.

Further information on Sourcing is  provided  on  page/uni00A0327,  Being  a  responsible  purchaser:  the  positive sourcing programme.\n\nA questionnaire was prepared with an independent third party in 2021 for new supplier CSR audits in 2022 concentrating on service provision in two medium-high risk E&S categories.\n\n## Activities pillar\n\nSociete  Generale  is  subject  to  a  set  of  regulations  (anti-money laundering  regulations,  compliance  with  embargoes,  legislation  on personal  data  protection  and  on  transparency,  the  fight  against corruption and modernisation of the economy, /uni00A0 etc . ) that constitute the foundation of its risk management.\n\nBeyond its regulatory obligations, the Group has also been developing processes  to  manage  the  E&S  risks  associated  with  its  activities  for over ten years. This risk management framework is applied based on E&S  standards  and  commitments,  a  set  of  Group  normative documents and their transposition into operating procedures, as well as the internal tools for practical implementation.\n\n## WHISTLEBLOWING PROCEDURE 5.7.4\n\nUnder the Duty of Care Act (as well as the French Act on Transparency, the  Fight  against  Corruption  and  Modernisation  of  the  Economy, known  as  the  Sapin/uni00A0II  Act),  companies  must  have  a  whistleblowing procedure. To comply  with  both  these  laws, a Group-wide whistleblowing  system  is  now  in  place  in  addition  to  existing measures. The French representative trade unions were consulted and the system proposed was presented to and discussed with French and European bodies before being introduced. The policy is now available at www.societegenerale.com and  on  the  Societe  Generale  Group's intranet.  It  has  been  rolled  out  in  France  and  other  countries,  and  is now available in 21/uni00A0languages. This is in addition to going through the managerial  channel  and  direct  referral via the  Chief  Compliance Officer, to whom the issue can be reported.\n\nWhistleblowers can use the system to report any suspected, potential or actual serious and clear violations of an international commitment,\n\nThe  E&S  General  Guidelines  govern  all  its  E&S  commitments  They include the cross-sector and sector-specific policies for those sectors deemed potentially sensitive from an environmental, social or ethical point of view. These policies notably describe the main risks of human rights  violations  or  environmental  damage,  and  set  out  assessment criteria  for  customers  or  transactions  carried  out  with  counterparts acting in these sectors.\n\nThe Group's normative documentation was updated in 2019 to include information  relative  to  risk  management  processes  and  measures introduced to prevent these risks, especially who does what in each of these  areas.  Since  then,  most  of  the  Business  Units  continued  to gradually  introduce  E&S  risk  management  into  their  operational processes, strengthened their centres of E&S expertise, and conducted specific training for teams working in sales, the Risk Division and the Compliance Division.\n\nLast, the tools to identify and assess E&S risks, used internally in the Group, are also updated at least every six months, including:\n\n- the  E&S  watch  list  of  projects,  companies  or  sectors/countries p representing a high risk on E&S issues, designed to trigger a more in-depth due diligence on such sectors, projects or companies;\n- the E&S exclusion list. p\n\nThe  E&S  risk  assessment  procedures  and  risk  control  systems  are described in more detail in the Universal Registration Document (see E&S  risk  management  in  the  businesses  to  promote  fair  and responsible growth, page 285).\n\na  law  or  a  regulation;  in  respect  of  human  rights,  fundamental freedoms,  health  and  safety  or  the  environment;  and  regarding behaviour  or  a  situation  that  runs  counter  to  the  Group's  Code  of Conduct.  It  is  available  to  all  employees,  as  well  as  to  external  or temporary staff  and  service  providers  working  with  the  Group  on  an established  basis  (as  subcontractors  or  suppliers).  It  is  hosted  on  a secure  external  platform  offering  the  guarantees  required  by  the French  Act  on  Transparency,  the  Fight  against  Corruption  and Modernisation  of  the  Economy,  namely  protection  of  personal  data and strict confidentiality of any information provided.\n\nWhistleblowing is a right and no employee may be sanctioned in any way whatsoever for having made disclosures in good faith.\n\nThe Group's Code of Conduct reflects this whistleblowing process (see A Code of Conduct underpinned by shared values, page 275).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## MONITORING OF DUTY OF CARE MEASURES 5.7.5\n\nSociete  Generale  has  developed  management and reporting tools to comply  with  its  extra-financial  reporting  obligations  and  monitor implementation  of  its  E&S  risk  management  processes.  These  tools provide the Human Resources Department, Security Division, Sourcing Division and Sustainable Development Department with key extra-financial  performance  indicators.  A  common  extra-financial reporting  system  is  in  place  throughout  the  Group  and  supplies  the data  needed  for  extra-financial  reporting  (Chapter/uni00A05  of  the  Universal Registration Document) and for the Duty of Care Plan.\n\nDuty  of  care  measures  are  also  monitored  by  means  of  internal self-assessment exercises, to:\n\n- monitor  how  E&S  risk  management  processes  are  applied  in p Business  Units,  Service  Units  and  further  down  the  chain  (at individual legal entity level);\n- identify  areas  for  improvement  and  monitor  the  ensuing  action p plans; and\n- leverage additional indicators for monitoring the measures taken by p the Group.\n\n## Human resources, safety and security pillar\n\nSociete Generale uses controls to assess monitoring of applicable rules.\n\nHow well it manages its risks determines the Bank's ability to achieve its HR risk prevention goals. Therefore, which control systems it uses, and how they are determined and monitored all play a crucial role in the Company's performance.\n\nFor  the  sake  of  efficiency,  the  Group  provides  all  its  entities  with normative documentation specific to the nature of the activities and taking  into  account  all  types  of  risk,  including  HR  risks.  This documentation is updated, disseminated, and accessible.\n\nSociete  Generale  uses  self-assessment  exercises  to  assess  risk mitigation measures.\n\nEvery year the Group asks all entities with more than 50/uni00A0employees to contribute to two self-assessment exercises:\n\n- one is on hedging operational risk (Risk control self-assessment). In p 2021, entities were asked to emphasise major residual risks, Culture & Conduct, recruitment, psychosocial risks and emerging risks. The Human  Resources  Department,  the  Risk  Division  and  the  Finance Division are responsible for governance and controls relating to this exercise;\n- the other is specific to correct application by the Group's entities of p their  duty  of  care.  It  is  based  on  a  questionnaire  (Planethic Reporting)  that  covers  how  local  policies  and  processes  are implemented, as well as checks performed on all issues presented in the Universal Registration Document, Being a responsible employer on  page/uni00A0314. The  Human  Resources  Department  governs  and consolidates these data.\n\nSociete  Generale  assesses  the  satisfaction  and  well-being  of  its employees.\n\nIn addition to these measures,  the  Group  gauges  employee engagement  and  gathers  direct  feedback  on  working  conditions through  the  Employee  Satisfaction  Survey,  an  annual  anonymous internal survey carried out throughout the Group. The 2021 survey set\n\nout to gain insights on insight, Culture & Conduct, working conditions and  diversity.  The  results,  shared  with  employees,  help  to  take  the pulse of our workforce and their expectations and to read the labour relations  climate.  Based  on  the  survey  findings,  action  plans  are implemented  where  necessary  to  continuously  improve  employees' daily working conditions.\n\n## Sourcing pillar\n\nThe Sourcing Division tracks E&S risk indicators on suppliers and calls for  tender  on  a  quarterly  basis.  For  procurement  overseen  by  the Sourcing Division:\n\n- CSR  tool  sheets  cover  100%  of  the  purchasing  categories p representing  a  high  or  medium-high  E&S  risk  (more  than  50/uni00A0tool sheets in total). These tool sheets are designed to help the Sourcing Division's buyers ask CSR questions or impose CSR requirements in respect of identified risks in the context of calls for tender;\n- 99%  of  calls  for  tender  in  high  E&S  risk  categories  included  CSR p criteria;\n- 89%  of  a  targeted  scope  of  suppliers  under  contract  have  an p up-to-date  non-financial  evaluation  conducted  by  an  independent third party;\n- a tool to help tackle controversies involving companies suspected of p using forced labour in their supply chains was also developed;\n- at 31/uni00A0December 2021, 100% of the Sourcing Division's active buyers p had  received  Responsible  Sourcing  training,  as  defined  in  the Group's  normative  documentation  and  in  E&S  risk  management tools applicable to sourcing.\n\n## Activities pillar\n\nThe Group continued to implement procedures and controls aimed at managing E&S risks in its activities, drawing on the annual monitoring in  the  framework  of  the  DNFP  (see/uni00A0E&S  risk  management  in  the businesses to promote fair and responsible growth, page 285) and on the Compliance Risk Assessment.\n\nThe Compliance Risk Assessment was conducted in 2020 and looked in detail  at  E&S  risks  in  188  Group  entities.  It  provided  the  Group  with more granular detail over a wider scope on implementation of its E&S risk  management  frameworks  and  insights  to  define  the  necessary improvement actions.\n\nThese internal management tools have made it possible to assess:\n\n- familiarity with the regulatory framework for managing E&S risks in p the Group (E&S policies, E&S watch list, E&S exclusion list) and their transposition into the Business Units' own procedures;\n- the  Business  Units  with  the  highest  exposure,  that  implemented p particular procedures (transposing the Societe Generale Code) with respect to the environmental and social risk management system;\n- implementation  of  Group  procedures  and  associated  controls,  as p part of the Group's permanent control system;\n- human resources and skills devoted to E&S risk management; p\n- governance framework to address complex E&S issues at local level, p before escalation to Group level;\n\n|",

Building  work  (1,5%  of  Group  spending) emerged as the highest risk category;\n- CSR  tool  sheets  cover  100%  of  the  purchasing  categories p representing  a  high  or  medium-high  E&S  risk  (more  than  50/uni00A0tool sheets in total). To meet specific challenges, 50 or so additional CSR tool sheets cover other purchasing categories;\n- 99%  of  calls  for  tender  in  high  E&S  risk  categories  included  CSR p criteria;\n- as  at  31/uni00A0December  2021,  100%  of  the  Sourcing  Division's  active p buyers had received Responsible Sourcing training.\n\n## Activities pillar\n\nThe main achievements in 2021 were:\n\n- review of  the  environmental  and  social  (E&S)  general  principles  in p March/uni00A02021  to  meet  certain  obligations  enshrined  in  Regulation 2019/2088  on  sustainabilityrelated  disclosures  in  the  financial services sector, especially with regard to the transparency of policies on  the  integration  of  sustainability  risks  and  negative  impacts  on sustainability  factors.  They  set  out  the  principles  that  apply  to transactions  and  dedicated  products  or  services  and  define  three types of criteria: exclusion criteria, priority risk assessment criteria and  additional  risk  assessment  criteria.  Four  sector-based  policies were revised in 2021 (thermal power plants, dams and hydro power, maritime transport and mines), as well as two cross-cutting policies covering climate and biodiversity;\n\n|\n\n- roll-out of a new tool to flag transactions located in protected areas p (Unesco  World  Heritage,  IUCN/uni00A0I  -  IV,  Ramsar,  Alliance  for  Zero Extinction) to reinforce biodiversity criteria;\n- definition of a procedure to escalate E&S risks; p\n- bolstering expertise in managing E&S risks in the Business Units and p in  the  second  line  of  defence.  The  Compliance  Division  appointed people  assigned  to  handling  cases  where  any  doubt  exists  on compliance  with  the  Group's  voluntary  E&S  commitments.  The decision circuit for such cases was clarified;\n- continued  controls  on  management  of  E&S  risks  were  included  in p the permanent supervision system;\n- e-learning  module  on  E&S  risk  management.  Training  was  made p compulsory  for  staff  in  direct  or  indirect  contact  with  corporate customers. The module described the scope, governance and main stages  in  managing  E&S  risks:  identifying  and  assessing  risk  and ensuing action plans;\n- all  employees  were  offered  free-to-access  online  training  on  E&S p topics.  The  Business  Units  and  Service  Units  organised  workshops focusing on sector policies;\n- action plans were monitored by the Compliance Division following p the 2020 Compliance Risk Assessment, including specific monitoring of  the  highest risks. All action plans intended to target the highest risks have been introduced.\n\n## Results:\n\n- The  mapping  exercise  demonstrated  that  8%  of  the  Group's  risk p exposure was linked to activities that potentially pose an E&S risk ( i.e. energy, transport and logistics, upstream agriculture, industry, construction, /uni00A0 etc . )  and  that  are  conducted  in  countries  that  also entail risk;\n- Action plans shed light on the following: p\n- the 2020 evaluation underscored that over 90% of the Business -Units apply the E&S identification and exclusion list at the KYC or transaction due diligence stage, and, at the end of 2021, 80% of entities evaluated stated having had introduced E&S review and identification or exclusion application controls,\n- more than 1,200 transactions underwent an E&S review in 2021, -\n- the  number  of  assessments  increased  on  clients  of  the  main -Business Units with a financing activity, and produced a range of widely  differing  opinions:  88.5%  were  positive,  9.5%  posed additional conditions and 2% were negative,\n- E&S  training  deployment  continued:  around  40,000/uni00A0employees -had received training in  managing E&S risks through e-learning modules by end-2021.",

The risk management framework will be further enhanced (policies, formal processes and/or additional checks) in 2022.\n\n## Human resources, safety and security pillar\n\nManaging work-related psychosocial risks is more important than ever, both  in  the  face  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic  and  as  result  of  changes brought about by the Group's transformation. And not just for Societe Generale, all companies must step up their response and vigilance.\n\nIn the Group, the main steps to prevent and manage health and safety risk are:\n\n- analysing  the  results  of  the  employee  survey,  paying  particularly p close attention to engagement and psychosocial risks;\n- stepping up measures to prevent psychosocial risks, especially risks p generated  by  the  Group's  transformation  projects  (monitoring labour  relations  indicators,  developing  preventive  policies,  setting up actions to contain psychosocial risk factors, and more);\n- training  managers  and  HR  personnel  to  detect  and  prevent p psychosocial and mental health risks;\n- communicate  and  inform  staff  about  health  and  safety  rules  and p best  practice  with  information  on  safety  processes  and  concepts available on the Group's intranet;\n- adapting  properties  to  create  a  good  working  environment  for p employees and reconfigure workspaces in response to the growth of remote and hybrid forms of working, with a 2021-2025 programme led by the Group's Real Estate Division.\n\nAdditional measures are also planned in entities that need to improve their controls, for example:\n\n- mental health information sessions are planned in the United Arab p Emirates;\n- in  Morocco, the Bank has strengthened governance and expanded p the prerogatives of the health, Safety and Security Committee;\n- in Russia,  all  employees  will  be  asked  to  complete  regular p questionnaires and evaluations on health at work;\n- plans  for  Madagascar  include  standardising  the  approach  to p applying workplace health, safety and security rules to improve how controls are set up and monitored.\n\nMoreover, the Group will continue to implement measures to protect and support staff during the pandemic in 2022. Listening attentively to stakeholders will clarify changes in its environment and help the Group to address them with agility. Appropriate channels have been set up to foster  constructive  dialogue  with  all  stakeholders  by  considering  the results  of  internal  surveys  and  through  continued  dialogue  with  the UNI Global Union.\n\n## Sourcing pillar\n\nThe main actions planned are as follows:\n\n- continued  improvements  to  the  tools  used  to  identify  and  assess p risks, including creating new tool sheets on moderate and low-risk categories for buyers;\n- translating all tool sheets into English for the international function, p covering all risk levels and purchasing categories;\n- more regular training for Group buyers and the function as a whole, p and extending training to entities that habitually manage sourcing when they request it;\n- performing  CSR  audits  and  setting  up  remedial  action  plans  with p suppliers under contract that present E&S risk factors;\n- beefing up procedures to identify and manage E&S controversies for p suppliers using new E&S risk analysis tools.\n\n## Activities pillar\n\nThe main actions planned are as follows:\n\n- publishing updated sector policies - with the addition of biodiversity p criteria - with the aim of improving identification and prevention of environmental and social risks;\n- defining  a  normative  framework  dealing  with  forced  labour  and p related tools;\n- developing  aids  for  Business  Units  to  apply  sector  policies  and p qualify the materiality of E&S controversies;\n- continuing training workshops on sector policies. p\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Group  includes  the parent company Societe Generale (including the Societe Generale foreign branches) and all of the entities in France and abroad that it controls either directly or indirectly (subsidiaries and joint arrangements) or on which it exercises significant influence (associates).\n\nThese standards are available on the European Commission website.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  transitional  measures  provided  by  IFRS/uni00A09,  the  Group  has  elected  to  recognise hedging  transactions  under  IAS/uni00A039  as  adopted  by  the  European  Union,  including  measures  related  to macro-fair value hedge accounting (IAS/uni00A039 'carve-out').\n\nAs the IFRS accounting framework does not specify a standard model, the format of the primary financial statements used to present the data for financial year is consistent with the format of financial statements proposed  by  the  French  Accounting  Standard  Setter,  the/uni00A0 Autorit\u00e9  des  Normes  Comptables  (ANC) , under/uni202FRecommendation No./uni00A02017-02 of/uni00A02/uni00A0June 2017.\n\nThe disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements focus on information that is both relevant and material to the financial statements of the Societe/uni00A0Generale Group, its activities, and the circumstances in which it conducted its operations of the period still impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe Group publishes its Annual Financial Report 2022 using the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) as  defined  by  the  European  Delegated  Regulation  2019/815  amended  by  the  Delegated  Regulation 2020/1989.\n\nThe presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements is the euro.\n\nThe figures presented in the financial statements and in the notes are expressed in millions of euros, unless otherwise specified.

The  purpose  of  Phase/uni00A01  of  these amendments, implemented by the Group since 31/uni00A0December 2019, has been  to  enable  the  continued  application  of  hedge  accounting treatments despite uncertainties regarding the timetable and specifics regarding the transition from old interest rate benchmarks to new ones. These  amendments  shall  apply  until  the  targeted  uncertainties  are removed  with  the  effective  cessation  of  the  abandoned  benchmarks. As/uni202Fat 31/uni00A0December  2021,  these  amendments  thus  still  apply  to  all hedges  in  which  the  hedged  item  and/or  hedging  instrument  remain indexed on an IBOR rate, for instance the USD/uni00A0Libor.\n\nPhase/uni00A02  of  these  amendments addresses the treatment of changes to financial  instruments  in  the  context  of  the  IBOR  reform.  Adopted  by the  European  Union  on  14/uni00A0January  2021,  they  were  early  applied  by the  Group  in  its  financial  statements  as  at  31/uni00A0December  2020. These/uni202Fsupplementary  amendments have provided for the application of the following treatments:\n\n- when  measuring  financial  assets  and  liabilities  at  amortised  cost, p financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income and lease liabilities, the changes brought about by the IBOR reform in  the  determination  of  contractual  cash  flows  are  booked  as  the revision of a variable interest rate provided that these changes are made on an economically equivalent basis;\n- the hedging relationship when changes are made, in the context of p the IBOR reform, to the hedged item and/or the hedging instrument and lead to a re-documentation of the hedge.\n\nIn view  of  the  provisions  introduced  by  the  IBOR  -  Phase/uni00A02 amendments,  the  changes  to  contractual  cash  flows  expected  in  the context  of  this  rate  transition  should  not  generate  any  significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. Indeed,/uni202Fthe/uni202FGroup,  in  line  with  the  recommendations  issued  by  the regulatory authorities and market working groups on the rate reform, has  usually  planned  to  migrate  all  IBOR-based  contracts  on  an economically equivalent basis. This is most often done by replacing the historical  benchmark  rate  with  an  alternative  benchmark  rate  plus  a fixed spread compensating for the difference between these two/uni202Frates.\n\nThe  economically  equivalent  nature  of  the  migration  stems  mainly from the use of the credit risk margins fixed by market authorities or from the standard market practices for the benchmark index chosen (see Chapter/uni00A04 of the present Universal Registration Document). In the marginal  cases  where  a  different  margin  is  used,  a  quantitative analysis is performed, based on the changes in value of the future cash flows of the modified instrument.\n\n## AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 4 - EXTENSION OF THE TEMPORARY EXEMPTION FROM APPLYING IFRS 9\n\nThe  amendments  to  IFRS/uni00A017  and  IFRS/uni00A04  published  by  the  IASB  on 25/uni00A0June  2020  as  well  as  Regulation  (EU)  2020/2097  published  by  the European Commission on 15/uni00A0December 2020 allow financial conglomerates as defined by Directive 2002/87/CE to defer, until/uni202F1/uni00A0January  2023, the application of IFRS/uni00A09 by their legal entities in the insurance sector. Regarding its insurance subsidiaries, the Group has  thus  upheld  the  decision  to  differ  the  application  of  IFRS/uni00A09  and continue  applying  the  processes  specified  under  IAS/uni00A039  in  the  form adopted in the European Union.\n\n## AMENDMENTS TO IFRS 16 'LEASES' - COVID-19 RELATED RENT CONCESSIONS BEYOND 30 JUNE 2021\n\nThese amendments extend by one year the application period of the Covid-19  related  amendments  to  IFRS/uni00A016  'Leases'  published  by  the IASB  on  28/uni00A0May  2020.  These  amendments  are  intended  to  optionally enable lessees who receive relief for rent payable until 30/uni00A0June 2022 to account  for  these  reliefs  as  negative  variable  leases  (generating  an immediate gain in the income statement).\n\nIn 2021, as in 2020, the Group did not benefit from any Covid-19 related rent reliefs.\n\n## DECISION OF THE IFRS INTERPRETATIONS COMMITTEE (IFRS IC) OF 20 APRIL 2021 ON IAS 19\n\nDuring  its  20/uni00A0April  2021  meeting,  the  IFRS/uni00A0IC  specified  the  modalities for  determining  the  vesting  period  of  a  defined  post-employment benefit  plan  under  which  employees  are  entitled  to  a  lump-sum benefit payment the amount of which:\n\n- depends  on  their  length  of  employee  service,  when  they  reach p retirement age; and\n- is capped at a maximum amount when they exceed a certain number p of consecutive years of service determined by the regime; and\n- the  payment of which requires that they are still employed by the p firm until their retirement date.\n\nThe  IFRS/uni00A0IC  specified  that,  pursuant  to  IAS/uni00A019,  the  vesting  period should  be  the  period  of  employee  service  immediately  before  the retirement age and that its duration should be capped to the number of consecutive years of service required to be entitled to this benefit.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to use as the vesting period the total length of service when the latter is greater than the cap used to calculate the benefit. The consecutive decision not to place the issue on the IFRS/uni00A0IC agenda was validated by the IASB on 24/uni00A0May 2021.\n\n|",

Their application is required for annual periods beginning on or\n\nafter 1/uni00A0January 2022 at the earliest or on the date of their adoption by the  European  Union.

        "page_content": "## AMENDMENTS TO IAS 12 'INCOME TAXES' DEFERRED TAX RELATED TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM A SINGLE TRANSACTION\n\nPublished by the IASB on 7/uni00A0May 2021.\n\nThese  amendments  clarify  and  narrow  the  scope  of  the  exemption provided by the IAS/uni00A012/uni00A0standard allowing institutions to not recognise any  deferred  tax  during  the  initial  recognition  of  an  asset  and  a liability.  Are/uni00A0excluded from  the  exemption  scope  all  leases  and decommissioning obligations for which companies recognise both an asset and a liability and will now have to recognise deferred taxes.\n\n## NOTE 1.4\n\nThe  aim  of  these  amendments  is  to  reduce  heterogeneity  in  the recognition of the deferred tax related to leases and decommissioning obligations.\n\nSince  the  date  of  first  application  of  IFRS/uni00A016,  the  Group  has  been considering  the  rights  of  use  and  the  lease-related  debt  as  a  single transaction. Consequently, on the initial recognition date, no deferred tax  is  recognised  since  the  amount  of  deferred  tax  asset  offsets  the amount of deferred tax liability. The net temporary differences resulting from  later  variations  in  the  right  of  use  and  lease  debt  subsequently result in the recognition of a deferred tax. This/uni202Famendment thus has no impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Preparation for the first-time application of IFRS 17 'Insurance contracts' and of IFRS 9 'Financial instruments' to the legal entities operating in the insurance sector\n\nThe IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0standard,  published  on  18/uni00A0May  2017  and  modified  by  the amendments  adopted  on  25/uni00A0June  2020  and  9/uni00A0December  2021, will/uni202Fupersede  the  IFRS/uni00A04  'Insurance  contracts'  standard  which  allows for the recognition of insurance contracts using the methods specified by the local accounting regulation.\n\nOn 23/uni00A0November 2021, the European Commission (EC) published in the official  journal  Regulation  (EU)  2021/2036  of  19/uni00A0November  2021 adopting IFRS/uni00A017 'Insurance Contracts'. This adoption was supplemented with a possibility offered to European companies not to apply the requirement stated in the standard to group certain type of insurance  contracts  by  annual  cohort  for  their  measurement (see/uni202Fparagraph/uni00A0Grouping  of  contracts);  this  possibility  of  exemption will  be  re-examined  by  the  European  Commission  no  later  than 31/uni00A0December 2027.\n\nThe  IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0standard  is  applicable  from  1/uni00A0January  2023  on.  On  the same date,  the  Group  subsidiaries  operating  in  the  insurance  sector will,  for  the  first  time,  apply  the  IFRS/uni00A09  'Financial  instruments' standard  the  application  of  which  was  deferred  for  these  entities according  to  the  possibilities  offered  by  the  amendments  to  the IFRS/uni00A017  and  IFRS/uni00A04/uni00A0standards  published  by  the  IASB  on  25/uni00A0June  2020 and extended by regulations (EU) 2017/1988 and (EU) 2020/2097 of the European Commission.\n\nOn  9/uni00A0December  2021,  the  IASB  published  amendments  to  IFRS/uni00A017  to improve the comparative information on financial assets presented at the  time  of  the  first  concomitant  application  of  the  IFRS/uni00A09  and IFRS/uni00A07/uni00A0standards. The process of adoption of these amendments by the European Union is currently underway.\n\nThe  main  consequences  of  the  application  of  the  IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0standard concern:\n\n- the  valuation  of  insurance  contracts  on  the  balance  sheet:  their p value will be updated at each closing date based on a reassessment of  the  related  future  cash  flows.  This  reassessment  will  take  into account  market  data  in  relation  to  the  financial  elements  and policyholders' behaviour;\n- the  recognition  of  the  margin:  even  if  the  profitability  of  the p insurance contracts remains unchanged, the/uni00A0recognition in profit or loss of their margins will be modified to be spread over the duration of the insurance service; and\n- the presentation of the income statement: the operating expenses p attributable  to  the  execution  of  the  insurance  contracts  will,  from now on, be presented in deduction of the net banking income under Insurance service expenses and will not impact the total operating expenses in the consolidated income statement anymore.\n\n|\n\n## SCOPE OF THE CONTRACTS\n\nThe scope of insurance contracts to which IFRS/uni00A017 applies mirrors the one  to  which  IFRS/uni00A04  currently  applies.  These  are  the  insurance contracts  issued,  the  reinsurance  contracts  issued  or  held,  and  the investment  contracts  issued  including  a  discretionary/uni00A0participation clause  provided  they  are  issued  by  an  entity  which  also  issues insurance  contracts.  Like  IFRS/uni00A04,  IFRS/uni00A017  does  not  apply  to  the insurance  contracts  in  which  the  Group  is  the  insured  beneficiary except for the contracts identified as reinsurance treaties.\n\n## GROUPING OF CONTRACTS\n\nTo measure the insurance contracts issued, IFRS/uni00A017 requires that the latter  to  be  aggregated  into  homogeneous  portfolios.  Within  these portfolios,  the  contracts  have  to  be  subject  to  similar  risks  and managed together.\n\nWithin  each  portfolio,  three  groups  will  be  distinguished  upon  initial recognition: contracts that are onerous at initial recognition, contracts that  at  initial  recognition  have  no  significant  possibility  of  becoming onerous subsequently, and remaining contracts.\n\nFurthermore,  IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0stipulates  that  each  group  of  contracts shall  be  divided  into  annual  cohorts  (with/uni00A0contracts  issued  no more  than  twelve-month  apart).  The  European  Commission endorsing  IFRS/uni00A017  has  however  offered  European  enterprises the possibility not to apply this provision to contracts benefiting from intergenerational pooling of the returns of the underlying assets.\n\nThe  Group  plans  to  use  this  optional  exemption  on  its  life insurance  contracts  in  France  because  they  include  direct  or discretionary participation features, which allow the sharing of risks and  cash  flows  between  different  generations  of policyholders. These life insurance contracts are also managed on  an  intergenerational  basis  to  mitigate  exposure  to  interest rate risk and longevity risk.",

Its  amount  is  determined  at  the  time  of  initial recognition of the Group of insurance contracts so that, at this date, no income  nor  expense  is  recognised,  except  in  the  particular  case  of groups  of  onerous  contracts  whose  loss  corresponding  to  the  net expected  cash  outflow  has  to  be  recognised  immediately  in  profit or/uni00A0loss.\n\n## i(glyph<c=21,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>iV$(Ve' dVRi(hVdVe' glyph<c=3,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>VlTVf' glyph<c=25,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"h \"eVh\"(i T\"e'hRT'iC\n\nAt each closing date, the accounting value on the balance sheet of the group of insurance contracts issued is re-estimated. It is then equal to the sum of the two following amounts:\n\n- liabilities for the remaining coverage, which aggregate the value of p the  execution  flows  re-estimated  at  this  date  (discounted  value  of the premiums receivable and of the expenses for future services over the remaining coverage period) and the contractual service margin discounted at the same date as described above;\n- liabilities  for  the  claims  incurred,  for  an  amount  equal  to  the p discounted value of the estimated cash flows required to settle the valid claims on past events.\n\nAt the same closing date, the amount of the contractual service margin is discounted to take account in particular of:\n\n- the impact of the new contracts added to the group of contracts; p\n- the  interest  capitalised  at  the  discounting  rate  used  to  determine p the initial margin value;\n- the  re-assessment  execution  cash  flows  (discounted  value  of  the p premiums receivable and of the expenses for future services over the remaining coverage period, except for the estimated expenses to be paid for the claims incurred which are assessed separately).\n\nA share of the amount of the margin thus reassessed is then recorded in profit or loss, representing the insurance coverage provided by the group  of  contracts  during  the  period;  this  share  is  determined  by distributing this reassessed margin between the amount of assurance services  provided  over  the  period  and  the  amount  of  services remaining to be provided over the expected residual coverage period of these contracts.\n\n## General Model adapted for the contracts with direct participation (Variable Fee Approach)\n\nTo measure the insurance contracts issued with direct participation in the profit, the General Model provided for by IFRS/uni00A017 is adapted to take account  of  the  participation  of  policyholders  in  the  yields  of  the investments underlying the contracts.\n\nThis approach, referred to as the 'Variable Fee Approach (VFA)', has to be  used  for  the  valuation  of  the  groups  of  insurance  contracts for/uni00A0which:\n\n- contractual  clauses  specify  that  the  policyholder  is  entitled  to  a p portion of a clearly defined portfolio of underlying elements;\n- the entity expects to pay to the holder an amount corresponding to p a  substantial  portion  of  the  yield  obtained  on  the  fair  value  of  the underlying elements;\n- the  entity  expects  that  a  substantial  proportion  of  the  variation  in p the  amounts  to  be  paid  to  the  holder  can  be  attributed  to  the variation in fair value of the underlying elements.\n\nAdjustment for non-financial risks (Risk adjustment)\n\nMargin for uncertainties on the estimated future flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

At each closing date, this portion of the period variation is incorporated into the contractual service margin to  be  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  and  spread  over  the  expected residual coverage period of the contracts;\n- the  interest  on  the  contractual  service  margin  of  which  the p variations are implicitly included in the periodic review of the margin on contractual services.\n\n## Simplified approach (Premium Allocation Approach) Option\n\nThe  standard  also  allows,  under  conditions,  for  the  application  of  a simplified approach called 'Premium Allocation Approach' to contracts with an insurance coverage period lower or equal to 12/uni00A0months.\n\nThe premiums receivables during the contractual insurance period are recognised in profit on a straight-line basis over this contractual period (or according to the expected pace of release of the risk when this pace differs considerably from a straight-line pace).\n\nAs in the General Model, the claims are provisioned through profit and loss  account  upon  their  occurrence  for  an  amount  equal  to  the estimated  value  of  the  cash  flows  necessary  to  settle  of  the  valid claims  (it  is  however  not  necessary  to  discount  the  amount  of compensation if their payment is expected within a year from the date of the claim).\n\n## iR)glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>eglyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>i Reglyph<c=23,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> hglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>hglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>dglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>e'\n\nThe  Group  considers  that  a  significant  portion  of  the  life  and savings  insurance  contracts  and  individual  and  collective retirement savings contracts issued by its insurance subsidiaries meet  the  definition  of  direct  participation  contracts.  These contracts, which represent the predominant insurance activity of  the  Group,  are  measured  using  the Variable  Fee  Approach (VFA) adapted  General  Model.  The  other  contracts  of  these categories are measured using the General Model or according to IFRS/uni00A09 if they meet the definition of an investment contract.\n\n## fh\"'glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>T'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"e RT'glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>)glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>'m\n\nThe Group intends to apply predominantly the General Model to measure its Provident and Health insurance contracts (borrower insurance, funeral, dependency\u2026 contracts) and the Simplified  approach  for  its  property  and  casualty  insurance contracts (personal injury, means of payment, multi-risk home insurance, etc.).\n\n## PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\nOn the consolidated income statement, the profits and losses related to  the  insurance  contracts  issued  and  the  reinsurance  contracts  are presented  under  net  banking  income,  distinguishing  between,  on one/uni00A0side:\n\n- the income from the insurance and reinsurance contracts issued; p\n- the expenses for the services relating to the insurance and reinsurance p contracts issued; and\n\n|\n\n- the income and expenses relating to the reinsurance contracts held; p\n\nand on the other side:\n\n- the financial income and expenses of the insurance and reinsurance p contracts issued; and\n- the financial income and expenses of the reinsurance contracts held. p\n\nThe expenses for the services relating to the insurance and reinsurance contracts issued as well as the expenses for the reinsurance contracts held  will  then  include  the  share  of  operating  expenses  directly attributable  to  the  execution  of  the  contracts  which  will  thus  be deducted from the net banking income.\n\nMany  insurance  contracts  include  an  investment  component  in  the form of a deposit made by the policyholder and which the insurer is contractually required to repay even if the insured event doesn't occur. Even if they may take the contractual form of insurance premiums and services,  the  deposits  collection  and  repayment  flows  do  not constitute either income or expenses in relation to these contracts.\n\nThe financial income and expenses of the insurance and reinsurance contracts  mainly  include  the  variations  in  value  of  the  groups  of contracts relating to the impacts of the time value of money and of the financial risks not taken into account in the estimated flows.\n\n## TRANSITION\n\nAt  this  stage  of  the  project  aiming  at  implementing  the  IFRS/uni00A017  and IFRS/uni00A09/uni00A0standards  by  the  Group's  insurance  entities,  the consequences of  its  application  in  terms  of  amounts  in  the  consolidated  financial statements cannot be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Application of the IFRS 17 standard\n\nThe  initial  application  of  IFRS/uni00A017  as  at  1/uni00A0January  2023  will  be retrospective  and  the  comparative  figures  on  the  2022  financial  year will be restated.\n\nThe differences in measurement of the insurance assets and liabilities resulting from the retrospective application of IFRS/uni00A017 as at 1/uni00A0January 2022 will be presented directly under 'Equity'.\n\nThe retrospective measurement of these assets and liabilities, and in particular  of  the  different  insurance  contract  portfolios,  may  be subject  to  simplified  approaches  when  the  historical  data  necessary for a completely retrospective application are not available. The/uni202Fstandard then allows for the use of:\n\n- either  an  adjusted  retrospective  approach  which  should,  provide, p based on the reasonable information available without undue cost or  effort,  for  measurements  that  are  as  close  as  possible  to  those that would result from the retrospective application of the standard;\n- or  an  approach  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  insurance  contract p portfolios as at 1/uni00A0January 2022.\n\nThe Group intends to apply a retrospective approach adjusted for  the  Savings  Life-insurance  contracts  and  the  Retirement savings  contracts  which  represent  the  large  majority  of  its contracts.  The  Protection-Damage  contracts  might  be  subject to a full retrospective approach while a case-by-case approach is examined for the Protection-Provident contracts.",

The  other financial  assets  (available  for  sale  financial  assets)  mainly consist of:\n\n- basic  financial  instruments  -  the  cashflows  of  which p correspond  solely  to  the  repayment  of  principal  and  the payment  of  interest  on  the  principal  due  -  (see  Note/uni00A04.3.2) held in the framework of a 'Held to Collect and Sell' business model; these instruments will be reclassified under 'Financial Assets at Fair Value through Equity';\n- non-basic  financial  instruments:  these  instruments  will  be p reclassified  under  'Financial  Assets  at  Fair  Value  through Profit  or  Loss'.  The  unrealised  gains  or  losses  previously recognised  in  equity  will  be  reclassified  as  consolidated reserves (no impact on the Group's shareholders' equity).\n\nOwing to the credit quality of the assets held (see Note/uni00A04.3.4), the application of the provisions of IFRS/uni00A09 on the recognition of the expected credit losses should lead only to a limited increase in their impairments.\n\n## Use of estimates and judgment NOTE 1.5\n\nWhen  applying  the  accounting  principles  disclosed  in  the  following notes for the purpose of preparing the Group's consolidated financial statements, the Management makes assumptions and estimates that may have an impact on the figures recorded in the income statement, on  the  Unrealised  or  deferred  gains  and  losses  on  the  valuation  of assets  and  liabilities  in  the  balance  sheet,  and  on  the  information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn order to make these assumptions and estimates, the Management uses  the  information  available  at  the  date  of  preparation  of  the consolidated  financial  statements  and  can  exercise  its  judgment. By/uni202Fnature, valuations based on estimates involve risks and uncertainties concerning their occurrence in the future. Consequently, the  actual  future  results  may  differ  from  these  estimates  and  have  a significant impact on the financial statements.\n\nThe  assumptions  and  estimates  made  for  the  preparation  of  these consolidated  financial  statements  take  into  account  of  uncertainties about  the  consequences,  duration  and  magnitude  of  the  economic crisis generated by the Covid-19 pandemic. The effects of this crisis on the  assumptions  and  estimates  used  are  specified  in  the  6 th /uni00A0part  of this/uni202Fnote.\n\n## ORGANISATION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMME OF THE IFRS 9 AND IFRS 17 STANDARDS\n\nA 'project' structure has been set up under the joint governance of the Group Finance Division and the Insurance Business Line.\n\nThis governance is articulated around the following main themes/uni00A0with a view to the implementation of the IFRS/uni00A09 and IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0standards by all the insurance entities of the Group, in France and abroad:\n\n- accounting treatments and computational models; p\n- presentation in the Financial statements and Notes; p\n- adaptation of the process; p\n- selection and Rollout of the IT solution. p\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, the work was focused on the review of the different types  of  contracts,  the  analysis  of  their  accounting  treatment  under IFRS/uni00A017 and their presentation in the consolidated financial statements, and, lastly, the identification and selection of solutions in terms of information system, information technology and processes.\n\nIn  2021  the  work  has  been  devoted  to  implementing  new  processes, and approving and rolling out the IT/uni00A0solution.\n\nThe preparatory work will continue in 2022 with the validation of the tool and processes, the finalisation of the accounting treatments and computational models and the production of the opening data as at 1/uni00A0January 2022 and of the comparative information.\n\nThe  use  of  estimates  and  judgment  mainly  concerns  the  following accounting topics:\n\n- the fair value in the balance sheet of financial instruments not listed p on  an  active  market  which  are  classified  as  Financial  assets  and liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss,  Hedging  derivatives, Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income or even Investments of insurance companies (described in Notes/uni00A03.1, 3.2,  3.3,  3.4  and  4.3),  as  well  as  the  fair  value  of  instruments measured  at  amortised  cost  for  which  this  information  must  be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements (see/uni00A0Note/uni00A03.9);\n- the amount of impairment and provisions for credit risk related to p financial assets measured at amortised cost, or at fair value through other comprehensive income, loan commitments granted, and/uni202Fguarantee  commitments  granted  measured  with  models  or internal  assumptions  based  on  historical,  current  and  prospective data (see Note/uni00A03.8).  The  uses  of  estimates  and  judgment  relates  in particular  to  the  assessment  of  the  deterioration  in  credit  risk observed  since  the  initial  recognition  of  financial  assets  and  the measurement  of  the  amount  of  expected  credit  losses  on  these same financial assets;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Several subsidiaries have also applied for transitional authorisation. The regulatory authorities of the United Kingdom have until end 2023 to rule on these applications.\n\nThe Group continues to monitor the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union regarding financial services. To/uni202Fdate, the European  Commission  has  granted  British/uni00A0clearing houses temporary equivalence/uni00A0status until 30/uni00A0June 2022.\n\nThe  Group  remains  vigilant  about  the  possible  future  differences between the local and European regulations and takes account of the short-/mid-/long-term consequences of the Brexit in the assumptions and estimates selected to prepare the consolidated accounts.\n\n## Covid-19 NOTE 1.6\n\nTwo years after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the year 2021 was  marked  by  an  economic  upturn  in  several  major  economies, in/uni202Fparticular as a result of the deployment of vaccines. However, these dynamics  are  affected  by  persistent  frictions  in  the  global  supply chains  and  labour  markets,  and  by  longer  delivery  times  in  the manufacturing sector and a reduced capacity of supply in the service sector, which have led to rising costs. Uncertainties remain regarding new  developments  in  the  sanitary  crisis  (emergence  of  the  Omicron variant and slow deployment of vaccines in some countries).\n\nAgainst this background, the multi-scenario approach selected in 2020 has  been  maintained  for  preparing  the  consolidated  accounts  as  at 31/uni00A0December 2021. The Group thus presents a central scenario central and an alternate protracted crisis scenario.\n\nTo apply the principles underlying the assessment of expected credit losses, the  Group  has  maintained  the  use  of  methodological adjustments to take account of the support measures adopted since 2020 by public authorities, and the specifics of the current period.\n\nThese  various  consequent  to  the  Covid-19  crisis  are  stated  below  to shed light on the financial consequences of the crisis and the way they have been taken into account in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## CLIMATE RISK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate  change  is  accelerating,  and  urgent  and\n\nunprecedented changes are needed more than ever.\n\nAs  illustrated  by  the  6\n\nth\n\n/uni00A0assessment  report  of  the\n\nIntergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC),\n\nthe  world  needs  urgent,  global  and  coordinated\n\naction to contain the now inevitable global warming.\n\nSociete Generale has been engaged in the fight against climate change for many years now. And the Bank remains committed to support an extensive shift towards a decarbonised and more resilient economy.\n\nEnvironmental risk factors are liable to trigger or increase the risks for the Group. The Group thus considers that climate change-related risks are  not  a  new  risk  category  but  rather  an  aggravating  factor  for categories already covered  by  the  risk management  system. The/uni202Fintegration of  climate-related  risks  is  based  on  the  existing governance  and  processes  and  follows  a  standard  approach (identification,  quantification,  definition  of  the  risk  appetite,  control and mitigation).\n\nAmong climate risks, the Group distinguishes between transitional risk and physical risk in compliance with the risk terminology proposed by the  TCFD  (Task  force  on  Climate-related  Financial  Disclosures). The/uni00A0impact  of  transitional risk on the credit risk of Societe Generale's corporate customers has been identified as the major climate risk for the  Group.  To  measure  this  impact,  indicators  aimed  at  reinforcing credit  analysis  on  the  most  exposed  counterparties  in  the  sectors identified as particularly vulnerable are gradually developed.\n\nThe Group continues its work to gradually integrate climate risks in the preparation  of  its  consolidated  accounts  (see  Notes/uni00A02.2,  3,  3.8,  5.3 and/uni00A06).\n\n## MACROECONOMIC SCENARIOS\n\nTo  prepare  its  financial  statements,  the  Group  uses  macroeconomic scenarios in the expected credit loss measurement models including forward-looking data (see Note/uni00A03.8) as well as some asset impairment tests  including  goodwill  (see  Note/uni00A02.2)  and  deferred  tax  assets (see/uni202FNote/uni00A06).\n\nAs at 31/uni00A0December 2021, the Group has maintained the coexistence of four scenarios:\n\n- the central scenario (SG Central), including the assumption that the p GDP in the euro area will be back to a 2019 level in 2022, expects no new  widespread  closures,  and  assumes  that  the  remaining  social distancing  measures,  such  as  masks,  will  enable  most  sectors  to operate almost as usual;\n- a  scenario  of  prolonged  health  crisis  (SG  Extended),  including  the p assumption that the GDP in the euro area will be back to a 2019 level in  2023,  expects  a  new  sanitary  shock  from  the  end  of  2021, reproducing the lockdown pattern with increased social distancing measures as observed at the end of 2020 and in Spring 2021;\n\n|",

The/uni202Ffavourable  scenario  envisages  a  stronger  GDP  growth  than  the central scenario owing to unexpected productivity gains leading to a potentially higher GDP. The stress scenario, including the assumption that the GDP in the euro area will be back to a 2019 level after  2026,  corresponds  to  a  crisis  situation  leading  to  a  negative deviation  in  GDP  compared  to  the  central  scenario.  This  scenario may  result  from  a  financial  crisis  (2008  crisis,  Euro  area  crisis), an/uni202Fexogenous crisis (Covid) or a combination of both.\n\nThese scenarios are developed by the Economic and Sector Research Division  of  Societe  Generale  for  all  the  Group's  entities  based, in/uni202Fparticular, on  information  published  by  statistical  institutes  in each/uni202Fcountry.\n\nForecasts  from  institutions  (IMF,  Global  Bank,  ECB,  OECD\u2026)  and  the consensus among market economists serve as a reference to ensure the consistency of the scenarios thus constructed.\n\nThe illustration below compares the GDP previsions in the Euro area used by the Group for each scenario with the previsions provided by the ECB in December/uni00A02021.\n\n## GDP FORECASTS BY SCENARIO, IN PERCENTAGE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe variables used in the expected credit loss measurement models are presented in Chapter/uni00A04.5.4 of the present Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios used in the credit loss measurement models\n\nThe scenarios provided by the Group's economists are integrated into the  models  over  a  3-year  horizon,  followed  by  a  two  year  period  to return in year five to the average probability of default observed during the  calibration  period.  The  assumptions  made  by  the  Group  with  a view  to  developing  these  macro-economic  scenarios  are  updated  to account  for  the  remaining  uncertainties  regarding  the  Covid-19 pandemic as well as for the economic recovery prospects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Conversely,  the  methodology provides for a higher weight to be assigned to the Stress scenario when the economy moves towards the peak of the cycle. This methodology will be applied and assessed throughout next year to be confirmed by 31/uni00A0December 2022.\n\n|",

The/uni00A0scope of this exercise concerns the outstanding amounts classified as Stage/uni00A01 and Stage/uni00A02 subject to a statistical  modelling of the impacts of the macro-economic variables (75% of the outstanding amounts in Stage/uni00A01/Stage/uni00A02).\n\nThe results of these tests, with no impact on the classification of the outstanding  amounts  concerned,  show  that,  in  the  event  of  a  100% weighting:\n\n- of  the  SG  Stress  scenario,  the  impact  would  be  an  additional p allocation of 381/uni00A0million/uni00A0euros;\n- of  the  SG  Favourable  scenario,  the  impact  would  be  a  reversal  of p 243/uni00A0million euros;\n- of  the  SG  Central  scenario,  the  impact  would  be  a  reversal  of p 150/uni00A0million euros;\n- of  the  SG  Extended  scenario,  the  impact  would  be  a  reversal  of p 64/uni00A0million euros.\n\n## Covid-19 support measures\n\n## d\"%R'\"%glyph<c=28,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>(di\n\nThe  moratoriums  granted  in  the  context  of  the  sanitary  crisis  through mass treatment have now expired, with a resumption of reimbursements without incident for most customers.\n\nAt  the  end  of  December/uni00A02021,  out  of  a  total  of  24.9/uni00A0billion  euros  of former  moratoriums,  EUR/uni00A06/uni00A0billion  of  these  outstanding  loans  are classified  in  Stage/uni00A02  (compared  to  7.5/uni00A0billion  euros  as  at  31/uni00A0December 2020) and EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0billion have been downgraded to Stage/uni00A03 (compared to EUR/uni00A00.7/uni00A0billion  as  at  31/uni00A0December  2020).  The  evolution  of  outstanding loans  classified  in  Stage/uni00A03  (without  a  predominant  sector)  remains consistent with the level of doubtful outstanding loans of the Group.\n\nAny  request  to  extend  these  moratoriums  will  not  be  considered  as part  of  general  measures,  and  the  outstanding  loans  related  to  such request  will  be  treated  as  restructured  loans  as  defined  in  the Accounting Principles section in Note/uni00A03.8.\n\n## glyph<c=31,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\"Rei i(##\"%'glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=23,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> Sm 'glyph<c=27,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold> glyph<c=26,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>\")glyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>%edglyph<c=24,font=/KQJOZS+Montserrat-ExtraBold>e'\n\nIn  France,  in  addition  to  the  moratoriums,  the  Group  entities  have contributed  to  the  implementation  of  support  measures  decided  by the  authorities  through  the  examination  and  allocation  of  State Guaranteed Loan facilities  ( Pr\u00eats  Garantis  par  l'Etat -  PGE  in  French) and Participatory Recovery Loans ( Pr\u00eats Participatifs Relance - PPR).\n\n## State Guaranteed Loans ( Pr\u00eats Garantis par l'\u00c9tat - PGE)\n\nThus, the Group will offer, until 30/uni00A0June 2022, to its customers affected by the crisis (professionals and corporate customers), the allocation of State  Guaranteed  Loan  facilities  (PGE)  within  the  framework  of  the 2020  French  Amending  Finance  Act  and  the  conditions  set  by  the French decree of 23/uni00A0March 2020. These/uni00A0are financings granted at cost price and guaranteed by the government for a share of the borrowed\n\namount between 70 to 90% depending on the size of the borrowing enterprise (with a waiting period of two months after disbursement at the  end  of  which  the  guarantee  period  begins).  With  a  maximum amount  corresponding,  in  the  general  case,  to  three  months  of turnover  before  tax,  these  loans  come  with  a  one-year  repayment exemption. At the end of this year, the customer can either repay the loan or amortise it over one to five more years, with the possibility of extending the grace period for the repayment of principal for one year (in  line  with  the  announcements  made  by  the  French  ' Ministre  de l'\u00c9conomie, des Finances et de la Relance ' on 14/uni00A0January 2021) without extending the total duration of the loan. The remuneration conditions of the guarantee are set by the State and are applicable by all French banking  institutions:  the  Bank  keeps  only  a  share  of  the  guarantee premium paid by the borrower (the amount of which depends on the size  of  the  Company  and  the  maturity  of  the  loan)  remunerating  the risk it bears, which corresponds to the part of the loan not guaranteed by the State ( i.e. , between 10% and 30% of the loan depending on the size of the borrowing company).\n\nThe  State  Guaranteed  Loans  contractual  characteristics  are  those  of basic loans (SPPI criterion) and these loans are held by the Group as part of a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows until their maturity; as a result, these loans have been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet under Customer loans at amortised cost. In accordance with the amortised cost method, the frequency of recognition  in  the  income  statement  of  the  share  of  guarantee premiums  retained  by  the  Bank  is  determined  during  the  initial recording  of  the  state-guaranteed  loans  (PGE)  based  on  their estimated  repayment  schedules.  Any  subsequent  change  in  the expected flows of these premiums resulting from the actual repayment terms (depending on the choice made by borrowers at the end of the first year of grace period and on the possibility to extend this period for another  year)  results  in  the  immediate  recognition  in  the  income statement of the updated amount of additional guarantee premiums that the Bank will receive.\n\nAs  at  31/uni00A0December  2021,  based  on  respondents  representing  75%  of the outstanding loans, nearly half of the state-guaranteed loans have benefited  from  a  second  year  of  grace  period  for  the  repayment  of principal and some 15% have been repaid at the end of the first year of grace  period.  The  State  Guaranteed  Loans  granted  by  the  Group represent  a  credit  outstanding  of  approximately  16.6/uni00A0billion  euros (of/uni202Fwhich  4.4/uni00A0billion/uni00A0euros  classified  in  Stage/uni00A02  and  0.9/uni00A0billion  euros  in Stage/uni00A03).  The  State  Guaranteed  Loans  granted  by  the  French  Retail Banking amount to 14.3/uni00A0billion euros (of which EUR/uni00A04/uni00A0billion classified in  Stage/uni00A02  and  EUR/uni00A00.7/uni00A0billion  in  Stage/uni00A03),  without  predominance  of  a specific sector; the State guarantee for these loans covers, on average, 81% of their amount. The adjusted assumptions relating to repayment terms and conditions had no material impact on the Group's financial statements as at 31 December 2021.\n\nWhen initially  recognised,  these  loans  are  recorded  at  their  nominal value,  as  the  Group  considers  that  it  is  representative  of  their  fair value;  and  an  impairment  for  expected  credit  loss  based  on  a probability of default at one year is recorded taking into account the effects  of  the  guarantee  insofar  as  it  is  an  integral  part  of  the  loan. The/uni202Fmodels  for  calculating  expected  credit  losses  also  take  into account  the  probabilities  of  exercise  of  the  extension  options, the/uni202Famount  of  the  loan  not  guaranteed  by  the  State  as  well  as  the waiting period in the enforcement of the guarantee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  aims  at  providing  small  and  medium entities  (SME)  and  mid-market  companies  with  new  long-term, quasi-equity-like,  financing.  PPR  are  granted  for  eight  years,  with  a grace period of four years. They bear market-based interest rates and do  not  include  the  right  to  participate  in  the  borrowing  company's profits. 90% of the PPR thus granted are immediately transferred to a specialised  investment  fund  whose  shares  are  purchased  mainly  by insurance companies and which are guaranteed by the French State up to 30% of the amount of money invested.\n\nThe  amount  of  PPR  granted  as  at  31/uni00A0December  2021  remains non-significant at Group level.\n\n## Amounts restated compared to the financial statements published for 2020 NOTE 1.7\n\nThe Group restated some comparative amounts with respect to the financial statements published for 2020.

        "page_content": "## CONSOLIDATION NOTE 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe various activities of the Societe Generale group in France and abroad are carried out by Societe/uni202FGenerale -  Parent company (which includes the Societe Generale foreign branches) and by all of the entities that it controls either directly or indirectly (subsidiaries and joint arrangements) or on which it exercises significant influence (associates). All of these entities make up the scope of the Group/uni202Fconsolidation.\n\nConsolidation uses a standardised accounting process to give an aggregated presentation of the accounts of  Societe  Generale  -  Parent  company  and  its  subsidiaries,  joint  arrangements  and  associates, presented/uni202Fas if they were a single entity.\n\nTo do so, the individual accounts of the entities that make up the Group are restated so that they are in accordance with IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, in order to present consistent information in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn  addition,  the  accounting  balances  (assets,  liabilities,  income  and  expense)  generated  by  transactions between Group entities are eliminated through the consolidation process so that the consolidated financial statements present only the transactions and results made with third parties outside of the/uni202FGroup.\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Societe Generale include the financial statements of the parent company and of the main French and foreign companies as well as foreign branches over which the Group exercises control as well as a portion of the financial statements of the companies over which the Group exercises joint control or significant influence.\n\n## Consolidated entities\n\n## SUBSIDIARIES\n\nSubsidiaries  are  the  entities  over  which  the  Group  has  exclusive  control.  The  Group  controls  an  entity  if  and  only  if  the  three  following conditions are met:\n\n- the Group has power over the entity (ability to direct its relevant activities, i.e. the activities that significantly affect the entity's returns), p through the holding of voting rights or other rights; and\n- the Group has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity; and p\n- the Group has the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of the Group's returns. p\n\n## Power\n\nWhen determining voting rights for the purpose of establishing the Group's degree of control over an entity and the appropriate consolidation method, potential voting rights are taken into account where they can be freely exercised at the time the assessment is made or at the latest when decisions about the direction of the relevant activities need to be made. Potential voting rights are instruments such as call options on ordinary shares outstanding on the market or rights to convert bonds into new ordinary shares.\n\nSome rights are designed to protect the interests of their holder (protective rights) without giving that party power over the investee to which those rights relate.\n\nIf  there  are  several  investors,  each  with  substantive  rights  that  give  them  the  unilateral  ability  to  direct  different  relevant  activities, the/uni202Finvestor  with  that  has  the  current  ability  to  direct  the  activities  that  most  significantly  affect  the  variable  returns  of  the  investee  is presumed to have power over the investee.\n\n## Exposure to variable returns\n\nControl exists only if the Group is significantly exposed to the variability of variable returns generated by its investment or its involvement in the entity. These returns, which could be dividends, interest, fees,/uni00A0etc., can/uni00A0be only positive, only negative or both positive and negative.\n\n## Link between power and variable returns\n\nTo assess the link between power and variable returns, if the Group has been delegated decision-making rights that it exercises on behalf and for the benefit of third parties (the principals), it is presumed to act as an agent for these principals, and therefore it does not control the entity when it exercises its decision-making power. In asset management activities, an analysis shall be performed in order to determine whether the asset manager is acting as agent or principal when managing the net assets of a fund; the fund is presumed to be controlled by the asset manager if the latter is considered as a principal.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Special case of structured entities\n\nA structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. Such is the case, for example, when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.\n\nA  structured  entity  often  presents  certain  characteristics  such  as  a  limited  business  activity,  a  specific  and  carefully  defined  purpose, or/uni202Finsufficient  capital  to  fund  its  activities without the use of subordinated financing. Structured entities may assume different legal forms: stock companies, partnerships, securitisation vehicles, mutual funds, unincorporated entities,/uni00A0etc.\n\nWhen assessing the existence of control over a structured entity, all facts and circumstances shall be considered among which:\n\n- the purpose and design of the entity; p\n- the structuring of the entity; p\n- risks to which the entity is exposed by way of its design and the Group's exposure to some or all of these risks; p\n- potential returns and benefits for the Group. p\n\nUnconsolidated structured entities are those that are not exclusively controlled by the Group.\n\n## JOINT ARRANGEMENTS\n\nThrough a joint arrangement (either a joint operation or a joint venture) the Group exercises joint control over an entity if decisions about the direction of its  relevant  activities  require  the  unanimous  consent  of  the  parties  that  collectively  control  the  entity.  Assessing  joint  control requires an analysis of the rights and obligations of all the parties. In the case of a joint operation, the parties to the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities.\n\nIn the case of a joint venture, the parties have rights to the net assets of the entity.\n\n## ASSOCIATES\n\nAssociates are companies over which the Group exercises significant influence and are accounted for using the equity method in the Group's consolidated financial statements. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policies of an entity without exercising  control.  In  particular,  significant  influence  can  result  from  Societe  Generale  being  represented  on  the  Board  of  Directors  or Supervisory  Board,  from  its  involvement  in  strategic  decisions,  from  the  existence  of  significant  intercompany  transactions,  from  the exchange  of  management  staff,  or  from  the  company's  technical  dependency  on  Societe  Generale.  The  Group  is  assumed  to  exercise significant influence over the financial and operating policies of an entity when it directly or indirectly holds at least 20% of the voting rights in this entity.\n\n## Consolidation rules and methods\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are built up from the financial statements of the entities that are included in the consolidation scope. Companies with a fiscal year ending more than three months before or after that of Societe Generale prepare proforma statements for a twelve-month period ended 31/uni00A0December. All significant balances, profits and transactions between Group companies are eliminated.\n\nThe results of newly acquired subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from their effective acquisition date while the results of subsidiaries disposed of during the fiscal year are included up to the date where the Group relinquished control.\n\n## CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nThe subsidiaries, including the structured entities over which the Group has exclusive control, are fully consolidated.\n\nIn the consolidated balance sheet, full consolidation consists in replacing the value of the subsidiary's equity securities held by the Group with each  of  the  subsidiary's  assets  and  liabilities,  in  addition  to  the  goodwill  recognised  when  the  Group  assumed  control  over  the  entity (see/uni202FNote/uni00A02.2). In the income statement and the statement of net income and unrealised or deferred gains and losses, the/uni00A0subsidiary's expense and income items are aggregated with those of the Group.\n\nThe portion of non-controlling interests in the subsidiary is presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement. However, in consolidated structured entities that are controlled by the Group, the portions of these entities not owned by the Group are recognised as Debt in the balance sheet.\n\nIn the case of a joint operation, the Group distinctly recognises in its consolidated financial statements its share in the assets and liabilities as well as its share in the related revenue and expense.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method in the consolidated financial statements of the Group. Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is recognised, on initial recognition, under Investments accounted for using the equity method at the cost of the Group's investment in the joint venture or associate, including goodwill and after the date of acquisition the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the changes in the investor's share in the net asset value of the investee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

If  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  investment (value/uni202Fin use or market value net of selling costs, whichever is higher) is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded on the balance  sheet  at  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment.  Impairment  allowances  and  reversals  are  recorded  under  Net  income  from investments accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe Group's share in the entity's net income and unrealised or deferred gains and losses is presented on separate lines in the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of net income and unrealised or deferred gains and losses. If the Group's share in the losses of an entity consolidated using the equity method becomes greater than or equal to its ownership interest in the company, the Group ceases to recognise its share in subsequent losses unless it is required to do so by legal or implied obligations, in/uni00A0which case it records a provision  for  said  losses.  Capital  gains  and  losses  generated  on  the  disposal  of  companies  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  are recorded under Net income/expense from other assets.\n\n## TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN ENTITY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe balance sheet items of consolidated companies reporting in foreign currencies are translated into euro at the official exchange rates prevailing at the closing date. Income statement items of these companies are translated into euros, at the average month-end exchange rates.  Gains  and losses arising from the translation of capital, reserves, retained earnings and income are recognised under Unrealised or deferred  gains  and  losses  -  Translation  differences.  Gains  and  losses  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  capital  contribution  of  foreign branches of Group banks are also included in changes in consolidated shareholders' equity under the same heading.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  option  allowed  under  IFRS/uni00A01,  the  Group  allocated  all  differences  arising  on  translation  of  foreign  entity  financial statements at 1/uni00A0January 2004 to consolidated reserves. As a result, if any of these entities are sold, the proceeds from the sale will only include write-backs of those translation differences arising since 1/uni00A0January 2004.\n\n## CHANGES IN GROUP'S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN A CONSOLIDATED ENTITY\n\nIn the event of an increase in Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary over which it already exercises control, the differences between the price paid for the additional stake and the assessed fair value of the proportion of net assets acquired at this date is recorded under Retained earnings, Group share.\n\nAlso, in the event of a reduction in the Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary over which it keeps control, the difference between the selling price and the carrying amount of the share of interests sold is recorded under Retained earnings, Group share.\n\nThe costs related to these transactions are recognised directly in equity.\n\nWhen the Group losses control of a consolidated subsidiary, any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured at fair value through profit or loss, at the same time the capital gain or loss is recorded under Net income/expense from assets in the consolidated income statement.  The  gains  or  losses  on  disposals  include  a  share  of  goodwill  previously  allocated  to  the  cash-generating  units  to  which  the subsidiary belongs. This share's determination is based on a normative capital allocated to the subsidiary that is sold and to the portion of cash-generating unit that is retained.\n\n## Commitments to buy out minority shareholders in fully consolidated subsidiaries\n\nIn some fully consolidated Group subsidiaries, the Group has awarded minority shareholders commitments to buy out their stakes. For the Group,  these  buyout  commitments  are  put  option  sales  (put  options  without  transfer  of  the  risks  and  advantages  associated  with  the ownership interest before the option's exercise). The exercise price for these options can be established using a formula agreed upon at the time of the acquisition of the shares in the subsidiary that takes into account its future performance. It can also be set as the fair value of these shares at the exercise date of the options.\n\nThe commitments are recorded as follows:\n\n- in accordance with IAS/uni00A032, the Group records a financial liability for the put options granted to minority shareholders of the subsidiaries p over which it exercises control. This liability is initially recognised at the present value of the estimated exercise price of the put options under Other liabilities;\n- the obligation to recognise a liability even though the put options have not been exercised means that, in order to be consistent, the Group p must use the same accounting treatment as the one applied to transactions in Non-controlling interests. As a result, the counterpart of this liability is a write-down in value of non-controlling interests underlying the options, with any balance deducted from Retained earnings, Group share;\n- subsequent  variations  in  this  liability  (linked  to  changes  in  the  estimated  exercise  price  of  the  options  and  the  carrying  value  of p Non-controlling interests) are recorded in full in Retained earnings, Group share;\n- if the buy-out takes place, the liability is settled by the cash payment linked to the acquisition of non-controlling interests in the subsidiary. p However  if,  when  the  commitment  reaches  its  term,  the  buy-out  has  not  occurred,  the  liability  is  written  off  against  Non-controlling interests and Retained earnings, Group share for their respective portions;\n- as  long  as  the  options  have  not  been  exercised,  the  results  linked  to  Non-controlling  interests  with  a  put  option  are  recorded  under p Non-controlling interests on the Group's consolidated income statement.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Consolidation scope NOTE 2.1\n\nThe consolidation scope includes subsidiaries and structured entities under the Group's exclusive control, joint arrangements (joint ventures and  joint  operations)  and  associates  whose  financial  statements  are significant  relative  to  the  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements, notably regarding Group consolidated total assets and gross operating income.\n\nThe  main  change  to  the  consolidation  scope  at  31/uni00A0December  2021, compared  with  the  scope  applicable  at  the  closing  date  of 31/uni00A0December 2020, is as follow.\n\n## TRANSFER OF THE ASSET MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES PERFORMED BY LYXOR\n\nOn 31/uni00A0December 2021, the Group finalised with Amundi the transfer of the  asset  management  activities  performed  by  Lyxor.  This  transfer concerns  the  passive  (ETF)  as  well  as  active  (including  alternative) asset  management  activities  performed  by  Lyxor  on  behalf  of institutional customers  in  France  and  abroad;  it/uni00A0includes the commercial and support functions dedicated to these activities.\n\n## Goodwill NOTE 2.2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen  the  Group  acquires  a  company,  it  integrates  in  its  consolidated  balance  sheet  all  of  the  new subsidiary's assets and liabilities at fair value.\n\nBut the acquisition price of a company is generally higher than the net revalued amount of its assets and liabilities.  The  excess  value,  called  goodwill,  can  represent  part  of  the  Company's  intangible  capital (reputation, quality of its personnel, market shares,/uni00A0etc.) which contributes to its overall value, or the value of the future synergies that the Group hopes to develop by integrating the new subsidiary in its existing activities.\n\nIn the consolidated balance sheet, the goodwill is recognised as an intangible asset, the useful life of which is presumed to be unlimited; it is not amortised and therefore does not generate any recurring expense in the Group's future results.\n\nHowever, every year, the Group assesses whether the value of its goodwill has not depreciated. If it has, an irreversible expense is immediately recognised in the Group results, which indicates that the profitability of the  intangible  capital  of  the  acquired  entity  is  inferior  to  initial  expectations,  or  that  the  anticipated synergies have not been fulfilled.\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nThe Group uses the acquisition method to recognise its business combinations in accordance with IFRS/uni00A03 'Business Combinations'.\n\nOn the acquisition date, the acquisition cost is calculated as the total fair value of all assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued in exchange for the control of the acquired entity. The/uni00A0costs directly linked to business combinations are recognised in profit or loss for the period except those related to the issuance of equity or debt instruments.\n\nAny contingent consideration is included in the acquisition cost at its fair value on the acquisition date, even if its occurrence is only potential. It  is  recognised under equity or debt in the balance sheet depending on the settlement alternatives. If recognised as debt, any subsequent adjustment is recorded under income for financial liabilities in accordance with IFRS/uni00A09 and within the scope of the appropriate standards for other debts. If recognised as equity instruments, these subsequent adjustments are not recorded.\n\nOn the acquisition date, as required by IFRS/uni00A03, all assets, liabilities, off-balance sheet items and contingent liabilities of this new subsidiary (even if they were not recognised before the combination) are measured individually at their fair value regardless of their purpose. At the same  time,  non-controlling  interests  are  valued  according  to  their  share  of  the  fair  value  of  the  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  of  the acquired entity. However, for each business combination, the Group may also choose to measure non-controlling interests initially at their fair value, in which case a fraction of goodwill is allocated.\n\nThis transfer resulted in a EUR/uni00A00.4/uni00A0billion decrease in the Group's total balance  sheet  including  the  EUR/uni00A0223/uni00A0million  decrease  in  goodwill allocated to the Asset and Wealth Management CGU (see Note/uni00A02.2).\n\nA  pre-tax  capital  gain  of  EUR/uni00A0439/uni00A0million  is  recognised  under  Net Income on other assets in the 2021 Income statement.\n\n## POST-CLOSING EVENT: ACQUISITION PROJECT\n\nOn 6/uni00A0January 2022, the Group announced the signing by Societe/uni202FGenerale and  ALD  of  two  agreements  providing  for  the acquisition by ALD of 100% of the capital of Lease Plan (the net book value of which would amount approximately to EUR/uni00A03.5/uni00A0billion) before end 2022.\n\nThe total acquisition price of EUR/uni00A04.9/uni00A0billion would be paid in cash for EUR/uni00A02/uni00A0billion and  in  shares  representing  an  ownership  interest  of 30.75% in the ALD capital upon completion of the transaction.\n\nFollowing  the  transaction,  Societe  Generale  would  remain  majority shareholder of ALD with an ownership interest of approximately 53% at the closing of the transaction which might be decreased to around 51% were Lease Plan shareholders to exercise their warrants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Any deficit is immediately recognised in profit or loss.\n\nOn the acquisition date, any stake in this entity already held by the Group is remeasured at fair value through profit or loss. In the case of a step acquisition, goodwill is therefore determined by referring to the fair value on the acquisition date.\n\nThe analyses and professional appraisals required for this initial valuation must be carried out within 12/uni00A0months as from the acquisition date, as  must  any  corrections  to  the  value  based  on  new  information  related  to  facts  and  circumstances  existing  at  the  acquisition  date. Goodwill/uni202Fand non-controlling interests initially recorded are consequently adjusted.\n\nOn  the  acquisition  date,  each  item  of  goodwill  is  allocated  to  one  or  more  cash-generating  units  expected  to  derive  benefits  from  the acquisition. When the Group reorganises its reporting structure in a way that changes the composition of one or more cash-generating units, goodwill previously allocated to modified units is reallocated to the units affected (new or existing). This reallocation is generally performed using a relative approach based on the normative capital requirements of each cash-generating unit affected.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed regularly by the Group and tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that its value may have diminished, and at least once a year. Any impairment of goodwill is calculated based on the recoverable value of the relevant cash-generating unit(s).\n\nIf the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit(s) is less than its (their) carrying amount, an irreversible impairment is recorded in the consolidated income statement for the period under Value adjustment on goodwill.\n\nAs at 31/uni00A0December 2021, goodwill is split into the following ten Cash-Generating Units (CGUs):\n\n## Pillars\n\nActivities\n\n| French Retail Banking                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| France Networks                                     | Societe Generale's retail banking network, Boursorama online banking activities, consumer and equipment financing in France, retail banking network of Cr\u00e9dit du Nord and its 7 regional banks            |\n| International Retail Banking and Financial Services |                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Europe                                              | Retail  banking  and  consumer  finance  services  in  Europe,  notably  in Germany  (Hanseatic  Bank,  BDK),  Italy  (Fiditalia),  France  (CGL),  Czech Republic (KB, Essox), Romania (BRD)             |\n| Russia                                              | Banking group Rosbank and its subsidiaries                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Africa, Mediterranean Basin and Overseas            | Retail banking and consumer finance in Africa, the Mediterranean Basin and Overseas, including in Morocco (SGMA), Algeria (SGA), Tunisia (UIB), Cameroon (SGBC), C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (SGBCI) and Senegal (SGBS) |\n| Insurance                                           | Life  and  non-life  insurance  activities  in  France  and  abroad  (including Sog\u00e9cap, Sogessur, Oradea Vie and Antarius)                                                                               |\n| Equipment and Vendor Finance                        | Financing  of  sales  and  professional  equipment  by  Societe  Generale Equipment Finance                                                                                                               |\n| Global Banking and Investor Solutions               |                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Global Markets and Investor Services                | Market solutions for businesses, financial institutions, the public sector, family  offices  and  a  full  range  of  securities  services,  clearing  services, execution, prime brokerage and custody   |\n| Financing and Advisory                              | Advisory  and  financing  services  for  businesses,  financial  institutions, the public sector and transaction and payment management services                                                          |\n| Asset and Wealth Management                         | Asset and Wealth Management Solutions in France and abroad                                                                                                                                                |\n\n|",

This project is subject to consultation with social  partners  and  to  approval  by  the  competent  authorities. Its/uni202Fimpacts  on  the  financial  statements  as  at  31/uni00A0December  2021  are presented below as well as in Note/uni00A08.1.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  monitoring  and  steering  of  the  Group's  activities evolved  during  the  2021  financial  year:  they  are  now  unique  and overall for the Retail banking networks of Societe Generale and Credit du  Nord.  These  activities  are  integrated  into  a  single  budget  whose flows  are  largely  independent  of  the  flows  generated  by  the  other assets or groups of assets of the Group by 2023.\n\nConsequently, the  Group  changed  the  composition  of  its  CGUs  as  at 31/uni00A0December  2021  and  integrated  the  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  CGU  (Retail banking network of Cr\u00e9dit du Nord and its seven regional banks) into the  Societe/uni00A0Generale  networks  CGU  (Societe  Generale  Retail  banking network,  Boursorama  online  banking  activities,  consumer  and equipment credit in France). The new name of CGU thus modified is France/uni00A0Networks.\n\nThe table below shows the changes over the year 2020 in the values of goodwill of Cash-Generating Units/uni00A0(CGUs):\n\n| (In EURm)                                          | Value as at 31.12.2020   | Acquisitions and other increases   | Disposals and other decreases   | Transfers   | Impairment   | Value as at 31.12.2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|\n| French Retail Banking                              | 797                      | 34                                 | -                               | -           | -            | 831                      |\n| French Network (1)                                 | 286                      | 34                                 | -                               | 511         | -            | 831                      |\n| Cr\u00e9dit du Nord                                     | 511                      | -                                  | -                               | (511)       | -            |                          |\n| International Retail  Banking & Financial Services | 2,730                    | -                                  | -                               | -           | (114)        | 2,616                    |\n| Europe                                             | 1,361                    | -                                  | -                               | -           | -            | 1,361                    |\n| Russia                                             | -                        | -                                  | -                               | -           | -            | -                        |\n| Africa, Mediterranean Basin and Overseas           | 228                      | -                                  | -                               | -           | (114)        | 114                      |\n| Insurance                                          | 335                      | -                                  | -                               | -           | -            | 335                      |\n| Equipment and Vendor Finance                       | 228                      | -                                  | -                               | -           | -            | 228                      |\n| Auto Leasing Financial Services                    | 578                      | -                                  | -                               | -           | -            | 578                      |\n| Global Banking and Investor Solutions              | 517                      | -                                  | (223)                           | -           | -            | 294                      |\n| Global Markets and Investor Services               | -                        | -                                  | -                               | -           | -            | -                        |\n| Financing and Advisory                             | 57                       | -                                  | -                               | -           | -            | 57                       |\n| Asset and Wealth Management (2)                    | 460                      | -                                  | (223)                           | -           | -            | 237                      |\n| TOTAL                                              | 4,044                    | 34                                 | (223)                           | -           | (114)        | 3,741                    |\n\n- The CGU Societe Generale Networks was renamed France Networks as at 31/uni00A0December 2021 (see section France Retail banks Projects). (1)\n- Corresponds to the decrease in goodwill related to the disposal of Lyxor (see Note/uni00A02.1). (2)\n\n## ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF CGU\n\nThe Group performed an annual impairment test at 31/uni00A0December 2021 for each CGU to which goodwill had been allocated.\n\nA  CGU  is  defined  as  the  smallest  identifiable  group  of  assets  that generates  cash  inflows,  which  are  largely  independent  of  the  cash inflows from the Group's other assets or groups of assets. Impairment tests  consist  into  assessing  the  recoverable  value  of  each  CGU  and comparing it with its carrying value. An irreversible impairment loss is recorded  in  the  income  statement  if  the  carrying  value  of  a  CGU, including goodwill, exceeds its recoverable value. This loss is booked under Value adjustment on goodwill.\n\nThe recoverable amount of a CGU is calculated using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method applied to the entire CGU.\n\nThe key principles retained for the implementation of annual tests for the assessment of the recoverable value of CGUs are as follows:\n\n- for  each  CGU,  estimates  of  future  distributable  dividends  are p determined  over  a  five-year  period,  on  the  basis  of  a  four-year budget trajectory (2022-2025) extrapolated to 2026, the latter year being used to calculate the terminal value;\n- these estimates take into account the equity target allocated to each p CGU,  unchanged  compared  to  31/uni00A0December  2020  (11%  of  the risk-weighted assets of each CGU);\n- the  growth  rates  used  to  calculate  the  terminal  value  are p determined  using  forecasts  on  sustainable  long-term  economic growth  and  inflation.  These  rates  are  estimated  using  two  main sources, namely the International Monetary Fund and the economic analyses produced by SG Cross Asset Research which provides 2026 forecasts;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

This  risk  premium,  specific  to  each activity, is calculated from a series of equity risk premiums published by SG Cross Asset Research and from its specific estimated volatility (beta). Where appropriate, the risk-free rate is also grossed up by a sovereign  risk  premium,  representing  the  difference  between  the\n\nrisk-free  rate  available  in  the  area  of  monetary  assignment  (mainly US dollar area or Euro area) and the interest rate observed on liquid long-term treasury bonds issued (mainly US dollar area or Euro area), in  proportion  with  risk-weighted  assets  for  CGUs  covering  several countries.

Local regulatory requirements  may  concern  regulatory  capital,  exchange  controls  or non-convertibility  of  the  local  currency  (as  it  is  the  case  in  countries belonging to the West African Economic and Monetary Union or to the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa), liquidity ratios (as in the United States) or large exposures ratios that aim to cap the entity's  exposure in relation to the Group (regulatory requirement to be  fulfilled  in  most  countries  in  Eastern  and  Central  Europe, Maghreb/uni202Fand sub-Saharan Africa).\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities NOTE 2.4\n\nThe  information  provided  hereafter  concerns  entities  structured  but not controlled by the Group. This information is grouped by main type of similar entities, such as Financing activities, Asset management and Others (including Securitisation and Issuing vehicules).\n\nAsset  financing  includes  lease  finance  partnerships  and  similar vehicles  that  provide  aircraft,  rail,  shipping  or  real  estate  finance facilities.\n\nThe  ability  of  the  Group  to  use  assets  may  also  be  restricted  in  the following cases:\n\n- assets  pledged  as  security  for  liabilities,  notably  guarantees p provided  to  the  central  banks,  or  assets  pledged  as  security  for transactions  in  financial  instruments,  mainly  through  guarantee deposits with clearing houses;\n- securities  that  are  sold  under  repurchase  agreements  or  that  are p lent;\n- assets held by insurance subsidiaries in representation of unit-linked p liabilities with life-insurance policy holders;\n- assets held by consolidated structured entities for the benefit of the p third-party investors that have bought the notes or securities issued by the entity;\n- mandatory deposits placed with central banks. p\n\nAsset  management  includes  mutual  funds  managed  by  the  Group's asset management subsidiaries.\n\nSecuritisation includes securitisation funds or similar vehicles issuing financial instruments that can be subscribed for by investors and that generate credit  risks  inherent  in  an  exposure  or  basket  of  exposures which can be divided into tranches.\n\nThe  Group's  interests  in  unconsolidated  entities  that  have  been structured by third parties are classified among financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheet according to their nature.\n\n## INTERESTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES NOTE 2.4.1\n\nThe Group's interests in an unconsolidated structured entity refer to contractual and non-contractual involvements that expose the Group to  the  variability  of  returns  from  the  performance  of  this  structured entity.\n\nSuch interests can be evidenced by:\n\n- the holding of equity or debt instruments (regardless of their rank of p subordination);\n- other  funding  (loans,  cash  facilities,  loan  commitments,  liquidity p facilities, etc.);\n- credit  enhancement (guarantees, subordinated instruments, credit p derivatives, etc.);\n- issuance of guarantees (guarantee commitments); p\n- derivatives  that  absorb  all  or  part  of  the  risk  of  variability  of  the p structured  entity's  returns,  except  Credit  Default  Swap  (CDS)  and options purchased by the Group;\n- contracts  remunerated  by  fees  indexed  to  the  structured  entity's p performance;\n- tax consolidation agreements. p\n\n|",

The Group's banking activities generally take the form of financial instruments covering a broad spectrum of assets and liabilities, such as loans, investment portfolios (equity, bonds,/uni00A0etc.), deposits, regulated  savings  accounts,  debt  securities  issued  and  derivative  instruments  (swaps,  options,  forward contracts, credit derivatives,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nIn  the  financial  statements,  the  classification  and  valuation  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities  depend  on their contractual characteristics and the way the entity manages those financial instruments.\n\nHowever, this distinction is not applicable to derivative instruments, which are always measured at fair value in the balance sheet, no matter what their purpose is (market activities or hedging transactions).\n\n|",

Classification is based on their contractual cash flow characteristics and the entity's business model for managing the/uni202Fassets.\n\n## Cash /flow characteristics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NON - SPPI\n\n- \u00b7 Complex debt /financial assets\n- Equity /financial assets \u00b7\n- Derivatives instruments \u00b7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCollecting contractual cash /flows\n\nCollecting contractual cash /flows and selling\n\nTrading portfolio\n\n## + Fair value option\n\n(to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## + Fair value through OCI option\n\nwithout subsequent recycling pro/fit or loss (non-trading equity /financial assets)\n\n## Accounting classi/fication\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nFair value through OCI with subsequent recycling in profit or loss\n\nFair value through pro/fit or loss\n\nFair value through pro/fit or loss\n\nFair value through pro/fit or loss\n\nFair value through OCI without subsequent recycling in profit or loss\n\nThe accounting principles for classifying the financial assets require the entity to analyse the contractual cash flows generated by the financial instruments and to analyse the business model for managing the financial instruments.\n\n## ANALYSIS OF CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOW CHARACTERISTICS\n\nThe aim of the analysis of contractual cash flow characteristics is to limit the option of recognising revenues from financial assets using the effective  interest  method  exclusively  to  the  instruments  whose  characteristics  are  similar  to  those  of  a  basic  lending  arrangement, meaning/uni202Ftheir  associated  cash  flows  are  highly  predictable.  All  other  financial  instruments  that  do  not  share  these  characteristics  are measured at fair value through profit or loss, regardless of the business model used to manage them.\n\nThe contractual inflows that represent Solely Payments of Principal and Interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding are consistent with a basic lending arrangement.\n\nIn a basic lending arrangement, interest predominantly consists of a consideration for the time value of money and for credit risk. Interest/uni202Fmay also include a consideration for liquidity risk, administrative costs, and a commercial profit margin. Negative interest is not inconsistent with this definition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAll financial assets that are not basic will be mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss, regardless of the business model for managing them.\n\nDerivatives qualifying as hedging instruments for accounting purposes are recorded on a separate line in the balance sheet (see Note/uni00A03.2).\n\nThe Group can make the irrevocable decision on a security-by-security basis, to classify and measure any equity instrument (shares and other equity securities) that is not held for trading purposes at fair value through other comprehensive income. Subsequently, the profit or loss accumulated  in  other  comprehensive  income  will  never  be  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  (only  dividends  on  these  instruments  will  be recognised as income).\n\n## ANALYSIS OF THE BUSINESS MODEL\n\nThe business model represents how the financial instruments are managed in order to generate cash flows and income.\n\nThe Group uses several business models in the course of exercising its different business lines. Business models are assessed on how groups of  financial  instruments  are  managed  together  to  achieve  a  particular  business  objective.  The  business  model  is  not  assessed  on  an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a portfolio level, considering relevant evidence such as:\n\n- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Group's Management; p\n- how risks related to financial instruments within that business model are managed; p\n- how managers of the business are compensated; p\n- sales of assets realised or expected (value, frequency, purpose). p\n\nTo determine the classification and measurement of financial assets, three different business models shall be distinguished:\n\n- a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows ('Collect' business model); p\n- a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on financial assets and selling these financial assets p ('Collect  and  Sell'  business  model),  a  separate  business  model  for  other  financial  assets,  especially  those  that  are  held  for  trading purposes, where collecting contractual cash flows is only incidental.\n\n## FAIR VALUE OPTION\n\nSPPI financial assets that are not held for trading purposes can be designated, at initial recognition, at fair value through profit or loss if such designation  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  discrepancies  in  the  accounting  treatment  of  the  related  financial  assets  and  liabilities (accounting mismatch).\n\n## Classification of financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified into one of the following two categories:\n\n- financial  liabilities  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss:  these  are  financial  liabilities  held  for  trading  purposes,  which  by  default  include p derivative financial liabilities not qualifying as hedging instruments and non-derivative financial liabilities designated by the Group upon initial recognition to be measured at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option;\n- debts: these include the other non-derivative financial liabilities and are measured at amortised cost. p\n\nDerivative financial assets and liabilities qualifying as hedging instruments are presented on separate lines of the balance sheet (see Note/uni00A03.2).\n\n## Reclassifications of financial assets\n\nReclassifications of financial assets are only required in the exceptional event that the Group changes the business model used to manage these assets.\n\n## Fair value\n\nFair  value  is  the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market participants  at  the  measurement  date.  The  valuation  methods  used  by  the  Group  to  establish  the  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  are detailed in Note/uni00A03.4.\n\n## Initial recognition\n\nFinancial assets are recognised on the balance sheet:\n\n- as at the settlement/delivery date for securities; p\n- as at the trade date for derivatives; p\n- as at the disbursement date for loans. p\n\nFor instruments measured at fair value, changes in fair value between the trade date and the settlement-delivery date are recorded in net income or in other comprehensive income, depending on the accounting classification of the financial assets in question. The trade date is the date on which the contractual commitment becomes binding and irrevocable for the Group.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "Upon initial recognition, the financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value including the transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issuance, except for the financial instruments recognised at fair value through profit or loss, for which these costs are booked directly to the income statement.\n\nIf the initial fair value is exclusively based on observable market data, any difference between the fair value and the transaction price, i.e. the sales margin, is immediately recognised in profit or loss. However, if one of the valuation inputs is not observable or if the used valuation model is not recognised by the market, the/uni00A0recognition of the sales margin is then generally deferred in profit or loss.\n\nFor  some instruments, due to their complexity, this margin is recognised at their maturity or upon disposal in the event of an early sale. When/uni00A0valuation inputs become observable, any portion of the sales margin that has not yet been recorded is then recognised in profit or loss (see Note/uni00A03.4.7).\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group derecognises all or part of a financial asset (or group of similar assets) when the contractual rights to the cash flows on the asset expire or when the Group has transferred the contractual rights to receive the cash flows and substantially all of the risks and rewards linked to ownership of the asset.\n\nThe Group also derecognises financial assets over which it has retained the contractual rights to the associated cash flows but is contractually obligated to pass these same cash flows through to a third party ('pass-through agreement') and for which it has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards.\n\nWhere the Group has transferred the cash flows of a financial asset but has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards  of  its  ownership  and  has  effectively  not  retained  control  of  the  financial  asset,  the  Group  derecognises  it  and,  where  necessary, recognises a separate asset or liability to cover any rights and obligations created or retained as a result of the transfer of the asset. If the Group  has  retained  control  of  the  asset,  it  continues  to  recognise  it  in  the  balance  sheet  to  the  extent  of  its  continuing  involvement  in said/uni202Fasset.\n\nWhen a financial asset is derecognised in its entirety, a gain or loss on disposal is recorded in the income statement for an amount equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the payment received for it, adjusted where necessary for any unrealised profit or loss previously recognised directly in equity and for the value of any servicing asset or servicing liability. Indemnities billed to borrowers following the prepayment of their loan are recorded in profit or loss on the prepayment date in Interest and similar income.\n\nThe  Group  derecognises  all  or  part  of  a  financial  liability  when  it  is  extinguished, i.e. when  the  obligation  specified  in  the  contract  is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\nA financial liability may also be derecognised in the event of a substantial amendment to its contractual conditions or where an exchange is made with the lender for an instrument whose contractual conditions are substantially different.\n\n## Foreign exchange transactions\n\nAt  the  balance  sheet  date,  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  into  the  entity's  functional currency at the prevailing spot exchange rate. Realised or unrealised foreign exchange losses or gains are recognised under Net gains and losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nForward  foreign  exchange  transactions  are  recognised  at  fair  value  based  on  the  forward  exchange  rate  for  the  remaining  maturity. Spot/uni202Fforeign  exchange positions are valued using the official spot rates prevailing at the end of the period. Unrealised gains and losses are recognised in the income statement under Net gains and losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss (see Note/uni00A03.1), except when hedge accounting is applied to a cash-flow hedge transaction or to a hedge of a net investment in a foreign currency operation (see Note/uni00A03.2).\n\nAt  the  balance  sheet  date,  non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  measured  at  fair  value  (in  particular, shares/uni202Fand other  equity  instruments)  are  translated  into  the  entity's  functional  currency  at  the  prevailing  spot  exchange  rate. Foreign/uni202Fexchanges  losses  or  gains  are  recognised  either  in  profit  or  loss  under  Net  gains  and  losses  on  financial  instruments  at  fair  value through profit or loss, or under other comprehensive income (Unrealised and deferred gains and losses), depending on the accounting of the gains or losses relative to these assets/liabilities.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies measured at historical cost are translated into the entity's functional currency at the historical exchange rate on initial recognition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A contractual term that permits the borrower or the lender to prepay or to return the debt instrument to the issuer before maturity remains consistent with SPPI  cash  flows,  provided  the  prepayment  amount  primarily  represents  the  principal  remaining  due  and  accrued  but  unpaid  contractual interest,  which  may  include  a  reasonable  compensation.  The  fact  that  such  compensation  can  be  either  positive  or  negative  is  not inconsistent with the SPPI nature of cash flows.\n\nThe prepayment compensation is considered as reasonable especially when:\n\n- the amount is calculated as a percentage of the outstanding amount of the loan and is capped by regulations (in France, for example, p compensation for the prepayment of mortgage loans by individuals is legally capped at an amount equal to six months of interest or 3% of the principal outstanding), or is limited by competitive market practices;\n- the amount is equal to the difference between contractual interest that should have been received until the maturity of the loan and the p interest that would be obtained by the reinvestment of the prepaid amount at a rate that reflects the relevant benchmark interest rate.\n\nSome loans  are  prepayable  at  their  current  fair  value,  while  others  can  be  prepayable  at  an  amount  that  includes  the  fair  value  cost  to terminate an associated hedging swap. It is possible to consider such prepayment amounts as SPPI provided that they reflect the effect of changes in the relevant benchmark interest rate.\n\n|",

An/uni202Fanalysis of  these  loans  has  allowed  them  to  qualify  as  basic  financial  assets (SPPI) provided that their flows meet the de minimis criterion as well as the other SPPI criteria.\n\nNon-basic financial assets (non-SPPI) mainly include:\n\n- derivative instruments; p\n- shares and other equity instruments held by the entity; p\n- equity instruments issued by mutual funds; p\n- debt  financial  assets  that  can  be  converted  or  redeemed  into  a  fixed  number  of  shares  (convertible p bonds, equity-linked securities,/uni00A0etc.);\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- structured  instruments  the  flows  of  which  are  indexed  in  full  or  in  part  on  an  ESG p market index.\n\nWhen the time value component of interest can be modified according to  the  contractual  term  of  the  instrument,  it  may  be  necessary  to compare the contractual cash flow with the cash flow that would arise from a benchmark instrument. For instance, that is the case when an interest rate is periodically reset, but the frequency of that reset does not match the tenor of the interest rate (such as an interest rate reset every  month  to  a  one-year  rate),  or  when  the  interest  rate  is periodically reset to an average of short- and long-term interest rates.\n\nIf the difference between the undiscounted contractual cash flows and the undiscounted benchmark cash flows is or may become significant, then the instrument is not considered basic.\n\nDepending on the contractual terms, the comparison with benchmark cash flow may be performed through a qualitative assessment; but in other  cases,  a  quantitative  test  is  required.  The  difference  between contractual and benchmark cash flows has to be considered in each\n\nreporting  period  and  cumulatively  over  the  life  of  the  instrument. When performing this benchmark test, the entity considers factors that could  affect  future  undiscounted  contractual  cash  flows:  using  the yield curve at the date of the initial assessment is not enough, and the entity  also  has  to  consider  whether  the  curve  could  change  over  the life of the instrument according to reasonably possible scenarios.\n\nWithin the Group, the financial instruments concerned by a benchmark test  include,  for  instance,  variable-rate  housing  loans  for  which interest rates are reset every year based on the twelve-month Euribor average  observed  over  the  two  months  previous  to  the  reset. Another/uni202Fexample is loans granted to real estate professionals for which interest is revised quarterly based on the one-month Euribor average observed over the three months previous to the reset. Following the benchmark analysis  performed  by  the  Group,  it  has  been  concluded that these loans are basic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Changes in the fair value of these instruments (including interest) are recorded in profit or loss under Net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, except the share related to the Group's own credit risk on financial liabilities which is booked under Unrealised or deferred gains and losses.\n\nFurthermore, in case of derecognition of a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option before its contractual maturity, any gains and losses, related to the Group's own credit risk are booked under Unrealised or deferred gains and losses and then reclassified under Retained earnings at the beginning of the subsequent financial year.\n\nFor financial assets, this option may only be used to eliminate or significantly reduce accounting mismatches that would otherwise arise from applying different accounting treatments to certain related financial assets and liabilities.\n\nFor financial liabilities, this option may only be used in the following cases:\n\n- to eliminate or reduce discrepancies in the accounting treatment of certain related financial assets and liabilities; p\n- when it applies to a hybrid financial instrument with one or more embedded derivatives, which should be recognised separately; p\n- when a group of financial assets and/or liabilities is managed together and its performance is measured at fair value. p\n\nThe Group thus recognises structured bonds issued by Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking at fair value through profit or loss. These issuances are purely commercial and the associated risks are hedged on the market using financial instruments managed in trading portfolios.

        "page_content": "## Financial derivatives NOTE 3.2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDerivative  instruments  are  financial  instruments  for  which  the  value  changes  according  to  that  of  an underlying item and can be accompanied by a leverage effect. The items underlying these instruments are various (interest rates, exchange rates, equity, indexes, commodities, credit rating, etc.), as are their forms (forward contracts, swaps, calls and puts, etc.).\n\nThe  Group  may  use  these  derivative  instruments  for  their  market  activities  to  provide  to  its  customers solutions to meet their risk management or revenue optimisation needs. In that case, they are accounted for as trading derivatives.\n\nThe Group may also use derivative instruments to manage and hedge its own risks. In/uni00A0which case, they are qualified  as  hedging  derivatives.  Hedging  transactions  can  concern  individual  items  or  transactions (micro-hedging relationships) or portfolios of financial assets and liabilities that can generate a structural interest-rate risk (macro-hedging relationships).\n\nContrary to other financial instruments, derivative instruments are always measured at fair value in the balance  sheet,  regardless  their  purpose  (market  activities  or  hedging  transactions).  The  fair  value adjustments  of  trading  derivatives  are  directly  recognised  in  the  income  statement.  However,  the accounting method used on hedging transactions aims to neutralise in the income statement the effects of the revaluation of hedging derivatives, as long as the hedge is effective.\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nDerivatives are financial instruments meeting the following three criteria:\n\n- their value changes in response to a change in a specified interest rate, foreign exchange rate, share price, index of prices, commodity price, p credit rating,/uni00A0etc.;\n- they require little to no initial investment; p\n- they are settled at a future date. p\n\nAll financial derivatives are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet as financial assets or financial liabilities. They are considered to be trading derivatives by default, unless they are designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes.\n\n## Special case - derivatives having Societe Generale shares as their underlying instrument\n\nFinancial derivatives having Societe Generale shares as their underlying instrument or shares in Group subsidiaries and whose liquidation entails  the  payment  of  a  fixed  amount  in  cash  (or  another  financial  asset)  against  a  fixed  number  of  Societe  Generale  shares  (other  than derivatives) are equity instruments. These/uni00A0instruments, and any related premiums paid or received, are recognised directly in equity, and any changes in the fair value of these derivatives are not recorded. For sales of put options on Societe Generale shares and forward purchases of Societe Generale shares, a debt is recognised for the value of the notional amount with a contra entry in equity.\n\nOther financial derivatives having Societe Generale shares as their underlying instrument are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value in the same manner as derivatives with other underlying instruments.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nAn embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that also includes a non-derivative host instrument.\n\nWhere the host contract is a financial asset, the entire hybrid contract is measured at fair value through profit or loss because its contractual cash flows do not pass the SPPI test.\n\nWhere the host contract is a financial liability and is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, the/uni00A0embedded derivative is separated from the host contract if:\n\n- at acquisition, the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics p and risks of the host; and\n- it would meet the definition of a derivative. p\n\nOnce  separated,  the  derivative  is  recognised  at  fair  value  in  the  balance  sheet  under  Financial  assets  or  Financial  liabilities  at  fair  value through  profit  or  loss  under  the  aforementioned  conditions.  The  host  contract  is  classified  under  one  of  the  financial  liability  categories measured at amortised cost.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Consequently, equity instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting regardless of their accounting category.\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nIn  order  to  be  hedged  against  certain  market  risks,  the  Group  sets  up  hedging  derivatives.  From  an  accounting  standpoint,  the  Group designates  the  hedging  transaction  as  a  fair  value  hedge,  a  cash  flow  hedge,  or  a  hedge  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation, depending/uni202Fon the risk and on the instruments to be hedged.\n\nTo  designate  an  instrument  as  a  hedging  derivative,  the  Group  documents  the  hedging  relationship  in  detail,  from  inception. This/uni202Fdocumentation  specifies  the  asset,  liability,  or  future  transaction  hedged,  the  risk  to  be  hedged  and  the  associated  risk  management strategy, the type of financial derivative used and the valuation method that will be used to measure its effectiveness.\n\nThe derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be highly effective in offsetting the change in fair value or cash flows arising from the hedged risk. This effectiveness is verified when changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged instrument are almost entirely offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument, with the expected ratio between the two changes ranging from 80% to 125%. Effectiveness shall be assessed both when the hedge is first set up and throughout its life. Effectiveness is measured each quarter prospectively  (expected  effectiveness  over  the  future  periods)  and  retrospectively  (effectiveness  measured  on  past  periods).  Where  the effectiveness falls outside the range specified above, hedge accounting is discontinued.\n\nHedging derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet under Hedging derivatives.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe purpose of these hedges is to protect the Group against an adverse fluctuation in the fair value of an instrument which could affect profit or loss if the instrument were derecognised from the balance sheet.\n\nChanges in the fair value of the hedging derivative are recorded in the income statement under Net gains and losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss; for interest rate derivatives, however, accrued interest income and expenses on the derivative are recorded in the income statement under Interest and similar income/Interest and similar expense - Hedging derivatives symmetrically to the accrued interest income and expenses related to the hedged item.\n\nIn the balance sheet, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for the gains and losses attributable to the hedged risk, which are reported in the income statement under Net gains and losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. To the extent that the hedge is highly effective, changes in the fair value of the hedged item and changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative are accurately offset through profit or loss, the difference corresponding to an ineffectiveness gain or loss.\n\nProspective effectiveness is assessed via a sensitivity analysis based on probable market trends or via a regression analysis of the statistical relationship  (correlation)  between  certain  components  of  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging  instrument.  Retrospective  effectiveness  is assessed by comparing any changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item.\n\nIf  it  becomes apparent that the derivative has ceased to meet the effectiveness criteria for hedge accounting or if it is terminated or sold, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. Thereafter, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability ceases to be adjusted for changes  in  fair  value  attributable  to  the  hedged  risk  and  the  cumulative  adjustments  previously  recognised  under  hedge  accounting  are amortised  over  its  remaining  life.  Hedge  accounting  is  also  discontinued  if  the  hedged  item  is  sold  prior  to  maturity  or  early-redeemed, the/uni202Fvaluation adjustments are then immediately recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe purpose of interest rate cash flow hedges is to protect against changes in future cash flows associated with a financial instrument on the balance sheet (loans, securities or floating-rate notes) or with a highly probable future transaction (future fixed interest rates, future exchange rates,  future  prices,/uni00A0etc.).  The  purpose  of  these  hedges  is  to  protect  the  Group  against  adverse  fluctuations  in  the  future  cash-flows  of  an instrument or transaction that could affect profit or loss.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recorded under Unrealised or deferred gains and losses, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement under Net gains and losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.  For  interest  rate  derivatives, the accrued interest income and expenses on the derivative are recorded in the income statement under Interest income/Interest expense - Hedging derivatives symmetrically to the accrued interest income and expenses related to the hedged item.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "The prospective effectiveness of the hedge is assessed via a  sensitivity analysis based on probable market input trends or via a  regression analysis  of  the  statistical  relationship  (correlation)  between  certain  components  of  the  hedged  item  and  the  hedging  instrument. The/uni202Feffectiveness  of  the  hedge  is  assessed using the hypothetical derivative method, which consists in i) creating a hypothetical derivative which bears exactly the same characteristics as the instrument being hedged (in terms of notional amounts, date on which the rates are reset, interest rate, exchange rate,/uni00A0etc.), but moves in the opposite direction and whose fair value is nil when the hedge is set up, then ii) comparing the expected changes in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative with those of the hedging instrument (sensitivity analysis) or performing a regression analysis on the prospective effectiveness of the hedge.\n\nWhen the derivative financial instrument has expired, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging derivatives is booked to Unrealised or deferred gains and losses, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement under Net gains and losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss. Gains and losses booked under equity are later recorded under Net gains and losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss in the income statement at the same time as cash flows hedged. For interest rate derivatives, accrued interest income and expenses on the derivative are recorded in the income statement under Interest income/Interest expense - Hedging derivatives symmetrically to the accrued interest income and expenses related to the hedged item.\n\nWhenever the hedging derivative ceases to meet the effectiveness criteria for hedge accounting or is terminated or sold, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The amounts previously recognised directly in equity are reclassified in the income statement over the periods during which interest income is affected by the cash flows from the hedged item. If the hedged item is sold or redeemed earlier than expected or  if  the  hedged  forecast  transaction  ceases  to  be  highly  probable,  the  unrealised  gains  and  losses  recognised  in  equity  are  immediately reclassified in the income statement.\n\n## Hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation\n\nThe purpose of a hedging of a net investment in a foreign company is to protect against exchange rate risk.\n\nThe hedged item is an investment in a country whose currency differs from the Group's functional currency. The hedge therefore serves to protect the net position of a foreign subsidiary or branch against an exchange rate risk linked to the entity's functional currency.\n\nThe hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation follows the same accounting principles as the cashflow hedge relationships. Thus, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of a hedging derivative designated for accounting purposes as the hedge of a net investment is recognised in equity under Unrealised or deferred gains and losses, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Portfolio hedges (macro-hedge)\n\nIn this type of hedge, interest rate derivatives are used to globally hedge the structural interest rate risk resulting mainly from Retail Banking activities.\n\nIn accounting for these transactions, are either documented as fair value hedges or as cash flow hedges, depending on the Group entities.\n\nGroup entities documenting a macro fair value hedge of fixed rate assets and liabilities portfolios, apply the IAS/uni00A039 'carve-out' standard as adopted by the European Union, which facilitates:\n\n- the  application  of  fair  value  hedge  accounting  to  the  macro-hedges  used  for  asset-liability  management,  including  customer  demand p deposits in the fixed-rate positions being hedged;\n- the performance of the effectiveness tests required by IAS/uni00A039 as adopted by the European Union. p\n\nThe accounting treatment of the financial derivatives designated as macro fair value hedges is similar to that of other fair value hedging instruments. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio of macro-hedged instruments measured based on the modelled synthetic instrument are reported on a separate line in the balance sheet under Revaluation differences on portfolios hedged against interest rate risk through profit or loss.\n\nGroup entities documenting a macro cash flow hedge apply the same accounting principles as those presented above for cash flow hedge. Thus, macro-hedged assets or liabilities portfolios are not measured at fair value for the hedged risk.\n\nIn the case of macro cash flow hedge, hedged portfolios include assets or liabilities at variable rate.\n\nFinally,  regardless  of  the  documentation  used  for  these  macro-hedges,  they  require  the  implementation  of  three  tests  to  measure  the effectiveness of the relationship:\n\n- a non-over-coverage test to ensure, prospectively and retrospectively, that the nominal amount of the portfolios covered is higher than the p notional amount of the hedging instruments for each future maturity band and each rate generation;\n- a test of non-disappearance of the hedged item, which consists in prospectively and retrospectively ensuring that the historically covered p maximum position is less than the notional amount of the hedging instruments on the closing date considered for each future maturity band and each generation of rates;\n- a quantitative test to retrospectively ensure that the fair value changes in the modelled synthetic instrument offset the changes in fair value p of the hedging instruments.\n\nThe sources of ineffectiveness of the macro-hedges implemented in the Group result from the latest fixing of the variable leg of the hedging swaps, the two-curve valuation of the collateralised hedging instruments, the possible mismatches of interests between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and the consideration of counterparty risk on the hedging instruments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This change is (2) excluding accrued interests for the items hedged against interest rate risk.\n\nAs at 31/uni00A0December 2021, EUR/uni00A079 million of cumulative changes in fair value are still to be amortised because of the disappearance of the hedged item. This amount is mainly related to interest rate risk hedging.\n\n|",

Furthermore, as these financial assets are subject to impairment for credit risk, the changes in expected credit losses are recorded in profit or loss under Cost of risk with a corresponding entry under Unrealised or deferred gains and losses. The applicable impairment rules are described in Note/uni00A03.8.\n\n## BUSINESS MODEL 'HOLD TO COLLECT AND SELL'\n\nThe objective of this business model is to realise cash flows by both collecting contractual payments and selling financial assets. In this type of business model, the sales of financial assets are not incidental or exceptional, but they are integral to achieving the business' objectives.\n\n## Cash management\n\nWithin the Group, except for the insurance activities, the 'hold to collect and sell' business model is mainly  applied  by  cash  management  activities  for  managing  HQLA  securities  (High/uni00A0Quality  Liquid Assets)  included  in  the  liquidity  reserve.  Only  a  few  subsidiaries  apply  a  'hold  to  collect'  business model for managing their HQLA securities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

This choice made instrument by instrument, is irrevocable.\n\nThese equity instruments are then measured at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised under Unrealised or deferred gains and losses  with  no  subsequent  reclassification  to  profit  or  loss.  If  the  instruments  are  sold,  the  realised  gains  and  losses  are  reclassified  to Retained earnings at the opening of the next financial year. Only dividend income, if it is considered as a return on investment, is recorded in profit or loss under 'Net gains or losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income'.\n\nThe Group chose only in few rare cases to designate equity instruments to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value NOTE 3.4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe financial assets and liabilities recognised in the Group balance sheet are measured either at fair value or  at  amortised  cost.  In  the  latter  case,  the  fair  value  of  the  instruments  is  disclosed  in  the  notes  (see Note/uni00A03.9).\n\nIf an instrument is quoted on an active market, its fair value is equal to its market price.\n\nBut many financial instruments are not listed (for example, most customer loans and deposits, interbank debts and claims,/uni00A0etc.), or are only negotiable on illiquid markets or over-the-counter markets (which is the case for many derivative instruments).\n\nIn  such  situations,  the  fair  value  of  the  instruments  is  calculated  using  measurement  techniques  or valuation  models.  Market  parameters  are  included  in  these  models  and  must  be  observable;  otherwise they  are  determined  based  on  internal  estimates.  The/uni00A0models  and  parameters  used  are  subject  to independent validations and internal controls.\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\n## Definition of fair value\n\nFair  value  is  the  price  that  would  be  received  to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly  transaction  between  market participants on the measurement date.\n\nIn  the  absence  of  observable  prices  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities,  the  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  is  determined  using  another measurement technique which maximises the use of observable market input based on assumptions that market operators would use to set the price of the instrument in question.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nFor information purposes, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the fair value of the financial instruments is classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the observability level of the inputs used. The fair value hierarchy is composed of the following levels.\n\n## LEVEL 1 (L1): INSTRUMENTS VALUED ON THE BASIS OF QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES\n\nLevel/uni00A01 instruments carried at fair value on the balance sheet include in particular shares listed in an active market, government or corporate bonds  priced  directly  by  external  brokers/dealers,  derivatives  traded  on  organised  markets  (futures,  options),  and  units  of  funds (including/uni202FUCITS) whose net asset value is available on the balance sheet date.\n\nA financial instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and if they reflect actual and regular market transactions on an arm's length basis.\n\nDetermining whether a market is inactive requires the use of indicators such as a sharp decline in the trading volume and the level of activity in the market, a sharp disparity in prices over time and among the various above-mentioned market participants, or the fact that the latest transactions conducted on an arm's length basis did not take place recently enough.\n\nWhere a financial instrument is traded in several markets to which the Group has immediate access, its fair value is represented by the market price at which volumes and activity levels are highest for the instrument in question. Transactions resulting from involuntary liquidations or distressed sales are usually not taken into account to determine the market price.\n\n## LEVEL 2 (L2): INSTRUMENTS VALUED USING INPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1 AND THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY CONCERNED, EITHER DIRECTLY (I.E. AS PRICES) OR INDIRECTLY (I.E. DERIVED FROM PRICES)\n\nThese are the instruments measured using a financial model based on market inputs. The inputs used shall be observable in active markets; using some unobservable inputs is possible only if the latter have only a minor impact on the fair value of the instrument. The prices published by an external source, derived from the valuation of similar instruments are considered as data derived from prices.\n\nLevel/uni00A02  instruments  include  in  particular  the  non-derivative  financial  instruments  carried  at  fair  value  on  the  balance  sheet  that  are  not directly  quoted  or  do  not  have  a  quoted  price  on  a  sufficiently  active  market  ( e.g. /uni00A0corporate  bonds,  repos  transactions,  mortgage-backed securities, units of funds), and the firm derivatives and options traded over-the-counter: interest rate swaps, caps, floors, swaptions, equity options, index options, foreign exchange options, commodity options and credit derivatives. The maturities of these instruments are linked to ranges of terms commonly traded in the market, and the instruments themselves can be simple or offer a more complex remuneration profile ( e.g. barrier  options,  products  with  multiple  underlying  instruments),  with  said  complexity  remaining  however  limited.  The  valuation techniques used in this category are based on common methods shared by the main market participants.\n\nThis category also includes the fair value of loans and receivables at amortised cost granted to counterparties whose credit risk is quoted via Credit Default Swap (see Note/uni00A03.9).\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## LEVEL 3 (L3): INSTRUMENTS VALUED USING INPUTS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF WHICH ARE NOT BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA (REFERRED TO AS UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS)\n\nLevel/uni00A03 instruments carried at fair value on the balance sheet are valued using financial models based on market inputs among which those which are unobservable or observable on insufficiently active markets, have a significant impact on the fair value of the financial instrument as a whole.\n\nAccordingly, Level/uni00A03 financial instruments include derivatives and repo transactions with longer maturities than those usually traded and/or with  specifically-tailored  return  profiles,  structured  debts  including  embedded  derivatives  valued  based  on  a  method  using  unobservable inputs  or  long-term  equity  investments  valued  based  on  a  corporate  valuation  method,  which  is  the  case  for  unlisted  companies  or companies listed on an insufficiently liquid market.\n\n## The main L3 complex derivatives are:\n\n- equity derivatives: options with long maturities and/or incorporating bespoke remuneration mechanisms. These/uni00A0instruments are sensitive p to market inputs (volatility, dividend rates, correlations,/uni00A0etc.). In the absence of market depth and an objective approach made possible by regularly observed prices, their/uni00A0valuation  is  based  on  proprietary  methods  ( e.g. extrapolation from observable data, historical analysis). Hybrid equity instruments ( i.e. having at least one non-equity underlying instrument) are also classified as L3 insofar as the correlations between the different underlying assets are generally unobservable;\n- interest  rate  derivatives:  long-term  and/or  exotic  options,  products  sensitive  to  correlation  between  different  interest  rates,  different p exchange rates, or between interest rates and exchange rates, for/uni00A0example for quanto products  (in  which  the  instrument  is  settled  in  a currency  different  from  the  currency  of  the  underlying  asset);  they  are  liable  to  be  classified  as  L3  because  the  valuation  inputs  are unobservable due to the liquidity of the correlated pair and the residual maturity of the transactions ( e.g. /uni00A0exchange  rate correlations are deemed unobservable for the USD/JPY);\n- credit  derivatives:  L3  credit  derivatives  mainly  include  baskets  of  instruments  exposed  to  time  to  default  correlation  ('N  to  default' p products  in  which  the  buyer  of  the  hedge  is  compensated  as  of  the  N th default,  which  are  exposed  to  the  credit  quality  of  the  issuers comprising the basket and to their correlation, or CDO Bespoke products, which are Collateralised Debt Obligations created specifically for a group of investors and structured according to their needs), as well as products subject to credit spread volatility;\n- commodity derivatives: this category includes products involving unobservable volatility or correlation inputs ( i.e. options on commodity p swaps or instruments based on baskets of underlyings).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

These  prices  may  be  adjusted,  if  they  are  not available at the balance sheet closing date, in order to incorporate the events that have an impact on prices and occurred after the closing of the stock markets but before the measurement date or in case of an inactive market.\n\nHowever,  due  notably  to  the  varied  characteristics  of  financial instruments traded over-the-counter on the financial markets, a large number  of  financial  products  traded  by  the  Group  does  not  have quoted prices in the markets.\n\nFor  these  products,  fair  value  is  determined  using  models  based  on valuation  techniques  commonly  used  by  market  participants  to measure financial instruments, such as discounted future cash flows for swaps or the Black & Scholes formula for certain options, and using valuation  parameters  that  reflect  current  market  conditions  at  the balance sheet date. These valuation models are validated independently by the experts from the Market Risk Department of the Group's Risk Division.\n\nFurthermore, the inputs used in the valuation models, whether derived from  observable  market  data  or  not,  are  checked  by  the  Finance Division  of  Market  Activities,  in  accordance  with  the  methodologies defined by the Market Risk Department.\n\nIf necessary, these valuations are supplemented by additional reserves (such  as  bid-ask  spreads  and  liquidity)  determined  reasonably  and appropriately after an analysis of available information.\n\nDerivatives and security financing transactions are subject to a Credit Valuation  Adjustment  (CVA)  or  Debt  Valuation  Adjustment  (DVA). The/uni202FGroup  includes all clients and clearing houses in this adjustment, which/uni00A0also reflects the netting agreements  existing for each counterparty.\n\nThe CVA is determined based on the Group entity's expected positive exposure to the counterparty, the/uni00A0counterparty's probability of default and  the  amount  of  the  loss  given  default.  The  DVA  is  determined symmetrically  based  on  the  negative  expected  exposure.  These calculations are carried out over the life of the potential exposure, with a focus on the use of relevant and observable market data. Since 2021, a/uni00A0framework has been set up to identify the new transactions for which CVA/DVA  adjustments  are  significant.  These/uni202Ftransactions  are  then classified in Level/uni00A03.\n\nSimilarly, an adjustment to take into account the costs or profits linked to the financing of these transactions (FVA -/uni00A0Funding Value Adjustment) is also performed.\n\nObservable data must be: independent, available, publicly distributed, based on a narrow consensus and/or backed up by transaction prices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "For example, consensus data provided by external counterparties are considered  observable  if  the  underlying  market  is  liquid  and  if  the prices  provided  are  confirmed  by  actual  transactions.  For  long maturities, these consensus data are not observable. This is the case for the implied volatility used for the valuation of equity options with maturities  of  more  than  five  years.  However,  when  the  residual maturity of the instrument falls below five years, its fair value becomes sensitive to observable inputs.\n\nIn  the  event of unusual tensions on the markets, leading to a lack of the  usual  reference  data  used  to  measure  a  financial  instrument, the/uni202FRisk  Division  may  implement  a  new  model  in  accordance  with pertinent  available  data,  similar  to  methods  used  by  other  market players.\n\n## SHARES AND OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nFor  listed  shares,  fair  value  is  taken  to  be  the  quoted  price  on  the balance  sheet  date.  For  unlisted  shares,  fair  value  is  determined depending on the type of financial instrument and according to one of the following methods:\n\n- valuation  based  on  a  recent  transaction  involving  the  issuing p company  (third  party  buying  into  the  issuing  company's  capital, appraisal by a professional valuation agent,/uni00A0etc.);\n- valuation  based  on  a  recent  transaction  in  the  same  sector  as  the p issuing company (income multiple, asset multiple,/uni00A0etc.);\n- proportion of net asset value held. p\n\nFor  unlisted  securities  in  which  the  Group  has  significant  holdings, valuations  based  on  the  above  methods  are  supplemented  by  a discounted future cash flow valuation based on business plans or on valuation multiples of similar companies.\n\n|\n\n## DEBT INSTRUMENTS HELD IN PORTFOLIO, ISSUES OF STRUCTURED SECURITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe fair  value  of  these  financial  instruments  is  determined  based  on the  quoted  price  on  the  balance  sheet  date  or  prices  provided  by brokers  on  the  same  date,  when  available.  For  unlisted  financial instruments,  fair/uni00A0value  is  determined  using  valuation  techniques. Concerning  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value,  the  on-balance  sheet amounts include changes in the Group's issuer credit risk.\n\n## OTHER DEBTS\n\nFor  listed  financial  instruments,  fair  value  is  taken  as  their  closing quoted  price  on  the  balance  sheet  date.  For  unlisted  financial instruments, fair value is determined by discounting future cash flows to  present  value  at  market  rates  (including  counterparty  risks, non-performance and liquidity risks).\n\n## CUSTOMER LOANS\n\nThe fair value of loans and receivables is calculated, in the absence of an actively traded market for these loans, by discounting the expected cash flows to present value at a discount rate based on interest rates prevailing on the market at the reporting date for Ioans with broadly similar  terms  and  maturities.  These/uni00A0discount  rates  are  adjusted  for borrower credit risk.",

However,/uni202Fby their  very  nature,  unobservable  inputs  inject  a  degree  of  uncertainty into the valuation of Level/uni00A03 instruments.\n\nTo quantify this, fair value sensitivity was estimated at 31/uni00A0December/uni202F2021 on  instruments  whose  valuation  requires  certain  unobservable  inputs. This  estimate  was  based  either  on  a  'standardised'  variation  in unobservable inputs, calculated for each input on a net position, or on\n\nassumptions in line with the additional valuation adjustment policies for the financial instruments in question.\n\nThe 'standardised' variation corresponds to the standard deviation of consensus prices (TOTEM,/uni00A0etc.) used/uni00A0to measure an input nevertheless considered  as  unobservable.  In  cases  of  unavailability  of  these  data, the  standard  deviation  of  historical  data  is  then  used  to  assess the/uni202Finput.\n\n## SENSITIVITY OF LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE TO A REASONABLE VARIATION IN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS\n\n|                                                           | 31.12.2021      | 31.12.2021      | 31.12.2020      | 31.12.2020      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (In EURm)                                                 | Negative impact | Positive impact | Negative impact | Positive impact |\n| Shares and other equity instruments and derivatives       | (21)            | 78              | (49)            | 150             |\n| Equity volatilities                                       | -               | 12              | 0               | 27              |\n| Dividends                                                 | -               | 19              | (18)            | 46              |\n| Correlations                                              | (20)            | 44              | (31)            | 69              |\n| Hedge Fund volatilities                                   | -               | 0               | 0               | 0               |\n| Mutual Fund volatilities                                  | (1)             | 3               | 0               | 8               |\n| Rates or Forex instruments and derivatives                | (6)             | 30              | (6)             | 27              |\n| Correlations between exchange rates and/or interest rates | (3)             | 27              | (4)             | 26              |\n| Forex volatilities                                        | (2)             | 3               | (1)             | 1               |\n| Constant prepayment rates                                 | -               | (0)             | 0               | 0               |\n| Inflation/inflation correlations                          | (1)             | 0               | (1)             | 0               |\n| Credit instruments and derivatives                        | -               | 8               | 0               | 12              |\n| Time to default correlations                              | -               | 1               | 0               | 1               |\n| Recovery rate variance for single name underlyings        | -               | -               | 0               | 0               |\n| Quanto correlations                                       | -               | 4               | 0               | 8               |\n| Credit spreads                                            | -               | 3               | 0               | 3               |\n| Commodity derivatives                                     | NA              | NA              | NA              | NA              |\n| Commodities correlations                                  | NA              | NA              | NA              | NA              |\n| Long term securities                                      | NA              | NA              | NA              | NA              |\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that,  given  the  already  conservative  valuation levels, this sensitivity is higher for a favourable impact on results than for  an  unfavourable  impact.

Furthermore, as these financial assets are subject to impairment for credit risk, changes in the expected credit losses are recorded in profit or loss under 'Cost of risk' with a corresponding impairment of the amortised cost on the asset side of the balance sheet. The applicable impairment rules are described in Note/uni00A03.8. When a loan or a receivable is  classified  in  Stage/uni00A03  for  impairment  (doubtful  outstanding),  the/uni00A0subsequent  accrued  interest  incremented  to  the  carrying  amount  of  the financial  asset  before  impairment is limited to the interest recognised in profit or loss. The amount of such interest is then calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (see/uni00A0Note/uni00A03.7).\n\nLoans granted by the Group may be subject to renegotiations for commercial reasons, while the borrowing customer is not experiencing any financial  difficulties  or  insolvency.  Such  efforts  are  undertaken  for  customers  for  which  the  Group  agrees  to  renegotiate  their  debt  in  the interest  of  preserving  or  developing  a  business  relationship,  in  accordance  with  the  credit  approval  procedures  in  force  and  without relinquishing  any  principal  or  accrued  interest.  Except  in  specific  cases  where  the  modification  due  to  the  renegotiation  would  not  be considered  significant,  renegotiated  loans  are  derecognised  as  at  the  renegotiation  date,  and  the  new  loans  contracted  under  the renegotiated terms and conditions replace the previous loans in the balance sheet as at this same date. The new loans are subject to the SPPI test to determine how they are classified in the balance sheet. If a loan qualifies as a basic instrument (SPPI), the renegotiation fees received are included in the effective interest rate of the new instrument.\n\nCustomer loans at amortised cost include lease  receivables  where  they  are  classified  as  finance  leases.  Leases  granted  by  the  Group  are classified as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the lessee. Otherwise, they are classified as operating leases (see Note/uni00A04.2).\n\nThese finance lease receivables represent the Group's net investment in the lease, calculated as the present value of the minimum payments to be received from the lessee, plus any unguaranteed residual value, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease. In the event of a subsequent reduction in the estimated unguaranteed residual value used to calculate the lessor's investment in the finance lease, the present value of this reduction is recognised as a loss under Expenses from other activities in the income statement and as a reduction of the finance lease receivables on the asset side of the balance sheet.\n\n## BUSINESS MODEL 'HOLD TO COLLECT'\n\nUnder this model, financial assets are managed to obtain cash flows by collecting contractual payments over the life of the instrument.\n\nTo achieve the objective of this business model, it is not necessary for the  entity  to  hold  all  the  instruments  until  maturity.  Selling  assets remains consistent with a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows in the following cases:\n\n- the financial asset is sold following an increase in the asset's credit p risk; or\n\nOther  sales  can  be  consistent  with  the  objective  of  collecting contractual cash flows, as well, provided they are infrequent (even if significant  in  value)  or  insignificant  in  value,  both  individually  and  in aggregate  terms  (even  if  frequent).  Such  other  sales  include  sales made to manage credit concentration risk (without an increase in the asset's credit risk). The Group has set up procedures for reporting and analysing  all  significant  projected  sales  of  financial  assets  held  for collecting contractual cash flows, as well as a periodic review of sales that have occurred.\n\n- the  sale  of  the  financial  asset  occurs  close  to  its  maturity  and  the p proceeds  from  the  sale  are  similar  to  the  amount  to  be  collected from the remaining contractual cash flows.\n\n|",

These liabilities are measured as at the  reporting  date  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  rate  method.  As  a  result,  issue  or  redemption  premiums  on  bonds  are amortised over the lifetime of the instruments concerned. Accrued or paid expenses are recorded in profit or loss under Interest and similar expense.\n\nThe  Group's  obligations  arising  from  mortgage  savings  accounts  and  plans  are  recorded  under  Customer  deposits  -  Regulated  savings accounts. A provision may be recorded in respect of such mortgage savings instruments (see Note/uni00A08.3).\n\n## DUE TO BANKS NOTE 3.6.1\n\n| (In EURm)                                   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Demand deposits and current accounts        | 12,373       | 11,354       |\n| Overnight deposits and borrowings           | 1,564        | 3,221        |\n| Term deposits (1)                           | 121,708      | 117,460      |\n| Related payables                            | 47           | 61           |\n| Revaluation of hedged items                 | 104          | 440          |\n| Securities sold under repurchase agreements | 3,381        | 3,035        |\n| TOTAL                                       | 139,177      | 135,571      |\n\n- Including  term-deposits  linked  to  governments  and  central  administrations,  and  in  particular  long-term  refinancing  operations  set  up  by  the  ECB  (Targeted (1) Longer-Term Refinancing Operations - TLTRO).\n\n## TLTRO\n\nThe  European  Central  Bank  (ECB)  launched  in  2019  a  third  series  of Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO) with the aim of maintaining  favourable  credit  conditions  in  the  euro  area.  As  in  the two  previous  systems,  the  level  of  remuneration  of  the  borrowings depends on the performance of the borrowing banking institutions in terms  of  loans  granted  to  their  household  customers  (excluding  real estate loans) and business customers (excluding financial institutions); depending  on  these  performances,  the  borrowing  institutions  may benefit  from  a  reduced  interest  rate  and  an  additional  temporary bonus  applicable  from  24/uni00A0June  2020  to  23/uni00A0June  2021  (reduction  by 50/uni202Fbasis  points  of  the  average  rate  of  the  deposit  facility  with  a  floor rate  set  at  -1%).  These  TLTRO/uni00A0III  operations  are  conducted  on  a quarterly  basis  between  September/uni00A02019  and  December/uni00A02021,  for  a possible total of 10/uni00A0drawdowns. Each such operation has a three-year maturity  and  includes  an  early  repayment  option.  Some  terms  and conditions  were  modified  in  March/uni00A02020,  in  particular  the  loan production objectives, rate conditions and drawdown limit, in order to further  support  the  granting  of  loans  at  the  outset  of  the  Covid-19 crisis.  In  January/uni00A02021,  the  ECB  decided  to  extend  the  temporary additional  bonification  over  the  period  from  24/uni00A0June  2021  to 23/uni00A0June/uni202F2022  subject  to  performance  in  terms  of  number  of  granted loans  observed  over  a  new  reference  period  from  1/uni00A0October  2020/uni00A0to 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\nThe  entities  of  the  Societe  Generale  Group  have  subscribed  to TLTRO/uni00A0III loans  through  quarterly  drawings  staggered  between December/uni00A02019 and December/uni00A02021. As at 31/uni00A0December 2021, the total outstanding amount drawn is EUR/uni00A071.9/uni00A0billion.\n\nOnce  the  Group  has  reasonable  assurance  of  being  eligible  for  the bonus  rates  provided  for,  the  latter  are  taken  into  account  to determine the amount of interest recognised in profit or loss for the TLTRO loans; this amount is then computed based on a weighted rate spreading  the  bonus  over  the  expected  life  of  the  drawdowns concerned.\n\nThe  Group  has  reached  its  objective  of  stability  of  the  outstanding amount  of  eligible  loans  between  1/uni00A0March  2020  and  31/uni00A0March  2021 allowing  it  to  benefit  from  a  reduced  interest  rate  as  well  as  from additional  temporary  bonuses  applied  between  24/uni00A0June  2020  and 23/uni00A0June  2021.  As  at  31/uni00A0December  2021,  the  Group  already  had  the reasonable assurance that it could benefit from these bonuses and had thus  taken  them  into  account  to  calculate  the  amount  of  interest recognised  in  2020  based  on  a  weighted  average  rate  of/uni00A0-0.67%; the/uni202Fconfirmation that the required objectives had indeed been met as at  31/uni00A0March  2021  has  thus  not  changed  the  pace  of  recognition  of these/uni00A0interests.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The/uni00A0weighted average rate of the TLTRO borrowings has thus  been  adjusted  as  early  as  September  to/uni00A0-0.63%  and  -0.83% depending  on  the  drawdown  dates.  The  retroactive  impact  of  this\n\nadjustment  has  generated  a  EUR/uni00A00.1/uni00A0billion  income  included  in  the total amount of negative interest on the TLTRO borrowing recorded in 2021  under  Interest  and  Similar  income  for  EUR/uni00A00.6/uni00A0billion  (around EUR/uni00A00.2/uni00A0billion in/uni00A02020).\n\nIn January/uni00A02021, the IFRS/uni00A0IC received a question about the accounting treatment of the TLTRO. The Group remains vigilant with regard to the IFRS/uni00A0IC  decision and will take account of any elements of clarification that this decision will provide.\n\n## CUSTOMER DEPOSITS NOTE 3.6.2\n\n| (In EURm)                                                | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Regulated savings accounts                               | 109,079      | 100,204      |\n| Demand                                                   | 83,025       | 74,617       |\n| Term                                                     | 26,054       | 25,587       |\n| Other demand deposits (1)                                | 308,091      | 268,556      |\n| Other term deposits (1)                                  | 84,861       | 81,295       |\n| Related payables                                         | 261          | 299          |\n| Revaluation of hedged items                              | 103          | 169          |\n| TOTAL CUSTOMER DEPOSITS                                  | 502,395      | 450,523      |\n| Securities sold to customers under repurchase agreements | 6,738        | 5,536        |\n| TOTAL                                                    | 509,133      | 456,059      |\n\n- Including term-deposits linked to governments and central administrations.

Such compensated financing arrangements can be loans, deposits or securities (bonds, negotiable debt securities, etc.).\n\nThis compensation is a consideration for the time value of money, and additionally for credit risk, liquidity risk  and  administrative  costs,  all  borne  by  the  lender  for  the  duration  of  the  financing  agreement. The/uni202Finterest can also include a margin used by the lending bank to remunerate equity instruments (such as ordinary  shares)  that  are  required  by  prudential  regulation  to  be  issued  in  relation  to  the  amount  of financing granted, so as to guarantee its own solvency.\n\nInterest  is  recognised  as  expense  or  income  over  the  life  of  the  financing  service  granted  or  received, proportionally to the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nInterest income and expense are recorded in the income statement under Interest and similar income and Interest and similar expense for all financial instruments measured using the effective interest method (instruments at amortised cost and debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income) and for all financial instruments mandatorily measured at fair value through profit and loss and interest rate risk  hedging  derivatives  for  the  portion  of  income  or  expenses  representative  of  the  effective  interest  rate.  Negative  interest  incomes  on financial assets are recorded under Interest and similar expense; negative interest expenses on financial liabilities are recorded under Interest and similar income.\n\nThe effective interest rate is taken to be the rate used to net discount future cash inflows and outflows over the expected life of the instrument in order to establish the net book value of the financial asset or liability. The calculation of this rate considers the future cash flows estimated on the basis of the contractual provisions of the financial instrument without taking account of possible future credit losses and also includes commissions paid or received between the parties where these may be assimilated to interest, directly linked transaction costs, and all types of premiums and discounts.\n\nWhere a financial  asset  is  classified  in  Stage/uni00A03  for  impairment,  subsequent  interest  income  is  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  by  applying  the effective interest rate to the net carrying amount of the financial asset with an offsetting entry equal to the outstanding financial asset before impairment.\n\nMoreover, except for those related to employee benefits, provisions recognised as balance sheet liabilities generate interest expenses which are calculated using the same risk-free interest rate as that used to discount the expected outflow of resources as soon as the effects of this update are significant.\n\nSPECIFIC TREATMENT RELATED TO THE REPLACEMENT OF A REFERENCE INTEREST RATE BY AN ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE (POSSIBLY INCLUDING A FINANCIAL COMPENSATION) - IBOR REFORM\n\nThe replacement of a reference interest rate by an alternative reference interest rate (possibly including a financial compensation in the form of a margin adjustment expressed in basis points and/or a cash amount) is liable to change the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or liability ( i.e. , the method for calculating the return on it).\n\nThe  effective  interest  rate  is  then  modified  prospectively  to  reflect  the  change  from  the  current  reference  interest  rate  to  an  alternative reference  interest  rate.  This  last  is  adjusted  for  the  new  margin  expressed  in  basis  points  and,  if  needed,  for  the  amortisation  over  the remaining term of the contract, of the cash amount paid at the time of the modification.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

These  impairments  and  provisions  are  recognised  as  the  loans  are  granted,  the  commitments undertaken, or the debt securities purchased, without waiting for the occurrence of an objective evidence of impairment.\n\nTo determine the amount of impairment or provision to be recorded at each reporting date, these exposures are split among three categories based on the increase in credit risk observed since initial recognition. An/uni00A0impairment or provision shall be recognised for the exposures in each category as follows:\n\nObserved deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition of the /financial asset\n\n| Credit risk category                                                                                              | Stage 1 Performing assets                                                                 | Under-performing or downgraded assets Stage 2                               | Credit-impaired or defaulted assets Stage 3   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Initial recognition of the instrument in stage 1 Maintained if the credit  risk has not increased  signi/ficantly | Credit risk on the  instrument has increased  signi/ficantly since initial  recognition / | Evidence that the  instrument is become  credit-impaired / 90 days past due | Transfer criteria 30 days past due            |\n| 12-month  expected credit losses                                                                                  | Lifetime  expected credit losses                                                          | Lifetime  expected credit losses                                            | Measurement of credit risk                    |\n| Gross carrying amount of the asset before impairment                                                              | Gross carrying amount of the asset before  impairment                                     | Net carrying amount of  the asset after impairment                          | Interest income recognition basis             |\n\n## Exposures classified in Stage 1\n\nAt the initial recognition date, the exposures are systematically classified in Stage/uni00A01, unless they are purchased or originated credit-impaired instruments.\n\n## Exposures classified in Stage 2\n\nTo identify Stage/uni00A02 exposures, the significant increase in credit risk compared to the date of initial recognition is assessed by the Group using all available past and forward-looking data (behavioural scores, loan to value indicators, macroeconomic forecast scenarios, sector analyses, cash flow projections for some counterparties,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nThe  three  criteria  used  to  assess  the  significant  changes  in  credit  risk  are  detailed  below.  Once  only  one  of  these  three  criteria  is  met, the/uni202Frelevant outstanding is transferred from Stage/uni00A01 to Stage/uni00A02 and related impairments or provisions are adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, the Group does not apply the exemption for low credit risk; it thus carries out an assessment of a significant increase in credit risk for all loans.\n\n## CRITERIA 1: THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE COUNTERPARTY IN 'SENSITIVE'\n\nTo determine the classification of the counterparty as 'sensitive' (notion of watch list), the Group analyses:\n\n- the counterparty's credit rating (where it is the subject of an internal analysis); and p\n- the changes in its operating sector, in macroeconomic conditions and in the behaviours of the counterparty which may also be indicative of p a deterioration in credit risk ' au lieu de ' that may be a sign of deteriorating credit risk.\n\nIf, after a review, a counterparty is deemed 'sensitive' (notion of watch list), all existing contracts between the Group and this counterparty are transferred into Stage/uni00A02 (to the extent that this approach does not lead to a distortion compared with an analysis of the credit quality at the  time  of  granting  of  each  financial  instrument)  and  the  related  impairment  and  provisions  are  increased  up  to  the  lifetime  expected credit/uni202Flosses.\n\nOnce a counterparty has been placed on a watch list, all new transactions originated with that counterparty are recorded in Stage/uni00A01.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## CRITERIA 2: THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHANGE IN A COUNTERPARTY'S CREDIT RATING SINCE THE INITIAL RECOGNITION\n\nThis magnitude is assessed from contract to contract, from the date of their initial recognition to the balance sheet date.\n\nTo determine whether a deterioration or improvement in the credit rating between the date of initial recognition and the balance sheet date is significant enough to prompt a change in the impairment Stage, thresholds are set once a year by the Risk Division. These transfer thresholds between  Stage/uni00A01  and  Stage/uni00A02  are  determined  for  each  homogeneous  portfolio  of  contracts  (notion  of  risk  segment  based  on  the  customer typology  and  the  credit  quality)  and  are  calculated  based  on  their  specific  probability-of-default  curves  (thus,  the  threshold  is  different depending on whether it is a Sovereign portfolio or a Large Corporates portfolio, for instance). These thresholds may be expressed as an absolute or  relative  increase  in  the  probability  of  default.  For  example,  the  threshold  is  set  at  +50/uni00A0bp  for  sovereign  debt,  +100/uni00A0bp  for  the  Very  Large Enterprises (turnover exceeding EUR/uni00A0500/uni00A0million), +200/uni00A0bp for SME and +10/uni00A0bp for the French mortgages of the Societe Generale retail network.\n\nIn  addition  and  in  line  with  the  recommendations  issued  by  the  EBA  and  the  ECB,  loans  for  which  the  probability  of  default  has  been multiplied by three between the date of first recognition and the balance sheet date are transferred to Stage/uni00A02.\n\n## CRITERIA 3: THE EXISTENCE OF PAYMENTS MORE THAN 30 DAYS PAST DUE\n\nThere is a (rebuttable) presumption of a significant deterioration in credit risk when a payment on an asset is more than 30/uni00A0days past due.\n\nThe three criteria are symmetrical: thus, a removal from the watch list of sensitive counterparties, a sufficient improvement in the debtor's credit rating or a settlement of payments more than 30/uni00A0days overdue results in a return to Stage/uni00A01, without any probation period in Stage/uni00A02.\n\n## PARTICULAR CASE OF EXPOSURES WITHOUT CREDIT RATING\n\nFor exposures to counterparties for which no credit rating is available (retail customers and a limited portion of the 'small- and medium- sized companies' segment), the transfer into Stage/uni00A02 is based on:\n\n- the Basel behavioural score or the existence of payments more than 30/uni00A0days past due for retail customers; p\n- the placement on the watch list or the existence of payments more than 30/uni00A0days past due for Corporate. p\n\n## Exposures classified in Stage 3\n\nTo identify Stage/uni00A03 exposures (doubtful exposures), the Group has been applying to most of its entities, since July/uni00A02020, the new definition of default as detailed in the guidelines published by the European Banking Authority (EBA). This definition leads to applying the following criteria to classify exposures as Stage/uni00A03:\n\n- one or more unpaid payments of over 100/uni00A0euros for Retail (500/uni00A0euros for Non-retail) during 90 consecutive days, representing at least 1% of p the total exposure of the customer. This unpaid amount may or may not be accompanied by a recovery procedure (except for restructured loans  classified  into  Stage/uni00A01  or  2  which  are  retransferred  into  Stage/uni00A03  from  the  first  amount  unpaid  after  30/uni00A0days  during  the  two-year probation period). In addition, only missed payments related to business litigations, specific/uni00A0contractual features or IT failures may avoid automatic transfer into Stage/uni00A03 after 90/uni00A0days;\n- identification of other criteria that evidence, even in the absence of missed payments, that this is unlikely that the counterparty could meet p all its financial obligations:\n- a significant deterioration in the counterparty's financial situation creates a strong probability that it will not be able to meet all of its -commitments and thus represents a risk of loss for the Group,\n- the  granting  of  concessions  to  the  clauses  of  the  loan  agreement,  which  would  not  have  been  granted  if  the  counterparty  wasn't -experiencing financial difficulties (restructured loans) and which result in a decrease in the present value of the loan cash flows of more than 1% of its initial value,\n- the existence of litigious proceedings ( ad hoc mandate, bankruptcy protection, court-ordered settlement or compulsory liquidation or -other similar proceedings in local jurisdictions).\n\nThe Group applies the impairment contagion principle to all of the defaulting counterparty's exposures. When a debtor belongs to a group, the impairment contagion principle may also be applied to all of the Group's exposures.\n\nThe classification in Stage/uni00A03 is kept during the 3-month probation period after the disappearance of all default indicators described above. The probation period in Stage/uni00A03 is extended to one year for the restructured loans that have been transferred in Stage/uni00A03.\n\nIn  the  case  of  a  return  to  Stage/uni00A02,  the  exposures  are  kept  in  Stage/uni00A02  during  a  probation  period  before  assessing  whether  they  could  be transferred to Stage/uni00A01. This probation period in Stage/uni00A02 is from six months to two years according to the nature of the risk portfolio to which the exposures belong.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Measurement of depreciation and provision\n\nStage/uni00A01 exposures are impaired for the amount of credit losses that the Group expects to incur within 12/uni00A0months (12-month expected credit losses), based on past data and the current situation. Accordingly, the/uni00A0amount of impairment is the difference between the gross carrying amount of the asset and the present value of future cash flows deemed to be recoverable, taking into account the impact of collateral called up or liable to be called up and the probability of a default event occurring within the next 12/uni00A0months.\n\nStage/uni00A02  and  3  exposures  are  impaired  for  the  amount  of  credit  losses  that  the  Group  expects  to  incur  over  the  life  of  the  exposures (lifetime/uni202Fexpected  credit  losses),  taking  into  consideration  past  data,  the  present  situation  and  reasonable  forecast  changes  in  economic conditions, and relevant macroeconomic factors through to maturity. Accordingly, the amount of impairment is the difference between the gross carrying amount of the asset and the present value of future cash flows deemed to be recoverable, taking into account the impact of collateral called up or liable to be called up and the probability of a default event occurring through to the instrument's maturity.\n\nFinancial guarantees are taken into account in the estimation of the recoverable cash flows when they are integral part of the contractual characteristics of the related loans and they are not recognised separately.\n\nIf  the  financial  guarantees don't meet these criteria and as a consequence their effects cannot be taken into account in the calculation of impairment (example: financial guarantee aimed at compensating the first losses suffered on a given portfolio of loans), a separate asset is recorded in the balance sheet under 'Other Assets'. The book value of this asset is representative of the expected credit losses, recorded in the balance sheet within the impairment of assets, for which the Group is almost certain to receive a compensation. Changes in the carrying amount of this asset are recorded in the income statement under 'Cost of risk'.\n\nIrrespective of the Stage/uni00A0in which the exposures are classified, cash flows are discounted using the initial effective interest rate of the financial asset.  The  amount  of  impairment  is  included  in  the  net  carrying  amount  of  the  credit  impaired  financial  asset.  Impairment allocations/reversals are recorded in the income statement under 'Cost of risk'.\n\nFor operating leases and trade receivables, the Group uses the 'simplified' approach, under which impairments are calculated as lifetime expected credit losses since their initial recognition, regardless of any subsequent changes in the counterparty's credit risk. The assessment of depreciation is mainly based on historical data on default rates and incurred losses in the event of default. Adjustments to take into account forward-looking information on economic conditions and macro-economic factors are determined by an expert.\n\n## Restructured loans\n\nLoans issued or acquired by the Group may be restructured due to financial difficulties. This takes the shape of a contractual modification of the  initial  terms  of  the  loan  ( e.g. lower  interest  rates,  rescheduled  loan  payments,  partial  debt  forgiveness,  or  additional  collateral). This/uni202Fadjustment of the contractual terms is strictly linked to the borrower's financial difficulties and/or insolvency (whether they have already become insolvent or are certain to do so if the loan is not restructured).\n\nWhere they still pass the SPPI test, restructured loans are still recognised in the balance sheet and their amortised cost before credit risk allowance is adjusted for a discount representing the restructuration loss. This discount is equal to the difference between the present value of the new contractual cash flows resulting from the restructuring of the loan and the amortised cost before credit risk allowance less any partial  debt  forgiveness;  it  is  booked  to  Cost  of  risk  in  the  income  statement.  As  a  result,  the  amount  of  interest  income  subsequently recognised into income is still computed using the initial effective interest rate of the loan and based on the net carrying amount of the asset after impairment during at least the first year following the restructuration.\n\nPost-restructuring,  these  financial  assets  are  classified  in  Stage/uni00A03  (credit-impaired  exposures)  whether  the  present  value  of  modified  cash flows decreases by more than 1% compared with the carrying amount of financial instruments before the restructuring or there is a high probability that the counterparty cannot meet all its commitments involving a risk of loss for the Group. In these two cases, the restructuring of  financial  assets  leads  to  default.  Stage/uni00A03  classification  is  maintained  for  at  least  one  year,  or  longer  if  the  Group  is  uncertain  that  the borrowers will be able to meet their commitments. Once the loan is no longer classified in Stage/uni00A03 or the loans which the present value does not decrease more than 1%, the assessment of the significant increase of credit risk will be performed by comparing the characteristics of the instrument at the closing date and the characteristics at the initial recognition date of the loan before restructuring, applying the transfer rules  to  Stage/uni00A01  and  2  previously  mentioned  in  this  note  with  specific  conditions  during  the  probation  period  (during  the  first  two-years following the restructuration, loans are retransferred into Stage/uni00A03 as of payments more than 30/uni00A0days past due).\n\nThe criteria to return to Stage/uni00A01 for the restructured loans are similar to those of all the other exposures, after a probation period in Stage/uni00A03 of a minimum of one year.\n\nGiven the new contractual terms arising from the restructuring where they no longer pass the SPPI test, restructured loans are derecognised and replaced by new loans recognised according to the restructured terms and conditions. These new loans are then classified as Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nRestructured loans do not include loans and receivables subject to commercial renegotiations that are loans to customers for which the Group has agreed to renegotiate the debt with the aim of maintaining or developing a commercial relationship, in accordance with the credit approval procedures in force and without relinquishing any principal or accrued interest.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## SPECIFIC TREATMENT RELATED TO THE REPLACEMENT OF A REFERENCE INTEREST RATE BY AN ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE INTEREST RATE (POSSIBLY INCLUDING A FINANCIAL COMPENSATION) - IBOR REFORM\n\nThe  methodology  for  calculating  impairments  and  provisions  for expected  credit  losses  in  Stage/uni00A01  and  Stage/uni00A02  was  developed  in  the Basel  framework  used  which  was  used  as  a  basis  for  choosing  the methods  for  assessing  the  calculation  parameters  (probability  of default and loss rate for outstanding loans under the Basel advanced approaches - IRBA and IRBF - and provisioning rate for outstanding loans under the standardised approach).\n\nThe  Group  portfolios  have  been  segmented  to  ensure  homogeneous risk characteristics  and  better  correlation  with  macroeconomic variables, both local and global. This segmentation makes it possible to address all the Group's specificities. It is consistent with or similar to the  one  defined  in  the  Basel  framework  to  ensure  the  uniqueness  of the historical records of losses and defaults.\n\nThe variables used in the expected credit loss assessment models are presented  in  Chapter/uni00A04.5.4  of  the  present  Universal  Registration Document.\n\nExpected losses are assessed based on the above-mentioned parameters, supplemented  with  in-house  analyses  of  each  counterparty's  credit quality, performed either individually or statistically.\n\n## COVID-19 CRISIS\n\nAs  at  31/uni00A0December,  to  account  for  uncertainties  related  to  the continuing  sanitary  crisis,  the  Group  has  updated  the  model  and post-model adjustments in keeping with 2020.\n\nIt  will  be  recalled  that  in  2020,  in  response  to  the  Covid-19  crisis, the/uni202Fmodels  and  parameters  used  to  estimate  the  expected  credit losses  had  been  reviewed  and  updated  based  on  new  economic scenarios.  Sectoral  and  other  adjustments  had  been  updated  to supplement the application of these models. A new criterion had also been  established  for  reclassifying  loans  as  underperforming  loans  in Stage/uni00A02.\n\nThese  adjustments  are  taken  into  account  to  estimate  the  expected credit  losses  (Stages/uni00A01  and  2),  except  for  the  additional  criterion  for transfer to Stage/uni00A02 which  concerns  the  classification  of  loans outstanding.\n\n## UPDATE OF THE MODELS AND PARAMETERS USED TO ESTIMATE EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES\n\nWhen applied for determining future default rates, the models used to estimate  the  expected  credit  losses  didn't  reflect  accurately  the economic uncertainties stemming from the current crisis.\n\nSince 2020, the Group  has  made  some  adjustments  to  its models/uni00A0(GDP/uni202Fadjustment and adjustment of the margin rates of French companies) to better reflect the impact of the economic scenarios on the expected credit losses and the effects of the support measures.\n\n## GDP adjustment\n\nThe containment measures taken by governments have resulted in a sudden decline in economic activity reflected in a significant volatility in the quarterly GDP growth rates (year-on-year) in the 2021 and 2022 forecasts in the countries where the Group operates.\n\nFurthermore, the authorities have adopted financial support measures for  households  and  businesses  to  help  them  cope  with  the  sudden deterioration in activity. Therefore, it seems likely that a time-lag will appear between the deterioration in the portfolios' credit quality and that of activity, the first being delayed with respect to the second.\n\nIn  order  to  account for this time-lag, the Group revised its models in 2020, using for each quarter between 2020 and 2022 an average of the changes in GDP over the last eight quarters compared to a base of 100 in 2019. This adjustment has not been used to determine the GDP rates for 2023 to 2025.\n\nAs at 31/uni00A0December 2021, the GDP rates used in the models have been determined as follows:\n\n- for each quarter of 2021 and 2022, the Group used in its models an p average of the changes in GDP over the last eight quarters compared to a base of 100 in 2019. This adjustment has been applied to each of the  four  scenarios  (SG/uni00A0Favourable,  SG/uni00A0Central,  SG/uni00A0Extended/uni00A0and SG/uni00A0Stress)  for  the  GDP  series  used  in  the  modelling  of  expected credit losses (see/uni00A0paragraph/uni00A06 in Note/uni00A01).\n- The data displayed for 2021 and 2022 in the table below correspond to  the  weighted  average  of  the  GDP  growth  rates  of  the  four scenarios, adjusted as described above;\n- the  data  displayed  for  the  years  2023  to  2025  in  the  table  below p correspond to the weighted average of the GDP growth rates of the four scenarios.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The impact of these adjustments is due to:\n\n- 319/uni00A0million euros  corresponding  to  the  above-mentioned  GDP p adjustment;\n- 126/uni00A0million  euros  attributable  to  the  update  of  the  weights  in  the p macro-economic scenarios presented in Note/uni00A01.\n\n## ADJUSTMENTS SUPPLEMENTING THE APPLICATION OF MODELS\n\n## Sectoral adjustments\n\nThe  Group  can  supplement  the  models  with  two  types  of  sectoral adjustments: the first relates to the possible revision of the expected credit loss estimates (with no impact on the classification of loans) of some sectors; the second, implemented since 2020, supplements the analysis  of  the  increase  in  credit  risk  and  may  leads  to  additional transfers in Stage/uni00A02.\n\n## Estimate of the expected credit losses\n\nThe different models used to estimate the expected credit losses may be  supplemented  by  sectoral  adjustments  that  increase  or  decrease the  amount  of  expected  credit  losses.  These  adjustments  allow  to better anticipate defaults or recoveries in certain cyclical sectors that have  been  subject  to  peaks  in  default  in  the  past  or  that  are particularly vulnerable to the current crisis and the Group exposure of which  exceeds  a  threshold  reviewed  and  fixed  yearly  by  the  Risk Division.\n\nThese sectoral adjustments are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis  by  the  Risk  Division  and  approved  by  General  Management according to the materiality threshold.\n\nAt  the  time  when  these  adjustments  are  reviewed  and where consistent with the provisioning horizon, the/uni202Fpossible impact of climate risks on the determination of expected credit losses has been integrated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe total sectoral adjustments amount thus to 536/uni00A0million euros as at 31/uni00A0December 2021  (406/uni00A0million euros  as  at  31/uni00A0December  2020). These/uni202Fchanges  stem  from  the  implementation  during  the  first  half  of 2021  of  ratios  to  take  account  of  the  reduction  in  the  impact  of  the macro-economic  variables  on  the  probabilities  of  default  and  to maintain  a  conservative  coverage  on  the  sectors  impacted  by  the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n## ADDITIONAL CRITERION OF TRANSFER TO STAGE 2\n\nSince 2020 and the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, in addition to the criteria applied at the individual level to classify deteriorated loans as Stage/uni00A02 underperforming loans, an additional expert analysis has been made on the loan portfolios for which a significant increase in credit risk  has  been  observed  since  their  granting.  This  analysis  resulted  in additional  transfers  to  Stage/uni00A02  underperforming  loans  of  all  loans granted  to  sectors  particularly  affected  by  the  Covid-19  crisis  and granted before the crisis. For the loans concerned, in addition to these transfers to Stage/uni00A02, an estimate of the provision has been made taking account  of  the  sectoral  adjustments  (described  above)  which  might have been applied.\n\nThese adjustments amount to 19/uni00A0million euros as at 31/uni00A0December 2021 (122/uni00A0million euros as at 31/uni00A0December 2020). This decrease over 2021 is attributable to the exit from the list of sectors concerned of the motor vehicles, shipping, oil and gas and non-food retail sectors, and to the maturing  of  some  of  the  contracts  concerned.  Some  of  the  sectors excluded  from  the  list  may  nonetheless  continue  to  be  subject  to  a sectoral  adjustment  of  the  expected  credit  losses  mentioned  above, depending  on  their  intrinsic  risk  (and/uni00A0not  on  a  pandemic-related deterioration anymore).\n\n## Other adjustments\n\nAdjustments based on expert opinion have also been made to reflect the  heightened  credit  risk  on  some  portfolios,  when  this  heightened risk  has  not  been  detectable  through  a  line-by-line  analysis  of  the loans outstanding:\n\n- for the scope of entities lacking developed models for estimating the p correlations between  the  macroeconomic  variables  and  the probability of default; and\n- for  the  scopes  on  which  models  are  developed  and  when  these p models cannot reflect future risk not observed in historical records.\n\nThe main sectors concerned are the hotel/restaurant/leisure sectors, as well as the oil and gas, commercial real-estate, cruise operators and airline sectors.\n\n|",

These/uni202Fchanges stem  from  the  cancellation  of  the  adjustments implemented  for  the  loans  under  moratorium,  provided  that  these moratoriums have expired at least a year ago. However, this decrease is  partly  offset  by  the  implementation  of  adjustments  for  the  loans most  exposed  to  the  crisis  to  better  account  for  the  uncertain economic situation.\n\n## CONSIDERATION OF THE SUPPORT MEASURES IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK\n\nThe  support  measures  granted  (and  their  actual  or  upcoming withdrawal) are included in the macro-economic scenarios described\n\nin  Note  1  and  are  thus  taken  into  account  in  the  holistic  customer analysis  in  order  to  assess  the  significant  increase  in  credit  risk (Criteria/uni202F1  and  2  presented  in  the  Accounting  principles  in  Note  3.8). The  phasing  out  of  the  support  measures  is  also  taken  into consideration through the additional criterion for transfer to Stage 2 (aforementioned) for the total outstanding loans, granted before the crisis,  to  the  sectors considered by the Group as particularly affected by the crisis.\n\nThus, despite the absence of actual defaults in a context where most support  measures  have  now  come  to  an  end,  the  Group  maintain  a conservative  provisioning  policy  in  an  uncertain  environment; in/uni202Fparticular in France, with the start of PGE repayments for customers having benefited from a two-year repayment exemption.\n\n## OVERVIEW NOTE 3.8.1\n\nThe tables of this note do not lay out the IAS/uni00A039 impairment related to financial instruments of insurance subsidiaries./uni00A0This impairment is presented in the Note/uni00A04.3.\n\nIn  this  note,  the  unit  of  measurement  selected  is  the  outstanding amounts  for  which  provisions  can  be  booked.

On 31/uni00A0December 2020, covered losses on Stage/uni00A03 loans amounted to EUR/uni00A01,676/uni00A0million. This is in line with the Group strategy  of  non-performing  loans  (NPL)  monitoring,  by  selling  its portfolios of exposures in default situation uncovered losses amount to EUR/uni00A0193/uni00A0million;\n- transfer of loans to Stage/uni00A02  due to downgraded ratings, transfer to p watch list and 30/uni00A0days overdue for EUR/uni00A016.7/uni00A0billion. This transfer was linked to the economic environment affected by the Covid-19 crisis and  resulted  in  an  increase  in  impairment  and  provisions  of EUR/uni00A0378/uni00A0million mainly including:\n- 62% on Corporates portfolio, including 46% on SME, -\n- 37% on Retail portfolio, including 34% on VSB; -\n\n## NOTE 3.8.5\n\nCOST OF RISK\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nCost  of  risk  only  includes  net  reversals  of  impairments  and  loss  allowances  for  credit  risk,  losses  on  irrecoverable  loans  and  amounts recovered on amortised receivables.\n\nThe Group proceed to a write off by recognising a loss on the bad loan and a reversal of impairment in Cost of risk when a debt is forgiven or when there are no longer any hopes of future recovery. The lack of future hopes of recovery is documented when a certificate issued as proof that the debt is uncollectible is delivered by the relevant authority or when strong circumstantial evidences are identified (years in default, provisions at 100%, lack of recent recoveries, specificities of the case).\n\nHowever,  a  write-off  in  accounting  terms  does  not  imply  debt  forgiveness  in  the  legal  sense  as  recovery  actions  on  cash  due  by  the counterparty  are  pursued  particularly  if  the  latter's  fortune  improve.  In  case  of  recoveries  on  an  exposure  previously  written-off,  such recoveries are recognised as Amounts recovered on irrecovrables loans on the year of collection.\n\nThe decrease in the cost of risk results from:\n\n- for  the  outstanding  loans  classified  in  Stage/uni00A03,  by  the  low  level  of p default; and\n- for the outstanding loans classified in Stage/uni00A01 et 2, by the impacts of p the  scenarios  and  weights  (see/uni00A0Note/uni00A01)  used  to  determine  the expected credit losses combined with the methodological adjustments (described above), in particular by the possible time lag\n\nbetween the deterioration of the quality of the credit portfolios and the deterioration in activity, the first one being delayed with respect to the second one.\n\nFurthermore,  the  cost  of  risk  in  2020  included  for  the  first  time  the impacts of the sanitary crisis, while the cost of risk in 2021 has been determined in keeping with the vision adopted in 2020.\n\n|\n\n- transfer  of  loans  to  Stage/uni00A03  due  to  default  for  EUR/uni00A03.3/uni00A0billion p (EUR/uni00A04.9/uni00A0billion at  31/uni00A0December  2020)  of  outstanding  amounts. This/uni202Ftransfer resulted in an increase in impairment and provisions of EUR/uni00A0533/uni00A0million mainly including:\n- 45% on Corporates portfolio, including 50% on SME, -\n- 53% on Retail portfolio, including 36% on VSB; -\n\n## Particularly, this variation concerns:\n\n- EUR/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion  of  outstanding  amounts  for  which  the  impairment -and provisions amount to EUR/uni00A0296/uni00A0million as at 31/uni00A0December/uni202F2021. These contracts were in Stage/uni00A01 as at 31/uni00A0December 2020,\n- EUR/uni00A02.0/uni00A0billion  of  outstanding  amounts  for  which  the  impairment -and provisions amount to EUR/uni00A0364/uni00A0million as at 31/uni00A0December/uni202F2021. These contracts were in Stage/uni00A02 as at 31/uni00A0December 2020;\n- transfer of loans from Stage/uni00A02  to  Stage/uni00A01,  particularly  linked  to  the p update of the list of sensitive sectors impacted by the Covid-19 crisis (notably  the  exclusion  from  this  list  of  the  automotive,  sea  freight transport,  oil  and  gas,  non-food  retail  sectors)  for  EUR/uni00A041.2/uni00A0billion. This transfer resulted in a decrease in impairment and provisions of EUR/uni00A0342/uni00A0million including:\n- 67% on Corporates portfolio, including 25% on SME, -\n- 33% on Retail portfolio, including 37% on VSB. -",

These discount rates are adjusted for borrower credit risk.\n\nThe fair value of loans, receivables and lease financing transactions for retail  banking  customers,  essentially  comprised  of  individuals  and small or medium-sized companies, is determined, in the absence of an actively traded market for these loans, by discounting the associated expected cash flows to present value at the market rates prevailing on the  balance  sheet  date  for  similar  types  of  loans  with  similar maturities.\n\nFor  floating-rates  loans,  receivables  and  lease  financing  transactions and fixed-rate loans with an initial maturity of less than or equal to one year, fair value is taken to be the same as the gross carrying amount adjusted  for  any  allowance,  assuming  there  has  been  no  significant change in credit spreads on the counterparties in question since they were recognised in the balance sheet.\n\n## DEBTS\n\nThe fair value of debts, in the absence of an actively traded market for these  liabilities,  is  taken  to  be  the  same  as  the  value  of  future  cash flows discounted to present value at the market rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. When the debt is a listed instrument, its fair value is its market value.\n\nWhen the debt is a listed instrument, its fair value is its market value.\n\nFor debts with a floating-rate and debts with an initial maturity of less than  or  equal  to  one  year,  fair  value  is  taken  to  be  the  same  as  the carrying amount. Similarly, the individual fair value of demand deposit accounts is equal to their carrying amount.\n\n## SECURITIES\n\nProvided that the security is an instrument traded on an active market, its fair value is equal to the market/uni00A0price.\n\nIf  no active market exists, the fair value of the securities is calculated by  discounting  expected  cash  flows  to  present  value  based  on  the market  rates.  For  variable-rate  debt  securities  and  fixed-rate  debt securities with an agreed duration of up to one year, the fair value is assumed to be the gross carrying amount adjusted for any allowance provided there have been no significant change in credit spreads on the  counterparties  in  question  since  they  were  recognised  in  the balance sheet.\n\n|",

Thereafter, they are provisioned as necessary in accordance with the accounting principles for impairment and provisions (see Note/uni00A03.8).\n\n## Guarantee commitments\n\nWhen considered as non-derivative financial instruments, the financial guarantees issued by the Group are initially recognised in the balance sheet at  fair  value.  Thereafter,  they  are  measured  at  either  the  amount  of  the  obligation  or  the  amount  initially  recognised  (whichever  is higher) less, when appropriate, the cumulative amortisation of a guarantee commission. Where there is objective evidence of impairment, a/uni202Fprovision for financial guarantees given is recognised on the liabilities side of the balance sheet (see Note/uni00A03.8).\n\n## Securities commitments\n\nSecurities bought and sold, which are booked to Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and Financial assets at amortised cost are recognised on the balance sheet at the settlement-delivery date. Between  the  trade  date  and  the  settlement-delivery  date,  securities  receivable  or  deliverable  are  not  recognised  on  the  balance  sheet. Changes in the fair value of the securities measured at fair value through profit or loss and the securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income between the trade date and the settlement-delivery date are booked to profit or loss or to equity, depending on the accounting classification of the securities in question.\n\n## COMMITMENTS NOTE 3.10.1\n\n## COMMITMENTS GRANTED\n\n| (In EURm)                                                         | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Loan commitments                                                  |              |              |\n| To banks                                                          | 60,870       | 45,707       |\n| To customers                                                      | 200,224      | 194,890      |\n| Issuance facilities                                               | 83           | 83           |\n| Confirmed credit lines                                            | 185,065      | 185,061      |\n| Others                                                            | 15,076       | 9,746        |\n| Guarantee commitments                                             |              |              |\n| On behalf of banks                                                | 5,279        | 4,541        |\n| On behalf of customers (1)                                        | 74,433       | 59,297       |\n| Securities commitments                                            |              |              |\n| Securities to be delivered                                        | 32,999       | 26,387       |\n| Acquisition of tangible assets commitments                        |              |              |\n| Purchase of vehicles and equipments subject to an operating lease | 4,682        | 2,641        |\n\n- Including capital and performance guarantees given to the holders of UCITS managed by entities of the Group.

It  may  re-use  the securities  received  under  resale  agreement  by  selling  them  outright, selling  them  under  repurchase  agreements  or  pledging  them  as security, provided that it returns these or equivalent securities to the\n\ncounterparty to the resale agreement at its term.

For  repurchase  agreements,  the  obligation  to  return  the  amounts  deposited  is  recorded  under  Liabilities  on  the liabilities  side  of  the  balance  sheet,  with  the  exception  of  the  transactions  initiated  under  trading  activities,  which  are  recorded  under Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nSecurities involved in a reverse repurchase agreement or a securities borrowing transaction are not recorded in the Group's balance sheet. For/uni202Fsecurities  received  under  a  reverse  repurchase  agreement,  the  right  to  recover  the  amounts  delivered  by  the  Group  is  recorded  under Customer Loans and receivables or Due from banks on the asset side of the balance sheet, with the exception of transactions initiated under trading activities which are recorded under Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. If the borrowed securities are subsequently sold,  a  debt  representing  the  return  of  these  securities  to  their  lender  is  recorded  on  the  liabilities  side  of  the  Group's  balance  sheet, under/uni202FFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nSecurities lending and securities borrowing transactions that are fully matched by cash are assimilated to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and are recorded and recognised as such in the balance sheet.\n\nWith securities lending and repurchase agreements, the Group remains exposed to issuer default (credit/uni00A0risk) and to increases or decreases in the value of securities value (market risk). The underlying securities cannot simultaneously be used as collateral in other transactions.\n\n|",

The legal right to set off the recognised amounts must be enforceable in all circumstances, in both the normal course of business and in the event of default of one of the counterparties. In this respect, the Group recognises in its balance sheet the net amount of derivative financial instruments traded with certain clearing houses where they achieve net settlement through a daily cash margining  process,  or  where  their  gross  settlement  system  has  features  that  eliminate  or  result  in  insignificant  credit  and  liquidity  risk, and/uni202Fthat process receivables and payables in a single settlement process or cycle.\n\nThe  following  tables  present  the  amounts  of  financial  assets  and financial liabilities set off on the Group's consolidated balance sheet. The gross outstanding amounts of these financial assets and financial liabilities  are  matched  with  the  consolidated  outstanding  amounts presented  in  the  balance  sheet  (net  balance  sheet  amounts), after/uni202Findicating  the  amounts  set  off  on  the  balance  sheet  for  these various  instruments  (amounts/uni00A0offset)  and  aggregating  them  with  the outstanding amounts of other financial assets and financial liabilities not  subject  to  a  Master  Netting  Agreement  or  similar  agreement (amounts of assets and liabilities not eligible for offsetting).\n\nconsolidated  financial  statements  under  IFRS.  This  information  is provided in comparison with the accounting treatment applied under US GAAP. This affects in particular financial instruments that may only be offset in the event of the default, insolvency or bankruptcy of one of the  counterparties,  as  well  as  instruments  pledged  by  cash  or securities  collateral.  These  mainly  include  over-the-counter  interest rate options, interest rate swaps and securities purchased/sold under resale/repurchase agreements.\n\nThese tables also indicate the amounts which may be offset, as they are  subject  to  a  Master  Netting  Agreement  or  similar  agreement, but/uni202Fwhose  characteristics  make  them  ineligible  for  offsetting  in  the\n\n## AT 31 DECEMBER 2021 NOTE 3.12.1\n\n## ASSETS\n\n|                                                                               |                                                 | Impact of offsetting on the balance sheet   | Impact of offsetting on the balance sheet   |                                           | Impact of Master Netting Agreements (MNA) and similar agreements (1)   | Impact of Master Netting Agreements (MNA) and similar agreements (1)   | Impact of Master Netting Agreements (MNA) and similar agreements (1)   |            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| (In EURm)                                                                     | Amount of liabilities not subject to offsetting | Gross amount                                | Amount offset                               | Net amount presented on the balance sheet | Financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet                  | Cash collateral pledged                                                | Financial instruments pledged as collateral                            | Net amount |\n| Derivative financial  instruments  (see Notes/uni00A03.1 and 3.2)             | 17,748                                          | 176,550                                     | (80,704)                                    | 113,594                                   | (70,403)                                                               | (13,415)                                                               | (129)                                                                  | 29,647     |\n| Securities lent                                                               | 7,210                                           | 7,413                                       | -

Fees that can be assimilated to interest are integrated into the effective interest rate on the associated financial instrument and are recorded under Interest and similar income and Interest and similar expense (see Note/uni00A03.7).\n\nTransactions with customers include the fees from retail customers from the Group retail banking activities (in particular credit card fees, account management fees or application fees outside the effective interest rate).\n\nSundry services provided include the fees from customers from the other Group activities (in particular, interchange fees, funds management fees or fees on insurance products sold within the network).\n\nThe Group recognises fee income or expense for an amount equivalent to the remuneration for the service provided and depending on the progress transferring control of these services:\n\n- fees for ongoing services, such as some payment services, custody fees, or digital service subscriptions are recognised as income over the p life of the service;\n- fees for one-off services, such as fund activity, finder's fees received, arbitrage fees, or penalties on payment incidents are recognised as p income when the service is provided.\n\nThe amount equivalent to the remuneration for the service provided is composed of fixed and variable contractual compensation whether they are paid in kind or in cash, less any payments due to customers (for/uni00A0example, in case of promotional offers). The variable compensation (for  example,  discounts  based  on  the  provided  services  volume  over  a  period  of  time  or  fees  payable  subject  to  the  achievement  of  a performance target,/uni00A0etc.) are included in the amount equivalent to the remuneration for the service provided if and only if this compensation is highly probable not to be subsequently reduced significantly.\n\nThe possible mismatch between the payment date of the service provided and the date of execution of the service gives assets and liabilities depending on the type of contract and mismatch which are recognised under Other Assets and Other Liabilities (see Note/uni00A04.4):\n\n- customer contracts generate trade receivables, accrued income or prepaid income; p\n- supplier contracts generate trade payables, accrued expenses or prepaid expenses. p\n\nIn  syndication  deals,  the  effective  interest  rate  for  the  share  of  the  issuance  retained  on  the  Group's  balance  sheet  is  comparable  to  that applied to the other members of the syndicate including, when needed, a share of the underwriting fees and participation fees; the balance of these fees for services rendered is then recorded under Fee income at the end of the syndication period. Arrangement fees are recorded as income when the placement is legally complete.\n\n|                                                            | 2021   | 2021    | 2021   | 2020   | 2020    | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|---------|--------|\n| (In EURm)                                                  | Income | Expense | Net    | Income | Expense | Net    |\n| Transactions with banks                                    | 161    | (107)   | 54     | 159    | (108)   | 51     |\n| Transactions with customers                                | 3,028  |         | 3,028  | 2,820  |         | 2,820  |\n| Financial instruments operations                           | 2,288  | (2,379) | (91)   | 2,208  | (2,215) | (7)    |\n| Securities transactions                                    | 532    | (1,105) | (573)  | 503    | (1,042) | (539)  |\n| Primary market transactions                                | 213    |         | 213    | 203    |         | 203    |\n| Foreign exchange transactions and derivatives  instruments | 1,543  | (1,274) | 269    | 1,502  | (1,173) | 329    |\n| Loan and guarantee commitments                             | 894    | (261)   | 633    | 795    | (271)   | 524    |\n| Various services                                           | 2,791  | (1,095) | 1,696  | 2,547  | (1,018) | 1,529  |\n| Asset management fees                                      | 659    |         | 659    | 613    |         | 613    |\n| Means of payment fees                                      | 921    |         | 921    | 795    |         | 795    |\n| Insurance product fees                                     | 256    |         | 256    | 260    |         | 260    |\n| Underwriting fees of UCITS                                 | 93     |         | 93     | 77     |         | 77     |\n| Other fees                                                 | 862    | (1,095) | (233)  | 802    | (1,018) | (216)  |\n| TOTAL                                                      | 9,162  | (3,842) | 5,320  | 8,529  | (3,612) | 4,917  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Lease/uni202Fpayments are recognised as income according to the straight-line method over the term of the lease. Meanwhile, the purpose of the accounting treatment of the income from invoices for maintenance services related to operating leases is to reflect, over the term of the service agreement, a constant margin between this income and the expenses incurred in providing the service.\n\nIncome and expenses, and capital gains or losses on investment properties and leased assets, as well as income and expense on maintenance services related to operating lease activities, are recorded under Income and expenses from other activities on the Real estate leasing and Equipment leasing lines.\n\nThese lines also include the losses incurred in the event of a decline in the unguaranteed residual value of finance-lease transactions, and the capital gains or losses on disposal related to unleased assets once the lease finance agreements are terminated.\n\nThe leases granted by the Group entities may include the maintenance service of the leased equipment. In/uni00A0this case, the portion of rentals corresponding  to  this  maintenance  service  is  spread  over  the  duration  of  the  service  (generally  the  lease  contract  duration)  and,  when necessary, considers the progress of the service provided when it is not linear.\n\n## Real estate development activities\n\nAs the sale of real estate off plan (housing, office property, retail areas,/uni00A0etc.) is an ongoing service, the margin of this activity is progressively recognised over the construction programme's duration until the delivery date to the customer. It is recognised under income when this margin is positive and under expenses when this margin is negative.\n\nThe margin recognised at each closing period reflects the programme's estimated margin forecast and its stage of completion at the end of the period which depends on the progress in terms of marketing and the project.\n\n|                         | 2021   | 2021     | 2021   | 2020   | 2020    | 2020   |\n|-------------------------|--------|----------|--------|--------|---------|--------|\n| (In EURm)               | Income | Expense  | Net    | Income | Expense | Net    |\n| Real estate development | 79     | -        | 79     | 65     | (1)     | 64     |\n| Real estate leasing     | 40     | (56)     | (16)   | 37     | (23)    | 14     |\n| Equipment leasing (1)   | 11,630 | (9,532)  | 2,098  | 10,933 | (9,248) | 1,685  |\n| Other activities        | 488    | (850)    | (362)  | 436    | (451)   | (15)   |\n| TOTAL                   | 12,237 | (10,438) | 1,799  | 11,471 | (9,723) | 1,748  |\n\n- The amount recorded under this heading is mainly due to income and expenses related to long-term leasing and car fleet management businesses.

The  Group  maintained  the  necessary  arrangements  to  forbid  all  transfers  of  financial instruments between its insurance sector and any other sector in the Group that would lead to a derecognition of the instrument by the seller, except for transfers of financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss by both sectors involved in such transfers.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  ANC  recommendation  of  2/uni00A0June  2017  related  to  the  consolidated  statements  of  banking  institutions  with  the international  accounting  standards,  separate  lines  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  clarification  purposes:  Investments  of insurance activities under balance sheet assets, Insurance contracts related liabilities under balance sheet liabilities and Net income from insurance activities under net banking income in the income statement.\n\nThe main subsidiaries concerned are Sog\u00e9cap, Antarius, Sogelife, Oradea Vie, Komercni Pojistovna/uni00A0A.S. and Sogessur.\n\n## INSURANCE CONTRACTS RELATED LIABILITIES NOTE 4.3.1\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\n## Underwriting reserves of insurance companies\n\nUnderwriting reserves correspond to the commitments of insurance companies with respect to policyholders and the beneficiaries of policies.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS/uni00A04  on  insurance  contracts,  life  and  non-life  underwriting  reserves  continue  to  be  measured  under  the  same  local regulations,  with  the  exception  of  certain  prudential  provisions  that  are  cancelled  (liquidity  risk  provision)  or  recalculated  economically (mainly, overall management reserve).\n\nRisks covered by non-life insurance policies are principally linked to home, car and accident protection guarantees. Underwriting reserves comprise reserves for unearned premiums (share of premium income relating to subsequent financial years) and for outstanding claims.\n\nRisks covered by life insurance policies are principally death, invalidity and incapacity for work. Life/uni00A0insurance underwriting reserves mainly comprise actuarial reserves, which correspond to the difference between the present value of commitments falling to the insurer and those falling to the policyholder, and/uni00A0the reserve for claims incurred but not settled.\n\nIn saving-life insurance products:\n\n- underwriting reserves of saving-life insurance contracts invested in EUR-denominated policies with profit sharing clauses consist primarily p of mathematical provisions and provisions for profit-sharing;\n- underwriting  reserves  of  saving-life  insurance  contracts  invested  in  unit-linked  policies  or  with  a/uni00A0significant  insurance  clause p (mortality,/uni202Finvalidity,/uni00A0etc.) are measured at the inventory date according to the realisation value of the assets underlying these contracts.\n\nUnder the principles defined in IFRS/uni00A04, and in compliance with local regulations applicable with respect thereto, life insurance policies with discretionary profit-sharing features are subject to 'mirror accounting', whereby any changes in the value of financial assets liable to affect policyholders are recorded in Deferred profit-sharing. This reserve is calculated to reflect the potential rights of policyholders to unrealised gains on financial instruments measured at fair value or their potential share of unrealised losses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

        "page_content": "To demonstrate the recoverability of the deferred profit-sharing asset in the event of an unrealised net loss, two approaches are verified by the Group in order to show that the liquidity requirements caused by an unfavourable economic environment would not require assets to be sold in the event of unrealised losses:\n\n- the  first  approach  consists  in  simulating  deterministic  ('standardised'  or  extreme)  stress  scenarios.  This/uni00A0is  used  to  show  that  in  these p scenarios no significant losses would be realised on the assets existing at the balance sheet date for the scenarios tested;\n- the aim of the second approach is to ensure that in the long or medium term, the sale of assets to meet liquidity needs would not generate p any significant losses. The approach is verified considering projections based on extreme scenarios.\n\nMoreover, a Liability Adequacy Test (LAT) is also carried out quarterly at the level of each consolidated entities operating in the insurance. This/uni202Ftest involves comparing the carrying amount of insurance liabilities with the average economic value using a stochastic model of future cash flows. This test takes into account all of the future cash flows from policies, including benefits, management charges, fees, policy options and guarantees related to the contracts; It does not include future premiums. If the test concludes that the book value is insufficient, the value of insurance liabilities will be adjusted with a corresponding entry in the income statement.\n\n## Classification of financial liabilities\n\nAt initial recognition, financial liabilities resulting from the Group's insurance activities are classified in the following accounting categories:\n\n- financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss: these are derivative financial liabilities; p\n- financial  liabilities  measured  at  fair  value  option  through  profit  or  loss:  these  are  non-derivative  financial  liabilities  that  were  initially p designated by the Group to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (using the option). These include investment contracts without both discretionary profit-sharing clauses and insurance component, that do not meet the definition of an insurance contract under IFRS/uni00A04 (unit-linked insurance contracts only) and are thus governed by IAS/uni00A039.\n\n## BREAKDOWN\n\n| (In EURm)                                                                      | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Underwriting reserves of insurance companies                                   | 151,148      | 142,106      |\n| Financial liabilities of insurance companies                                   | 4,140        | 4,020        |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss                     | 520          | 583          |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option) | 3,620        | 3,437        |\n| TOTAL                                                                          | 155,288      | 146,126      |\n\n## UNDERWRITING RESERVES OF INSURANCE COMPANIES\n\n| (In EURm)                                                                      | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Life insurance underwriting reserves for unit-linked policies                  | 44,138       | 35,794       |\n| Other life insurance underwriting reserves                                     | 94,280       | 92,620       |\n| Non-life insurance underwriting reserves                                       | 2,020        | 1,834        |\n| Deferred profit-sharing booked in liabilities                                  | 10,710       | 11,858       |\n| TOTAL                                                                          | 151,148      | 142,106      |\n| Attributable to reinsurers                                                     | (776)        | (749)        |\n| Underwriting reserves of insurance net of the share attributable to reinsurers | 150,372      | 141,357      |\n\n|",

In particular, insurance entities measure at fair value using the option the financial assets representing unit-linked contracts in order to eliminate the accounting mismatch with the related insurance liabilities, as well as interests in UCITS over which a significant influence exists;\n- available-for-sale financial assets: these are non-derivative financial assets held for an indeterminate period, which the insurance entity p may sell at any time. By default, they are any assets that do not fall into one of the one of the other categories. These instruments are measured at fair value against Unrealised or deferred gains and losses. Interests accrued or paid on debt securities are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method while dividend income earned on equity securities is recorded under Net gains and losses on available-for-sale financial assets. If there is an objective evidence on an individual basis, the total accumulated unrealised loss previously recorded in shareholders' equity is reclassified in profit or loss under Net Income from insurance activities;\n- loans and receivables: these include non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active p market and are not held for trading purposes, not held for sale from the time they are originated or acquired, and not designated upon initial  recognition  to  be  carried  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  (in  accordance  with  the  fair  value  option).  They  are  measured  at amortised cost, and impairment, determined on an individual basis, may be recorded if appropriate;\n- held-to-maturity  financial  assets:  these  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable  payments  and  a  fixed  maturity, p that/uni202Fare  quoted  in  an  active  market  and  which  the  Group  has  the  intention  and  ability  to  hold  to  maturity.  They  are  measured  at  their amortised cost and may be subject to impairment as appropriate whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually.\n\nAll these categories are presented on the insurance entity's balance sheet under the Investments of insurance companies, which also includes investment properties held by insurance entities and hedge derivatives assessed in accordance with the accounting principles respectively presented in Note/uni00A08.4 and/uni00A0Note/uni00A03.2.\n\n## Reclassification of financial assets\n\nAfter their initial recognition, financial assets may not be later reclassified as Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nA  non-derivative  financial  asset  initially  recognised  under  Financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  as  an  asset  held  for  trading purposes may only be reclassified out of this category under specific conditions framed by IAS/uni00A039/uni00A0standard.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT\n\n## Impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\nFor debt instruments not measured at fair value through net income, the criteria used by the insurance entity's insurance entities to assess individually objective evidence of impairment include the following conditions:\n\n- a significant decline in the counterparty's financial situation leads to a high probability of said counterparty being unable to fulfil its overall p commitments, implying then a risk of loss for the insurance entity (the appreciation of this deterioration can be based on the evolution of the rating of the issuers or the variations of the credit spreads changes observed on these markets);\n- the occurrence of late payment of coupons and more generally of arrears of more than 90/uni00A0days; p\n- or, regardless of whether or not any past-due payments are recorded. There is objective evidence of impairment or legal proceedings have p been initiated (bankruptcy, legal settlement, compulsory liquidation).\n\nIf there is objective evidence that loans or other receivables, or financial assets classified as held-to-maturity financial assets, are impaired, an/uni202Fimpairment is recognised for the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of estimated future recoverable cash flows, taking into account any guarantees. This/uni00A0discount is calculated using the financial assets' original effective interest rate. The amount of this impairment is deducted from the carrying value of the impaired financial asset.\n\nThe allocations and reversals of impairments are recorded under net income from investments in the Net income from insurance activities. The impaired loans or receivables are remunerated for accounting purposes by the reversal over time of the discounting to present value, which is recorded under interest income in the Net income from insurance activities.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets\n\nAn available-for-sale financial asset is impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of this asset.\n\nFor listed equity instruments, a significant or prolonged decline in their price below their acquisition cost constitutes objective evidence of impairment. For this  purpose,  insurance  entities  consider  as  impaired  listed  shares  showing  an  unrealised  loss  greater  than  50%  of  their acquisition price on the balance sheet date, as well as listed shares for which the quoted prices have been below their acquisition price on every trading day for at least the last 24/uni00A0months before the balance sheet date. Further factors, such as the financial situation of the issuer or its  development  outlook,  can  lead  the  insurance  entities  to  consider  that  the  cost  of  its  investment  may  not  be  recovered  even  if  the abovementioned criteria  are  not  met.  An  impairment  loss  is  then  recorded  through  net  income  equal  to  the  difference  between  the  last quoted price of the security on the balance sheet date and its acquisition price.\n\nFor unlisted equity instruments, the criteria used to assess the evidence of impairment are identical to those mentioned above. The value of these instruments at the balance sheet date is determined using the valuation methods described in Note/uni00A03.4.\n\nThe criteria for the impairment of debt instruments are similar to those for the impairment of financial assets measured at amortised cost.\n\nWhen a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in shareholders' equity under Unrealised or deferred gains and losses and subsequent objective evidence of impairment emerges, insurance entities recognise the total accumulated unrealised loss previously recorded in shareholders' equity in the income statement among under net income from investments in the Net income from insurance activities for equity instruments and under Cost of risk for debt instruments.\n\nThis cumulative loss is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any repayments of principal and amortisation) and the present fair value, less any impairment of the financial asset that has already been recorded through profit or loss.\n\nImpairment losses recognised through profit or loss on an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale are only reversed through profit or loss when the instrument is sold. Once an equity instrument has been recognised as impaired, any further loss of value is recorded as an additional impairment loss. For debt instruments, however, an impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss if they subsequently recover in value following an improvement in the issuer's credit risk.\n\n## OTHER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nAccounting  principles  relative  to  fair  value,  initial  recognition  of  financial  instruments,  derecognition  of  financial  instruments, derivative/uni202Ffinancial instruments, interest income and expense, transferred financial assets and offsetting of financial instruments are similar to those described in Note/uni00A03 'Financial instruments'.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\n| (In EURm)                                                                 | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (trading portfolio) | 211          | 291          |\n| Shares and other equity instruments                                       | 36           | 51           |\n| Trading derivatives                                                       | 175          | 240          |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (fair value option) | 84,448       | 70,422       |\n| Bonds and other debt instruments                                          | 34,280       | 32,178       |\n| Shares and other equity instruments                                       | 49,592       | 37,942       |\n| Loans, receivables and repo transactions                                  | 576          | 302          |\n| Hedging derivatives                                                       | 353          | 438          |\n| Available-for-sale financial assets                                       | 88,486       | 89,755       |\n| Debt instruments                                                          | 74,084       | 75,662       |\n| Equity instruments                                                        | 14,402       | 14,093       |\n| Due from banks (2)                                                        | 4,771        | 5,301        |\n| Customer loans                                                            | 69           | 76           |\n| Held-to-maturity financial assets                                         | 22           | 32           |\n| Real estate investments                                                   | 538          | 539          |\n| TOTAL INVESTMENTS OF INSURANCE ACTIVITIES (1)(2)                          | 178,898      | 166,854      |\n\n- Investments in other Group companies that are made in representation of unit-linked liabilities are kept in the Group's consolidated balance sheet without any (1) significant impact thereon.\n- o/w EUR/uni00A01,207/uni00A0million of current accounts as at 31/uni00A0December 2021 vs. EUR/uni00A0897/uni00A0million as at 31/uni00A0December 2020.

Since/uni202Fthe life insurance business is predominant on the French market in the Group's insurance activities, the market risks of financial assets in terms  of  technical  liabilities  constitute  the  most  significant exposure. Within market risks, the insurance business line is sensitive to  shocks  in  interest  rates,  equity  markets  and  credit  spreads. In/uni202Fconnection  with  the  life  insurance  savings  activity,  the  risk  of withdrawls is also significant.\n\nManaging these risks is key to the Insurance business line's activity. It/uni202Fis carried out by qualified and experienced teams, with major bespoke IT resources. Risks undergo regular monitoring and are reported to the General  Management  of  both  the  entities  concerned  and  the business/uni202Flines.\n\nRisk management techniques are based on the following:\n\n- heightened security for the risk acceptance process, with the aim of p guaranteeing that the price schedule matches the policyholder's risk profile and the guarantees provided;\n- regular monitoring of indicators on product claims rates in order to p adjust  certain  product  parameters,  such  as  pricing  or  the  level  of guarantee, if necessary;\n- implementation of a reinsurance  plan  to  protect  the  business  line p from major/serial claims;\n\nManagement of risks linked to the financial markets and to ALM is an integral  part  of  the  investment  strategy  just  like  objectives  on long-term performance. The optimisation of these two factors is highly influenced  by  the  asset/liability  balance.  Liability  commitments (guarantees offered to customers, maturity of policies), as well as the amounts  booked  under  the  major  items  on  the  balance  sheet (shareholders' equity, income, provisions, reserves,/uni00A0etc.) are analysed by the Finance and Risk Department of the insurance business line.\n\nRisk management  related  to  financial  markets  (interest  rates, credit/uni202Fand shares) and to ALM is based on the following:\n\n- monitoring short- and long-term cash flows (match between the term p of a liability and the term of an asset, liquidity risk management);\n- particular monitoring of policyholder behaviour (redemption); p\n- close monitoring of financial markets; p\n- hedging of exchange rate risks (both rising and falling); p\n- defining  thresholds  and  limits  per  counterparty,  per  rating  issuer p and per category of assets;\n- stress tests, the results of which are presented annually at entities' p Board of Directors' meetings, as part of the ORSA report (Own Risk and Solvency Assessment), transferred to the ACPR after approval by the Board;\n- application of policies related to ALM and investment risks. p\n- application of policies on risk, provisioning and reinsurance. p\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF NET INVESTMENTS BY RATING OF BASIC INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe following table shows the gross carrying amounts after eliminating intercompany transactions.\n\n## 31.12.2021\n\n| (In EURm)               | Available-for-sale financial assets   | Due from banks   | Customer loans   | Held-to-maturity financial assets   | Total   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| AAA                     | 3,347                                 | 207              | -                | -                                   | 3,554   |\n| AA+/AA/AA-              | 36,087                                | 753              | -                | -                                   | 36,840  |\n| A+/A/A-                 | 16,027                                | 537              | -                | -                                   | 16,564  |\n| BBB+/BBB/BBB-           | 14,757                                | 174              | -                | 22                                  | 14,953  |\n| BB+/BB/BB-              | 1,057                                 | -                | -                | -                                   | 1,057   |\n| B+/B/B-                 | 20                                    | -                | -                | -                                   | 20      |\n| CCC+/CCC/CCC-           | -                                     | -                | -                | -                                   | -       |\n| CC+/CC/CC-              | -                                     | -                | -                | -                                   | -       |\n| Lower than CC-          | -                                     | -                | -                | -                                   | -       |\n| Without rating          | 242                                   | 888              | 69               | -                                   | 1,199   |\n| TOTAL BEFORE IMPAIRMENT | 71,537                                | 2,559            | 69               | 22                                  | 74,187  |\n| Impairment              | -                                     | -                | -                | -                                   | -       |\n| CARRYING AMOUNT         | 71,537                                | 2,559            | 69               | 22                                  | 74,187  |\n\nThe rating scale is the one used for meeting the requirements imposed by two purposes, which calls for the second highest rating determined by the rating agencies (Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings) to be used.

All  other transactions with these individuals are insignificant.\n\n## Employee benefits NOTE 5.2\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nEmployee benefits are divided into four categories:\n\n- short-term employee benefits; p\n- post-employment benefits, including defined contributions plans and defined benefit plans such as pension plans and retirement benefits; p\n- others long-term employee benefits which are employee benefits not expected to be settled wholly before twelve months, such as defined p variable compensation paid in cash and not indexed to the Societe/uni00A0Generale share, long service awards and time saving accounts;\n- termination benefits. p\n\n## Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits are recognised as Expenses payable on employee benefits. The settlement is expected to be settled wholly before  twelve  months  after  the  end  of  the  annual  reporting  period  in  which  the  employees  render  the  related  service,  such  as  fixed  and variable compensation, annual leave, taxes and social security contributions, mandatory employer contributions and profit-sharing.\n\n## Post-employment benefits\n\nPost-employment benefits can be broken down into two categories: defined contribution pension plans or defined benefit pension plans.\n\n## POST-EMPLOYMENT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS\n\nDefined contribution plans limit the Group's liability to the subscriptions paid into the plan but do not commit the Group to a specific level of future benefits. Contributions paid are recorded as an expense for the current year.\n\n## POST-EMPLOYMENT DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS\n\nDefined benefit plans commit the Group, either formally or constructively, to pay a certain amount or level of future benefits and therefore bare the associated medium or long-term risk.\n\nProvisions are recognised on the liabilities side of the balance sheet under Provisions, to cover the whole of these retirement obligations. These  provisions  are  assessed  regularly  by  independent  actuaries  using  the  projected  unit  credit  method.  This  valuation  technique incorporates assumptions about demographics, early/uni00A0retirement, salary rises and discount and inflation rates.\n\n|\n\n## TOTAL AMOUNTS PROVISIONED OR BOOKED BY THE SOCIETE GENERALE GROUP FOR THE PAYMENT OF PENSIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS\n\nThe  total  amount  provisioned  or  booked  by  the  Societe  Generale Group at 31/uni00A0December 2021 under IAS/uni00A019 for the payment of pensions and  other  benefits  to  Societe  Generale's  Chief  Executive  Officers (Ms/uni00A0Lebot  and  Mr./uni00A0Aymerich,  the  two  staff-elected  Directors  and  the Director representing employee shareholders) is/uni00A08.4/uni00A0million of euros.",

        "page_content": "Group can choose to finance defined benefit plans by assets held by a long-term employee benefit fund or by qualifying insurance policies. Funding assets, made by funds or insurance policies, are classified as plan assets if assets are held by an entity (fund) that is legally separate from the reporting entity and are available to be used only to pay employee benefits. When these plans are financed from external funds classified as plan assets, the fair value of these funds is subtracted from the provision to cover the obligations. When/uni00A0these plans are financed from funds not classified as plan assets, these funds, classified as separate assets, are displayed separately in the assets of the balance sheet under Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nDifferences  arising  from  changes  in  calculation  assumptions  (early  retirements,  discount  rates,  etc.)  and  differences  between  actuarial assumptions and real performance are recognised as actuarial gains and losses. Actuarial gains and losses, as well as the return on plan assets excluding amounts expensed as net interest on the net defined benefit liability (or asset) and any change in the effect of the asset ceiling are components  used  to  re-measure  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (or  asset).  These  components  are  immediately  and  fully  recognised  in shareholder's equity among Unrealised or deferred gains and losses. These items cannot be subsequently reclassified as income and are presented under Retained earnings on the liabilities side of the balance sheet and on a separate line under the Statement of net income and unrealised or deferred gains and losses.\n\nWhen a new or amended plan comes into force, past service cost is immediately recognised in profit or loss.\n\nAn annual charge is recorded under Personnel expenses for defined benefit plans consisting of the additional entitlements vested by each employee (current service cost), past service cost resulting from a plan amendment or a curtailment, the financial expense resulting from the discount rate and the interest income on plan assets (net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset), plan settlements.\n\n## Other long-term benefits\n\nOther long-term employee benefits are benefits other than post-employment and termination benefits, that are paid to employees more than twelve months after the end of the annual period in which they provided the related services.\n\nOther long-term benefits are measured and recognised in the same way as post-employment benefits, with the exception of actuarial gains and losses, which are immediately recognised as profit or loss.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination  benefits  refer  to  the  benefits  to  be  granted  to  an  employee  following  the  termination  by  the  entity  of  the  staff  member's employment contract before the normal retirement age or the decision of the staff member to voluntarily leave in exchange for these benefits.\n\nTermination benefits payable more than 12/uni00A0months after the closing date shall be discounted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Benefits  paid  out  in  annuities  supplement  the  pensions  paid  by  the mandatory basic plans.\n\nThe main defined benefit plans are located in France, in Switzerland, in/uni202Fthe United Kingdom and in the United States.\n\nIn  France,  the  supplementary  pension  plan  for  executive  managers, set/uni202Fup  in  1991,  allocates  an  annual  allowance to beneficiaries covered by  Societe  Generale  as  described  in  the  Chapter/uni00A03  'Corporate Governance'  of the present Universal Registration Document. This/uni202Fallowance  depends  in  particular  on  the  beneficiary's  seniority within  Societe  Generale.  Since  4/uni00A0July  2019,  date  of  publication  of  the ordinance  ending  the  so-called  'random  rights'  defined  benefit pension plans in application of the Loi Pacte , this plan is closed to new employees and the rights of beneficiaries were frozen on 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02019.\n\nIn  Switzerland,  the  plan  is  managed  by  a  personal  protection insurance  institution  (the  Foundation),  comprised  of  employer  and employee  representatives.  The  employer  and  its  employees  pay contributions  to  the  Foundation.  Pension  benefits  are  revalued  at  a guaranteed  rate  of  return  and  converted  to  annuities  (or  lump-sum payment) also at a guaranteed conversion rate (cash balance scheme). Because  of  this  minimum  guaranteed  return,  the  plan  is  considered similar to a defined benefit plan.\n\nIn recent years, the Societe Generale Group has actively implemented a  policy  of  converting  defined  benefit  plans  to  defined  contribution plans.\n\nIn  the  United  Kingdom,  the  defined  benefit  plan  has  been  closed  to new  employees  for  nearly  20/uni00A0years,  and/uni00A0the  benefits  of  the  last beneficiaries  were  frozen  in  2015.  The  plan  is  managed  by  an independent institution (Trustee).\n\nSimilarly,  in  the  United  States,  defined  benefit  plans  were  closed  to new employees in 2015 and the vesting of new benefits was frozen.\n\n|",

Directly held Societe/uni202FGenerale shares are not significant.\n\nFunding assets excess is EUR/uni00A0347/uni00A0million.\n\nEmployer  contributions  to  be  paid  to  post-employment  defined benefit plans for 2022 are estimated at EUR/uni00A012/uni00A0million.\n\nPlan  hedging  strategies  are  defined  locally  in  connection  with  the Finance and Human Resources departments of the entities, by ad hoc structures  (Trustees,  Foundations,  Joint  structures/uni00A0etc.)  if  necessary. Besides,  liability  investment  or  financing  strategies  are  monitored  at Group level through a global governance system. Committee/uni202Fmeetings, with  the  participation  of  representatives  of  the  Human  Resources Department, the Finance Department  and  the  Risk  Division, are/uni202Forganised in  order  to  define  Group  guidelines  for  employee benefits  investment  and  management,  to  validate  decisions  and  to follow up the associated risks for the Group.\n\nDepending  on  the  duration  of  each  plan  and  local  regulations, funding/uni202Fassets are  invested  in  equities  and/or  in  fixed  income products, whether guaranteed or not.\n\n|",

At  each  accounting  date,  the/uni00A0number  of  these  instruments  is  revised  in  order  to  take  into  account  performance  and  service conditions and adjust the overall cost of the plan as originally determined. Expenses recognised under Personnel expenses from the start of the plan are then adjusted accordingly.\n\nFor cash-settled share-based payments (compensation indexed on Societe Generale, or one of its subsidiaries, shares), the fair value of the amounts  payable  is  recorded  under  Personnel  expenses  as  an  expense  over  the  vesting  period  against  a  corresponding  liabilities  entry recognised in the balance sheet under Other liabilities - Expenses payable on employee benefits. This payables item is then remeasured to take into account performance and presence conditions, as well as changes in the value of the underlying shares. When the expense is hedged by an equity derivative instrument, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative is recorded in the income statement under Personnel expenses, as well.\n\nThe Group may award some of its employees stock purchase or subscription options, free shares or rights to a future cash payment indexed to the Societe Generale, or one of its subsidiaries, share price.\n\nThe options are measured at their fair value when the employees are first notified, without waiting for the conditions that trigger the award to be met, or for the beneficiaries to exercise their options.\n\nGroup stock-option plans are measured using a binomial formula when the Group has adequate statistics to take into account the behaviour of  the  option  beneficiaries.  When  such  data  are  not  available,  the  Black  &  Scholes  model  or Monte-Carlo model  is  used.  Valuations  are performed by independent actuaries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe vesting conditions for beneficiaries of payments based on Societe Generale shares include conditions of presence  and  performance.  The  performance conditions  may  be  indexed  on  the  Group's  financial data  (for  instance,  the  Group's  profitability,  or  the\n\nrelative  performance  of  the  Societe  Generale  share)  and/or  on  the Group's  non-financial  data  (for  instance,  the  achievement  of  the Group's objectives in terms of social and environmental responsibility/uni202F- CSR).\n\n|",

They  are  calculated  according  to  the  rates  and  tax  regulations  applicable  in  the countries where each consolidated entity is located.\n\nIncome tax presented in the income statement includes current taxes and deferred taxes:\n\n- current  taxes  correspond  to  the  amount  of  taxes  due  (or  refundable)  as  calculated  according  to  the p taxable profit base for the reporting period;\n- deferred  taxes  correspond  to  the  amount  of  taxes  resulting  from  past  transactions  and  that  will  be p payable (or refundable) in a future reporting period.\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\n## Current taxes\n\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profits of each consolidated taxable entity and determined in accordance with the rules established by the local taxation authorities, upon which income taxes are payable. This tax expense also includes net allowances for tax adjustments pertaining to income tax.\n\nTax  credits  arising  in  respect  of  interest  from  loans  and  income  from  securities  are  recorded  in  the  relevant  interest  account  as  they  are applied in settlement of income taxes for the year. The related tax charge is included under 'Income tax' in the income statement.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised whenever the Group identifies a temporary difference between the book value and tax value of balance sheet assets and liabilities that will affect future tax payments.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured in each consolidated taxable entity and in accordance with the rules established by the local taxation authorities, upon which their income taxes are payable. This/uni00A0amount is based on the tax rate enacted or substantively enacted which is expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled. These deferred taxes are adjusted in the event of changes to tax rates. This amount is not discounted to present value.\n\nDeferred tax assets can result from deductible temporary differences or from tax loss carry-forwards. These/uni00A0deferred tax assets are recorded only if the entity concerned is likely to recover these assets within a set time. These temporary differences or tax loss carry-forwards can also be used against future taxable profit.\n\nTax loss carry-forwards are subject to an annual review taking into account the tax system applicable to each relevant tax entity and a realistic projection of their tax income or expense: any previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recorded in the balance sheet to the extent it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered; however, the carrying value of deferred tax assets already recognised in the balance sheet is reduced where a risk of total or partial non-recovery occurs.\n\nCurrent and deferred taxes are recognised in the consolidated income statement under 'Income tax'. However, deferred taxes related to gains  and  losses  recorded  under  'Unrealised  or  deferred  gains  and  losses'  are  also  recognised  under  the  same  heading  in  shareholders' equity.\n\n## Tax uncertainties\n\nThere  may  be  uncertainty  over  the  tax  treatments  applied  by  the  Group.  If  it  is  probable  that  the  tax  Authority  will  not  accept  some  tax treatments, these uncertainties shall be booked under 'Tax expenses/income' by the counterpart of Provisions for tax adjustments recorded among Tax liabilities.\n\nInformation  on  the  nature  and  the  amount  of  the  associated  risks  is  not  disclosed  when  the  Group  considers  that  such  disclosure  could seriously undermine its position in a dispute with other parties on the object of the provision.\n\n|",

For this purpose, the tax results are determined based on the projected performance of the businesses. This performance corresponds to the estimated budget (scenario SG Central) over four years (from 2022 to 2025), extrapolated to 2026, which corresponds to a 'normative' year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese budgets notably take into account the impacts of  the  commitments  to  energy  and  environmental transition  and  regional  development  detailed  in  the Declaration of Non-Financial Performance.\n\nOn principle, the appreciation of the macro-economic factors selected and  the  internal  estimates  used  to  determine  the  tax  results  involve risks  and uncertainties about their materialisation over the estimated timeframe  for  the  absorption  of  the  losses.  These  risks  and uncertainties  are  especially  related  to  possible  changes  in  the applicable tax rules (computation of the tax result, as well as allocation rules for tax loss carry-forwards) or materialisation of the assumptions selected. These uncertainties are mitigated by robustness checks of the budgetary and strategic assumptions.\n\nThe updated projections show that the Group's activated tax loss-carry forwards may likely be used against its future taxable income.\n\nThe  tax  results  also  take  into  consideration  the  accounting  and  tax adjustments  (including  the  reversal  of  the  deferred  tax  assets  and liabilities  bases  on  temporary  differences)  applicable  to  the  entities and jurisdictions concerned. These adjustments are determined on the basis  of  historical  tax  results  and  on  the  Group's  tax  expertise. An/uni202Fextrapolation of the tax results is performed from 2026 on and over a  timeframe  considered  reasonable  and  depending  on  the  nature  of the activities carried out within each tax entity.\n\n|",

The net earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders are adjusted for the preferred shareholders rights, such as holders of preferred shares, subordinated securities or deeply subordinated notes classified in equity.

Segment reporting information is therefore presented under both criteria.\n\nThe  Group  includes  in  the  results  of  each  sub-division  all  operating income and expenses directly related to its activity. Income for each sub-division, except for the Corporate Centre, also includes the return on  equity  allocated  to  it,  based  on  the  estimated  rate  of  return  on Group  equity.  The  return  on  the  sub-division's  book  equity  is  then reallocated to the Corporate Centre. Transactions between sub-divisions are carried out under the same terms and conditions as those applying to non-Group customers.\n\nThe  Group's  core  businesses  are  managed  through  three  strategic pillars:\n\n- French  Retail  Banking,  which  includes  the  domestic  networks p Societe Generale, Cr\u00e9dit du Nord and Boursorama;\n- International Retail Banking &/uni00A0Financial Services, which consists of: p\n- International Retail Banking, including consumer  finance -activities,\n- Financial Services (operational vehicle leasing and fleet -management, equipment and vendor finance),\n- Insurance activities; -\n- Global Banking and Investor Solutions which comprises: p\n- Global Markets and Investors Services, -\n- Financing and Advisory, -\n- Asset and Wealth Management. -\n\nIn  addition  to  the  strategic  pillars,  the  Corporate  Centre  acts  as  the Group's central funding department. As/uni00A0such, it recognises the carrying cost  of  equity  investments  in  subsidiaries  and  related  dividend payments, as well as income and expenses stemming from the Group's Asset  and  Liability  Management  (ALM)  and  income  from  the  Group's management  of  its  assets  (management  of  its  industrial  and  bank equity portfolio and of its real estate assets). Income or expenses that do  not  relate  directly  to  the  activity  of  the  core  businesses  are  also allocated to the Corporate Centre.\n\nSegment  income  take  intra-Group transactions into account, while/uni202Fthese transactions are eliminated from segment assets and/uni202Fliabilities.\n\nThe tax rate levied on each business line is based on the standard tax rate  applicable  in  each  country  where  the  division  makes  profits. Any/uni202Fdifference  with  respect  to  the  Group's tax rate is allocated to the Corporate Centre.\n\nFor the purpose of segment reporting by geographical region, segment profit  or  loss  and  assets  and  liabilities  are  presented  based  on  the location of the booking entities.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## COMMITMENTS UNDER MORTGAGE SAVINGS AGREEMENTS NOTE 8.3.1\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nIn France, Comptes d'\u00e9pargne-logement (CEL or mortgage savings accounts) and Plans d'\u00e9pargne-logement (PEL or mortgage savings plans) are special savings schemes for individual customers which are governed by Law 65-554 of 10/uni00A0July 1965. These products combine an initial deposit  phase  in  the  form  of  an  interest-earning  savings  account,  followed  by  a  lending  phase  where  the  deposits  are  used  to  provide mortgage loans. The lending phase is subject to the prior existence of the savings phase and is therefore inseparable from it. The savings deposits collected and loans granted are measured at amortised cost.\n\nThese instruments create two types of commitments for the Group: the obligation to pay interest on customer savings for an indeterminate future period at an interest rate established at the inception of the mortgage savings agreement, and the obligation to subsequently lend to the customer at an interest rate also established at the inception of the savings agreement.\n\nIf it is clear that commitments under the PEL/CEL agreements will have negative consequences for the Group, a provision is recorded on the liabilities  side  of  the  balance  sheet.  Any  changes  in  these  provisions  are  recognised  as  net  banking  income  under  net  interest  income. These/uni202Fprovisions only relate to commitments arising from PEL/CEL that are outstanding at the date of calculation.\n\nProvisions are calculated for each generation of mortgage savings plans (PEL), with no netting between different PEL generations, and for all mortgage saving accounts (CEL) making up a single generation.\n\nDuring  the  deposit  phase,  the  underlying  commitment  used  to  determine  the  amount  to  be  provisioned  is  calculated  as  the  difference between the average expected amount of deposits and the minimum expected amount. These two amounts are determined statistically on the basis of the historical observations of past customer behaviour.\n\nDuring the lending phase, the underlying commitment to be provisioned includes loans already granted but not yet drawn at the date of calculation, and future loans that are considered statistically probable on the basis of deposits that are currently recognised in the balance sheet at the date of calculation and on the basis of historical observations of past customer behaviour.\n\nA  provision  is  recognised  if  the  discounted  value  of  expected  future  earnings  for  a  given  generation  of  PEL/CEL  is  negative.  Earnings  are estimated on the basis of interest rates available to individual customers for equivalent savings and loan products, with a similar estimated life and date of inception.\n\n## OUTSTANDING DEPOSITS IN PEL/CEL ACCOUNTS\n\n| (In EURm)                         | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| PEL accounts                      | 18,789       | 19,227       |\n| Less than 4/uni00A0years old      | 714          | 734          |\n| Between 4 and 10/uni00A0years old | 10,411       | 11,511       |\n| More than 10/uni00A0years old     | 7,664        | 6,982        |\n| CEL accounts                      | 1,513        | 1,404        |\n| TOTAL                             | 20,302       | 20,631       |\n\n## OUTSTANDING HOUSING LOANS GRANTED WITH RESPECT TO PEL/CEL ACCOUNTS\n\n| (In EURm)                         |   31.12.2021 | 31.12.2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Less than 4/uni00A0years old      |            0 | -            |\n| Between 4 and 10/uni00A0years old |            3 | 7            |\n| More than 10/uni00A0years old     |            7 | 9            |\n| TOTAL                             |           10 | 16           |\n\n|",

Since long-term rates were low during 2021, the provisions for PEL and CEL mortgage savings accounts were mainly linked to the risks attached to the  commitment  to  pay  interest  on  the  deposits.  Provisioning  for PEL/CEL  savings  amounted  to  1.56%  of  total  outstandings  at 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\n## METHODS USED TO ESTABLISH PROVISION VALUATION INPUTS\n\nThe  inputs  used  to  estimate  future  customer  behaviour  are  derived from  historical  observations  of  customer  behaviour  patterns  over  a long  period  (more  than  10/uni00A0years).

In/uni00A0this  complex  legal  context, the/uni202FGroup  and some of its former and current representatives may be involved  in  various  legal  actions,  including  civil,  administrative  and criminal proceedings. The vast majority of these proceedings are part of  the  Group's  current  business.  In  recent  years,  litigation  with investors and the number of disputes involving financial intermediaries such as banks and investment advisors has increased, partly due to a difficult financial environment.\n\nIt  is  by nature difficult to foresee the outcome of disputes, regulatory proceedings and acts involving Group entities, particularly if they are initiated by various categories of complainants, if the amount of claims for damages is not specified or is indeterminate or if the proceedings have no precedent.\n\nadjusted  whenever  changes  are  made  to  regulations  that  may undermine  the  effectiveness  of  past  data  as  an  indicator  of  future customer behaviour.\n\nThe values of the different market inputs used, notably interest rates and  margins,  are  calculated  on  the  basis  of  observable  data  and constitute a best estimate, at the date of valuation, of the future value of these items for the period in question, in line with the Retail Banking division's policy of interest rate risk management.\n\nThe  discount  rates  used  are  derived  from  the  zero  coupon  swaps vs ./uni00A0Euribor yield curve at the valuation date, averaged over a 12/uni00A0month period.\n\nIn preparing its financial statements, the Group  assesses  the consequences of the legal, regulatory or arbitration proceedings in which it is involved. A provision is booked when losses from these proceedings become probable and the amount can be estimated reliably.\n\nTo assess the probability of losses and the amount of these losses, and thus to determine the amount of provisions to book, estimations are important.  Management  makes  these  estimates  by  exercising  its judgment  and  taking  into  account  all  information  available  when financial statements are prepared. In/uni00A0particular, the Group takes into account  the  nature  of  the  dispute,  the  underlying  facts,  ongoing proceedings  and  court  decisions  already  taken,  as  well  as  its experience  and  the  experiences  of  other  companies  dealing  with similar  cases  (assuming  that  the  Group  has  knowledge  thereof)  and, where  appropriate,  the  opinion  and  reports  of  experts  and independent legal advisers.\n\nEach  quarter,  the  Group  carries  out  a  detailed  examination  of outstanding disputes that present a significant risk. The description of those  disputes  is  presented  in  Note/uni00A09  'Information  on  risks  and litigation'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Equipment assets held for operating leases purpose are included in operating tangible assets, while buildings held for leasing purposes are included in investment property.\n\nTangible and intangible fixed assets are carried at their purchase price on the asset side of the balance sheet, less depreciation, amortisation and impairment.\n\nThe purchase price of fixed assets includes borrowing costs incurred to fund a lengthy construction period for the fixed assets, along with all other directly attributable expenses. Investment subsidies received are deducted from the cost of the relevant assets. Software developed internally is recorded on the asset side of the balance sheet in the amount of the direct cost of development.\n\nAs  soon  as  they  are  fit  for  use,  fixed  assets  are  depreciated  or  amortised  using  the  component-based  approach.  Each  component  is depreciated or amortised over its own useful life. The Group has applied this approach to its operating properties, breaking down its assets into components with depreciation periods of 10 to 50/uni00A0years. Depreciation periods for fixed assets other than buildings depend on their useful life, which is usually estimated at 3 to 20/uni00A0years.\n\nAny residual value of the asset is deducted from its depreciable amount. If there is a subsequent decrease or increase in this initial residual value, the depreciable amount of the asset is adjusted, leading to a prospective modification of the depreciation schedule.\n\nDepreciation  and  amortisation  are  recorded  in  the  income  statement  under  Amortisation,  depreciation  and  impairment  of  tangible  and intangible fixed assets.\n\nFixed  assets  grouped  into  Cash  Generating  Units  are  tested  for  impairment  whenever  there  is  any  indication  that  their  value  may  have diminished.  Allocations  and  reversals  of  provisions  for  impairment  are  recorded  in  profit  or  loss  under  Amortisation,  depreciation  and impairment of tangible and intangible fixed assets.\n\nRealised capital gains and losses on operating fixed assets are recognised under Net income from other assets.\n\nInvestment properties are depreciated using the component-based method. Each component is depreciated over its own useful life, ranging from 10 to 50/uni00A0years.\n\nProfits or losses on operating lease assets and on investment property, including amortisation and depreciation, are recognised under Income from other activities and Expense from other activities (see/uni00A0Note/uni00A04.2).\n\n## Rights-of-use for assets leased by the Group\n\nLEASE\n\n## Definition of the lease\n\nA contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys to the lessor the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration:\n\n- control is conveyed when the customer has both the right to direct the identified asset's use, and to obtain substantially all the economic p benefits from that use throughout the lease period;\n- the  existence  of  an  identified  asset  will  depend  on  the  absence,  for  the  lessor,  of  substantive  substitution  rights  for  the  leased  asset; p this/uni202Fcondition is measured with regard to the facts and circumstances existing at the commencement of the contract. If the lessor has the option of freely substituting the leased asset, the contract can not be qualified as a lease, since its purpose is the provision of a capacity and not an asset;\n- a capacity portion of an asset is still an identified asset if it is physically distinct ( e.g. a  floor  of  a  building).  Conversely, a portion of the p capacity or of an asset that is not physically distinct does not constitute an identified asset ( e.g. the lease of co-working area within a unit with no pre-defined location inside that unit).\n\n## Separation of lease and non-lease components\n\nA contract may cover the lease of an asset by the lessor as well as the supply of additional services by that lessor. In this scenario, the lessee can  separate  the  lease  components  from  the  non-lease  components  of  the  contract  and  treat  them  separately.  The  rental  payments stipulated in the contract must be separated between the lease components and the non-lease components based on their individual prices (as directly indicated in the contract or estimated on the basis on all of the observable information). If the lessee cannot separate the lease components from the non-lease components (or services), the entire contract is treated as a lease.\n\n|",

This/uni00A05-year  term  may  be  modified  depending  on  the  quality  of  the  location,  the  completion  of  major investments, or the planned closure of a group of designated branches.\n\n## Changing the lease term\n\nThe term must be modified in case of a change of circumstances which lead the lessee to revise the exercise of the options included in the lease  contract  or  in  case  of  events  which  contractually  oblige  the  lessee  to  exercise  (or  not)  an  option  that  had  not  been  included  (or  is included) in the lease contract.\n\nFollowing a change in the lease term, the lease obligation must be reassessed to reflect those changes by using a revised discount rate for the remaining estimated term of the contract.\n\n## ACCOUNTING TREATMENT BY THE GROUP AS A LESSEE\n\nOn the commencement date (on which the leased asset is made available for use), the lessee must record a lease liability on the liabilities side of the balance sheet and a right-of-use asset on the assets side of the balance sheet except for the exemptions described below.\n\nIn  the  income statement, the lessee must recognise an interest expense calculated on the lease liability under Net banking income and a depreciation of the right-of-use under Amortisation, depreciation and impairment of tangible and intangible fixed assets.\n\nThe rental payments will partly reduce the lease liability and partly remunerate this liability in the form of interest expense.\n\n## Exemptions and exclusions\n\nThe Group does not apply the new lease treatment to contracts with a term of less than one year (including renewal options), nor to contracts on low-value items by applying the exemption threshold of USD/uni00A05,000  as  indicated  in  the  standard's  Basis  for  Conclusions  (the  threshold should be measured against the replacement cost per unit of the leased asset).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeriods covered by an option to extend the lease*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeriods covered by an option to terminate the lease**\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

This variable portion of the rental payments is recorded in the net income over time according to fluctuations in contractual indexes fluctuations.\n\nRental payments have to be considered based on their amount net of value-added tax. In addition, for/uni00A0building leases, occupancy taxes and property taxes passed on by lessors will be excluded from lease liabilities because their amount, as set by the competent public authorities, is/uni202Fvariable.\n\n## Recognition of the lease liability\n\nThe liability initial amount is equal to the discounted value of the rental payments that will be payable over the lease period.\n\nThis lease liability is then measured at the amortised cost using the effective interest rate method: part of each rental payment will then be booked as interest expenses in the income statement, and part will be gradually deducted from the lease liability on the balance sheet.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the amount of the lease liability may be adjusted if the lease is amended, the lease period is re-estimated, or/uni202Fto account for contractual changes in the rental payments related to the application of indices or rates.\n\nAs applicable, the lessee must also recognise a provision in its liabilities to cover the costs of restoring the leased asset that would be assumed when the lease ends.\n\n## Recognition of the right-of-use\n\nOn the availability date of the leased asset, the lessee must enter a right-of-use asset, on the assets side of the balance sheet, for an amount equal to the initial value of the lease liability, plus, as applicable, initial direct costs ( e.g. issuance of an authenticated lease, registration fees, negotiation fees, front-end fee, leasehold right, lease premium,/uni00A0etc.), advance payments, and restoration costs.\n\nThis asset is then depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lease period that is applied for measuring the lease liability.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the asset's value may be adjusted if the lease is amended, as it is the case for the lease liability.\n\nRights-of-use is presented on the lessee's balance sheet under the items of fixed assets where properties of the same type that are held in full ownership are entered. If the lease stipulates the initial payment of a leasehold right to the former tenant of the premises, the amount of that right is stated as a separate component of the right of use and presented under the same heading as the latter.\n\n## Lease discount rates\n\nThe Group uses the lessees' incremental borrowing rate to discount the rental payments as well as the amount of lease liabilities. For the entities which can directly refinance themselves on their local markets, the incremental borrowing rate is set at the lessee entity level, not at the Group level, in consideration of the borrowing terms and that entity's credit risk. For the entities which refinance themselves through the Group, the incremental borrowing rate is set by the Group.\n\nThe discount rates are set according to the currency, the country of the lessee entities and the maturity estimated of the contracts.\n\n|",

If a new contract is not signed by the end of that nine-year period, the initial lease is automatically extended;\n- the office buildings are leased for certain departments reporting to the Group's French headquarters or p the local head offices of the main foreign subsidiaries, and for certain locations in the main international financial centers: London, New York, Hong Kong, etc.\n\nOutside  France,  residual  lease  periods  are  generally  below  10/uni00A0years.  In  some  countries,  such  as  Russia, leases  can  be  annual,  with  optional  automatic  renewal.  In/uni00A0other  locations,  specifically  London  and New/uni202FYork, lease periods can be as long as 25/uni00A0years.\n\n## Equipment Leases\n\nOther leases (less than 10%) are mainly computer equipment leases and a very small percentage of vehicle leases.\n\n## OVERVIEW TABLE OF LEASE TRANSACTION COSTS AND SUBLEASE INCOME\n\n31.12.2021\n\n| (In EURm)                                      | Real estate   | IT   | Others   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|------|----------|---------|\n| Lease                                          | (470)         | (45) | (8)      | (523)   |\n| Interest expenses on lease liabilities         | (39)          | -    | -        | (39)    |\n| Depreciation charge for right-of-use assets    | (385)         | (41) | (3)      | (429)   |\n| Expense relating to short-term leases          | (36)          | -    | (3)      | (39)    |\n| Expense relating to leases of low-value assets | (2)           | (4)  | (2)      | (8)     |\n| Expense relating to variable lease payments    | (8)           | -    |          | (8)     |\n| Sublease income                                | 14            | -    | -        | 14      |\n\n31.12.2020\n\n| (In EURm)                                      | Real estate   | IT   | Others   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|------|----------|---------|\n| Lease                                          | (480)         | (49) | (8)      | (537)   |\n| Interest expenses on lease liabilities         | (43)          | (1)  | (0)      | (44)    |\n| Depreciation charge for right-of-use assets    | (394)         | (42) | (4)      | (440)   |\n| Expense relating to short-term leases          | (35)          | -    | (3)      | (38)    |\n| Expense relating to leases of low-value assets | (2)           | (5)  | (1)      | (8)     |\n| Expense relating to variable lease payments    | (6)           | (1)  | -        | (7)     |\n| Sublease income                                | 14            | -    | -        | 14      |\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## INFORMATION ON RISKS AND LITIGATION NOTE 9\n\nEvery  quarter,  the  Group  reviews  in  detail  the  disputes  presenting  a significant risk. These disputes may lead to the recording of a provision if  it  becomes probable or certain that the Group will incur an outflow of resources for the benefit of a third party without receiving at least the  equivalent  value  in  exchange.  These/uni00A0provisions  for  litigations  are classified among the Other provisions included in the Provisions item in the liabilities of the balance-sheet.\n\nNo detailed information can be disclosed on either the recording or the amount of a specific provision given that such disclosure would likely seriously prejudice the outcome of the disputes in question.\n\n- On 24/uni00A0October 2012, the Court of Appeal of Paris confirmed the first p judgment  delivered  on  5/uni00A0October  2010,  finding  J.  Kerviel  guilty  of breach of trust, fraudulent insertion of data into a computer system, forgery  and  use  of  forged  documents.  J.  Kerviel  was  sentenced  to serve  a  prison  sentence  of  five  years,  two  years  of  which  are suspended,  and  was  ordered  to  pay  EUR/uni00A04.9/uni00A0billion  in  damages  to the  bank.  On  19/uni00A0March  2014,  the  Supreme  Court  confirmed  the criminal  liability  of  J.  Kerviel.  This  decision  puts  an  end  to  the criminal  proceedings. On/uni00A0the/uni00A0civil/uni00A0front,  on  23/uni00A0September  2016,  the Versailles Court of Appeal rejected J. Kerviel's request for an expert determination  of  the  damage  suffered  by  Societe  Generale,  and therefore confirmed that the net accounting losses suffered by the Bank as a result of his criminal conduct amount to EUR/uni00A04.9/uni00A0billion. It also declared J. Kerviel partially responsible for the damage caused to Societe Generale and sentenced him to pay to Societe Generale EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0million. Societe Generale and J./uni00A0Kerviel did not appeal before the  Supreme  Court.  Societe  Generale  considers  that  this  decision has  no  impact  on  its  tax  situation.  However,  as/uni202Findicated  by  the Minister  of  the  Economy  and  Finance  in  September/uni00A02016,  the  tax authorities  have  examined  the  tax  consequences  of  this  book  loss and  indicated  that  they  intended  to  call  into  question  the deductibility  of  the  loss  caused  by  the  actions  of  J./uni00A0Kerviel, amounting to EUR/uni00A04.9/uni00A0billion. This/uni00A0proposed tax rectification has no immediate  effect  and  will  possibly  have  to  be  confirmed  by  an adjustment notice sent by the tax authorities when Societe Generale is in a position to deduct the tax loss carry forwards arising from the loss  from  its  taxable  income.  Such  a  situation  will  not  occur  for several years according to the bank's forecasts. In view of the 2011 opinion of the French Supreme Administrative Court (Conseil d'\u00c9tat) and its established case law which was recently confirmed again in this  regard,  Societe  Generale  considers  that  there  is  no  need  to provision  the  corresponding  deferred  tax  assets.  In/uni00A0the/uni00A0event  that the  authorities  decide,  in  due  course,  to  confirm  their  current position,  Societe  Generale  Group  will  not  fail  to  assert  its  rights before  the  competent  courts.  By  a  decision  handed  down  on  the 20/uni00A0September  2018,  the  Investigation  Committee  of  the  reviewing and  reassessment  Criminal  Court  has  furthermore  declared inadmissible the request filed in May/uni00A02015  by  J.  Kerviel  against  his criminal  sentence,  confirming  the  absence  of  any  new  element  or fact that could justify the reopening of the criminal/uni00A0file.\n- Between 2003 and 2008, Societe Generale set up gold consignment p lines with the Turkish group Goldas. In/uni00A0February/uni00A02008, Societe/uni202FGenerale was alerted to a risk of fraud and embezzlement of gold stocks held by Goldas. These suspicions were rapidly confirmed following  the  failure  by  Goldas  to  pay  or  refund  gold  worth EUR/uni00A0466.4/uni00A0million. Societe Generale brought civil proceedings against its  insurers  and  various  Goldas  group  entities.  Goldas/uni202Flaunched various  proceedings  in  Turkey  and  in  the  UK  against  Societe Generale. In/uni00A0the action brought by Societe Generale against Goldas in\n\nthe  UK,  Goldas  applied  to  have  the  action  of  SG  struck-out  and applied to the UK/uni00A0court  for  damages.  On  3/uni00A0April  2017,  the  UK  court granted  both  applications  and  will,  after  an  inquiry  into  damages, rule/uni00A0on  the amount due to Goldas, if any. On/uni00A015/uni00A0May 2018, the Court of  Appeal  discharged  entirely  the  inquiry  into  damages  granted  by the High Court to Goldas but rejected Societe Generale's arguments relating  to  service  of  the  claims  issued  against  Goldas,  which  are therefore  time-barred.  On  18/uni00A0December  2018,  the/uni202FSupreme  Court refused  permission  to  appeal  to  both  Societe/uni202FGenerale  and  Goldas. On 16/uni00A0February 2017, the/uni00A0Paris  Commercial Court dismissed Societe Generale's claims against its/uni202Finsurers.\n\n- In the early 2000s, the French banking industry decided to transition p to  a  new  digital  system  in  order  to  streamline  cheque  clearing. To/uni202Fsupport this reform (known as EIC -/uni00A0 \u00c9change d'Images Ch\u00e8ques ), which  has  contributed  to  the  improvement  of  cheque  payments security and to the fight against fraud, the banks established several interbank  fees  (including  the  CEIC  which  was  abolished  in  2007). These fees were implemented under the aegis of the banking sector supervisory  authorities,  and  to  the  knowledge  of  the  public authorities.\n\nOn 20/uni00A0September 2010, the French competition authority ruled that the joint implementation and the setting of the amount of the CEIC and  of  two  additional  fees  for  related  services  were  in  breach  of competition  law.  The  authority  fined  all  the  participants  to  the agreement (including the Banque de France) a total of approximately  EUR/uni00A0385/uni00A0million.  On  2/uni00A0December  2021,  after  several years  of  proceedings  and  two  decisions  of  the  Supreme  Court, the/uni00A0Paris  Court  of  Appeal  overturned  the  decision  of  the  French competition authority and ruled that (i)/uni00A0it  was  not  proven  that  the establishment of the CEIC and the fees for related services on AOCT (cancellation  of  wrongly  cleared  transactions)  as  well  as  their collection  had  infringed  the  provisions  of  Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0420-1  of  the French  Commercial  Code  and  of  Article/uni00A0101  of  the  Treaty  on  the Functioning  of  the  European  Union  and,  (ii)/uni00A0that  its  decision  was giving rise to a right of restitution of the sums paid in execution of the  overturned  decision,  namely  approximatively  EUR/uni00A053.5/uni00A0million for Societe Generale and approximatively EUR/uni00A07/uni00A0million for Cr\u00e9dit du Nord, together with interests at the legal rate. On/uni00A031/uni00A0December/uni202F2021, the  French  competition  authority  filed  an  appeal  before  the Supreme court against this decision.\n\n- In  August/uni00A02009,  Societe  Generale  Private  Banking  (Switzerland) p ('SGPBS'), along with several other financial institutions, was/uni202Fnamed  as  a  defendant  in  a  putative  class  action  that  was ultimately  transferred  to  the  US  District  Court  for  the  Northern District  of  Texas.  The  plaintiffs  sought  to  represent  a  class  of individuals who were customers of Stanford International Bank/uni00A0Ltd. (SIBL), with money on deposit at SIBL and/or holding Certificates of Deposit issued by SIBL as of 16/uni00A0February 2009. The plaintiffs alleged that they suffered losses as a result of fraudulent activity at SIBL and the  Stanford  Financial  Group  or  related  entities,  and  that  the defendants were responsible for those alleged losses. The plaintiffs further  sought  to  recoup  payments  made  through  or  to  the defendants  on  behalf  of  SIBL  or  related  entities  on  the  basis  that they  were  alleged  to  have  been  fraudulent  transfers.  The  Official Stanford  Investors  Committee  (OSIC)  was  permitted  to  intervene and  filed  a  complaint  against  SGPBS  and  the  other  defendants seeking  similar  relief.  Following  motions  to  dismiss,  the  Court ultimately  in  April/uni00A02015  permitted  the  substantial  majority  of  the claims to proceed.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "On 7/uni00A0November 2017, the District Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for  class  certification.  On  3/uni00A0May  2019,  several/uni00A0hundred  individual plaintiffs  filed  motions  to  intervene  in  the  pending  OSIC  action seeking  recovery  in  their  individual  capacities  for  losses  on  their Stanford  investments.  By  order  of  18/uni00A0September  2019  the  court denied the motions to intervene. One group of plaintiffs appealed the  denial,  which  was  rejected  by  the  court  of  appeal  on 3/uni00A0February/uni202F2021,  and  the  remaining  group  of  plaintiffs  initiated  a separate action in Texas state court in Houston in November/uni00A02019, now pending in the Southern District of Texas.\n\nOn  12/uni00A0February  2021,  all  parties  in  the  litigation  filed  motions  for summary judgment.  SGPBS  seeks  dismissal  of  all  pending  claims, and  OSIC,  renewing  a  prior  unsuccessful  motion  for  summary judgement  seeks  return  of  a  USD/uni00A095/uni00A0million  transfer  to  SGPBS  in 2008. Discovery has been completed.\n\nOn 19/uni00A0January 2022, the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas asked the Judicial Panel for Multidistrict Litigation to remand the  case  to  US  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  Texas  in Houston,  where  it  was  originally  filed,  for  further  proceedings, including  trial.  The  following  day,  on  20/uni00A0January  2022,  the  US District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled on the pending motions  for  summary  judgment  denying  SGPBS's  and  OSIC's motions.\n\n- Notwithstanding  the  agreements  reached  in  2018  with  the  US p authorities  regarding  certain  London  Interbank  Offered  Rates  and the  Euro  Interbank  Offered  Rate  ('the  IBOR  matter')  and  the dismissal on 30/uni00A0November 2021 of the legal proceedings brought by the  DOJ  in  this  matter  (see  Chapter/uni00A04.11  of  the  present  Universal Registration  Document),  the  Bank  continues  to  defend  civil proceedings  in  the  United  States  (as  described  below)  and  has responded to information requests received from other authorities, including  the  Attorneys  General  of  various  States  of  the  United States and the New/uni00A0York Department of Financial Services.\n\nIn  the  United  States,  Societe  Generale,  along  with  other  financial institutions,  has  been  named  as  a  defendant  in  putative  class actions involving the setting of US Dollar Libor, Japanese Yen Libor, and Euribor rates and trading in instruments indexed to those rates. Societe  Generale  has  also  been  named  in  several  individual (non-class) actions concerning the US Dollar Libor rate. All of these actions  are  pending  in  the  US  District  Court  in  Manhattan (the/uni202F'District Court').\n\nAs  to  US  Dollar  Libor,  all  claims  against  Societe  Generale  were dismissed  by  the  District  Court  or  voluntarily  dismissed  by  the plaintiffs,  except  in  two  putative  class  actions  and  one  individual action that are effectively stayed. The class plaintiffs and a number of  individual  plaintiffs  appealed  the  dismissal  of  their  antitrust claims to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ('Second  Circuit').  On/uni00A030/uni00A0December 2021,  the  Second  Circuit reversed  the  dismissal  and  reinstated  the  antitrust  claims. These/uni00A0reinstated claims include those asserted by a proposed class of over-the-counter (OTC) plaintiffs and by OTC plaintiffs that have filed individual actions.\n\nAs to Japanese Yen Libor, the District Court dismissed the complaint brought  by  purchasers  of  Euroyen  over-the-counter  derivative products. On 1/uni00A0April 2020, the Second Circuit reversed the dismissal\n\nand reinstated the claims. On 30/uni00A0September 2021, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs' Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  Act  claims  but  upheld  plaintiffs'  antitrust  and  state law claims against Societe Generale. In the other action, brought by purchasers or sellers of Euroyen derivative contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on 27/uni00A0September 2019, plaintiff filed a motion for  class  certification.  On/uni00A025/uni00A0September  2020,  the  District  Court granted  defendants'  motion  for  judgment  on  the  pleadings  and dismissed plaintiffs' remaining claims. Plaintiff has appealed to the Second Circuit.\n\nAs  to  Euribor,  the  District  Court  dismissed  all  claims  against Societe/uni202FGenerale in  the  putative  class  action  and  denied  the plaintiffs' motion to file a proposed amended  complaint. Plaintiffs/uni202Fhave appealed those rulings to the Second Circuit.\n\n- In Argentina, Societe Generale, along with other financial institutions, has been named as a defendant in litigation brought by a consumer association on behalf of Argentine consumers who held government bonds or other specified instruments that paid interest tied  to  US  Dollar  Libor.  The  allegations  concern  violations  of Argentine  consumer  protection  law  in  connection  with  alleged manipulation of the US Dollar Libor rate. Societe Generale has not yet been served with the complaint in this matter.\n- Beginning  on  15/uni00A0January  2019,  Societe  Generale  and  SG  Americas p Securities,/uni00A0LLC,  along  with  other  financial institutions, were named in  three  putative  antitrust  class  actions  in  the  US  District  Court  in Manhattan,  which  have  since  been  consolidated.  Plaintiffs  allege that the USD/uni00A0ICE Libor panel banks conspired to make artificially low submissions to that benchmark in order to profit on their trading in derivatives  tied  to  USD/uni00A0ICE  Libor.  Plaintiffs/uni00A0seek  to  certify  a  class comprised of US residents (individuals and entities) that transacted with  a  defendant  in  floating  rate  debt  instruments  or  interest  rate swaps  tied  to  USD/uni00A0ICE  Libor  and  received  a  payment  at  any  time between  1/uni00A0February  2014  to  the  present,  regardless  of  when  the instrument  was  purchased.  By  order  dated  26/uni00A0March  2020,  the District  Court  dismissed  the  action.  Plaintiffs  appealed  that  ruling. On 6/uni00A0April 2021, the/uni00A0Second Circuit permitted a new proposed class representative to intervene as a plaintiff  in  the  appeal  and  denied defendants' motion which sought dismissal of the appeal because the  original  proposed  class  representatives  withdrew  from  the action.\n- Societe  Generale,  along  with  several  other  financial  institutions, p was/uni202Fnamed  as  a  defendant  in  a  putative  class  action  alleging violations  of  US  antitrust  laws  and  the  CEA  in  connection  with foreign  exchange  spot  and  derivatives  trading.  The  action  was brought  by  persons  or  entities that transacted in certain over-the-counter and exchange-traded foreign exchange instruments. Societe Generale reached a settlement of USD/uni00A018/uni00A0million, which was approved by the Court on 6/uni00A0August 2018. On 7/uni00A0November  2018,  a  group  of  individual  entities  that  elected  to opt  out  of  the  settlement  filed  a  lawsuit  against  SG,  SG  Americas Securities,/uni00A0LLC and several other financial institutions. SG Americas Securities,/uni00A0LLC was dismissed by order dated 28/uni00A0May 2020. Discovery is  proceeding  as  to  SG  and  the  other  remaining  defendants. On/uni00A011/uni00A0November  2020,  Societe  Generale  was  named,  along  with several other banks, in a UK action alleging collusion in the market for FX instruments. Societe Generale is defending the action.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- On  10/uni00A0December  2012,  the  French  Supreme  Administrative  Court p (Conseil  d'\u00c9tat) handed  down  two  decisions  confirming  that  the pr\u00e9compte tax  which  used  to  be  levied  on  corporations  in  France does  not  comply  with  EU/uni00A0law  and  defined  a  methodology  for  the reimbursement  of  the  amounts  levied  by  the  tax  authorities. However,/uni00A0such/uni00A0methodology considerably reduces the amount to be reimbursed. Societe Generale purchased in 2005 the pr\u00e9compte tax claims  of  two  companies  (Rhodia  and  Suez,  now  ENGIE)  with  a limited  recourse  on  the  selling  companies.  One  of  the  above decisions  of  the  French  Supreme  Administrative  Court  relates  to Rhodia.  Societe  Generale  has  brought  proceedings  before  the French administrative courts.\n\nSeveral  French  companies  applied  to  the  European  Commission, who  considered  that  the  decisions  handed  down  by  the  French Supreme  Administrative  Court  on  10/uni00A0December  2012,  which  was supposed  to  implement  the  decision  rendered  by  the  Court  of Justice  of  the  European  Union  C-310/09  on  15/uni00A0September  2011, infringed  a  number  of  principles  of  European  law.  The  European Commission  subsequently brought infringement proceedings against  the  French  Republic  in  November/uni00A02014,  and  since  then confirmed  its  position  by  publishing  a  reasoned  opinion  on 28/uni00A0April/uni202F2016  and  by  referring  the  matter  to  the  Court  of  Justice  of the  European  Union  on  8/uni00A0December  2016.  The  Court  of  Justice  of European  Union  rendered  its  judgement  on  4/uni00A0October  2018  and sentenced France for failure by the French Supreme Administrative Court to disregard the tax on EU sub-subsidiaries in order to secure the withholding tax paid in error as well as on the absence of any preliminary  question.  With  regard  to  the  practical  implementation of the decision, Societe Generale has continued to assert its rights with the competent courts and the tax authorities, which it expects to be  treated  diligently and  in  accordance  with  the  law. On/uni00A023/uni00A0June/uni202F2020,  the/uni00A0Administrative  Court  of  Appeal  of  Versailles issued a ruling in favour of Societe Generale on our 2002 and 2003 Suez  claims,  followed  by  a  mid-July  enforcement  in  our  favour. The/uni202Fjudgment of Versailles held that the advance payment was not compatible  with  the  Parent-Subsidiary  Directive:  the  French Supreme Administrative  Court,  which  had  also  received  a  request for a priority question of constitutionality, also/uni00A0pointed out that the advance payment was incompatible with Article/uni00A04 of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive but that a question should be referred to  the  ECJ  for  a  preliminary  ruling  in  order  to  ascertain  this. It/uni00A0is/uni00A0therefore now appropriate to await the response of the Court of Luxembourg, which should not occur before the beginning of 2022.\n\n- Societe Generale, along with other financial institutions, was named p as  a  defendant  in  a  putative  class  action  alleging  violations  of  US antitrust laws and the CEA in connection with its involvement in the London  Gold  Market  Fixing.  The  action  is  brought  on  behalf  of persons  or  entities  that  sold  physical  gold,  sold  gold  futures contracts traded on the CME, sold shares in gold ETFs, sold gold call options  traded  on  CME,  bought  gold  put  options  traded  on  CME, sold/uni202Fover-the-counter  gold  spot  or  forward  contracts  or  gold  call options, or/uni00A0bought over-the-counter gold put options. Societe/uni202FGenerale, along with three other defendants, has/uni00A0reached a settlement to resolve this action for USD/uni00A050/uni00A0million. By order dated 13/uni00A0January  2022,  the/uni00A0Court  granted  preliminary  approval  of  the settlement.  The  final  fairness  hearing  has  been  scheduled  for 5/uni00A0August  2022. Although Societe Generale's share of the settlement is  not  public,  it  was  not  material  from  a  financial  perspective. Societe  Generale,  along  with  other  financial  institutions,  is  also named as a defendant in two putative class actions in Canada (in the Ontario  Superior  Court  in  Toronto  and  Quebec  Superior  Court  in Quebec City) involving similar claims. Societe Generale is defending the claims.\n- Since  August/uni00A02015, various  former  and  current  employees  of p Societe/uni202FGenerale  Group  have  been  under  investigation  by  German\n\ncriminal prosecution and tax authorities for their alleged participation  in  the  so  called  'CumEx'  patterns  in  connection  with withholding tax on dividends on German shares. These/uni00A0investigations relate  inter  alia  to  a  fund  administered  by  SGSS/uni00A0GmbH  proprietary trading  activities  and  transactions  carried  out  on  behalf  of  clients. The  Group  entities  are  responding  to  the  requests  of  the  German authorities.\n\nSGSS/uni00A0GmbH was  informed  by  the  Bonn  District  Court  on 19/uni00A0June/uni00A02019  that  criminal  proceedings  had  been  initiated  against two  individuals  who  were  employed  by  a  company  having previously  advised  this  fund,  the  latter  being  suspected  by  the German prosecutors to have been involved in potentially fraudulent CumEx  transactions.  On  19/uni00A0August  2019,  the  Bonn  District  Court ordered  SGSS/uni00A0GmbH  to  join  these  criminal  proceedings  as  a 'secondary  party'.  By  order  of  16/uni00A0March  2020,  the  Bonn  District Court, with consent of the Cologne Prosecutors, released SGSS/uni00A0GmbH as a secondary party immediately. In addition to being subject to investigations or criminal proceedings, SG Group entities may  be  exposed  to  claims  by  third  parties,  including  German  tax offices, and become party to legal disputes.\n\n- In May/uni00A02019, SGAS  was  named,  along  with  other  financial p institutions,  as  a  defendant  in  a  putative  class  action  in  the  US alleging anticompetitive behaviour in the pricing of 'agency bonds' issued by US/uni00A0Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), including/uni202FFederal  Home  Loan  Bank  (FHLB),  Federal  Home  Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). On/uni00A016/uni00A0June  2020,  SGAS  and  twelve  other bank  defendants  reached  a  final  settlement  with  plaintiffs. Although/uni202FSGAS's  share  of  the  settlement  is  not  public,  the  amount was not material from a financial statement perspective. SGAS was also  named  in  four  separate  individual  opt-out  litigations  by  the following  plaintiffs:  the  State  of  Louisiana  (filed  September/uni00A02019), the  City  of  Baton  Rouge/East  Baton  Rouge  Parish  and  related entities (October/uni00A02019), Louisiana Asset Management Pool (April/uni00A02020), and  the  City  of  New/uni00A0Orleans  and  related  entities (September/uni00A02020). These suits also asserted antitrust claims (and in some cases other related claims) against SGAS and multiple other bank defendants based on these plaintiffs' purchases of GSE bonds. As to the opt-out litigations, a settlement was reached involving all defendants in June/uni00A02021, of which SGAS's share was immaterial, and these actions have been dismissed. SGAS/uni00A0also received a subpoena from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) in connection with its US agency  bond  business.  SGAS  responded  to  these  requests  and  is cooperating with the DOJ investigation.\n- Societe Generale and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants in an p action pending in the US Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan brought by the  Trustee  appointed  for  the  liquidation  of  Bernard  L.  Madoff Investment  Securities/uni00A0LLC  (BLMIS).  The  action  is  similar  to  those brought  by  the  BLMIS  Trustee  against  numerous  institutions  and seeks  recovery  of  amounts  allegedly  received  by  the  SG  entities indirectly  from  BLMIS  through  so-called  'feeder  funds'  that  were invested  in  BLMIS  and  from  which  the  SG  entities  received redemptions. The suit alleges that the amounts that the SG entities received  are  avoidable  and  recoverable  under  the  US  Bankruptcy Code and New York state law. The BLMIS Trustee seeks to recover, in the aggregate, approximately USD/uni00A0150/uni00A0million from the SG entities. The  SG  entities  are  defending  the  action.  In  decisions  dated 22/uni00A0November  2016  and  3/uni00A0October  2018,  the  Court  rejected  most  of the claims brought by the BLMIS Trustee. The Trustee appealed to the  US  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit.  By  order  dated 25/uni00A0February  2019,  the  Second  Circuit  vacated  the  judgements  and remanded  for  further  proceedings.  On  1/uni00A0June  2020,  the  United States  Supreme  Court  denied  Defendant-Appellees'  petition  for  a writ  of  certiorari.  The  case  is  now  before  the  Bankruptcy  Court  for further proceedings.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "- On  10/uni00A0July  2019,  Societe  Generale  was  named  as  a  defendant  in  a p litigation  filed  in  the  US  District  Court  in  Miami  by  plaintiffs  seeking compensation  under  the  Cuban  Liberty  and  Democratic  Solidarity (Libertad) Act  of  1996  (known  as  the  Helms-Burton  Act)  stemming from  the  expropriation  by  the  Cuban  government  in  1960  of  Banco Nunez  in  which  they  are  alleged  to  have  held  an  interest.  Plaintiffs claim damages from Societe Generale under the terms of this statute. Plaintiffs  filed  an  amended  complaint  on  24/uni00A0September/uni202F2019  adding three  other  banks  as  defendants  and  adding  several  new  factual allegations as to Societe Generale. Societe Generale filed a motion to dismiss,  which  was  fully  briefed  as  of  10/uni00A0January  2020.  While  the motion to dismiss was pending, plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion on 29/uni00A0January 2020, to/uni00A0transfer the case to federal court in Manhattan, which the court granted on 30/uni00A0January 2020. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on 11/uni00A0September 2020, in which it dropped the three  other  banks  as  defendants,  added  a  different  bank  as  an additional defendant, and/uni202Fadded as additional plaintiffs who purport to be heirs of the founders of Banco Nunez. The court granted Societe Generale's motion to dismiss on 22/uni00A0December 2021 but has permitted plaintiffs to replead their claims.\n- On 9/uni00A0November 2020, Societe Generale was named as a defendant, p together with another bank, in similar Helms-Burton litigation filed in the US District Court in Manhattan (Pujol/uni00A0I) by the purported heirs of former owners, and personal representatives of estates of heirs or former owners, of Banco Pujol, a Cuban bank alleged to have been confiscated by the Cuban government in 1960. On 27/uni00A0January 2021, Societe Generale filed a motion to dismiss. In response, as permitted by the judge's rules, plaintiffs chose to file an amended complaint and did so on 26/uni00A0February 2021. Societe Generale filed a motion to dismiss  to  dismiss  the  amended  complaint  on  19/uni00A0March  2021, which/uni202Fwas granted by the court on 24/uni00A0November 2021. The court has given plaintiffs the opportunity to replead their claims. On/uni202F16/uni00A0March/uni202F2021, Societe  Generale  was  named  as  a  defendant, together  with  another  bank,  in  a  nearly  identical  Helms-Burton litigation filed in the US/uni00A0District Court in Manhattan (Pujol/uni00A0II) by the personal representative of one of the purported heirs to Banco Pujol who is also a plaintiff in Pujol/uni00A0I. The deadline for the defendants to respond  to  the  complaint  in  Pujol/uni00A0II  has  been  stayed  pending  the next steps in Pujol/uni00A0I.\n- On 5/uni00A0June 2020, a shareholder of Societe Generale filed a derivative p action  in  New  York  State  court  against  39/uni00A0current  and  former directors and officers of the Bank. The complaint alleges that a 2009 written agreement with US banking regulators required the Bank to implement  and  maintain  an  effective  anti-money  laundering compliance  and  transaction  monitoring  system.  According  to  the complaint,  the  Bank  failed  to  do  so,  leading  to  penalties  and\n\nforfeitures  imposed in November/uni00A02018  by  a  number  of  federal  and New  York  state  agencies  and  criminal  authorities  relating  to  US sanctions  and  anti-money  laundering  laws.  The/uni00A0complaint  makes claims  for,  among  other  things,  breaches  of  duty  related  to  these matters.  On/uni00A01/uni00A0November  2021,  a  motion  to  dismiss  on  a  variety  of grounds was filed. Thereafter, the parties stipulated to the voluntary dismissal  with  prejudice  of  the  action,  with  each  party  bearing  its own  costs.  By/uni00A0order  dated  2/uni00A0December  2021,  the  court  dismissed the/uni202Faction.\n\n- On  15/uni00A0October  2020,  Vestia  brought  proceedings  against  Societe p Generale before the High Court of England regarding the conditions pursuant  to  which  Vestia  contracted  derivative  products  with Societe Generale between 2008 and 2011. Vestia claims that these transactions  were  outside  of  its  capacity  and  alleges  they  were induced by corruption. Vestia seeks to rescind the transactions and recover  the  amounts  paid  to  Societe  Generale  pursuant  to  these transactions. On  8/uni00A0January 2021, Societe Generale  filed its Statement  of  Defence  and  Counterclaim.  On  11/uni00A0October  2021, Societe  Generale  and  Vestia  reached  an  agreement  to  settle  this dispute without any admission of liability for Societe Generale.\n- On  1/uni00A0June  2021,  a  shareholder  of  Societe  Generale  initiated  an p action designated by him as a 'derivative action' (action ut singuli) before  the  Commercial  Court  of  Paris  against  the  CEO  of  the Company (Directeur  g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), Mr./uni00A0Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Oud\u00e9a.  The  plaintiff  is seeking an order that Mr./uni00A0Oud\u00e9a pay to Societe Generale an amount equal  to  fines  paid  to  the  US  and  French  treasuries  under  the convention judiciaire d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public of 24/uni00A0May 2018 between Societe Generale  and  the  Financial  Public  Prosecutor  (the  'CJIP')  and  the Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement  of  5/uni00A0June  2018  between  Societe Generale and the United States Department of Justice (the 'DPA').\n- Societe  Generale  voluntarily  joined  these  proceedings  at  the  first procedural hearing in order to seek the dismissal of the claims made by the plaintiff. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a brief asking the court to dismiss the case with prejudice, and the parties asked the court to put  an  end  to  these  proceedings.  By  order  dated  15/uni202FFebruary/uni202F2022, the Commercial Court of Paris therefore took note of the termination of the proceedings. This case is now definitively closed.\n- In the context of the sale of its Polish subsidiary Euro Bank to Bank p Millennium  on  31/uni00A0May  2019  and  of  the  indemnity  granted  to  the latter  against  certain  risks,  Societe  Generale  continues  to  monitor the  evolution  of  court  cases  related  to  CHF-denominated  or CHF-indexed loans issued by Euro Bank.\n- Like  other  operators  in  the  Paris  marketplace,  Societe  Generale  is p subject  to  a  tax  review  of  its  equity  market  transactions. Discussions/uni202Fwith the administration are continuing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

We  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics for statutory auditors (C ode de  d\u00e9ontologie  de  la  profession  de  commissaire  aux  comptes )  for  the period from January/uni00A01, 2021 to the date of our report and specifically we  did  not  provide  any  prohibited  non-audit  services  referred  to  in Article/uni00A05(1) of Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0537/2014.\n\n## EMPHASIS OF MATTER\n\nWithout  qualifying  the  above  opinion,  we  draw  your  attention  to Note/uni00A01.7 to the consolidated financial statements on the restatements made this year compared to the 2020 published consolidated financial statements, which describes the impacts of:\n\n- corrections  following  the  review  of  financial  asset  and  liability p offsetting;\n- adoption of the IFRS/uni00A0IC decision of April/uni00A020, 2021 regarding IAS/uni00A019. p\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements  for  this  period  have  been  prepared  and  audited  under\n\nspecial circumstances. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken  in  the  context  of  the  health  emergency  have  had  numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties regarding their future prospects.  Some  of  those  measures,  such  as  travel  restrictions  and remote  working,  have  also  had  an  impact  on  companies'  internal organization and on the performance of our audits.\n\nIt  is  in  this  complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0823-9 and R./uni00A0823-7 of the French Commercial Code  ( Code  de  commerce ) relating to the  justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese  matters  were  addressed  in  the  context  of  our  audit  of  the consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole,  and  in  forming  our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPAIRMENT OF CUSTOMER LOANS\n\n## Risk identified\n\nCustomer loans and receivables carry a credit risk which exposes the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group to a potential loss if its client or counterparty is  unable  to  meet  its  financial  commitments.  The  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group recognizes impairment to cover this risk.\n\nSuch  impairment  is  calculated  according  to  IFRS/uni00A09, Financial instruments and the expected credit loss principle.\n\nThe assessment of expected credit losses for customer loan portfolios requires the exercise of judgment by Management, particularly in the uncertain  context  due  to  the  global  crisis  tied  to  the  Covid-19 pandemic, notably to:\n\n- determine  the  loan  classification  criteria  under  stages/uni00A01,  2  or  3, p taking account of the material increase in credit risk at loan portfolio level and the impact of measures to support the economy;\n- prepare, in an uncertain environment, macro-economic projections p which  are  embedded  in  the  deterioration  criteria  and  in  the expected credit losses measurement;\n- estimate  the  amount  of  expected  credit  losses  depending  on  the p different stages;\n- determine the adjustments to models and parameters, as well as the p sector  adjustments  considered  necessary  to  reflect  the  impact  of economic  scenarios  on  expected  credit  losses  and  anticipate  the default or recovery cycle for certain sectors.\n\nThe  information  concerning  in  particular  the  procedures  used  to estimate and recognize expected credit losses are mainly described in Notes/uni00A03.5 'Loans, receivables and securities at amortized cost' and 3.8 'Impairment and provisions' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs at December/uni00A031, 2021, total customer loan outstandings exposed to credit risk totaled M\u20ac 497,164; impairment totaled M\u20ac 10,980.\n\n|",

As  at\n\nDecember/uni00A031,  2021,  this  timeframe  is  eight  years  for  the  France  tax group and seven years for the United States of America tax group.\n\nIn  addition,  as  stated  in  Note/uni00A06  'Income  tax'  and  9  'Information  on risks  and  litigation'  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  certain tax loss carryforwards are challenged by the French tax authorities and are therefore liable to be called into question.\n\nGiven  the  importance  of  the  assumptions  used  to  assess  the recoverability  of  the  deferred  tax  assets  in  France  and  the  United States of America, notably on future taxable profits, and the judgment exercised by Management in this respect, we considered this issue to be a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur  audit  approach  consisted  in  assessing  the  probability  that  the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  Group  will  be  able  to  use  in  the  future  its  tax  loss carryforwards generated to date, in particular with regard to its ability to generate future taxable profits in France and in the United States of America.\n\nWith the support of tax specialists, our work notably consisted in:\n\n- comparing  the  projected  results  of  the  previous  years  with  the p actual  results  of  the  corresponding  fiscal  years,  to  assess  the reliability of the tax business plan preparation process;\n- obtaining  an  understanding  of  the  2022  budget  drawn  up  by p Management and approved by the Board of Directors, as well as of the  assumptions  underlying  projections  for  the  2022-2025  period, which  take  into  account  the  expected  impacts  of  the  France network/uni00A0merger;\n- assessing the relevance of tax profit extrapolation methods after the p 2022-2025 period;\n- reviewing the assumptions underlying sensitivity tests in the event p of adverse scenarios defined by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group;\n- analyzing  the  sensitivity  of  the  tax  loss  recovery  period  under  a p range of assumptions determined by us;\n- analyzing  the  situation  of  the  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  Group,  notably  by p taking note of the opinions of its external tax advisers regarding its tax  loss  carryforwards  in  France,  partly  challenged  by  the  tax authorities.\n\nWe  have  also  examined  the  information  provided  by  the  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group concerning deferred tax assets disclosed in Notes/uni00A01.5 'Use of estimates and judgment', 6 'Income tax' and 9 'Information on risks and litigation' to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## PORTFOLIO-BASED INTEREST RATE RISK FAIR VALUE HEDGING OF OUTSTANDINGS OF THE RETAIL BANKING NETWORKS IN FRANCE\n\n## Risk identified\n\nTo  manage  the  interest  rate  risk  generated  by  its  retail  banking activities in France in particular, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group manages a portfolio of internal derivatives classified as hedges.\n\nThese  internal  transactions  are  classified  as  portfolio-based  interest rate risk fair value  hedging  transactions  ('macro-hedging')  in accordance  with  IAS/uni00A039  as  adopted  in  the  European  Union,  as presented  in  Note/uni00A03.2  'Financial  derivatives'  to  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  fair  value  of  the  corresponding  financial  instruments  is included under 'Hedging derivative instruments' in assets and liabilities.\n\nGiven the documentation requirements for 'macro-hedging' relationships,  the  volume  of  hedging  derivative  transactions  and  the use  of  Management  judgment  required,  we  consider  the  accounting treatment  of  portfolio-based  interest  rate  risk  fair  value  hedging  of outstandings of the retail banking networks in France to be a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur audit procedures in response to the risk relating to the accounting treatment  of  portfolio-based  interest  rate  risk  fair  value  hedging  of outstandings ('macro-hedging') consisted in obtaining an understanding of the procedures used to manage the structural interest rate risk, and reviewing the control environment set up by Management in  particular  for  the  documentation,  identification  and  eligibility  of hedged  and  hedging  items,  as  well  as  for  the  performance  of effectiveness tests.\n\nWith the support of financial modelling experts, where necessary, our work mainly consisted in:\n\n- familiarizing  ourselves  with  the  accounting  documentation  of  the p hedging relationships;\n- testing the eligibility of the financial assets and liabilities used by the p Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group for the portfolio-based interest rate risk fair value  hedge  accounting,  according  to  the  terms  and  conditions defined by IAS/uni00A039 as adopted in the European Union;\n- assessing  the  procedures  used  to  prepare  and  control  the  criteria p adopted  to  schedule  the  maturities  of  the  hedged  financial instruments,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  adopted  maturities  of the eligible financial liabilities;\n- assessing  the  procedures  used  to  determine  the  effectiveness  of p these hedging relationships, as well as the related governance;\n- analyzing the external reversal system for hedges entered into with p internal Group counterparties and the related documentation, and conducting  tests  on  the  matching  of  internal  and  external transactions;\n- analyzing the results of tests on over-hedging, the disappearance of p hedged  items,  efficiency  and  reversal  required  by  applicable accounting standards.\n\nWe  also  assessed  the  information  disclosed  in  Notes/uni00A01.5  'Use  of estimates  and  judgment',  3.2  'Derivative  financial  instruments'  and 3.4 'Fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value' to the consolidated  financial  statements  and  their  compliance  with  IFRS/uni00A07 'Financial instruments: Disclosures' with regard to hedge accounting.\n\n## MEASUREMENT OF GOODWILL\n\n## Risk identified\n\nThe accounting recognition of external growth transactions leads the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  Group  to  record  goodwill  in  the  asset  side  of  the consolidated  balance  sheet.  This  goodwill  represents  the  difference between  the  acquisition  cost  of  the  activities  or  securities  of companies acquired and the share in identifiable net assets acquired and  liabilities  assumed  at  the  acquisition  date.  As  at  December/uni00A031, 2021, the net value of goodwill was M\u20ac 3,741, after impairment of the AFMO zone cash-generating unit (CGU) at December/uni00A030, 2021 for a total amount of M\u20ac 114.\n\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group must determine the presence or absence of  indications  of  loss  in  value  on  this  goodwill,  in  particular  its inclusion  in  forecasts  made  and  variables  used  to  update  business plans, as well as in the terminal value calculation. The comparison of the  net  carrying  amount  of  uniform  business  groupings  allocated  to CGUs, and their recoverable amount is a key component in assessing the potential need to record an impairment. The value in use of CGUs was  calculated  using  the  discounted  cash  flow  method  based  on distributable profits calculated at CGU level.\n\nAs  disclosed  in  Notes/uni00A01.5  'Use  of  estimates  and  judgment'  and  2.2 'Goodwill' to the consolidated financial statements, the models and data  used  to  value  these  CGUs  are  based  on  accounting  estimates resulting  from  the  exercise  of  Management  judgment,  notably concerning the following assumptions:\n\n- future  distributable  profits  of  activities  or  companies  acquired, p whether  5-year  budget  forecasts  or  the  extrapolation  for  an additional year to calculate the terminal value;\n- discount and growth rates applied to forecast flows. p\n\nFor this reason, we considered the measurement of goodwill to be a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur audit approach is based on obtaining an understanding of control procedures  relating  to  (i)/uni00A0goodwill  impairment  tests  and  (ii)/uni00A0the preparation  of  business  plans,  implemented  within  the  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group to assess future changes in structures and activities, and to identify indications of impairment loss on these assets.\n\nProcedures  on  the  financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021, conducted with our valuation specialists, notably consisted in:\n\n- assessing the way groupings of uniform businesses are determined p and, where appropriate, change;\n- analyzing the methodology applied in the current context; p\n- comparing  prior  year  profit  forecasts  with  actual  results  for  the p relevant years, to assess the reliability of the budget process;\n\n|",

As  at  December/uni00A031, 2021,  in  this  respect,  M\u20ac  222,934  are  recognized  in  fair  value  levels/uni00A02 and 3 in the asset side, and M\u20ac 302,669 are recognized in the liability side of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group's balance sheet, i.e. 56% and 95%, respectively, of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value\n\nTo determine the fair value of these instruments, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group  uses  techniques  or  in-house  valuation  models  based  on parameters and data, some of which are not observable in the market, which can defer the recognition of the margin in the income statement for transactions involving such financial instruments, as stated in point 7  of  Note/uni00A03.4  'Fair  value  of  financial  instruments  measured  at  fair value'  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  If  necessary,  these valuations  include  additional  reserves  or  value  adjustments.  The models  and  data  used  to  value  these  instruments,  and  their classification under the fair value hierarchy, may be based for example on  Management's  judgments  and  estimates,  in  the  absence  of available market data or a market valuation model.\n\nDue  to  the  complexity  of  modelling  in  determining  fair  value,  the multiplicity of models used, and the use of Management judgment in determining  these  fair  values,  we  consider  the  valuation  of  complex financial instruments to be a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur  audit  approach  is  based  on  the  key  internal  control  processes related to the valuation of complex financial instruments.\n\nWith  the  support  of  experts  in  the  valuation  of  financial  instruments included in the audit team, our work consisted in:\n\n- obtaining  an  understanding  of  the  procedure  to  authorize  and p validate  new  products  and  their  valuation  models,  including  the process for the entry of these models in the information systems;\n- analyzing  the  governance  set  up  by  the  Risk  Department  for  the p control of the valuation models;\n- analyzing  the  valuation  methodologies  for  certain  categories  of p complex instruments and the relating reserves or value adjustments;\n- testing  the  key  controls  relating  to  the  independent  verification  of p the valuation parameters, and analyzing certain market parameters used  to  provide  input  for  the  valuation  models,  by  reference  to external data;\n- obtaining  an  understanding  of  the  bank's  analysis  principles  and p performing  tests  of  controls,  on  a  sampling  basis,  as  regards  the process  used  to  explain  the  changes  in  fair  value;  in  addition, performing  'analytical'  IT  procedures  on  the  daily  control  data relating to certain activities;\n- obtaining the quarterly results of the independent price verification p process performed on the valuation models;\n- obtaining the quarterly results of the valuation adjustment process p using  external  market  data,  and  analyzing  the  differences  in parameters with the market data in the event of a significant impact, and the accounting treatment of such differences. Where there was no  external  data,  we  controlled  the  existence  of  reserves  or  the non-material nature of the related issues;\n- performing counter-valuations of a selection of complex derivative p financial instruments using our tools;\n- analyzing  the  observability  criteria, among  others,  used  to p determine  the  fair  value  hierarchy  of  such  instruments,  and  to estimate  deferred  margin  amounts  and  we  compared  the  new methods adopted by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group to recognize these margins  over  time  with  the  information  presented  in  point  7  of Note/uni00A03.4 'Fair value of financial instruments measured at fair value' to the consolidated financial statements\n\nWe have also assessed the compliance of the methods underlying the estimates  with  the  principles  described  in  Note/uni00A03.4  'Fair  value  of financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value'  to  the  consolidated financial statements.\n\n## IT RISK RELATING TO MARKET ACTIVITIES\n\n## Risk identified\n\nThe  Market  Activities  of  the  Global  Banking  &  Investor  Solutions division  (GBIS)  constitute  an  important  activity,  as  illustrated  by  the significance  of  the  financial  instruments  positions  in  Note/uni00A03.4  'Fair value  of  financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value'  to  the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThis  activity  is  highly  complex  given  the  nature  of  the  financial instruments  processed,  the  volume  of  transactions,  and  the  use  of numerous interfaced information systems. The risk of occurrence of a significant misstatement in the accounts related to an incident in the data processing chains used or the recording of transactions until their transfer into the accounting system may result from:\n\n- changes  made  to  management  and  financial  information  by p unauthorized  persons  via  the  information  systems  or  underlying databases;\n- a failure in processing or in the transfer of data between systems; p\n- a service interruption or an operating incident which may or may not p be related to internal or external fraud.\n\nFurthermore, the resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic still requires all employees  to  work  from  home  to  ensure  business  continuity.  The measures taken by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group in this respect exposed it  to  new  risks,  particularly  those  relating  to  the  opening  up  of information systems to allow remote access to transaction processing applications.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

In  this  context,  the  IT  risk  relating  to  the Market Activities of the GBIS division constitutes a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur audit approach for this activity is based on the controls related to the  management  of  the  information  systems  set  up  by  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group. With the support of specialists in information systems included  in  the  audit  team,  we  tested  the  IT  general  controls  of  the applications  that  we  considered  to  be  key  for  this  activity.  Our  work mainly consisted in assessing:\n\n- the controls set up by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group on access rights, p notably  at  sensitive  periods  in  a  professional  career  (recruitment, transfer,  resignation,  end  of  contract)  with,  where  applicable, extended  audit  procedures  in  the  event  of  ineffective  control identified during the financial year;\n- potential privileged access to applications and infrastructure; p\n- the  management  of  changes  made  to  applications,  and  more p specifically  the  separation  between  development  and  business environments;\n- security policies in general and their deployment in IT applications p (for example, those related to passwords);\n- the handling of IT incidents during the audit period; p\n- governance and the control environment on a sample of applications. p\n\nFor  these  same  applications,  and  in  order  to  assess  the  transfer  of information  flows,  we  tested  the  key  application  controls  relating  to the automated interfaces between the systems. In addition, our tests on the general IT and application controls were supplemented by data analytics procedures on certain IT applications.\n\nWe  also  evaluated  the  governance  implemented  by  the  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group to ensure the resilience of information systems in the context of the Covid-19 crisis. Our procedures consisted in discussions with  the  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  Group's  security  teams  and  reviewing minutes of cybersecurity committee meetings, as well as any incidents during  the  period.  Our  procedures  notably  included  an  analysis  of access derogations granted and validated by the security team.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nWe  have  also  performed,  in  accordance  with  professional  standards applicable  in  France,  the  specific  verifications  required  by  laws  and regulations on the information relating to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group presented in the Board of Directors' management report.\n\nWe  have  no  matters  to  report  as  to  its  fair  presentation  and  its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial performance statement required by Article/uni00A0L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de  commerce)  is  included  in  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  Group  management report,  it  being  specified  that,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0823-10 of  said  Code,  we  have  verified  neither  the  fair presentation  nor  the  consistency  with  the  consolidated  financial statements  of  the  information  contained  therein.

Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists. Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ),  our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the p consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error, designs  and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks, and  obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be  sufficient  and appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  his  opinion.  The  risk  of  not detecting  a  material  misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher than  for  one  resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion, forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override of internal control;\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in p order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the p reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related  disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- assesses  the  appropriateness  of  Management's  use  of  the  going p concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability\n\nto  continue  as  a  going  concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to  cease  to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a  material  uncertainty  exists,  there  is  a  requirement  to  draw attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n\n- evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial p statements  and  assesses  whether  these  consolidated  statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial p information of the entities or business activities within the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.  The  statutory  auditor  is  responsible  for  the  direction, supervision  and  performance  of  the  audit  of  the  consolidated financial  statements  and  for  the  opinion  expressed  on  these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## REPORT TO THE AUDIT AND INTERNAL CONTROL COMMITTEE\n\nWe submit to the Audit and Internal Control Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit  program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the  accounting  and  financial  reporting  procedures  that  we  have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Internal Control Committee includes the risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment, were  of  most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe  also  provide  the  Audit  and  Internal  Control  Committee  with  the declaration  provided  for  in  Article/uni00A06  of  Regulation  (EU)  No./uni00A0537/2014, confirming  our  independence  within  the  meaning  of  the  rules applicable in France  such  as  they  are  set  in  particular  by Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0822-10 to L./uni00A0822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )  and  in  the  French  Code  of  Ethics  for  Statutory  Auditors ( Code  de  d\u00e9ontologie  de  la  profession  de  commissaire  aux  comptes ). Where  appropriate,  we  discuss  with  the  Audit  and  Internal  Control Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, March/uni00A09, 2022 The Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres Micha Missakian\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The pace of growth picked up in the  United  States,  boosted  by  huge  fiscal  supports  and  the  surge  in consumer  spending.  Growth  also  expanded  sharply  in  Europe  in mid-2021. In France, GDP returned to pre-crisis levels in the third quarter.\n\nThis trend persisted through to the end of the year, despite inflationary pressure,  in  part  due  to  the  mismatch  between  strong  demand  and supply scarcities caused by disruptions in the production chains and reimposed restrictions to tackle virus outbreaks.\n\nIn  this  positive  economic  environment,  Societe  Generale  posted exceptional results and demonstrated tight cost discipline and sound risk management.\n\nAt  31/uni00A0December  2021,  the  balance  sheet  total  was  EUR/uni00A01,237/uni00A0billion, down EUR/uni00A021/uni00A0billion from the position at 31/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nThe Interbank and money  market  assets  line increased by EUR/uni00A014.5/uni00A0billion versus 31/uni00A0December  2020.  Amounts  outstanding  with the  French  central  bank,  the  Banque  de  France,  rose  EUR/uni00A05/uni00A0billion, mainly  due  to  the  ECB's  operations  to  provide  financing  to  credit institutions. Amounts  due  from  banks  increased  EUR/uni00A09/uni00A0billion, primarily related to financing of Group subsidiaries.\n\nMoney market liabilities increased to the tune of EUR/uni00A016/uni00A0billion. Term borrowings  from  banks  rose  EUR/uni00A014.6/uni00A0billion, bank  refinancing increased EUR/uni00A03.6/uni00A0billion, while demand deposits were up EUR/uni00A06.3/uni00A0billion. Conversely,  issuance  volume  of  euro  medium-term notes (EMTN) debt securities declined EUR/uni00A09.4/uni00A0billion.\n\nLoans  to  customers  rose  EUR/uni00A022/uni00A0billion  on  an  increase  in  short-term loans of EUR/uni00A011.1/uni00A0billion,  in  equipment  loans  of  EUR/uni00A01.1/uni00A0billion  and  in mortgage lending of EUR/uni00A03.3/uni00A0billion. Overdrafts increased by EUR/uni00A09.4/uni00A0billion, chiefly with  Group  subsidiaries,  while  loans  to subsidiaries  fell  EUR/uni00A04.5/uni00A0billion.  Customer  deposits  declined  a  net EUR/uni00A010/uni00A0billion as customer deposits increased and short-term loans to subsidiaries decreased.\n\n|",

Income rose across all our businesses:\n\n- French  Retail  Banking's  net  banking  income  was  up  slightly p (EUR/uni00A0+0.1/uni00A0billion)  in  comparison  to  2020  in  a  resilient  performance. Fee  income  rose  7%  year-on-year,  mainly  attributable  to  higher financial fees as the economy recovered, which partially offset the 5% contraction in net interest margin with rates still at rock bottom. Retail  Banking pursued the drive to transform its network and the merger  between  the  Cr\u00e9dit  du  Nord  and  Societe  Generale  bank networks  has  gone  ahead  on  target.  The  plan  aims  to  boost  the Bank's  positioning  in  the  French  retail  banking  market,  with  more than 10/uni00A0million customers;\n- Global  Banking  and  Investor  Solutions  rebounded  compared  with p 2020,  lifted  by  brisk  activity  in  equity  derivatives.  Note  that  the pandemic and extreme volatility in financial markets in reaction to government health restrictions to contain the virus tool their toll on\n\nthese  activities,  especially  in  the  first  half  of  2020.  However,  this uptick tends to obscure a more nuanced picture. The healthy growth in revenue for Equities was mitigated by the decline in Fixed Income and Foreign Exchange:\n\n- income  from  Equities  and  Securities  powered  ahead  in  2021, -reflecting  the  remarkable  recovery  in  the  Equity  derivatives business. Equities put in its best performance since 2009, making the most of a buoyant stock market and optimum volatility levels over  the  year.  Moreover,  the  Bank's  exposure  to  losses  in  2021 was  reduced  as  a  result  of  the  defensive  action  taken  to recalibrate  its  risk  profile  in  structured  equities  -  with  a  heavy knock-on effect on costs in 2020,\n- revenue  from  Fixed  Income  and  Currencies  contracted  25%  in -2021 in less favourable market conditions, as spreads tightened and customer demand for fixed-income products fell,\n- Financing and Advisory Services saw revenue pick up 7% over the -period,  buoyed  by  brisk  momentum  in  advisory,  mergers  and acquisitions;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The  higher  contribution  to  the  Single  Resolution  Fund  (SRF) accounted for EUR/uni00A00.1/uni00A0billion of this item in 2021 and the costs of the merger between the retail network and Credit du Nord makes up EUR/uni00A00.2/uni00A0billion,\n- payroll  expense  totalled  EUR/uni00A05.1/uni00A0billion,  a  rise  of  EUR/uni00A00.3/uni00A0billion -(+6%) on 2020, reflecting the effects of the economic recovery on collective and variable compensation post-pandemic;\n\n## TRADE PAYABLES PAYMENT SCHEDULE\n\n## 31.12.2021\n\n## 31.12.2020\n\n|                 | Payables not yet due   | Payables not yet due   | Payables not yet due     | Payables not yet due     | Payables not yet due   | Payables not yet due   | Payables not yet due   | Payables not yet due     | Payables not yet due     | Payables not yet due   | Payables not yet due   |\n|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| (In EURbn)      | 1-30/uni00A0 days      | 31-60/uni00A0 days     | >/uni00A060/uni00A0 days | >/uni00A090/uni00A0 days | Payables due Total     | 1-30/uni00A0 days      | 31-60/uni00A0 days     | >/uni00A060/uni00A0 days | >/uni00A090/uni00A0 days | Payables due Total     |                        |\n| Trade  Payables | 41                     | 91                     | -                        | -                        | - 132                  | 18                     | 48                     | -                        | -                        | -                      | 66                     |\n\nThe due dates are according to conditions calculated at 60/uni00A0days from invoice date.\n\nIn France, Societe Generale's supplier invoices are processed centrally for  the  most  part.  The  department  responsible  books  and  settles invoices  for  services  requested  by  all  Societe  Generale  France's Corporate and Business Divisions.\n\nIn  accordance with the Group's internal control procedures, invoices are only paid after they have been approved by the departments that\n\nsigned for the services. Once approved, invoices are paid on average in three to seven days.\n\nIn accordance with Article/uni00A0D./uni00A0441-6 of the French Commercial Code, as worded  pursuant  to  French  Decree  No./uni00A02021-11  of  26/uni00A0February  2021, the information on supplier payment times is given in the table below:\n\n- the  banking,  insurance  and  financial  services  businesses  (loans, p financing and commissions) are excluded from the scope.\n\n|\n\n- the net cost of risk was EUR/uni00A00.1/uni00A0billion at end-2021, a healthy fall of p EUR/uni00A01.5/uni00A0billion year-on-year. In 2020, the Bank put aside substantial provisions  to  cover  the  impacts  of  the  pandemic,  especially  on performing loans. But the quality of the loan portfolio drove down the  cost  of  risk  in  2021,  while  the  Group  retained  its  prudent provisioning policy.\n\nThe  combination  of  these  items  pushed  up  operating  income  by EUR/uni00A03.4/uni00A0billion vs. 2020 to EUR/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion at 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\n- In  2021,  Societe  Generale  booked  EUR/uni00A00.7/uni00A0billion  in  gains  on  fixed p assets, essentially arising from the sale of Lyxor Asset Management and Lyxor International Asset Management. You are reminded that the  gains  on  fixed  assets  in  2020  had  to  do  with  the  positive revaluation  of  some  subsidiaries  and  the  resulting  write-back  of EUR/uni00A00.5/uni00A0billion  in  impairment  provisions, as well as the capital gain on  the  partial  conversion  of  Visa/uni00A0Inc.  securities  in  the  amount  of EUR/uni00A00.2/uni00A0billion.\n- Income tax fell by EUR/uni00A00.2/uni00A0billion. The 2021 tax charge increased by p EUR/uni00A00.2/uni00A0billion and reflects the increase in pre-tax operating income over the period, offset by the fall in deferred taxes for EUR/uni00A00.4/uni00A0billion, particularly in France and in the United States. Updated projections for  the  2021  financial  year  have  improved.  As  a  result,  Societe Generale recognised EUR/uni00A00.2/uni00A0billion in deferred tax assets, compared to  a  deferred  tax  expense  of  EUR/uni00A00.7/uni00A0billion  in  2020  following  a review of tax loss carry-forwards that factored in the uncertainties inherent in the Covid-19 crisis in projected taxable income.\n\nNet income after tax amounted to EUR/uni00A02/uni00A0billion  at  end-2021 versus a loss of EUR/uni00A01.6/uni00A0billion at the 2020/uni00A0year end.",

receivable are set by contract in respect of financing granted or services invoiced. The initial payment terms  set  for  loan  repayments  may  be  amended  by  means  of contractual options (such as prepayment options, or options to defer payments). Compliance with contractual payment terms is monitored as part of the Bank's risk management process (see Chapter/uni00A04 of this URD: 'Risks  and  Capital  Adequacy' ),  particularly  in  respect  of  credit\n\nrisk,  structural  interest  rate  risk,  and  liquidity  risk.

These products  meet  a  range  of  customer  needs,  including  the  risk management  needs  of  business  customers  (producers,  consumers), and provide exposure to the commodities markets for investors (asset managers, funds and insurance companies).\n\nSociete  Generale's  offering  covers  a  broad  range  of  underlyings, including  sugar,  cocoa,  coffee,  cotton,  orange  juice,  corn,  wheat, rapeseed,  soybean,  oats,  cattle,  lean  hogs,  milk  and  rice.  Within  this scope, Societe Generale offers vanilla products on organised markets and  in  index-based  products.  Exposure  to  agricultural  commodities can  be  provided  through  single-  or  multi-commodity  products. Multi-commodity  products  are  primarily  used  by  investor  clients through index-based products.\n\nSociete Generale manages the risks associated with these positions on organised markets, for example:\n\n- NYSE  LIFFE  (including  Euronext  Paris)  for  cocoa,  corn,  wheat, p rapeseed oil, sugar and coffee;\n- ICE  FUTURES  US  for  cocoa,  coffee,  cotton,  orange  juice,  sugar, p canola and wheat;\n- CME  group  for  corn,  soybean,  soybean  oil,  soybean  meal,  wheat, p oats, cattle, lean hogs, milk and rice;\n- Minneapolis Grain Exchange for wheat; p\n- SGX for rubber; p\n- TOCOM for rubber. p\n\nThis list is subject to change.\n\n## DISCLOSURE ON DORMANT ACCOUNTS 6.4.2\n\nAll credit institutions are required to publish information on dormant bank  accounts  on  an  annual  basis  under  Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0312-19  and L./uni00A0312-20 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, as introduced by the  French  Act  No./uni00A02014-617  of  13/uni00A0June  2014  on  dormant  bank accounts  and  unclaimed  life  insurance  accounts.

They also attend regular training on business standards and market conduct;\n- daily  controls  are  run  to  detect  any  inappropriate  trading.  These p controls  include  monitoring  compliance  with  the  US  Commodity Futures  Trading  Commission  (CFTC)  and  market  rules  on  position limits,  designed  to  ensure  that  no  operator  can  adopt  a  market position that poses a danger to market equilibrium.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL 6.6 STATEMENTS\n\nThe parent company financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 9/uni00A0February 2022.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES NOTE 1\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe  preparation  and  presentation  of  the  parent  company  financial statements  for  Societe  Generale  comply  with  the  provisions  of Regulation  2014-07  of  the  French  Accounting  Standards  Board ( Autorit\u00e9  des  Normes  Comptables, ANC),  relating  to  the  annual accounts for the banking sector.\n\nAs  the  financial  statements  of  foreign  branches  were  prepared  using accounting principles generally accepted in their respective countries, they  have  been  adjusted  to  comply  with  the  accounting  principles applicable in France.\n\nThe disclosures provided in the notes to the parent company financial statements focus on information that is both relevant and material to the  financial  statements  of  Societe  Generale,  its  activities  and  the circumstances in which it conducted its operations over the period still impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n## 2. Accounting policies and valuation methods\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  accounting  principles  applicable  to  French credit  institutions,  the  majority  of  transactions  are  recorded  using valuation  methods  that  take  account  of  the  purpose  for  which  they were completed.\n\nIn  financial  intermediation  transactions,  assets  and  liabilities  are generally  maintained  at  their  historical  cost  and  impairment  is recognised  where  counterparty  risk  arises.  Revenues  and  expenses arising from these transactions are recorded prorata temporis over the life  of  the  transaction  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  cut-off principle.  The  same  applies  for  transactions  on  forward  financial instruments carried out for hedging purposes or to manage the bank's overall interest rate risk.\n\nTransactions  performed  in  the  Global  Markets  activity  are  generally marked  to  market  at  year-end,  except  for  loans,  borrowings  and short-term investment securities which are recorded at nominal value. When these financial instruments are not quoted in an active market, the market value used is adjusted to take into account liquidity risk, future management fees and, if any, counterparty risk.\n\n## 3. Translation of foreign currency financial statement\n\nThe on- and off-balance sheet items of branches reporting in foreign currencies  are  translated  at  the  official  exchange  rate  prevailing  at year-end.  The  income  statement  items  of  these  branches  are translated at the average quarter-end exchange rate. Translation gains and  losses  arising  from  the  translation  of  the  capital  contribution, reserves, retained earnings and net income of foreign branches, which result  from  changes  in  exchange  rates,  are  included  in  the  balance sheet  under  'Accruals,  other  accounts  payable/receivable  and  other liabilities/assets'.\n\n## 4. Use of estimates and judgment\n\nIn compliance with the accounting principles and methods applicable to the preparation of the financial statements and stated in the notes to  the  present  document,  the  Management  makes  assumptions  and estimates  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  figures  recorded  in  the income  statement,  the  valuation  of  assets  and  liabilities  on  the balance sheet, and the information disclosed in the notes to the parent company financial statements.\n\nIn order to make these assumptions and estimates, the Management uses  the  information  available  as  at  the  date  of  preparation  of  the financial  statements  and  can  exercise  its  own  judgment.  By  nature, valuations  based  on  these  estimates  involve  risks  and  uncertainties about  their  materialization  in  the  future.  Consequently,  the  actual future  results  may  differ  from  these  estimates  and  may  then  have  a significant impact on the financial statements.\n\nThe  assumptions  and  estimates  made  in  preparing  these  annual financial  statements  takes  into  account  current  uncertainties  on  the consequences,  duration  and  magnitude  of  the  economic  crisis resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic. The impacts of this crisis on the assumptions  and  estimates  used  are  detailed  in  part  6  of  the present/uni00A0note.\n\nThe use of estimates mainly concerns the following accounting topics:\n\n- fair  value  in  the  balance  sheet  of  financial  instruments  (securities p portfolio and forward financial instruments) not quoted in an active market and held for trading activities (see Notes/uni00A02.1, 2.2 and 3.2);\n- impairment of financial assets (see Note/uni00A02.6); p\n- provisions recognised as liabilities (see Notes/uni00A02.6, 4.2 and 7.3); p\n- deferred tax assets recognised in the balance sheet (see Note/uni00A05). p\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## BREXIT\n\nThe United Kingdom withdrawal agreement (Brexit) entered into force on  1/uni00A0January  2021.  Societe  Generale  has  been  granted  a  transitional authorisation to continue its activities in London for two years and is currently  in  the  process  of  obtaining  its  permanent  licence.  To  date, the/uni00A0European/uni00A0Commission has granted British/uni00A0clearing houses temporary equivalence/uni00A0status until 30/uni00A0June 2022.\n\nSociete Generale continues to monitor the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union regarding financial services and takes account of the short-/mid-/long-term consequences of the Brexit  in  the  assumptions  and  estimates  selected  to  prepare  the statutory financial statements.\n\n## CLIMATE RISK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate change is accelerating and urgent as unprecedent change are more than ever necessary. As the  6 th /uni00A0report of the  Intergovernmental  panel  for climate change (IPCC), the world needs urgent, global and coordinated actions to contain the global warming.\n\nSociete Generale has been engaged in the fight against climate change for many years now. And the Bank remains committed to support an extensive shift towards a decarbonised and more resilient economy.\n\nEnvironmental risk factors are liable to trigger or increase the risks for which  Societe  Generale  is  exposed.  Societe  Generale  thus  considers that climate change-related risks are not a new risk category but rather an  aggravating  factor  for  categories  already  covered  by  the  risk management system. The integration of climate-related risks is based on  the  existing  governance  and  processes  and  follows  a  standard approach (identification, quantification, definition of the risk appetite, control and mitigation).\n\nAmong  climate  risks, Societe Generale distinguishes between transitional  risk  and  physical  risk  in  compliance  with  the  risk terminology  proposed  by  the  TCFD  (Task  force  on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures). The impact of transitional risk on the credit risk of Societe Generale's corporate customers has been identified as the major  climate  risk.  To  measure  this  impact,  indicators  aimed  at reinforcing credit analysis on the most exposed counterparties in the sectors identified as particularly vulnerable are gradually developed.\n\nSociete  Generale  continues  its  work  to  gradually  integrate  climate risks in the preparation of its statutory financial statements.\n\n## 5. Update of the recommendation n\u00b02013-02 related to the principles of measurement and recognition of pension obligations and assimilated benefits for the statutory and consolidated financial statements prepared according to french accounting standards\n\nThe  French  ANC  -/uni00A0 Autorit\u00e9  des  Normes  Comptables (French  accounting standards authority) modified on 5/uni00A0November 2021 the recommendation n\u00b02013-02 related to the principles of measurement and recognition of pension  obligations  and  assimilated  benefits  for  the  statutory  and consolidated  financial  statements  prepared  according  to  French accounting standards.\n\nThis  update  introduced  a  choice  of  method  for  the  allocation  and recognition in the income statement of the benefit rights for defined\n\nbenefit  plans  with  benefit  rights  depending  on  seniority,  with  a maximum caped amount and requiring the presence of the employee in  the  Company  when  he  reaches  the  retirement  age.  The  change resulting  from  this  choice  of  method  is  qualified  as  change  of accounting method.\n\nAs Societe Generale choose to apply this new method, its application led  to  remeasure  the  plan  obligations  with  similar  features  as  those described in the updated recommendation (end of career compensation).  The  retroactive  effect  of  this  change  of  accounting method  has  been  recognised  in  equity  on  1/uni00A0January  2021  for  a  net amount of EUR/uni00A013/uni00A0million.\n\nThis change of accounting method impacts Notes/uni00A04 and 6.\n\n## 6. Covid-19\n\nTwo years after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, the year 2021 was  marked  by  an  economic  upturn  in  several  major  economies,  in particular  as  a  result  of  the  deployment  of  vaccines.  However,  these dynamics  are  affected  by  persistent  frictions  in  the  global  supply chains  and  labour  markets,  and  by  longer  delivery  times  in  the manufacturing sector and a reduced capacity of supply in the service sector, which have led to rising costs. Uncertainties remain regarding new  developments  in  the  sanitary  crisis/uni00A0(emergence  of  the  Omicron variant and slow deployment of vaccines in some countries).\n\nAgainst this background, the multi-scenario approach selected in 2020 has  been  maintained  for  preparing  the  statutory  accounts  as  at 31/uni00A0December 2021; in particular, Societe Generale uses macro-economic scenarios  in  its  measurement  models  for  credit  risk  impairment  and provision (see Note/uni00A02.6) and in its impairment test for differed tax assets (see Note/uni00A05).\n\nSociete Generale  also  maintained  the  use  of  methodological adjustments  (see  Note/uni00A02.6)  to  take  account  of  the  support  measures adopted  since  2020  by  public  authorities,  and  the  remaining uncertainties related to the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThese  various  topics  are  detailed  hereafter  to  shed  light  on  the financial consequences of the crisis and the way they have been taken into account in the preparation of the statutory financial statements.\n\n## MACRO-ECONOMIC SCENARIOS AND WEIGHTING\n\nAs  at  31/uni00A0December  2021,  Societe  Generale  has  maintained  the coexistence of four scenarios:\n\n- the central scenario (SG Central), weighted at 50%, expects no new p widespread  closures,  and  assumes  that  the  remaining  social distancing  measures,  such  as  masks,  will  enable  most  sectors  to operate almost as usual;\n- a  scenario  of  prolonged  health  crisis  (SG  Extended),  weighted  at p 10%,  expects  a  new  sanitary  shock  from  the  end  of  2021, reproducing the lockdown pattern with increased social distancing measures as observed at the end of 2020 and in Spring 2021;\n- lastly,  two  additional  scenarios,  one  favourable  (SG  Favourable) p weighted  at  10%  and  one  stress  (SG  Stress)  weighter  at  30%, supplement these two scenarios. The favorable scenario envisages a stronger GDP growth than the central scenario owing to unexpected productivity  gains  leading  to  a  potentially  higher  GDP.  The  stress scenario  corresponds  to  a  crisis  situation  leading  to  a  negative deviation  in  GDP  compared  to  the  central  scenario.  This  scenario may result  from  a  financial  crisis  (2008  crisis,  Euro  area  crisis),  an exogenous crisis (Covid) or a combination of both.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "These scenarios are developed by the Economic and Sector Research Departmentof  Societe  Generale  based,  in  particular,  on  information published  by  statistical  institutes.  Forecasts  from  institutions  (IMF, Global  Bank,  ECB,  OECD,  etc.)  and  the  consensus  among  market economists  serve  as  a  reference  to  ensure  the  consistency  of  the scenarios thus constructed.\n\n## COVID-19 SUPPORT MEASURES\n\nThe  moratoriums  granted  by  Societe  Generale  in  the  context  of  the sanitary  crisis  through  mass  treatment  have  now  expired,  with  a resumption of reimbursements without incident for most customers.\n\n## LOANS SUPPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT\n\nIn  addition  to  the  moratoriums,  Societe  Generale  contributed  to  the implementation  of  support  measures  decided  by  the  authorities through  the  examination  and  allocation  of  State  Guaranteed  Loan facilities  ( Pr\u00eats  Garantis  par  l'\u00c9tat (PGE)  in  French)  and  Participatory Recovery Equity Loans ( Pr\u00eats Participatifs Relance (PPR).\n\nThus, Societe Generale will offer, until 30/uni00A0June 2022, to its customers affected  by  the  crisis  (professionals  and  corporate  customers),  the allocation  of  State  Guaranteed  Loan  facilities  (PGE)  within  the framework  of  the  2020  French  Amending  Finance  Act  and  the conditions  set  by  the  French  decree  of  23/uni00A0March  2020.  These  are financings granted at cost price and guaranteed by the government for a share of the borrowed amount between 70 to 90% depending on the size of the borrowing enterprise (with a waiting period of two months after disbursement at the end of which the guarantee period begins). With a maximum amount corresponding, in the general case, to three months  of  turnover  before  tax,  these  loans  come  with  a  one-year repayment exemption. At the end of this year, the customer can either repay  the  loan  or  amortise  it  over  one  to  five  more  years,  with  the possibility of extending the grace period for the repayment of principal for  one  year  (in  line  with  the  announcements  made  by  the  French Ministre  de  l'\u00c9conomie,  des  Finances  et  de  la  Relance on  14/uni00A0January 2021) without extending the total duration of the loan.\n\nThe remuneration conditions of the guarantee are set by the State: the bank  keeps  only  a  share  of  the  guarantee  premium  paid  by  the borrowers (the amount of which depends on the size of the Company and  the  maturity  of  the  loan)  remunerating  the  risk  it  bears,  which corresponds to the part of the loan not guaranteed by the State ( i.e., between  10%  and  30%  of  the  loan  depending  on  the  size  of  the borrowing company). This share of the guarantee premium kept by the bank is assimilated to interest income.\n\nThese  State  Guaranteed  Loan  facilities  (PGE)  have  been  recorded among Customer loans. The share of the guarantee premium received from the borrowers and kept by the bank to compensate the share of risk  not  guaranteed  by  the  French  State  is  spread  over  the  effective lifetime  of  the  loans  in  net  income  amongst  Interest  and  similar income, as for the contractual interests.\n\nProvisions  and  impairment  for  credit  risk  recognised  for  the  State Guaranteed Loan facilities take into account of the effect of the French State guarantee.  The  models  for  calculating  impairment  and provisions  for  credit  risk  also  take  into  account  the  probabilities  of exercise  of  the  extension  options,  the  amount  of  the  loan  not guaranteed  by  the  State  as  well  as  the  waiting  period  in  the enforcement of the guarantee.\n\nAt  31/uni00A0December  2021,  the  State  Guaranteed  Loan  facilities  represent an outstanding of approximately EUR/uni00A010.1/uni00A0billion (including EUR/uni00A02.7/uni00A0billion in underperforming  loans  and  EUR/uni00A00.5/uni00A0billion of doubtful loans). The amount of credit risk impairment and provisions recorded  as  at  31/uni00A0December  2021  related  to  these  State  Guaranteed Loan  facilities  represent  approximately  EUR/uni00A064.1/uni00A0million,  without predominance of a specific sector.\n\nBased on the scenarios presented above, and after taking into account methodological adjustments and support measures, the cost of risk for the  financial  year  2021  represents  a  net  loss  of  EUR/uni00A0107/uni00A0million, decreasing  from  EUR/uni00A01,475/uni00A0million (-93%)  compared  to  financial year/uni00A02020.\n\nA French decree published on 19/uni00A0January 2022, amending the decree published on 23/uni00A0March 2020, allows some companies to benefit, under certain  conditions,  from  an  extension  of  their  PGE  repayment deadlines from 6 to 10/uni00A0years. The possible impacts of this decree will be presented in the 2022 financial statements.\n\n## 7. Project to merge the retail network of Societe Generale and Credit du Nord\n\nSociete Generale announced on 7/uni00A0December 2020 its project to merge of the retail banking network of Societe Generale and Cr\u00e9dit du Nord to form a new one (the/uni00A0VISION/uni00A02025/uni00A0project).\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, Societe Generale presented the proposed organisation of its new Retail Banking in France, which will result from the  legal  merger  of  Credit  du  Nord  and  Societe  Generale.  The  net income of the financial year 2021 includes EUR/uni00A0166/uni00A0million of expenses related to this project. These expenses mainly represent restructuring costs  already  incurred  during  the  year  as  well  as  the  gradual recognition  of  the  cost  of  voluntary  redundancy  measures,  the accounting  treatment  of  which  has  been  assimilated  to  that  of post-employment benefits.\n\n## 8. Acquisition project of leaseplan by ald in order to create a leader of the mobility business\n\nSociete Generale announced the signing by Societe Generale and ALD of  two  separate Memorandums  of  Understanding providing  for  the acquisition  by  ALD  of  100%  of  the  capital  of  LeasePlan  from  a consortium led by TDR Capital in order to create a leading actor of the mobility solutions business.\n\nThe  intended  acquisition  of  LeasePlan  for  a  total  amount  of EUR/uni00A04.9/uni00A0billion would  be  financed  by  securities  and  cash.  Societe Generale would ensure a capital increase with preferred subscription rights  of  EUR/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion  and  would  be  committed  to  remain  the majority shareholder of the new group ('NewALD') with a capital share of  about  53%  at  the  closing  of  this  transaction,  the  LeasePlan shareholders would receive a capital share of 30.75% as share based payment.  The  LeasePlan  shareholders  would  receive  also  warrants that could increase the capital share pro forma up to 32.9% in case of exercise, decreasing  the  capital  share  of  Societe  Generale  to around/uni00A051%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  coupons  received  on  the  fixed-income securities in the trading portfolio are recorded on the income statement under 'Net interest income' from bonds, or other debt securities.\n\nThe  trading  securities  that  are  no  longer  held  with  the  intention  of  selling  them  in  the  near  term,  or  no  longer  held  for  the  purpose  of market-making activities, or held as part of the specialised management of a trading portfolio for which there is no longer evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit-taking, may be reclassified into the Short-term investment securities category or into the Long-term investment securities category if:\n\n- exceptional market situations generate a change in holding strategy; or p\n- if debt securities become no longer negotiable in an active market after their acquisition, and Societe Generale has the intention and ability p to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity.\n\nSecurities which are then reclassified are recorded in their new category at their fair market value on the date of reclassification.\n\n## Long-term investment securities\n\nLong-term investment securities  are  debt  securities  acquired  or  reclassified  from  Trading  securities  and  Short-term  investment  securities which Societe Generale intends and has the capacity to hold until maturity.\n\nSociete Generale must therefore have, in particular, the necessary financing capacity to continue holding these securities until their expiry date.  These  long-term  investment  securities  shall  not  be  subject  to  any  legal  or  other  form  of  constraint  that  might  call  into  question  its intention to hold it until maturity.\n\nLong-term investment securities also include trading and short-term investment securities which have been reclassified by Societe Generale following  the  particular  conditions  described  here  before  (facing  exceptional  market  situations  or  when  debt  securities  are  no  longer negotiable in an active market). These reclassified securities are identified within the long-term investment securities portfolio.\n\nSociete Generale may have to dispose of long-term investment securities or transfer them to another accounting category only in the specific following cases:\n\n- the sale or transfer is made at a date close to the maturity of the security; or p\n- the sale or transfer is due to an isolated event independent of Societe Generale control. p\n\nThese instruments may be designated as hedged items when forward financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate risk on identifiable items or groups of similar items.\n\nLong-term investments securities are recorded in the balance sheet at their purchase cost excluding acquisition expenses.\n\n|",

This notably covers the investments that meet the following criteria:\n\n- shares in fully integrated companies or issued by companies accounted for using the equity method; p\n- shares in companies that share Directors or senior managers with Societe Generale and where influence can be exercised over the Company p whose shares are held;\n- shares in companies that belong to the same group controlled by individuals or legal entities, where the said persons or entities exercise p control over the Group and ensure that decisions are taken in unison;\n- shares representing more than 10% of the voting rights in the capital issued by a bank or a company whose business is directly linked to p that of Societe Generale.\n\nThis category also includes the other long-term securities. These are equity investments made by Societe Generale with the aim of developing special professional relations with a company over the long term but without exercising any influence on its management due to the low proportion of attached voting rights.\n\nAffiliates, investments in related parties and other long-term securities are recorded at their purchase price net of acquisition costs. Dividend income earned on these securities is recognised in the income statement under 'Dividend income'.\n\n## Short-term investment securities\n\nShort-term  investment  securities  are  all  the  securities  that  are  not  classified  as  trading  securities,  long-term  investment  securities,  or investments in consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates.\n\n## SHARES AND OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nEquity securities are initially recognised on the balance sheet at cost excluding acquisition expenses, or at contribution value. At year-end, cost is compared to realisable value. Only the unrealised losses are recorded with the recognition of a depreciation of the securities portfolio. Income from these securities is recorded in Dividend income.\n\n## BONDS AND OTHER DEBT SECURITIES\n\nThese securities are initially recognised on the balance sheet at cost excluding the acquisition expenses, and excluding interest accrued not due at the date of purchase. The positive or negative differences between the cost and redemption values are recognised as premiums (if positive) or discounts (if negative) in the income statement over the life of the securities concerned and spread using the actuarial method. The accrued interest on bonds and other short-term investment securities is recorded as related receivables with a counterpart entry under 'Interest and similar income' in the income statement.\n\nShort-term investment securities may be reclassified into Long-term investment securities category provided that:\n\n- exceptional market situations generate a change in holding strategy, or; p\n- if  after  their  acquisition  debt  securities  become  no  longer  negotiable in an active market and if Societe Generale has the intention and p ability to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity.\n\n## TREASURY NOTES, BONDS AND OTHER DEBT SECURITIES, SHARES NOTE 2.1.1 AND OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES\n\n## 31.12.2021\n\n31.12.2020\n\n| (In EURm)                         | Treasury notes and similar securities   | Shares and other equity securities   | Bonds and other debt securities (1)   | Total   | Treasury notes and similar securities   | Shares and other equity securities   | Bonds and other debt securities (2)   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|\n| Trading securities                | 26,742                                  | 109,347                              | 51,139                                | 187,228 | 31,612                                  | 91,824                               | 68,789                                | 192,225 |\n| Short-term investment  securities | 20,106                                  | 190                                  | 10,153                                | 30,449  | 22,049                                  | 1,659                                | 10,893                                | 34,601  |\n| Gross book value                  | 20,175                                  | 209                                  | 10,410                                | 30,794  | 22,115                                  | 1,704                                | 11,138                                | 34,957  |\n| Impairment                        | (69)                                    | (19)                                 | (257)                                 | (345)   | (66)                                    | (45)                                 | (245)                                 | (356)   |\n| Long-term investment securities   | 56                                      | -                                    | 43,321                                | 43,377  | 53                                      | -                                    | 41,715                                | 41,768  |\n| Gross book value                  | 56                                      | -                                    | 43,321                                | 43,377  | 53                                      | -                                    | 41,715                                | 41,768  |\n| Impairment                        | -                                       | -                                    | -                                     | -       | -                                       | -                                    | -                                     | -       |\n| Related receivables               | 88                                      | 92                                   | 9                                     | 189     | 92                                      | 85                                   | (8)                                   | 169     |\n| TOTAL                             | 46,992                                  | 109,629                              | 104,622                               | 261,243 | 53,806                                  | 93,568                               | 121,389                               | 268,763 |\n\n- As at 31 December 2021, the amounts of bonds and other debt securities includes EUR 1,351 million of securities issued by public bodies.

        "page_content": "## Transactions on forward financial instruments NOTE 2.2\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nTransactions on forward financial instruments on interest rates, foreign exchange rates or equities are used for trading or hedging purposes.\n\nNominal  commitments  on  forward  financial  instruments  are  recorded  as  a  separate  off-balance  sheet  item.  This  amount  represents  the volume  of  current  transactions  and  does  not  reflect  the  potential  gain  or  loss  associated  with  the  market  or  counterparty  risk  on  these transactions. Credit derivatives purchased to hedge credit risks on financial assets which are not valued at market value are classified and treated as guarantee commitments received.\n\nThe accounting treatment of income or expense on these forward financial instruments depends on the purpose of the transaction, as follows:\n\n## Hedging transactions\n\nIncome and expense on forward financial instruments used as hedge assigned from the beginning to an identifiable item or group of similar items are recognised in the income statement symmetrically to the income and expense on the hedged items. Income and expense on interest rate  instruments  are  recorded  as  net  interest  income  in  the  same  interest  income  or  expense  account  as  the  items  hedged.  Income  and expense  on  other  instruments  such  as  equity  instruments,  stock  market  indexes  or  currencies  are  recognised  under  'Net  income'  from short-term investment securities.\n\nIncome and expense on forward financial instruments used to hedge or manage an overall interest rate risk are recognised in the income statement over the life of the instrument under 'Net income' from the trading portfolio.\n\n## Market transactions\n\nMarket transactions include:\n\n- the instruments traded on organised or similar markets and other instruments, such as credit derivatives and composite option products, p which are included in the trading portfolio although they are traded over-the-counter on less liquid markets;\n- some  debt  securities  with  a  forward  financial  instrument  component  for  which  this  classification  in  the  accounts  most  appropriately p reflects the results and associated risks.\n\nThese transactions are measured at their market value as at the closing date. When financial instruments are not quoted in an active market, this  value  is  generally  determined  based  on  internal  models.  Where  necessary,  these  valuations  are  adjusted  for  reasons  of  prudence  by applying a discount (Reserve Policy). This discount is determined on the basis of the instruments concerned and the associated risks, and takes into account:\n\n- a conservative valuation of all the instruments, regardless of the liquidity of the corresponding market; p\n- a reserve calculated based on the size of the exposure and intended to cover the risk that Societe Generale will be unable to liquidate the p investment in one go due its size;\n- an adjustment for the reduced liquidity of the instruments and for model risk in the case of complex products as well as transactions on less p liquid markets (less liquid since they have been developed recently or are more specialised).\n\nFurthermore, for over-the-counter transactions on forward interest rate instruments, these valuations also take into account counterparty risk and the present value of the future management fees.\n\nThe corresponding gains or losses are directly recognised as income or expense for the period, regardless of whether they are realised or unrealised. They are recognised in the income statement as Net income from the trading portfolio.\n\nThe gains or losses corresponding to the contracts concluded as part of the cash management activities managed by the trading room in order to benefit from any interest rate fluctuations, are recorded when these contracts are settled or prorata temporis over  the  life  of  the contracts,  depending  on  the  type  of  instrument.  Any  unrealised  losses  are  provisioned  at  year-end  and  the  corresponding  amounts  are recorded under 'Net income' from the trading portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Loans and receivables NOTE 2.3\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nAmounts due from banks and customer loans are classified according to their initial duration and type: demand deposits (current accounts and overnight transactions) and term deposits for credit institutions, commercial loans, overdrafts and other loans to customers. They also include the securities purchased from banks or customers under resale agreements, and the loans secured by notes and securities.\n\nOnly the amounts due and customer loans that meet the following criteria are offset on the balance sheet: those with the same counterparty, maturity, currency and accounting entity, and those for which an agreement exists with the counterparty allowing the bank to combine the accounts and exercise the right of offset.\n\nThe interest accrued on these receivables is recorded as Related receivables and recognised in the income statement under 'Interest income and expenses'.\n\nThe fees and commissions received and the incremental transaction costs related to the granting of a loan (finder's and handling fees) are comparable to interest and spread over the effective life of the loan.\n\nThe loan commitments recorded on the off-balance sheet reflect transactions that have not yet resulted in cash flows, such as the irrevocable commitments for the undrawn portion of facilities made available to banks and customers or guarantees given on their behalf.\n\nIf a commitment bears a proven credit risk that makes it probable that Societe Generale will not recover all or part of the amounts due under the counterparty's commitment in accordance with the original terms of the contract, the corresponding outstanding loan is classified as a doubtful loan, despite the existence of a guarantee. Moreover, any loan will be classified as doubtful if one or more repayments are more than three  months  overdue  (six  months  for  mortgage  loans  and  nine  months  for  loans  to  local  authorities),  or  if,  regardless  of  any  missed payments, it can be assumed that there is a proven risk, or if legal proceedings have been started.\n\nIf  a  loan to a given debtor is classified as doubtful, all the outstanding loans and commitments to that debtor are reclassified as doubtful, regardless of whether or not they are backed by a guarantee.\n\nImpairment for unrealised losses and for doubtful loans is recorded for the amount of probable loss (see Note/uni00A02.6).\n\n## Restructuring of loans and receivables\n\nWhen  an  asset  recorded  under  'Due  from  banks'  or  'Customer  loans'  is  restructured,  contractual  changes  that  would  not  have  been considered  in  other  circumstances  are  made  to  the  amount,  term  or  financial  conditions  of  the  initial  transaction  approved  by  Societe Generale, due to the financial difficulties or insolvency of the borrower (whether this insolvency is proven or will definitely occur unless the debt is restructured). The restructured financial assets are classified as impaired and the borrowers are considered to be in default.\n\nThese  classifications  are  maintained  for  at  least  one  year  and  for  as  long  as  some  uncertainty  remains  for  Societe  Generale  as  to  the borrowers' ability to meet their commitments. At the restructuring date, the carrying amount of the restructured financial asset is decreased to  the  present  amount  of  the  estimated  new  future  recoverable  cash  flows  discounted  using  the  initial  effective  interest  rate.  This  loss  is booked in the income statement under 'Cost of risk'. The restructured financial assets do not include the loans and receivables subject to commercial renegotiations.\n\nLoans  and  receivables  may  be  subject  to  commercial  renegotiations  provided  that  the  borrowing  customer  is  not  experiencing  financial difficulties and is not insolvent. Such transactions thus involve customers whose debt Societe Generale is willing to renegotiate in the interest of maintaining or developing a commercial relationship, in accordance with the credit granting rules, and without relinquishing any principal or accrued interest.\n\nThese renegotiated loans and receivables are derecognised as at the renegotiation date and replaced as at the same date on the balance sheet by the new loans, contractualised under the renegotiated conditions. These new loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost, based  on  the  effective  interest  rate  arising  from  the  new  contractual  conditions  and  taking  into  account  the  renegotiation  fees  billed  to the/uni00A0customer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

For  this  purpose,  Societe  Generale  has transferred EUR/uni00A09,242/uni00A0million housing loans to a securitisation mutual fund.  To  capitalise  the  acquisition,  the  fund  has  issued  bonds  which were fully subscribed by Societe Generale.\n\nThe bonds are presented in the assets on the balance sheet within the investment  portfolio  for  an  amount  of  EUR/uni00A04,382/uni00A0million  as  at 31/uni00A0December 2021 as a result of underlying housing loans amortisation (EUR/uni00A05,346/uni00A0million as at 31/uni00A0December 2020).\n\nOn 27/uni00A0January  2022,  Societe  Generale  ended  the  securisation  by  the buy  back  of  the  entire  portfolio  of  housing  loans,  the  simultaneous repayment  of  the  bonds  and  the  liquidation  of  the  fund.  These operations have had no impact on the bank's net income.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

As  in  the two  previous  systems,  the  level  of  remuneration  of  the  borrowings depends on the performance of the borrowing banking institutions in terms  of  loans  granted  to  their  household  customers  (excluding  real estate loans) and business customers (excluding financial institutions). Depending  on  these  performances,  the  borrowing  institutions  may benefit  from  a  reduced  interest  rate  and  an  additional  temporary bonus applicable from 24/uni00A0June 2020 to 23/uni00A0June 2021 (reduction by 50 basis points of the average rate of the deposit facility with a floor rate set  at  -1%).  These  TLTRO/uni00A0III  operations  are  conducted  on  a  quarterly basis  between  September/uni00A02019  and  December/uni00A02021,  for  a  possible total of 10 drawdowns. Each such operation has a three-year maturity and includes an early repayment option. Some terms and conditions were  modified  in  March/uni00A02020,  in  particular  the  loan  production objectives,  rate  conditions  and  drawdown  limit,  in  order  to  further support  the  granting  of  loans  at  the  outset  of  the  Covid-19  crisis.  In January/uni00A02021,  the  ECB  decided  to  extend  the  temporary  additional bonification over the period from 24/uni00A0June 2021 to 23/uni00A0June 2022 subject to performance in terms of number of granted loans observed over a new reference period from 1/uni00A0October 2020 to 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\nSociete Generale have subscribed to TLTRO/uni00A0III loans through quarterly drawings  staggered  between  December/uni00A02019  and  December/uni00A02021.  As at 31/uni00A0December 2021,  the  total  outstanding  amount  drawn  is EUR/uni00A060.6/uni00A0billion.\n\nOnce Societe Generale has little doubt of being eligible for the bonus rates provided for, the latter are taken into account to determine the amount of interest recognised in profit or loss for the TLTRO loans; this amount  is  then  computed  based  on  a  weighted  rate  spreading  the bonus over the expected life of the drawdowns concerned.\n\nSociete  Generale  has  reached  its  objective  of  stability  of  the outstanding  amount  of  eligible  loans  between  1/uni00A0March  2020  and 31/uni00A0March 2021 allowing it to benefit from a reduced interest rate as well as  from  additional  temporary bonuses applied between 24/uni00A0June  2020 and  23/uni00A0June  2021.  As  at  31/uni00A0December  2021,  Societe  Generale  already had little doubt that it could benefit from these bonuses and had thus taken them into account to calculate the amount of interest recognised in 2020 based on a weighted average rate of -0.67%; the confirmation that the required objectives had indeed been met as at 31/uni00A0March 2021 has thus not changed the pace of recognition of these/uni00A0interests.\n\nAs  early  as  the  end  of  September/uni00A02021,  Societe  Generale  had  little doubt that it would reach its objective of stability of the outstanding amount  of  eligible  loans  between  1/uni00A0October  2020  and  31/uni00A0December 2021, which was confirmed at the end of the year, allowing it to benefit from  a  reduced  interest  rate  as  well  as  from  additional  temporary bonuses  applied  between  24/uni00A0June  2021  and  23/uni00A0June  2022.  The weighted  average  rate  of  the  TLTRO  borrowings  has  thus  been adjusted  as  early  as  September  to  -0.63%  and  -0.83%  depending  on the  drawdown  dates.  The  retroactive  impact  of  this  adjustment  has generated  a  EUR/uni00A00.1/uni00A0billion  income  included  in  the  total  amount  of negative  interest  on  the  TLTRO  borrowing  recorded  in  2021  under 'Interest  and  similar  expense'  for  EUR/uni00A00.5/uni00A0billion  (EUR/uni00A00.2/uni00A0billion in/uni00A02020).\n\n|",

The negative interest is deducted from the interest income and expense accounts related to these instruments.\n\nThe effective interest rate is the rate used to discount exactly the future cash inflows and outflows over the expected life of the instrument in order to establish the book value of the financial asset or liability. The calculation of this rate considers the future cash flows based on the contractual provisions of the financial instrument without taking account of possible future loan losses, and it also includes the commissions paid or received between the parties to the contract where they may be assimilated to interest, the directly linked transaction costs, and all types of premiums and discounts.\n\nWhen a financial asset or group of similar financial assets has been impaired following an impairment loss, the subsequent interest income is recorded based on the effective interest rate used to discount the future cash flows when measuring the impairment loss.\n\nMoreover, except for those related to employee benefits, the provisions recognised as balance sheet liabilities generate interest expenses that are calculated using the same interest rate used to discount the expected outflow of resources.\n\n|                                                                                                    | 2021   | 2021     | 2021    | 2020   | 2020     | 2020    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|---------|--------|----------|---------|\n| (In EURm)                                                                                          | Income | Expense  | Net     | Income | Expense  | Net     |\n| Transactions with banks                                                                            | 1,152  | (1,096)  | 56      | 1,534  | (1,714)  | (180)   |\n| Transactions with central banks, post office accounts  and banks (1)                               | 655    | (660)    | (5)     | 843    | (1,087)  | (244)   |\n| Securities sold under repurchase agreements and  borrowings secured by notes and securities        | 497    | (436)    | 61      | 691    | (627)    | 64      |\n| Transactions with customers                                                                        | 8,976  | (5,162)  | 3,814   | 9,937  | (8,068)  | 1,869   |\n| Trade notes                                                                                        | 13     | -        | 13      | 24     | -        | 24      |\n| Other customer loans                                                                               | 8,434  | -        | 8,434   | 8,917  | -        | 8,917   |\n| Overdrafts                                                                                         | 222    | -        | 222     | 227    | -        | 227     |\n| Regulated savings accounts                                                                         | -      | (482)    | (482)   | -      | (596)    | (596)   |\n| Other customer deposits                                                                            | -      | (4,379)  | (4,379) | -      | (6,760)  | (6,760) |\n| Securities sold/bought under repurchase agreements  and borrowings secured by notes and securities | 307    | (301)    | 6       | 769    | (712)    | 57      |\n| Bonds and other debt securities                                                                    | 2,662  | (4,213)  | (1,551) | 2,414  | (3,274)  | (860)   |\n| Other interest expenses and related income                                                         | 2,270  | (3,033)  | (763)   | 2,655  | (3,190)  | (535)   |\n| TOTAL                                                                                              | 15,060 | (13,504) | 1,556   | 16,540 | (16,246) | 294     |\n\n- Negative interests on TLTRO borrowing are deducted from expenses under 'Transactions with central banks, post office accounts and banks'.

Sectoral  and  other  adjustments  had  been  updated  to supplement the application of these models. A new criterion had also been established for reclassifying loans as underperforming loans.\n\nThese adjustments are taken into account to estimate the impairment and  provisions  for  credit  risk,  except  for  the  additional  criterion  for transfer to underperforming loans which concerns the classification of loans outstanding.\n\n## UPDATE OF THE MODELS AND PARAMETERS USED TO ESTIMATE THE IMPAIRMENT AND PROVISIONS FOR CREDIT RISK\n\nThe models used to estimate impairment and provisions for credit risk did  not  reflect  accurately,  in  determining  future  default  rates,  the economic uncertainties stemming from the current crisis.\n\nConsequently,  Societe  Generale  made  some  adjustments  to  its models/uni00A0to  better  reflect  the  impact  of  economic  scenarios  on  credit risk impairment and provisions:\n\n- GDP  adjustments:  in  order  to  take  into  account  the  increase  of p expected defaults in 2021 and 2022, Societe Generale has revised its models and retained for each quarter from 2021 to 2022 the average variation in GDP over the past eight quarters compared to a base of 100 in 2019. This adjustment is not performed for 2023 to 2025;\n- adjustment of the margin rate of French companies: to prepare the p statutory financial statements as at 31/uni00A0December  2020,  an  add-on, that had been included on the margin rate of French companies in 2020, has been removed in 2021 owing to the INSEE (French National Institute  of  Statistics  and  Economic  studies)  taking  account  of  the impact of the support measures in its margin rate forecasts.\n\n## ADJUSTMENTS SUPPLEMENTING THE APPLICATION OF MODELS\n\nTo better reflect the deterioration of the credit risk on some portfolios or business sectors, Societe Generale updated the existing adjustments made  in  addition  to  the  application  of  models  such  as  sectoral adjustments and adjustments for the use of simplified models.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt  the  time  when  these  sectoral  adjustments  are reviewed and where consistent with the provisioning horizon,  the  possible  impact  of  climate  risks  on  the determination of impairment and provisions for credit risk has been integrated (see Note 1).\n\n## ADDITIONAL CRITERION OF TRANSFER TO UNDERPERFORMING LOANS\n\nSociete  Generale  made  also  an  additional  analysis  on  the  loan portfolios  for  which  a  significant  increase  in  credit  risk  has  been observed  since  their  granting.  This  analysis  resulted  in  additional transfers  to  underperforming  loans  category  of  loans  granted  to sectors particularly affected by the Covid-19 crisis and granted before the crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## IMPAIRMENT FOR CREDIT RISK NOTE 2.6.1.1\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nThe value of impairment allowance for doubtful outstandings is equal to the difference between the gross carrying amount of the asset and the present value of the estimated future recoverable cash flows, taking into account any guarantees, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Furthermore, the amount of this impairment may not be less than the full amount of the interest not collected on the doubtful loan.\n\nThe effects of financial guarantees received to compensate losses on a portfolio of loans are recorded among assets impairment.\n\nThe impairment allowances, impairment reversals, losses on bad debts and recoveries of impaired debts are recognised under 'Cost of risk', along with write-backs of impairment linked to the passage of time.\n\nDoubtful loans can be reclassified as performing loans once the proven credit risk has been definitively eliminated and regular payments have resumed according to the original  terms  of  the  contract.  Similarly,  the  doubtful  loans  that  have  been  restructured  can  be  reclassified  as performing loans. When a loan is restructured, any difference between the cash flows expected to be received under the initial terms of the contract and the present value of the future flows of capital and interest expected to be received under the new terms, is discounted at the original effective interest rate.\n\nThe  amount  deducted  is  recognised  under  'Cost  of  risk'.  If  the  restructured  loan  is  subsequently  reclassified  as  a  performing  loan,  this deduction is reincorporated into net interest income over the remaining term of the loan.\n\nWhen a borrower's solvency is such that after the loan has been classified as doubtful for a reasonable period, it is not foreseeable that it will be reclassified as a performing loan, this loan is identified as a non-performing loan. A loan is classified as non-performing once the bank has formally demanded payment, or when the contract is terminated and in any case one year after it was classified as doubtful, except where the original terms of the contract have been respected or where the loan is covered by guarantees which ensure its recovery. Loans that have been restructured and for which the borrower has not respected the new conditions are also classified as non-performing.\n\n| (In EURm)      | Amount as at 31.12.2020   | Net cost of risk   | Other income statement   | Used Reversals   | Change in scope and reclassifying   | Amount as at 31.12.2021   |\n|----------------|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Banks          | 20                        | 1                  | -                        | -                | -                                   | 21                        |\n| Customer loans | 2,594                     | 182                | -                        | (449)            | 30                                  | 2,357                     |\n| Other          | 78                        | -                  | 5                        | -                | -                                   | 83                        |\n| TOTAL (1)      | 2,692                     | 183                | 5                        | (449)            | 30                                  | 2,461                     |\n\n- Of which impairment for non-performing loans: EUR/uni00A01,741/uni00A0million.

Accordingly, the amount of impairment equals to the present value of the expected credit losses, taking into account the probability of a default event occurring within the next 12/uni00A0months and if any, the impact of collateral called up or liable to be called up.\n\nMoreover,  identification,  amongst  homogeneous  portfolios,  of  a  significant  deterioration  of  the  credit  risk  leads  to  the  recognition  of  a provision for the amount of credit losses that are expected to incur on those underperforming outstandings over the life of the exposures (lifetime expected credit loss).\n\nLifetime expected credit losses are calculated taking into consideration past data, the present situation and reasonable forecasts of changes in  economic conditions and relevant macroeconomic factors through to maturity. Accordingly, the amount of impairment is equal to the present value of the expected credit losses, taking into account the probability of a default event occurring through to maturity, and, if need be, the impact of collateral called up or liable to be called up.\n\nChanges in collective provisions for credit risk are recorded under 'Cost of risk'.\n\nComments related to the identification of the downgrading of credit risk:\n\nTo identify the exposures covered by the collective provision for credit risk, Societe Generale determines whether or not there is a significant increase  in  credit  risk  based  on  the  available  historical  and  prospective  information  (behaviour  scoring,  loan  to  value  indicators, macro-economic scenarios,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nThe assessment of changes in credit risk takes account of the following criteria:\n\n- 1 st /uni00A0criterion: changes in the counterparty's credit rating (where it is the subject of an internal analysis) as well as the changes in its operating p sector, in macroeconomic conditions and in the behaviours of the counterparty that may be a sign of deteriorating credit risk;\n- 2 nd /uni00A0criterion: changes in the default probability contract by contract, from origination date to closing date; p\n- 3 rd /uni00A0criterion: the existence of amounts past due of more than 30/uni00A0days. p\n\nAs soon as one of these criteria is met, the relative contract is impaired as described before.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

These saving schemes combine an initial phase when deposits are made in specific interest-earning savings account, followed by a lending phase where the deposits are used to provide mortgage loans to the depositors, on regulated terms and conditions, both phases being inseparable. Both the savings deposits collected and the loans granted are recognised at amortised cost.\n\nThese instruments create two types of commitments for Societe Generale: the obligation to subsequently lend to the customer at an interest rate established at the inception of the savings agreement and the obligation to remunerate customer savings for an indeterminate future period at an interest rate also established at the inception of the mortgage savings agreement.\n\nAs if it is clear that commitments under the PEL/CEL agreements will have negative consequences for the Company: a provision is recorded on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. Any change in these provisions is recognised as net banking income under 'Net interest income'. These provisions only relate to commitments arising from PEL/CEL that are outstanding at the date of calculation.\n\nProvisions are calculated for each generation of mortgage savings plans (PEL), with no netting between the different PEL generations, and for all mortgage saving accounts (CEL) which constitute a single generation.\n\nDuring  the  deposits  phase,  the  underlying  commitment  used  to  determine  the  amount  to  be  provisioned  is  calculated  as  the  difference between the average expected amount of deposits and the minimum expected amount. These two amounts are determined statistically on the basis of historical observed past customer behaviour.\n\nDuring the lending phase, the underlying commitment to be provisioned includes loans already granted but not yet drawn at the date of calculation,  and  future  loans  that  are  considered  statistically  probable  based  on  the  amount  of  balance  sheet  deposits  at  the  date  of calculation on one side and on the historical observed past customer behaviour on the other.\n\nA provision is recorded if the discounted value of the expected future earnings for a given generation of PEL/CEL is negative. Earnings are estimated based on the interest rates offered to individual customers for equivalent savings and loan instruments (with similar estimated life and date of inception).\n\n|",

Since the long-term rates were low during 2021, the provisions for PEL and CEL mortgage  saving  accounts  are  linked  to  the  risks  attached  to  the commitment  to  remunerate  the  deposits.  Provisioning  for  PEL/CEL savings amounted to 1.62% of total outstandings as at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02021.\n\n## METHODS USED TO ESTABLISH THE PARAMETERS FOR VALUING PROVISIONS\n\nThe parameters used for estimating the future behaviour of customers are  derived  from  historical  observations  of  customer  behaviour patterns over a long period (more than 10/uni00A0years). The values of these parameters  can  be  adjusted  whenever  changes  are  made  to regulations that may undermine the effectiveness of past data as an indicator of future customer behaviour.\n\nThe  values  of  the  various  market  parameters  used,  notably  interest rates and margins, are calculated on the basis of observable data and constitute a best estimate, at the date of valuation, of the future value of  these  items  for  the  periods  in  question,  in  line  with  the  Retail Banking division's policy of interest rate risk management.\n\nThe  discount  rates  used  are  derived  from  the  zero  coupon  swaps vs ./uni00A0Euribor  yield  curve  on  valuation  date,  averaged  over  a  12-month period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For  listed  securities,  the  realisable  value  is  defined  as  the  most  recent  market  price. Unrealised capital gains are not recognised in the accounts but an impairment of portfolio securities is recorded to cover unrealised capital losses, without this impairment being offset against any unrealised capital gains.\n\n## BONDS AND OTHER DEBT SECURITIES\n\nAt year-end, cost is compared to realisable value or, in the case of listed securities, to their most recent market price. Unrealised capital gains are not recognised in the accounts but a impairment of portfolio securities is recorded to cover unrealised capital losses, after consideration of any gains made on any related hedging transactions.\n\nAllocations to and reversals of impairment for losses on short-term investment securities together with gains and losses on sales of these securities are recorded under 'Net income' from short-term investment securities in the income statement.\n\n## Long-term investment securities\n\nAt year-end, no impairment is made for unrealised losses, unless there is a strong probability that the securities will be sold in the short term, or unless there is a risk that the issuer will be unable to redeem them.\n\nAllocations to and reversals of impairment for losses on long-term investment securities, together with gains and losses on sales of these securities, are recorded in the income statement under 'Net income' from long-term investments.\n\n## Affiliates, other long term securities and investments in related parties\n\nAt  year-end,  affiliates,  other  long-term  securities  and  investments  in  related  parties  are  valued  at  their  value  in  use,  namely  the  price  the Company would accept to pay to obtain the said securities if it had to acquire them in view of its investment objective. This value is estimated on  the  basis  of  various  criteria,  such  as  shareholders'  equity,  profitability  (based  on  the  business  plans  defined  by  the  entities),  and  the average share price over the last three months. Unrealised capital gains are not recognised in the accounts but an impairment on portfolio securities  is  recorded  to  cover  unrealised  capital  losses.

Arrangement fees are recorded in income when the placement is legally complete.\n\n|                                                                  | 2021   | 2021    | 2021   | 2020   | 2020    | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|---------|--------|\n| (In EURm)                                                        | Income | Expense | Net    | Income | Expense | Net    |\n| Transactions with banks                                          | 86     | (43)    | 44     | 95     | (62)    | 33     |\n| Transactions with customers                                      | 1,595  | (27)    | 1,567  | 1,436  | (27)    | 1,409  |\n| Securities transactions                                          | 449    | (999)   | (550)  | 418    | (846)   | (428)  |\n| Primary market transactions                                      | 103    | -       | 103    | 83     | -       | 83     |\n| Foreign exchange transactions and forward financial  instruments | 265    | (408)   | (143)  | 232    | (404)   | (172)  |\n| Loan and guarantee commitments                                   | 840    | (401)   | 439    | 757    | (360)   | 397    |\n| Services                                                         | 1,594  | -       | 1,594  | 1,443  | -       | 1,443  |\n| Other                                                            | -      | (291)   | (291)  | -      | (221)   | (221)  |\n| TOTAL                                                            | 4,932  | (2,169) | 2,763  | 4,464  | (1,920) | 2,544  |\n\n## Accruals, other assets and liabilities NOTE 3.2\n\n## ACCRUALS, OTHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES AND OTHER ASSETS NOTE 3.2.1\n\n| (In EURm)                                                               | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Other assets                                                            | 136,990      | 148,148      |\n| Guarantee deposits paid (1)                                             | 44,834       | 42,202       |\n| Miscellaneous receivables                                               | 3,157        | 2,445        |\n| Premiums on options purchased                                           | 87,172       | 101,934      |\n| Settlement accounts on securities transactions                          | 1,709        | 1,447        |\n| Other                                                                   | 118          | 120          |\n| Accruals and similar                                                    | 40,757       | 60,731       |\n| Prepaid expenses                                                        | 406          | 384          |\n| Deferred taxes                                                          | 3,073        | 3,299        |\n| Accrued income                                                          | 1,183        | 1,162        |\n| Other (2)                                                               | 36,095       | 55,886       |\n| Accruals, other accounts receivables and other assets before impairment | 177,747      | 208,879      |\n| Impairment                                                              | (84)         | (78)         |\n| TOTAL                                                                   | 177,663      | 208,801      |\n\n- Mainly relates to guarantee deposits paid on financial instruments.

        "page_content": "## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\nPension plans may be defined contribution or defined benefit plans.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nDefined contribution plans limit the liability of Societe Generale to contributions paid into the plan but do not commit the bank to a specific level of future benefits. The contributions paid are recorded as an expense for the current year.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nDefined  benefit  plans  commit  Societe  Generale,  either  formally  or  constructively,  to  pay  a  certain  amount  or  level  of  future  benefits  and therefore bear the medium- or long-term risk. The present value of defined benefit obligations is valued by independent qualified actuaries.\n\nProvisions are recognised on the liability side of the balance sheet under 'Provisions' to cover all of these retirement obligations. They are regularly  assessed  by  independent  actuaries  using  the  projected  unit  credit  method.  This  valuation  technique  incorporates  assumptions about demographics, early retirement, salary rises and discount and inflation rates.\n\nSociete Generale can choose to finance defined benefit plans by assets held in a long-term employee benefit fund or by qualifying insurance policies.\n\nFunding assets are classified as plan assets if these assets are held by an entity (a fund) that is legally separate from the reporting entity and are only intended to pay employee benefits.\n\nWhen these plans are financed from external funds classified as plan assets, the fair value of these funds is subtracted from the provision to cover the benefit obligations.\n\nWhen these plans are financed from funds not classified as plan assets, these funds, classified as separate assets, are displayed separately on the asset side of the balance sheet.\n\nDifferences  arising  from  changes  in  calculation  assumptions  (early  retirements,  discount  rates,  etc.)  or  differences  between  actuarial assumptions and real performance (return on plan assets) are recognised as actuarial gains or losses. They are recorded immediately and in full in the income statement.\n\nWhere a new or amended plan comes into force the cost of past services is recorded immediately and in full in the income statement.\n\nAn annual expense is recorded under 'Personnel expenses' for defined benefit plans, consisting of:\n\n- the additional entitlements vested by each employee (current service cost); p\n- the financial expense resulting from the discount rate; p\n- the expected return on plan assets (gross return); p\n- the actuarial gains and losses and past service cost; p\n- the settlement or curtailment of plans. p\n\n## Other long-term benefits\n\nOther long-term employee benefits are those that are payable to employees for services rendered during their employment, but which are not expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of the annual reporting period in which the employees render the related service. Other long-term benefits are measured in the same way as post-employment benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## TAXES NOTE 5\n\n## ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\n\n## Current taxes\n\nIn the financial year 1989, Societe Generale opted to apply a tax consolidation regime. As at 31/uni00A0December 2021, 213/uni00A0subsidiaries had signed a tax  consolidation agreement with Societe Generale. Each of the integrated companies shall record in its accounts the tax debt to Societe Generale, determined in accordance with the application of the tax consolidation agreement.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nSociete Generale applies the option allowing it to recognise deferred taxes in its annual financial statements.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised whenever Societe Generale identifies a temporary difference between the book value and tax value of balance sheet assets and liabilities. They are calculated using the liability method, whereby the deferred taxes from previous years are adjusted to account for a change in tax rates. The impact of such change is recorded in the income statement under deferred taxes. Net deferred tax assets are recorded only if the entity concerned is likely to recover these assets within a set timeframe.\n\nDeferred  taxes  are  determined  separately  for  each  taxable  entity  (parent  company  and  foreign  branches)  and  are  never  discounted  to present/uni00A0value.\n\n## Income tax NOTE 5.1\n\n| (In EURm)      | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Current taxes  | 305    | 533    |\n| Deferred taxes | (280)  | (674)  |\n| TOTAL          | 25     | (141)  |\n\n2021 income tax includes a loss of EUR/uni00A07/uni00A0million related to the effect of the  tax  consolidation  compared  to  a  loss  of  EUR/uni00A048/uni00A0million  for  2020 (213/uni00A0subsidiaries included in the tax group in 2021 compared to 222 in 2020).The  loss  of  tax  integration,  mostly  related  to  the  tax  rates applicable  to  the  re-billings  of  subsidiaries,  decreased  in  2021  as  a result  of  the  smaller  gap  between  the  tax  rate  applicable  to  entities whose turnover is less than EUR/uni00A0250/uni00A0million and the tax rate applicable to the tax group.\n\nIn compliance with the French tax provisions that define the ordinary corporate tax rate, the latter will be lowered to 25% in 2022 (article/uni00A0219 of the French Tax Code) plus the existing national contribution (CSB) of 3.3%, i.e., a compound tax rate of 25.83%.\n\nFor fiscal year running from 1/uni00A0January 2021 to 31/uni00A0December 2021, for liable companies  with  a  turnover  equal  to  or  greater  than EUR/uni00A0250/uni00A0million, the  ordinary  tax  rate  is  27.5%,  plus  the  existing national contribution (CSB) of 3.3%.\n\nLong-term capital gains on equity investments are exempt, subject to taxation of a portion of fees and expenses at the full statutory tax rate. This portion of fees and expenses is 12% of gross capital gains only if the Company realises a net long-term capital gain.\n\nFurthermore,  under  the  parent-subsidiary  regime,  dividends  from companies in which Societe Generale's equity interest is  at  least  5% are  tax  exempt,  subject  to  the  taxation  of  a  portion  of  fees  and expenses of 1% or 5% at the full statutory tax rate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

For this  purpose,  the  tax  results  are  determined  based  on  the  projected performance of the businesses. This performance corresponds to the estimated budget (scenario SG Central) over four years (from 2022 to 2025) extrapolated to 2026, which corresponds to a 'normative' year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese budgets notably take into account the impacts of  the  commitments  to  energy  and  environmental transition and  regional  development  which  are detailed in the Declaration of Non-Financial Performance.\n\nThe  tax  results  also  take  into  consideration  the  accounting  and  tax adjustments  (including  the  reversal  of  the  deferred  tax  assets  and liabilities  bases  on  temporary  differences)  applicable  to  the  entities and jurisdictions concerned. These adjustments are determined on the\n\nbasis  of  historical  tax  results  and  on  the  entity's  tax  expertise.  An extrapolation of the tax result is performed from 2026 on and over a timeframe considered reasonable and depending on the nature of the activities carried out within each tax entity.\n\nOn principle, the appreciation of the macro-economic factors selected and the  internal  estimates  used  to  determine  the  tax  results  involve risks and uncertainties about their materialisation over the estimated timeframe  for  thartice  absorption  of  the  losses.  These  risks  and uncertainties are especially related to possible changes in applicable tax rules (computation of the tax result, as well as allocation rules for tax loss carry-forwards)  or  materialization  of  the  assumptions selected.  These  uncertainties  are  mitigated  by  robustness  checks  of the budgetary and strategic assumptions.\n\nThe  updated  projections  show  that  the  Societe  Generale's  activated tax  loss-carry  forwards  may  likely  be  used  against  its  future  taxable income.\n\n|",

Consequently,  the  unrecognised  portion  of deferred  tax  assets  on  the  French  tax  group  has  been  reduced  by EUR/uni00A0130/uni00A0million.\n\nAt  the  same time, defered tax assets of the United States of America tax  group  decreased  by  EUR/uni00A014/uni00A0million  due  to  the  recognition  of EUR/uni00A037/uni00A0million  of  unrecognised  differed  tax  and  a  foreign  exchange effect of EUR/uni00A0-23/uni00A0million.\n\nWith regard to the tax treatment of the loss caused by the actions of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, Societe Generale considers that the judgment of the Versailles  Court  of  Appeal  of  23/uni00A0September  2016  does  not  call  into question its validity in light of the 2011 opinion of the French Supreme Administrative Court (Conseil d'\u00c9tat) and its established case law which was  recently  confirmed  again  in  this  regard.  Consequently,  Societe Generale  considers  that  the  related  tax  loss  remains  recoverable against the future taxable income (see Note/uni00A08).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The purchase price of fixed assets include borrowing costs incurred to fund a lengthy construction period, along with all other  directly  attributable  expenses.  Software  created  in-house  is  recognised  for  its  direct  cost  of  development,  that  includes  external expenditure on hardware and services and personnel costs directly attributable to the production and the preparation of the asset for use.\n\nAs soon as they are ready for use, tangible assets are depreciated using a component-based approach. Each component is depreciated over its own useful life.\n\nFor operating premises and investment property, the depreciation periods of the different components are between 10 to 50/uni00A0years.\n\n| Infrastructure          | Major structures                          | 50/uni00A0years             |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| /uni00A0                | Doors and windows, roofing                | 20/uni00A0years             |\n| /uni00A0                | Fa\u00e7ades                                   | 30/uni00A0years             |\n| Technical installations | Lifts                                     | /uni00A0                    |\n| /uni00A0                | Electrical installations                  | /uni00A0                    |\n| /uni00A0                | Electrical generators                     | /uni00A0                    |\n| /uni00A0                | Air conditioning, extractors              | /uni00A0                    |\n| /uni00A0                | Technical wiring                          | 10/uni00A0- 30/uni00A0years |\n| /uni00A0                | Securities and surveillance installations | /uni00A0                    |\n| /uni00A0                | Plumbing                                  | /uni00A0                    |\n| /uni00A0                | Fire and safety equipment                 | /uni00A0                    |\n| Fixtures and fittings   | Finishing, surroundings                   | 10/uni00A0years             |\n\nFor  the  other  fixed  assets,  depreciation  periods  have  been  defined  based  on  the  useful  life  of  the  assets  considered  which  is  generally estimated between 3 to 20/uni00A0years.\n\n| Plant and equipment                  | 5/uni00A0years     |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Transport                            | 4/uni00A0years     |\n| Furniture                            | 10-20/uni00A0years |\n| Office equipment                     | 5-10/uni00A0years  |\n| IT equipment                         | 3-5/uni00A0years   |\n| Software, developed or acquired      | 3-5/uni00A0years   |\n| Concessions, patents, licences, etc. | 5-20/uni00A0years  |\n\nIf any, the depreciable value of each asset or component is reduced for its residual value. In the event of a subsequent decrease or increase of the residual value initially retained, the adjustment of the depreciable base shall affect the depreciation or amortisation plan of the asset prospectively.\n\nDepreciation or amortisation allowances are recognised in the income statement under 'Impairment, amortisation and depreciation'.\n\nGains or losses on disposal of operating assets are recorded in Net gains or losses on other assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

In  this  complex  legal context,  Societe  Generale  and  some  of  its  former  and  current representatives  may  be  involved  in  various  legal  actions,  including civil,  administrative  and  criminal  proceedings.  The  vast  majority  of these proceedings are part of Societe Generale's current business. In recent  years,  litigation  with  investors  and  the  number  of  disputes involving  financial  intermediaries  such  as  banks  and  investment advisors has increased, partly due to a difficult financial environment.\n\nIt  is  by nature difficult to foresee the outcome of disputes, regulatory proceedings and acts involving Societe Generale entities, particularly if they are initiated by various categories of complainants, if the amount of  claims  for  damages  is  not  specified  or  is  indeterminate  or  if  the proceedings have no precedent.\n\nIn  preparing  its  financial  statements,  Societe  Generale  assesses  the consequences  of  the  legal,  regulatory  or  arbitration  proceedings  in which  it  is  involved.  A  provision  is  booked  when  losses  from  these proceedings  become  probable  and  the  amount  can  be  estimated reliably.\n\nTo assess the probability of losses and the amount of these losses, and thus to determine the amount of provisions to book, estimations are important.  Management  makes  these  estimates  by  exercising  its judgement  and  taking  into  account  all  information  available  when financial  statements  are  prepared.  In  particular,  Societe  Generale takes  into  account  the  nature  of  the  dispute,  the  underlying  facts, ongoing proceedings and court rulings already handed down, as well as its experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar cases (assuming that Societe Generale has knowledge thereof) and,  where  appropriate,  the  opinion  and  reports  of  experts  and independent legal advisers.\n\nEach quarter, Societe Generale carries out a detailed examination of pending  disputes  that  present  a  significant  risk.  These  disputes  are described in the Note/uni00A08 'Information on risks and litigation'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Outright  forward  foreign exchange transactions and those used to hedge other forward foreign exchange transactions are valued on the basis of the forward foreign exchange rate of  the  relevant  currency  for  the  remaining  maturity.  Spot  and  other  forward  foreign  exchange  positions  are  revalued  on  a monthly  basis  using  official  month-end  spot  rates.  unrealized  gains  and  losses  are  recognised  in  the  income  statement.  premiums  and discounts resulting from hedged forward foreign exchange transactions are amortized to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the remaining maturity of these transactions.\n\n## 31.12.2021\n\n## 31.12.2020\n\n|                  | Foreign   | Foreign     | Foreign                                   | Foreign                                  | Foreign   | Foreign     | Foreign                           | Foreign                                  |\n|------------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| (In EURm)        | Assets    | Liabilities | Foreign exchange bought, not yet received | Foreign exchange sold, not yet delivered | Assets    | Liabilities | exchange bought, not yet received | Foreign exchange sold, not yet delivered |\n| EUR              | 613,387   | 615,135     | 373,684                                   | 361,197                                  | 620,409   | 622,164     | 312,707                           | 294,432                                  |\n| USD              | 410,505   | 408,844     | 711,327                                   | 696,403                                  | 375,744   | 374,715     | 535,170                           | 505,931                                  |\n| GBP              | 64,809    | 65,439      | 177,947                                   | 172,373                                  | 74,531    | 75,098      | 167,163                           | 172,862                                  |\n| JPY              | 43,542    | 42,886      | 76,804                                    | 86,614                                   | 75,144    | 74,252      | 58,996                            | 76,705                                   |\n| Other currencies | 105,053   | 104,992     | 430,353                                   | 437,961                                  | 112,214   | 111,813     | 240,199                           | 254,400                                  |\n| TOTAL            | 1,237,296 | 1,237,296   | 1,770,115                                 | 1,754,548                                | 1,258,042 | 1,258,042   | 1,314,235                         | 1,304,330                                |\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## INFORMATION ON RISKS AND LITIGATION NOTE 8\n\nEvery  quarter,  Societe  Generale  reviews  in  detail  the  disputes presenting a significant risk. These disputes may lead to the recording of a provision if it becomes probable or certain that Societe Generale will  incur  an  outflow  of  resources  for  the  benefit  of  a  third  party without  receiving  at  least  the  equivalent  value  in  exchange.  These provisions  for  litigations  are  classified  among  the  Other  provisions included in the Provisions item in the liabilities of the balance-sheet.\n\nNo detailed information can be disclosed on either the recording or the amount of a specific provision given that such disclosure would likely seriously prejudice the outcome of the disputes in question.\n\n- On 24/uni00A0October 2012, the Court of Appeal of Paris confirmed the first p judgment  delivered  on  5/uni00A0October  2010,  finding  J.  Kerviel  guilty  of breach of trust, fraudulent insertion of data into a computer system, forgery  and  use  of  forged  documents.  J.  Kerviel  was  sentenced  to serve  a  prison  sentence  of  five  years,  two  years  of  which  are suspended,  and  was  ordered  to  pay  EUR/uni00A04.9/uni00A0billion  in  damages  to the  bank.  On  19/uni00A0March  2014,  the  Supreme  Court  confirmed  the criminal  liability  of  J.  Kerviel.  This  decision  puts  an  end  to  the criminal proceedings. On the civil front, on 23/uni00A0September 2016, the Versailles Court of Appeal rejected J. Kerviel's request for an expert determination  of  the  damage  suffered  by  Societe  Generale,  and therefore confirmed that the net accounting losses suffered by the Bank as a result of his criminal conduct amount to EUR/uni00A04.9/uni00A0billion. It also declared J. Kerviel partially responsible for the damage caused to Societe Generale and sentenced him to pay to Societe Generale EUR/uni00A01/uni00A0million. Societe Generale and J. Kerviel did not appeal before the  Supreme  Court.  Societe  Generale  considers  that  this  decision has  no  impact  on  its  tax  situation.  However,  as  indicated  by  the Minister  of  the  Economy  and  Finance  in  September/uni00A02016,  the  tax authorities  have  examined  the  tax  consequences  of  this  book  loss and  indicated  that  they  intended  to  call  into  question  the deductibility  of  the  loss  caused  by  the  actions  of  J.  Kerviel, amounting to EUR/uni00A04.9/uni00A0billion. This proposed tax rectification has no immediate  effect  and  will  possibly  have  to  be  confirmed  by  an adjustment notice sent by the tax authorities when Societe Generale is in a position to deduct the tax loss carry forwards arising from the loss  from  its  taxable  income.  Such  a  situation  will  not  occur  for several years according to the bank's forecasts. In view of the 2011 opinion of the French Supreme Administrative Court (Conseil d'\u00c9tat) and its established case law which was recently confirmed again in this  regard,  Societe  Generale  considers  that  there  is  no  need  to provision  the  corresponding  deferred  tax  assets.  In  the  event  that the  authorities  decide,  in  due  course,  to  confirm  their  current position, Societe Generale will not fail to assert its rights before the competent courts. By a decision handed down on the 20/uni00A0September 2018, the Investigation Committee of the reviewing and reassessment Criminal Court has furthermore declared inadmissible the  request  filed  in  May/uni00A02015  by  J.  Kerviel  against  his  criminal sentence, confirming the absence of any new element or fact that could justify the reopening of the criminal file.\n\nSociete Generale. In the action brought by Societe Generale against Goldas in the UK, Goldas applied to have the action of SG struck-out and applied to  the  UK  court  for  damages.  On  3/uni00A0April  2017,  the  UK court  granted  both  applications  and  will,  after  an  inquiry  into damages, rule on the amount due to Goldas, if any. On 15/uni00A0May 2018, the  Court  of  Appeal  discharged  entirely  the  inquiry  into  damages granted by the High Court to Goldas but rejected Societe Generale's arguments relating  to  service  of  the  claims  issued  against  Goldas, which  are  therefore  time-barred.  On  18/uni00A0December  2018,  the Supreme  Court  refused  permission  to  appeal  to  both  Societe Generale  and  Goldas.  On  16/uni00A0February  2017,  the  Paris  Commercial Court dismissed Societe Generale's claims against its insurers.\n\n- In the early 2000s, the French banking industry decided to transition to p a  new  digital  system  in  order  to  streamline  cheque  clearing.  To support this reform (known as EIC -/uni00A0 \u00c9change d'Images Ch\u00e8ques ), which has contributed to the improvement of cheque payments security and to the fight against fraud, the banks established several interbank fees (including  the  CEIC  which  was  abolished  in  2007).  These  fees  were implemented  under  the  aegis  of  the  banking  sector  supervisory authorities, and to the knowledge of the public authorities.\n\nOn 20/uni00A0September 2010, the French competition authority ruled that the joint implementation and the setting of the amount of the CEIC and  of  two  additional  fees  for  related  services  were  in  breach  of competition  law.  The  authority  fined  all  the  participants  to  the agreement (including the Banque de France) a total of approximately  EUR/uni00A0385/uni00A0million.  On  2/uni00A0December  2021,  after  several years of proceedings and two decisions of the Supreme Court, the Paris  Court  of  Appeal  overturned  the  decision  of  the  French competition authority and ruled that (i)/uni00A0it  was  not  proven  that  the establishment of the CEIC and the fees for related services on AOCT (cancellation  of  wrongly  cleared  transactions)  as  well  as  their collection  had  infringed  the  provisions  of  Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0420-1  of  the French  Commercial  Code  and  of  Article/uni00A0101  of  the  Treaty  on  the Functioning  of  the  European  Union  and,  (ii)/uni00A0that  its  decision  was giving rise to a right of restitution of the sums paid in execution of the overturned  decision  approximatively  EUR/uni00A053.5/uni00A0million for Societe  Generale  with  interests  at  the  legal  rate.  On  31/uni00A0December 2021,  the  French  competition  authority  filed  an  appeal  before  the Supreme court against this decision.\n\n- Notwithstanding  the  agreements  reached  with  the  US  authorities p regarding  certain  London  Interbank  Offered  Rates  and  the  Euro Interbank  Offered  Rate  ('the  IBOR  matter'),  the  dismissal  on 30/uni00A0November  2021  of  the  legal  proceedings  brought  by  the  DOJ  in this  matter,  the  Bank  continues  to  defend  civil  proceedings  in  the United  States  (as  described  below)  and  has  responded  to information requests received from other authorities, including the Attorneys General of various States of the United States and the New York Department of Financial Services.\n- Between 2003 and 2008, Societe Generale set up gold consignment p lines  with  the  Turkish  group  Goldas.  In  February/uni00A02008,  Societe Generale was alerted to a risk of fraud and embezzlement of gold stocks  held  by  Goldas.  These  suspicions  were  rapidly  confirmed following  the  failure  by  Goldas  to  pay  or  refund  gold  worth EUR/uni00A0466.4/uni00A0million. Societe  Generale  brought  civil  proceedings against  its  insurers  and  various  Goldas  group  entities.  Goldas launched  various  proceedings  in  Turkey  and  in  the  UK  against\n\nIn  the  United  States,  Societe  Generale,  along  with  other  financial institutions,  has  been  named  as  a  defendant  in  putative  class actions involving the setting of US Dollar Libor, Japanese Yen Libor, and Euribor rates and trading in instruments indexed to those rates. Societe  Generale  has  also  been  named  in  several  individual (non-class) actions concerning the US Dollar Libor rate. All of these actions  are  pending  in  the  US  District  Court  in  Manhattan  (the 'District Court').\n\n|",

The class plaintiffs and a number of  individual  plaintiffs  appealed  the  dismissal  of  their  antitrust claims to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ('Second  Circuit').  On  30/uni00A0December  2021,  the  Second  Circuit reversed  the  dismissal  and  reinstated  the  antitrust  claims.  These reinstated  claims  include  those  asserted  by  a  proposed  class  of over-the-counter  (OTC)  plaintiffs  and  by  OTC  plaintiffs  that  have filed individual actions.\n\nAs to Japanese Yen Libor, the District Court dismissed the complaint brought  by  purchasers  of  Euroyen  over-the-counter  derivative products. On 1/uni00A0April  2020,  the  Second  Circuit  reversed  the  dismissal and reinstated the claims. On 30/uni00A0September 2021, the District Court dismissed plaintiffs' Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act claims but upheld plaintiffs' antitrust and state law claims against Societe Generale. In the other action, brought by purchasers or sellers of Euroyen derivative contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on 27/uni00A0September 2019, plaintiff filed a motion for class certification. On 25/uni00A0September 2020, the District Court granted defendants' motion for  judgment  on  the  pleadings  and  dismissed  plaintiffs'  remaining claims. Plaintiff has appealed to the Second Circuit.\n\nAs to Euribor, the District Court dismissed all claims against Societe Generale  in  the  putative  class  action  and  denied  the  plaintiffs' motion  to  file  a  proposed  amended  complaint.  Plaintiffs  have appealed those rulings to the Second Circuit.\n\nIn Argentina, Societe Generale along with other financial institutions, has been named as a defendant in litigation brought by a consumer association on behalf of Argentine consumers who held government bonds or other specified instruments that paid interest tied  to  US  Dollar  Libor.  The  allegations  concern  violations  of Argentine  consumer  protection  law  in  connection  with  alleged manipulation of the US Dollar Libor rate. Societe Generale has not yet been served with the complaint in this matter.\n\n- Beginning  on  15/uni00A0January  2019,  Societe  Generale  along  with  other p financial  institutions,  have  been  named  in  three  putative  antitrust class actions in the US District Court in Manhattan, which have since been  consolidated.  Plaintiffs  allege  that  the  USD/uni00A0ICE  Libor  panel banks  conspired  to  make  artificially  low  submissions  to  that benchmark in order to profit on their trading in derivatives tied to USD/uni00A0ICE  Libor.  Plaintiffs  seek  to  certify  a  class  comprised  of  US residents (individuals and entities) that transacted with a defendant in  floating  rate  debt  instruments  or  interest  rate  swaps  tied  to USD/uni00A0ICE Libor  and  received  a  payment  at  any  time  between 1/uni00A0February  2014  to  the  present,  regardless  of  when  the  instrument was  purchased.  By  order  dated  26/uni00A0March  2020,  the  District  Court dismissed the action. Plaintiffs have appealed that ruling. On 6/uni00A0April 2021, the Second  Circuit  permitted  a  new  proposed  class representative to intervene as a plaintiff  in  the  appeal  and  denied defendants' motion which sought dismissal of the appeal because the  original  proposed  class  representatives  withdrew  from  the action.\n- Societe Generale along with several other financial institutions, was p named as a defendant in a putative class action alleging violations of US antitrust laws and the CEA in connection with foreign exchange spot and derivatives trading. The action was brought by persons or entities that transacted in certain over-the-counter and exchange-traded  foreign  exchange  instruments.  Societe  Generale reached a settlement of USD/uni00A018/uni00A0million, which was approved by the Court on 6/uni00A0August 2018. On 7/uni00A0November 2018, a group of individual entities  that  elected  to  opt  out  of  the  settlement  filed  a  lawsuit against  Societe  Generale  and  several  other  financial  institutions. Societe  Generale  was  dismissed  by  order  dated  28/uni00A0May  2020. Discovery  is  proceeding  as  to  Societe  Generale  and  the  other\n\nremaining defendants. On 11/uni00A0November 2020, Societe Generale was named,  along  with  several  other  banks,  in  a  UK  action  alleging collusion  in  the  market  for  FX  instruments.  Societe  Generale  is defending the action.\n\n- On  10/uni00A0December  2012,  the  French  Supreme  Administrative  Court p (Conseil d'\u00c9tat) rendered  two  decisions  confirming  that  the pr\u00e9compte tax  which  used  to  be  levied  on  corporations  in  France does  not  comply  with  EU  law  and  defined  a  methodology  for  the reimbursement  of  the  amounts  levied  by  the  tax  authorities. However, such methodology considerably reduces the amount to be reimbursed.  Societe  Generale  purchased  in  2005  the  'pr\u00e9compte tax' claims of two companies (Rhodia and Suez, now ENGIE) with a limited  recourse  on  the  selling  companies.  One  of  the  above decisions  of  the  French  Supreme  Administrative  Court  relates  to Rhodia.  Societe  Generale  has  brought  proceedings  before  the French administrative courts.\n\nSeveral  French  companies  applied  to  the  European  Commission, who  considered  that  the  decisions  handed  down  by  the  French Supreme  Administrative  Court  on  10/uni00A0December  2012,  which  was supposed  to  implement  the  decision  rendered  by  the  Court  of Justice  of  the  European  Union  C-310/09  on  15/uni00A0September  2011, infringed  a  number  of  principles  of  European  law.  The  European Commission  subsequently brought infringement proceedings against  the  French  Republic  in  November/uni00A02014,  and  since  then confirmed its position by publishing a reasoned opinion on 28/uni00A0April 2016  and  by  referring  the  matter  to  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the European  Union  on  8/uni00A0December  2016.  The  Court  of  Justice  of European  Union  rendered  its  judgement  on  4/uni00A0October  2018  and sentenced France for failure by the French Supreme Administrative Court to disregard the tax on EU sub-subsidiaries in order to secure the withholding tax paid in error as well as on the absence of any preliminary  question.  With  regard  to  the  practical  implementation of the decision, Societe Generale has continued to assert its rights with the competent courts and the tax authorities, which it expects to be treated diligently and in accordance with the law. On 23/uni00A0June 2020, the Administrative Court of Appeal of Versailles issued a ruling in  favour  of  Societe  Generale  on  our  2002  and  2003  Suez  claims, followed by a mid-July enforcement in our favour. The judgment of Versailles held that the advance payment was not compatible with the Parent-Subsidiary Directive: the French Supreme Administrative Court, which had also received a request for a priority question of constitutionality,  also  pointed  out  that  the  advance  payment  was incompatible  with  Article/uni00A04  of  the  Parent-Subsidiary  Directive  but that a question should be referred to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling in  order  to  ascertain  this.  It  is  therefore  now  appropriate  to  await the response of the Court of Luxembourg, which should not occur before the beginning of 2022.\n\n- Societe Generale, along with other financial institutions, was named p as  a  defendant  in  a  putative  class  action  alleging  violations  of  US antitrust laws and the CEA in connection with its involvement in the London  Gold  Market  Fixing.  The  action  is  brought  on  behalf  of persons  or  entities  that  sold  physical  gold,  sold  gold  futures contracts traded on the CME, sold shares in gold ETFs, sold gold call options traded on CME, bought gold put options traded on CME, sold over-the-counter gold spot or forward contracts or gold call options, or  bought  over-the-counter  gold  put  options.  Societe  Generale, along  with  three  other  defendants,  has  reached  a  settlement  to resolve  this  action  for  USD/uni00A050/uni00A0million.  By  order  dated  13/uni00A0January 2022, the Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The final  fairness  hearing  has  been  scheduled  for  5/uni00A0August  2022. Although Societe Generale's share of the settlement is not public, it was  not  material  from  a  financial  perspective.  Societe  Generale, along with other financial institutions, is also named as a defendant in  two  putative  class  actions  in  Canada  (in  the  Ontario  Superior Court  in  Toronto  and  Quebec  Superior  Court  in  Quebec  City) involving similar claims. Societe Generale is defending the claims.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- Since  August/uni00A02015,  various  former  and  current  employees  of  the p Societe Generale have been under investigation by German criminal prosecution and tax authorities for their alleged participation in the so  called  'CumEx'  patterns  in  connection  with  withholding  tax  on dividends on German shares. These investigations relate inter alia to a  fund  administered  by  SGSS/uni00A0GmbH  proprietary  trading  activities and transactions carried out on behalf of clients. Societe Generale respond to the requests of the German authorities.\n- Societe Generale and certain of its subsidiaries are defendants in an p action pending in the US Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan brought by the  Trustee  appointed  for  the  liquidation  of  Bernard  L.  Madoff Investment  Securities/uni00A0LLC  (BLMIS).  The  action  is  similar  to  those brought  by  the  BLMIS  Trustee  against  numerous  institutions  and seeks  recovery  of  amounts  allegedly  received  by  the  Societe Generale  indirectly  from  BLMIS  through  so-called  'feeder  funds' that  were  invested  in  BLMIS  and  from  which  the  Societe  Generale received  redemptions.  The  suit  alleges  that  the  amounts  that  the Societe Generale received are avoidable and recoverable under the US  Bankruptcy  Code  and  New  York  state  law.  The  BLMIS  Trustee seeks  to  recover,  in  the  aggregate,  approximately  USD/uni00A0150/uni00A0million from the Societe Generale. Societe Generale is defending the action. In decisions dated 22/uni00A0November 2016 and 3/uni00A0October 2018, the Court rejected  most  of  the  claims  brought  by  the  BLMIS  Trustee.  The Trustee appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. By  order  dated  25/uni00A0February  2019,  the  Second  Circuit  vacated  the judgements and remanded for further proceedings. On 1/uni00A0June 2020, the  United  States  Supreme  Court  denied  Defendant-Appellees' petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari.  The  case  is  now  before  the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings.\n- On  10/uni00A0July  2019,  Societe  Generale  was  named  as  a  defendant  in  a p litigation  filed  in  the  US  District  Court  in  Miami  by  plaintiffs  seeking compensation  under  the  Cuban  Liberty  and  Democratic  Solidarity (Libertad)  Act  of  1996  (known  as  the  Helms-Burton  Act)  stemming from  the  expropriation  by  the  Cuban  government  in  1960  of  Banco Nunez  in  which  they  are  alleged  to  have  held  an  interest.  Plaintiff claims  damages  from  Societe  Generale  under  the  terms  of  this statute. Plaintiff filed  an  amended complaint on 24/uni00A0September 2019 adding  three  other  banks  as  defendants  and  adding  several  new factual  allegations  as  to  Societe  Generale.  Societe  Generale  filed  a motion  to  dismiss,  which  was  fully  briefed  as  of  10/uni00A0January  2020. While  the  motion  to  dismiss  was  pending,  plaintiffs  filed  an unopposed motion on 29/uni00A0January 2020, to transfer the case to federal court  in  Manhattan,  which  the  court  granted  on  30/uni00A0January  2020. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on 11/uni00A0September 2020, in which  it  dropped  the  three  other  banks  as  defendants,  added  a different  bank  as  an  additional  defendant,  and  added  as  additional plaintiffs who purport to be heirs of the founders of Banco Nunez. The court granted Societe Generale's motion to dismiss on 22/uni00A0December/uni00A02021 but has permitted plaintiffs to replead their claims.\n- On 5/uni00A0June 2020, a shareholder of Societe Generale filed a derivative p action  in  New  York  State  court  against  39  current  and  former directors and officers of the Bank. The complaint alleges that a 2009 written agreement with US banking regulators required the Bank to implement  and  maintain  an  effective  anti-money  laundering compliance  and  transaction  monitoring  system.  According  to  the complaint,  the  Bank  failed  to  do  so,  leading  to  penalties  and forfeitures  imposed in November/uni00A02018  by  a  number  of  federal  and New  York  state  agencies  and  criminal  authorities  relating  to  US sanctions  and  anti-money  laundering  laws.  The  complaint  makes claims  for,  among  other  things,  breaches  of  duty  related  to  these matters. On 1/uni00A0November  2021,  a  motion  to  dismiss  on  a  variety  of grounds was filed. Thereafter, the parties stipulated to the voluntary dismissal  with  prejudice  of  the  action,  with  each  party  bearing  its own  costs.  By  order  dated  2/uni00A0December  2021,  the  court  dismissed the/uni00A0action.\n- On  16/uni00A0October  2020,  Vestia  brought  proceedings  against  Societe p Generale before the High Court of England regarding the conditions pursuant  to  which  Vestia  contracted  derivative  products  with Societe Generale between 2008 and 2011. Vestia claims that these transactions  were  outside  of  its  capacity  and  alleges  they  were induced by corruption. Vestia seeks to rescind the transactions and recover  the  amounts  paid  to  Societe  Generale  pursuant  to  these transactions. On  8/uni00A0January 2021, Societe Generale  filed its Statement  of  Defence  and  Counterclaim.  On  11/uni00A0October  2021, Societe Generale and Vestia reached an agreement to put an end to this dispute without any admission of liability for Societe Generale.\n- On  1/uni00A0June  2021,  a  shareholder  of  Societe  Generale  initiated  an p action designated by him as a 'derivative action' (action ut singuli) before  the  Commercial  Court  of  Paris  against  the  CEO  of  the Company (directeur  general), Mr./uni00A0Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Oud\u00e9a.  The  plaintiff  is seeking an order that Mr./uni00A0Oud\u00e9a pay to Societe Generale an amount equal  to  fines  paid  to  the  US  and  French  treasuries  under  the convention judiciaire d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public of 24/uni00A0May 2018 between Societe Generale  and  the  Financial  Public  Prosecutor  (the  'CJIP')  and  the Deferred  Prosecution  Agreement  of  5/uni00A0June  2018  between  Societe Generale and the United States Department of Justice (the 'DPA').\n\nSociete  Generale  voluntarily  joined  these  proceedings  at  the  first procedural hearing in order to seek the dismissal of the claims made by the plaintiff. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a brief asking the court to dismiss the case with prejudice, and the parties asked the court to  put  an  end  to  these  proceedings.  Like  others  operators  in  the Paris marketplace, Societe Generale is subject to a tax review of its equity market transactions. Discussions with the administration are continuing.  Like  other  operators  in  the  Paris  marketplace,  Societe Generale is subject to a tax review of its equity market transactions. Discussions with the administration are continuing.\n\n- On 9/uni00A0November 2020, Societe Generale was named as a defendant, p together with another bank, in similar Helms-Burton litigation filed in the US District Court in Manhattan (Pujol/uni00A0I) by the purported heirs of former owners, and personal representatives of estates of heirs or former owners, of Banco Pujol, a Cuban bank alleged to have been confiscated by the Cuban government in 1960. On 27/uni00A0January 2021, Societe Generale filed a motion to dismiss. In response, as permitted by the judge's rules, plaintiffs chose to file an amended complaint and did so on 26/uni00A0February 2021. Societe Generale filed a motion to dismiss to dismiss the amended complaint on 19/uni00A0March 2021, which was granted by the court on 24/uni00A0November 2021. The court has given plaintiffs the opportunity to replead their claims. On 16/uni00A0March 2021, Societe Generale was named as a defendant, together with another bank,  in  a  nearly  identical  Helms-Burton  litigation  filed  in  the  US District Court in Manhattan (Pujol/uni00A0II) by the personal representative of one of the purported heirs to Banco Pujol who is also a plaintiff in Pujol/uni00A0I. The deadline for the defendants to respond to the complaint in Pujol/uni00A0II has been stayed pending the next steps in Pujol/uni00A0I.\n\n|",

Indeed,  this  crisis  and  the  exceptional measures  taken  in  the  context  of  the  health  emergency  have  had numerous  consequences  for  companies,  particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties regarding  their  future  prospects.  Some  of  these  measures,  such  as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and on how audits are performed.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0823-9 and R./uni00A0823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce )  relating  to  the  justification  of our  assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters  relating  to risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial  statements  as  a  whole,  and  in  forming  our  opinion  thereon and  we  do  not  provide  a  separate  opinion  on  specific  items  of  the financial statements.\n\n## STATUTORY AUDITORS' REPORT 6.7 ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThis is a translation into English of the statutory auditors' report on the financial statements issued in French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users.\n\nThis statutory auditors' report includes information required by French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders.\n\nThis report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nFor the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by  your  Annual General  Meeting,  we  have  audited  the  accompanying  financial statements of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as of December/uni00A031, 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Internal Control Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## AUDIT FRAMEWORK\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  in  accordance  with  professional  standards applicable  in  France.

As  at  December/uni00A031,  2021,  this  timeframe  is eight years for the tax group in France and seven years for the tax group in the United States of America.\n\nIn addition, as stated in Notes/uni00A05 'Taxes' and 8 'Information on risks and litigation' to the financial statements, certain tax loss carryforwards are challenged by the French tax authorities and are therefore liable to be called into question.\n\nGiven  the  importance  of  the  assumptions  used  to  assess  the recoverability  of  the  deferred  tax  assets  in  France  and  in  the  United States of America, notably on future taxable profits, and of the judgment exercised by Management in this respect, we considered this issue to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit approach consisted in assessing the probability that Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  will  be  able  to  use  in  the  future  its  tax  loss  carryforwards generated to date, in particular in view of its ability to generate future taxable profits in France and in the United States of America.\n\nWith the support of tax specialists, our procedures mainly consisted in:\n\n- comparing the projected results of the previous years with the actual p results of the corresponding fiscal years, so as to assess the reliability of the tax business plan development process;\n- obtaining  an  understanding  of  the  budget  for  2022  drawn  up  by p Management and approved by the Board of Directors, as well as the assumptions underlying the projections over the 2022-2025 timeframe which take into account the expected impacts of the France network merger;\n- assessing  the  relevance  of  the  methods  used  to  extrapolate  the  tax p results after the 2022-2025 timeframe;\n- assessing the assumptions used to analyze sensitivity in the event of p adverse scenarios defined by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale group;\n- analyzing  the  sensitivity  of  the  recovery  period  for  tax  losses  under p different scenarios we created;\n- analyzing the situation of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, notably by taking note of p the  opinions  of  its  external  tax  advisers  regarding  its  tax  loss carryforwards in France, partly challenged by the tax authorities.\n\nWe  also  analyzed  the  information  provided  by  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, concerning deferred tax assets, disclosed in Notes/uni00A01.4 'Use of estimates and judgment', 5 'Taxes' and 8 'Information on risks and litigation' to the financial statements.\n\n|",

As at December/uni00A031, 2021, M\u20ac 187,228 are recorded in this respect under assets on Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's balance sheet.\n\nTo determine the fair value of theseinstruments, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale uses techniques  or  in-house  valuation  models.  As  stated  in  Note/uni00A02.2 'Operations  on  forward  financial  instruments'  to  the  financial statements, if necessary, these valuations include discounts calculated according  to  the  relevant  instruments  and  associated  risks.  In  the absence  of  available  market  data  or  market  valuation  models,  the models and data used to value these instruments may, for example, be based on Management's judgment and estimates.\n\nGiven the complexity of the modelling in determining the fair value, the multiplicity of models used, and the use of Management's judgment in determining  these  fair  values,  we  consider  the  valuation  of  complex financial instruments to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur  audit  approach  is  based  on  the  key  internal  control  processes related to the valuation of complex financial instruments.\n\nWith  the  support  of  experts  in  the  valuation  of  financial  instruments included in the audit team, our procedures consisted in:\n\n- obtaining  an  understanding  of  the  procedure  to  authorize  and p validate  new  products  and  their  valuation  models,  including  the process for the entry of these models in the information systems;\n- analyzing  the  governance  set  up  by  the  Risk  Department  for  the p control of the valuation models;\n- analyzing  the  valuation  methodologies  for  certain  categories  of p complex instruments and the related reserves or value adjustments;\n- testing the key controls relating to the independent verification of the p valuation  parameters,  and  evaluating  the  reliability  of  the  market parameters  used  to  provide  input  for  the  valuation  models  with reference to external data;\n- as  regards  the  process  used  to  explain  the  changes  in  fair  value, p obtaining  an  understanding  of  the  bank's  analysis  principles  and performing  tests  of  controls  on  a  sample  basis.  In  addition,  we performed 'analytical' IT procedures on the control data relating to certain activities;\n- obtaining  the  quarterly  results  of  the  model  independent  price p verification process;\n- obtaining  the  quarterly  results  of  the  valuation  adjustment  process p based  on  external  market  data,  and  analyzing  the  differences  in parameters with the market data in the event of a significant impact, and  the  accounting  treatment  of  such  differences.  Where  external data  is  absent,  we  assessed  the  existence  of  reserves  or  the non-materiality of the associated issues;\n- performing  counter-valuations  of  a  selection  of  complex  derivative p financial instruments using our tools.\n\nWe  also  analyzed  the  compliance  of  the  methods  underlying  the estimates  with  the  principles  described  in  Note/uni00A02.2  'Operations  on forward financial instruments' to the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The measures taken by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in this respect have exposed it to new risks,  particularly  those  relating  to  the  opening  up  of  information systems to allow remote access to transaction processing applications.\n\nTo  ensure  the  reliability  of  the  accounts,  it  is  therefore  essential  for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale to master the controls relating to the management of the information systems.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  IT  risk  relating  to  the  Market  Activities  of  the  GBIS division constitutes a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit approach for this activity is based on the controls related to the management of the information systems set up by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. With  the  support  of  specialists  in  information  systems  included  in  the audit team, we tested the IT general controls of the applications that we considered to be key for this activity.\n\nOur work mainly consisted in assessing:\n\n- the  controls  set  up  by  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  on  access  rights,  notably  at p sensitive  periods  in  a  professional  career  (recruitment,  transfer, resignation,  end  of  contract)  with,  where  applicable,  extended procedures in the event of  anomalies  identified  during  the  financial year;\n- potential privileged access to applications and infrastructure; p\n- change  management  relating  to  applications,  and  more  specifically p the separation between development and business environments;\n- security  policies  in  general  and  their  deployment  in  IT  applications p (for example, those related to passwords);\n- handling of IT incidents during the audit period; p\n- governance and the control environment on a sample of applications. p\n\nFor  these  same  applications,  and  in  order  to  assess  the  transfer  of information flows, we tested the key application controls relating to the automated interfaces between the systems.\n\nIn  addition,  our  tests  on  the  general  IT  and  application  controls  were supplemented by data analysis procedures on certain IT applications.\n\nWe also evaluated the governance implemented by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale to ensure  the  resilience  of  the  information  systems  in  the  context  of  the Covid-19 crisis.  Our  work  consisted  in  interviewing  the  bank's  security teams and studying the reports from the cybersecurity teams as well as any  incidents  occurring  during  the  period.  Our  work  notably  included analyzing  the  access  special  access  authorizations  granted  and validated by the security team.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\n## OBJECTIVES AND AUDIT APPROACH\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement. Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of  assurance,  but  is  not  a guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists. Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ),  our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the p financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  designs  and performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains audit  evidence  considered  to  be  sufficient  and  appropriate  to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for  one  resulting from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in p order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the p reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and  related  disclosures made by management in the financial statements;\n\n- assesses  the  appropriateness  of  management's  use  of  the  going p concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to  cease  to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a  material  uncertainty  exists,  there  is  a  requirement  to  draw attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  and p assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## REPORT TO THE AUDIT AND INTERNAL CONTROL COMMITTEE\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Internal Control Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit  program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our  audit.  We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the  accounting  and  financial  reporting  procedures  that  we  have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Internal Control Committee includes the risks  of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe  also  provide  the  Audit  and  Internal  Control  Committee  with  the declaration  provided  for  in  Article/uni00A06  of  Regulation  (EU)  No./uni00A0537/2014, confirming  our  independence  within  the  meaning  of  the  rules applicable in France  such  as  they  are  set  in  particular  by Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0822-10 to L./uni00A0822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Internal Control Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, March/uni00A09, 2022 The Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nDELOITTE & ASSOCIES\n\nJean-Marc Mickeler\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres Micha Missakian\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

According to this agreement,  Societe  Generale  and  Santander  Central  Hispano  each grant the other party a pre-emptive right to the shares held, directly or through a subsidiary, by each of the parties in the share capital of the other, although this right does not apply in the event of a public tender offer initiated by a third party for the shares of either party.\n\nThe agreement was concluded for an initial period of three years from the date of its  signature  and  is  subsequently  renewable for two-year periods.\n\nThis  pre-emptive  clause  was  published  by  the  French  Financial Markets Council ( Conseil des March\u00e9s Financiers ) in Decision No./uni00A0201C1417  dated  30/uni00A0November/uni00A02001.  This  agreement  was  still  in force on 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02021. However, at this date, Banco Santander no longer  held  any  shares  in  Societe  Generale  and  Societe  Generale  no longer held any shares in Banco Santander.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "According to the law, double voting rights cease for shares which have been  converted  into  bearer  form  or  if  ownership  of  the  shares  is transferred. Nevertheless, transfer through inheritance, liquidation of marital  assets,  donation inter  vivos to  a  spouse  or  a  direct  relative entitled  to  inherit,  does  not  result  in  the  loss  of  rights  and  does  not affect the minimum two-year vesting period. The same applies, unless otherwise  stated  in  the  Company's  By-laws,  in  case  of  transfer following  a  merger  or  a  spin-off  of  a  shareholder  company.  The amendment to the regulations of Fund E as at 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02021 has no effect  on  the  calculation  of  the  double  voting  rights  of  the  shares  in Fund E's assets.\n\n## Restriction on voting rights\n\nIn accordance with Article/uni00A014 of the Company's By-laws, the number of votes  at  General  Meetings  to  be  used  by  one  shareholder,  either personally or through a proxy, may not exceed 15% of the total voting rights existing at the date of the Meeting. This 15% limit does not apply to the Chairman or any other proxy with respect to the total number of voting  rights  they  hold  on  a  personal  basis  and  in  their  capacity  as proxy, provided that each proxy complies with the 15% rule. For the purposes  of  applying  this  15%  limit,  shares  held  by  a  single shareholder include shares held indirectly or jointly in accordance with the  conditions  described  in  Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0233-7 et  seq. of  the  French Commercial  Code.  This  limit  ceases  to  apply  when  a  shareholder comes  to  hold,  following  a  public  tender  offer,  either  directly  or indirectly or jointly with another shareholder, more than 50.01% of the Company's voting rights.\n\n## Disclosure of statutory threshold crossings\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article/uni00A06.2  of  the  Company's By-laws,  any  person,  acting  on  his  own  or  in  concert,  who  comes  to hold  directly  or  indirectly,  in  any  manner  whatsoever,  a  number  of shares representing at least 1.5% or 3% of the share capital or voting rights of the Company, must inform the latter, in writing, within four trading days of the crossing of this threshold, and must also indicate in his  declaration  the  number  of  securities  giving  access  to  the  share capital of the Company it holds. Mutual fund management companies must  provide  this  information  based  on  the  total  number  of  shares held in the Company by the funds they manage.\n\nBeyond  the  threshold  of  3%,  any  additional  crossing  of  1%  of  the capital  or  voting  rights  of  the  Company  must  be  notified  to  the Company as provided by Article/uni00A06.2 of the Company's By-laws.\n\nAny person, acting on his own or in concert, is also required to inform the Company within four trading days if the percentage of his capital or voting rights falls below each of the thresholds described in the/uni00A0article 6.2 of by-laws.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  obligations  to  disclose  the  crossings  of statutory thresholds provided by Article/uni00A06.2 of the Company's By-laws, the  shares  or  voting  rights  listed  in  Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0233-9,/uni00A0I  of  the  French Commercial Code are assimilated to the shares or voting rights held.\n\nFailure  to  comply  with  these  requirements  will  be  penalised  in accordance  with  applicable  laws,  at  the  request  of  one  or  more shareholders  holding  at  least  5%  of  the  Company's  capital  or  voting rights.  Said  request  will  be  duly  recorded  in  the  minutes  of  the General/uni00A0Meeting.\n\n## Convening and rules for attending General Meetings of Shareholders\n\nUnder  Article/uni00A014  of  the  Company's  By-laws,  General  Meetings  are convened and deliberate in accordance with the conditions set forth by the laws and regulations in force. They meet at the registered office or  in  any  other  place  in  mainland  France  indicated  in  the  convening notice.  Such  meetings  are  chaired  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors or, failing this, by a Director appointed for this purpose by the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nRegardless  of  the  number  of  shares  held,  any  shareholder  whose shares are registered under the terms and at a date set by decree, has the right, upon proof of their identity and status as a shareholder, to participate in the General Meetings. A shareholder may, in accordance with the laws and regulations in force, personally attend the General Meetings,  vote  remotely  or  appoint  a  proxy.  The  intermediary registered  on  behalf  of  shareholders  may  participate  in  the  General Meetings, under the conditions set forth by the provisions of the laws and regulations in force.\n\nIn  order  for  the  ballots  to  be  counted,  they  must  be  received  by  the Company at least two days before the General Meeting is held, unless a shorter period is specified in the convening notice or required by the regulations in force.\n\nShareholders may participate in General Meetings by videoconference or  any  other  means  of  telecommunication,  when  provided  for  in  the convening notice and subject to the conditions defined therein.\n\nThe General Meeting may be publicly broadcast by means of electronic communication subject to the approval of and under the terms set by the  Board  of  Directors.  Notice  will  be  given  in  the  notice  of  meeting and/or the convening notice.\n\nIn all General Meetings, the voting right attached to shares with a right of usufruct is exercised by the usufructuary.\n\n## Identifiable bearer securities\n\nSociete Generale may at any time, in accordance with the provisions of the laws and regulations in force, ask the organisation responsible for securities  clearing  to  provide  information  relating  to  the  securities granting the right to vote in its General Meetings, either immediately or in  the  future,  as  well  as  information  about  the  holders  of  these securities.\n\n## Employee shareholding\n\nFollowing the amendments to the by-laws voted by the extraordinary General  Meeting  on  19/uni00A0May/uni00A02020  and  since  the  General  Meeting  of 18/uni00A0May/uni00A02021,  employee  shareholders are represented on the Board of Directors by a Director, in addition to the two Directors representing all employees.  The  level  of  employee  shareholding,  calculated  for  the specific  need  of  this  new  director  appointment  represents,  in accordance with the calculation methods provided in Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-102 of  the  French  Commercial  Code  and  with  the  new  stipulations  of Article/uni00A06.5 of the by-laws, 7.89% of the share capital on 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02021.\n\nFollowing the amendments of the rules of the FCPE 'Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale actionnariat  (FONDS  E)'  decided  on  16/uni00A0April/uni00A02020,  which  came  into force on 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02021, in accordance with paragraph/uni00A03 of Article/uni00A0L./uni00A0214-165/uni00A0II  of  the  French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code,  the voting rights relating to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale shares included in the assets of  this  fund,  corresponding  to  10.45%  of  the  voting  rights  on 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02021, will be exclusively exercised individually by the unit holders  and,  for  the  fractional  units  forming  fractional  rights,  by  the Supervisory Board of this fund.\n\n|",

Directors appointed by the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders\n\nThere are at least nine of these Directors, and thirteen at the most.\n\nThe  term  of  office  of  Directors  appointed  by  the  Ordinary  General Meeting is four years.\n\nWhen, in application of current legislative and regulatory provisions, a Director is appointed to replace another, then his term of office shall not exceed the term of office remaining to be served by his predecessor.\n\nEach Director must hold at least six hundred shares.\n\n## 2. Directors representing the employees elected by employees\n\nThe status and methods of electing these Directors are laid down by Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-27  to  L./uni00A0225-34  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  as  well as by these By-laws.\n\nThere  are  two  Directors,  one  to  represent  the  executives  and  one  to represent all other Company employees.\n\nIn any event, their number may not exceed one third of the Directors appointed by the General Meeting.\n\nTheir term of office is three years.\n\n## 3. A Director representing employee shareholders appointed by The Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders\n\nThe  General  Meeting  appoints  a  Director  representing  employee shareholders.\n\nThe term of office is four/uni00A0years.\n\nRegardless  of  the  appointment  procedure,  the  duties  of  a  Director cease at the end of the Ordinary General Meeting called to approve the financial  statements  of  the  previous  fiscal  year  and  held  during  the year in which his term of office expires.\n\nDirectors  may  be  reelected,  as  long  as  they  meet  the  legislative  and regulatory provisions in force, particularly with regard to age.\n\nThis  provision  shall  apply  from  the  General  Meeting  convened  to approve the accounts for the 2020 financial year.\n\n## II - METHODS OF ELECTING\n\n## 1. Directors representing employees elected by employees\n\nFor each seat to be filled, the voting procedure is that set forth by the legislative and regulatory provisions in force.\n\nThe first Directors elected by employees will begin their term of office during the Board of Directors' meeting held after publication of the full results of the first elections.\n\nSubsequent Directors shall take up office upon expiry of the outgoing Directors' terms of office.\n\nIf, under any circumstances and for any reason whatsoever, there shall remain  in  office  less  than  the  statutory  number  of  elected  Directors before the normal end of the term of office of such Directors, vacant seats  shall  remain  vacant  until  the  end  of  the  term  of  office  and  the Board shall continue to meet and take decisions validly until that date.\n\nElections  shall  be  organised  every  three  years  so  that  a  second  vote may take place at the latest fifteen days before the normal end of the term of office of outgoing Directors.\n\nFor both the first and second ballot, the following deadlines should be adhered to:\n\n- posting of the date of the election at least eight weeks before the p polling date;\n- posting  of  the  lists  of  the  electors  at  least  six  weeks  before  the p polling date;\n- registration of candidates at least five weeks before the polling date; p\n- posting of lists of candidates at least four weeks before the polling p date;\n- sending of documents required for postal voting at least three weeks p before the polling date.\n\nThe candidatures or lists of candidates other than those entered by a representative  trade  union  should  be  accompanied  by  a  document including  the  names  and  signatures  of  the  one  hundred  employees presenting the candidates.\n\nPolling  takes  place  the  same  day,  at  the  work  place,  and  during working hours. Nevertheless, the following may vote by post:\n\n- employees not present on the day of polling; p\n- employees working abroad; p\n- employees of a department or office, or seconded to a subsidiary in p France,  not  having  a  polling  station,  or  who  cannot  vote  in another/uni00A0office.\n\n|",

The  Chairman  is  responsible  for seeing that voting operations proceed correctly.\n\nVotes are counted in each polling station, and immediately after the closing of the polls; the minutes are drawn up as soon as the counting has been completed.\n\nResults are immediately sent to the Head Office of Societe Generale, where a centralized results station will be set up with a view to drafting the summary report and announcing the results.\n\nMethods of polling not specified by Articles/uni00A0L./uni00A0225-27 to L./uni00A0225-34 of the French Commercial Code or these By-laws are decreed by the General Management after consulting with the representative trade unions.\n\nThese  methods  may  include  electronic  voting,  whose  organization may  deviate  from  the  practical  organization  and  conduct  of  the election described herein.\n\n## 2. Director representing employee shareholders appointed by the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders\n\nWhen the legal conditions are met, a member of the Board of Directors representing  employee  shareholders  is  appointed  by  the  Ordinary General Meeting in accordance with the terms and conditions set by the regulations in force and by these By-laws.\n\nThe  term  of  office  is  identical  to  the  terms  of  the  other  Directors appointed  by  the  Ordinary  General  Meeting.  The  term  of  office  is exercised  by  the  candidate  appointed,  or  by  his  replacement  in  the event of definitive termination, during the term of office, of the duties as Director of the candidate with whom he was appointed. The term of office  ends  automatically  in  the  event  of  loss  of  the  capacity  of employee  of  the  Company  or  of  an  affiliated  company  within  the meaning of the regulations in force.\n\nCandidates  for  appointment  as  Director  representing  employee shareholders  are  nominated  by  a  single  election  of  all  employee shareholders,  including  holders  of  units  of  mutual  funds  invested  in Societe  Generale  securities.  The  scope  of  voters  and  eligible candidates is defined by the regulations in force and these By-laws.\n\nEmployee shareholders may be consulted by any technical means that ensures the reliability of the vote, including electronic voting or postal ballot.  Each  elector  has  a  number  of  votes  equal  to  the  number  of shares he holds directly or indirectly through a mutual fund.\n\nEvery  candidate  must  stand  for  election  with  a  replacement  who meets  the  same  legal  conditions  of  eligibility  as  the  candidate.  The replacement is called upon to replace the candidate for the remainder of  the  term  of  office.  The  candidate  and  his  replacement  shall  be  of different sexes.\n\nOnly candidacies presented by voters (i) representing at least 0.1% of the shares held directly or indirectly by employee shareholders and (ii) benefitting  from  100  sponsorships  of  employees  who  vote,  are admissible.\n\nMinutes of the consultation are drawn up: they include the number of votes  received  by  each  of  the  candidates  as  well  as  a  list  of  validly nominated candidates and replacements.\n\nOnly the two candidacies having obtained the highest number of votes cast  during  the  consultation  of  employee  shareholders  shall  be submitted to the vote of the Ordinary General Meeting.\n\nThe  procedures  relating  to  the  organization  and  conduct  of  the consultation  of  employee  shareholders  and  the  appointment  of candidates not defined by the regulations in force and these Articles of Association  shall  be  determined  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the proposal of the General Management.\n\nThe Board of Directors presents the designated candidates and their replacements to the Ordinary General Meeting by means of separate resolutions, and approves, if necessary, one of the resolutions.\n\nThe Director representing employee shareholders and his replacement are appointed by the Ordinary General Meeting from among the validly nominated  candidates  and  replacements.  Under  the  quorum  and majority conditions applicable to any appointment  of a Director, the person  who  has  received  the  highest  number  of  votes  cast  by  the shareholders present or represented at the Ordinary General Meeting shall be elected as Director.\n\nThe  Director  representing  employee  shareholders  shall  hold  on  a continuous basis, either directly or through a mutual fund, at least one share  or  a  number  of  shares  of  such  fund  equivalent  to  at  least  one share. Failing this, he shall be deemed to have resigned automatically unless he has rectified his situation within three months.\n\nIn  the  event  of  the  definitive  termination  of  the  mandate  of  the Director  representing  employee  shareholders,  his  replacement,  if  he still  meets  the  eligibility  conditions,  shall  take  up  office  immediately for the remainder of the term of office. If he is no longer a shareholder, he  must  rectify  his  situation  within  three  months  of  taking  office; failing this, he is deemed to have resigned at the end of this period.\n\nIn the event of a vacancy, for any reason whatsoever, in the office of the Director  representing  employee  shareholders,  the  appointment  of candidates to replace the Director representing employee shareholders shall be made under the conditions provided for in this article, at the latest  before  the  meeting  of  the  next  Ordinary  General  Meeting  or,  if such meeting is held less than four months after the vacancy occurs, before  the  next  Ordinary  General  Meeting.  The  Director  representing employee  shareholders  so  appointed  to  the  vacant  position  shall  be appointed for the duration of one term of office.\n\nUntil  the  date  of  replacement  of  the  Director  representing  the employee shareholders, the Board of Directors may validly meet and deliberate.\n\nIn the event that, during the term of office, the conditions provided for by  the  regulations  in  force  for  the  appointment  of  a  Director representing  employee  shareholders  are  no  longer  met,  the  term  of office of the Director representing employee shareholders shall end at the  end  of  the  Ordinary  General  Meeting  at  which  the  Board  of Directors' report acknowledging this fact is presented.\n\n## III - NON-VOTING DIRECTORS\n\nOn the proposal of the Chairman, the Board of Directors may appoint one or two Non-Voting Directors.\n\nNon-Voting  Directors  are  convened  and  attend  Board  of  Directors' meetings in a consultative capacity.\n\nThey  are  appointed  for  a  period  not  exceeding  four  years  and  the Board can renew their terms of office or terminate them at any time.\n\nThey may be selected from among shareholders or non-shareholders, and  receive  an  annual  remuneration  determined  by  the  Board  of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7",

Based  on systematic  stakeholder  engagement  in  a  company's  day-to-day business,  it  contains  a  series  of  indicators,  targets  and  reporting systems designed to assure the credibility of a company's performance in such  respect.  Various  major  corporations,  non-governmental organisations and public institutions are among those to have adopted the standard.\n\nADEME: the Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME or Ademe) is a French public industrial and commercial institution (EPIC) created in 1991.

These  units  or shares  reflect  the  portfolio's  value  at  any  given  time.  This  value  is expressed as a 'net asset value', calculated by dividing the total value of the CIU's net assets by the total number of its units or shares. The net  asset  value  represents  both  the  subscription  price  for  a  unit  or share (with fees being payable in addition) and its redemption price.\n\nConvention  d'Occupation  Temporaire : a  contract  between  a  public entity and, typically, a private one, under which the latter is authorised to  temporarily  occupy  part  of  the  public  domain.

The Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations pools  60% of all funds on Livret  A accounts, using them to invest in projects in the public interest, such as building social housing and granting long-term loans to providers of social  housing  or  to  local  authorities  for  infrastructure  development, including building hospitals and  transport infrastructure. The remaining  40%  is  managed  by  the  banks  and  generates  interest  for savers.\n\nLuxFLAG: the  Luxembourg Finance Labelling Agency (LuxFLAG) is an independent  and  international  non-profit  association  founded  in July/uni00A02006.  It  aims  to  promote  sustainable  investments  by  awarding a transparent label to investment vehicles that are active in the fields of microfinance, the environment, ESG (environment, social, governance),  climate  finance  and  green  bonds.  LuxFLAG  labels  are designed to reassure investors that the investment vehicle in question genuinely  pursues  responsible  investment  of  the  assets  it  manages. There  are  no  restrictions  on  eligibility  for  international  investment vehicles based on issuing countries or where the vehicle is domiciled. LuxFLAG  is  guided  by  four  core  values:  sustainability,  transparency, independence and responsibility.\n\nLyxor: Lyxor  Asset  Management  Group  is  a  Societe  Generale subsidiary.

Phenix  collects  their  unsold  goods  (foodstuffs, toiletries,  cleaning  products,  school  supplies, /uni00A0 etc . )  and  then  either donates  them  to  food  banks  and  charities  or  sells  them  at  cut-price rates through its mobile app.\n\nPhysical  risk: refers  to  the  financial  impact  of  climate  change,  as  a result of more frequent extreme weather events as well as progressive climate change. Physical risks can be either 'acute' (impact of extreme weather  events,  such  as  storms  and  flooding)  or  chronic  (impact  of more progressive shifts, such as higher temperatures, rising sea levels and water stress). These physical risks may have financial implications for organisations, such as direct damage, supply shocks (affecting their own assets or else their supply chains, resulting in an indirect impact) or  demand  shocks  (affecting  downstream  destination  markets).  An organisation's financial performance may also be affected by changes in  water  availability,  sourcing  and  quality,  food  security,  or  extreme temperature  variations  affecting  its  premises,  operations,  supply chains, transport needs and employee safety.\n\nPositive  Impact  note: Societe  Generale  has  put  together  a  range  of positive impact notes (PI Notes) that offer investors the opportunity to invest  in  a  structured  note  with  the  additional  benefit  of  promoting Positive  Impact  Finance.

Transitioning  to  a  low-carbon economy to meet the challenges of mitigating and adapting to climate change  can  involve  major  political,  legal,  technological  and  market changes. The exact nature and direction of these changes, as well as how  fast  they  occur,  will  affect  the  extent  of  the  financial  and reputational  risk  elements  making  up  transition  risks.  Although  the TCFD's  recommendations  do  not  specifically  mention  it,  the  Group also  includes  within  transition  risk  the  liability  risk  arising  from possible compensation claims from parties having sustained losses as a result of physical or transition risks.\n\nVisits  per  month: a  website  visit  is  counted  when  an  internet  user views one or more pages over a one-month period.\n\nWWF: the  World  Wildlife  Fund  is  an  international  non-governmental organisation  (INGO)  established  in  1961,  dedicated  to  environmental protection  and  sustainable  development.

It notably establishes a minimum capital ratio  -  as  a  proportion  of  the  total  risks  taken  on  by  banks  -  of  8% (Source:  Bank  of  France  Glossary  -  Documents  et  D\u00e9bats  -  No./uni00A04  May/uni00A02012).\n\nBasel/uni00A02  (Accords): prudential  framework  used  to  better  assess  and limit  banks'  risks.  It  is  focused  on  banks'  credit,  market  and operational  risks  (Source:  Bank  of  France  Glossary  -  Documents  et D\u00e9bats - No./uni00A04 - May/uni00A02012).\n\nBasel/uni00A03 (Accords): changes  to  prudential  banking  standards  that supplement the Basel/uni00A02 accords by improving the quality and quantity of banks' required capital. They also implement minimum requirements  in  terms  of  liquidity  risk  management  (quantitative ratios),  define  measures  to  limit  the  financial  system's  procyclicality (capital  buffers  that  vary  according  to  the  economic  cycle)  and strengthen  requirements  related  to  systemically  significant  banks (Source:  Bank  of  France  Glossary  -  Documents  et  D\u00e9bats  -  No./uni00A04  May/uni00A02012).  The  Basel/uni00A03  Accords  are  implemented  in  Europe  under Directive  2013/36/EU  ('CRD4')  and  Regulation  575/2013  ('CRR'), which have been in force since 1/uni00A0January 2014.\n\nBond: a  bond is a fraction of a loan, issued in the form of a security, which is tradable and - in a given issue - grants a receivable over the issuer  according  to  the  issue's  nominal  value  (the  issuer  being  a company, public sector entity or government).\n\nCash  Generating  Unit  (CGU): the  smallest  identifiable  set  of  assets which  generates  incoming  cash  flow  that  is  generally  independent from  the  incoming  cash  flow  generated  by  other  assets  or  sets  of assets  in  accordance  with  the  IAS  36  accounting  standard.  'In accordance  with  IFRS  standards,  a  company  must  determine  the largest number of cash generating units (CGU) which make it up; these CGU should be generally independent in terms of operations and the company  must  allocate  assets  to  each  of  these  CGU.  Impairment testing  must  be  conducted at the CGU level periodically (if there are reasons  to  believe  that  their  value  has  dropped)  or  annually  (if  they include goodwill).' (Source: Les Echos.fr , quoting Vernimmen).\n\nCollateral: transferable  asset  or  guarantee  used  as  a  pledge  for  the repayment of a  loan  in  the  event  that  the  borrower  cannot  meet  its payment obligations (Source: Bank of France Glossary - Documents et D\u00e9bats - No./uni00A04 - May/uni00A02012).\n\nCollateralised Debt Obligation (CDO): see securitisation.\n\nCollateralised Loan Obligation (CLO): see securitisation.\n\nCommercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS): see securitisation.\n\nCommon  Equity  Tier  1  capital: includes  principally  share  capital, associated share premiums and reserves, less prudential deductions.\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio: ratio  between Common Equity Tier 1 capital  and  risk-weighted  assets,  according  to  CRD4/CRR  rules. Common Equity Tier 1 capital has a more restrictive definition than in the earlier CRD3 Directive (Basel/uni00A02).\n\nComprehensive Risk Measurement (CRM): capital charge in addition to  Incremental  Risk  Charge  (IRC)  for  the  credit  activities  correlation portfolio  which  accounts  for  specific  price  risks  (spread,  correlation, collection, etc.).  The CRM is a 99.9% risk factor, meaning the highest risk obtained after eliminating the 0.1% most unfavourable incidents.\n\n|",

It  is determined by dividing management fees by the NBI.\n\nCost  of  risk  in  basis  points: the  cost  of  risk  in  basis  points  is calculated  using  the  ratio  of  the  net  cost  of  commercial  risk  to  loan outstandings at the start of the period.\n\nNet cost of risk corresponds to the cost of risk calculated for on- and off-balance  sheet  exposures, i.e. Depreciation  and  reversals  (used  or not  used)  +  Losses  on  unrecoverable  receivables  -  Recovery  of impaired  debts.  Provisions  and  reversals  of  provisions  for  litigation issues are excluded from this calculation.\n\nCRD3: European Directive on capital requirements, incorporating the provisions known as Basel/uni00A02 and 2.5, notably in respect of market risk: improvement  in  the  incorporation  of  the  risk  of  default  or  rating migration  for  assets  in  the  trading  book  (tranched  and  untranched assets),  and  reduction  in  the  procyclicality  of  Value  at  Risk  (see definition).\n\nCRD4/CRR (Capital Requirement Regulation): Directive  2013/36/EU ('CRD4')  and  Regulation  (EU)  No./uni00A0575/2013  ('CRR')  constitute  the corpus  of  the  texts  transposing  Basel/uni00A03  in  Europe.  They  therefore define  the  European  regulations  relating  to  the  solvency  ratio,  large exposures, leverage and liquidity ratios, and are supplemented by the European Banking Authority's ('EBA') technical standards.\n\nCredit and counterparty risk: risk of losses arising from the inability of the Group's customers, issuers or other counterparties to meet their financial commitments. Credit risk also includes the counterparty risk linked  to  market  transactions,  as  well  as  that  stemming  from securitisation activities.\n\nCredit Default Swaps (CDS): insurance mechanism against credit risk in  the  form  of  a  bilateral  financial  contract,  in  which  the  protection buyer  periodically  pays  the  seller  in  return  for  a  guarantee  to compensate  the  buyer  for  losses  on  reference  assets  (government, bank  or  corporate  bonds)  if  a  credit  event  occurs  (bankruptcy, payment default, moratorium, restructuring) (Source: Bank of France Glossary - Documents et D\u00e9bats - No./uni00A04 - May/uni00A02012).\n\nCredit Value at Risk (CVaR): the  largest  loss  that  would  be  incurred after eliminating the top 1% of the most adverse occurrences, used to set the risk limits for individual counterparties.\n\nDerivative: a  financial  asset  or  financial  contract,  the  value  of  which changes  based  on  the  value  of  an  underlying  asset,  which  may  be financial (equities, bonds, currencies, etc.) or non-financial (agricultural or other commodities, etc.). Depending  on  the circumstances, this change may be accompanied by a leverage effect. Derivatives  can  take  the  form  of  securities  (warrants,  certificates, structured  EMTNs,  etc.)  or  contracts  (forwards,  options,  swaps,  etc.). Listed derivative contracts are called Futures.\n\nDoubtful loan coverage rate: ratio  between  portfolio  provision  and depreciation and doubtful outstandings (customer loans and receivables,  loans  and  receivables  with  credit  institutions,  finance leases and basic leases).\n\nExpected  Loss  (EL): losses  that  may  occur  given  the  quality  of  a transaction's structuring and all measures taken to reduce risk, such as collateral.\n\nExposure  at  default  (EAD): Exposure  in  case  of  default,  exposure incurred  by  the  financial  institution  in  the  event  of  default  of  a counterparty.  The  EAD  includes  both  balance  sheet  and  off-balance sheet  exposures.  Off-balance  sheet  exposures  are  converted  to  their balance  sheet  equivalent  using  internal  or  regulatory  conversion factors (drawdown assumption).\n\nFair  value: the  amount  for  which  an  asset  could  be  exchanged  or  a liability  settled,  between  informed  and  consenting  parties  under normal market conditions.\n\nGovernment-backed loans (PGE): In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the  French  State  set  up  an  emergency  financing  scheme  to  help debtors manage their cash requirements for an amount capped at 25% of  their  revenue  and  with  an  initial  bullet  redemption  phase  over  12 months.  At  the  end  of  this  initial  phase,  the  client  may  opt  for  a redemption period of up to five years.\n\nNinety percent of the loan amount for professional and VSB clients is backed by the French government. The only cost to these clients is a 0.25% commission to the French Public Investment Bank (BPI).\n\nFor corporate clients, 70% to 90% of the loan amount is backed by the French government. The only cost to these clients is a commission of between  0.25%  and  0.50%  paid  to  the  French  government  and collected  by  the  French  Public  Investment  Bank  (BPI)  depending  on the revenue bracket.\n\nGross  rate  of  doubtful  outstandings: the  ratio  between  doubtful outstandings and gross book loan outstandings (customer loans and receivables,  loans  and  receivables  with  credit  institutions,  finance leases and basic leases).\n\nHaircut: percentage by which the market value of securities is reduced to reflect their value in the context of stress (counterparty or market stress risk). The extent of the reduction reflects the perceived risk.\n\nImpairment: recording of probable loss on an asset (Source: Bank of France Glossary - Documents et D\u00e9bats - No./uni00A04 - May/uni00A02012).\n\nIncremental  Risk  Charge  (IRC): capital  cost  incurred  due  to  rating migration risk and risk of issuers' default within a one-year horizon for trading  book  debt  instruments  (bonds  and  CDS).  The  IRC  is  a  99.9% risk  factor,  meaning  the  highest  risk  obtained  after  eliminating  the 0.1% most unfavourable incidents.\n\nInsurance risk: beyond asset/liability risk management (interest-rate, valuation,  counterparty  and  currency  risk),  insurance  risk  includes underwriting risk, mortality risk and structural risk of life and non-life insurance activities, including pandemics, accidents and catastrophic events (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, industrial disasters, or acts of terrorism or war).\n\nInternal  Capital  Adequacy  Assessment  Process  (ICAAP): process outlined in Pillar 2 of the Basel Accord, by which the Group verifies its capital  adequacy with regard to all  risks  incurred.  Investment  grade: long-term rating provided by an external ratings agency, ranging from AAA/Aaa to BBB-/Baa3 for a counterparty or underlying issue. A rating of BB+/Ba1 or lower indicates a Non-Investment Grade instrument.\n\nLeverage  ratio: the  leverage  ratio  is  intended  to  be  a  simple  ratio developed  with  a  view  to  limiting  the  size  of  banks'  balance  sheets. The  leverage  ratio  compares  the  Tier  1  capital  with  the  accounting balance sheet/off-balance sheet, after restatements of certain items. A new definition of leverage ratio has been implemented in accordance with the application of the CRR.\n\nLiquidity: for  a  bank,  the  capacity to cover its short-term maturities. For  an  asset,  this  term  indicates  the  potential  to  purchase  or  sell  it quickly on the market, with a limited discount (Source: Bank of France Glossary - Documents et D\u00e9bats - No./uni00A04 - May/uni00A02012).\n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): this ratio is intended to promote the short-term resilience of a bank's liquidity risk profile. The LCR requires banks to hold risk-free assets that may be easily liquidated on markets in order to meet required payments for outflows net of inflows during a  thirty-day  crisis  period  without  central  bank  support  (Source: December/uni00A02010 Basel document).\n\nLoss  Given  Default  (LGD): ratio  between  the  loss  incurred  from exposure to default by a counterparty and the amount of the exposure at the time of default.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Market risk: risk of decline in the value of financial instruments arising from changes in market parameters, the volatility of these parameters and correlations between them. These parameters include but are not limited  to  exchange  rates,  interest  rates,  and  the  price  of  securities (equity, bonds), commodities, derivatives and other assets, including real estate.\n\nMarket stress tests: to assess market risks, alongside the internal VaR and SVaR model, the Group monitors its exposure using market stress test simulations to take into account exceptional market occurrences, based on 26 historical scenarios and eight hypothetical scenarios.\n\nMezzanine: form  of  financing  between  equity  and  debt.  In  terms  of ranking,  mezzanine  debt  is  subordinate  to  senior  debt,  but  it  is  still above equity.\n\nMinimum requirement of own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL): the  EU  Bank  Recovery  and  Resolution  Directive  (BRRD)  requires compliance with a minimum ratio of 'bail-inable' debt ( i.e. debt that can  be  used  in  the  event  of  the  bank's  resolution).  The  MREL requirement is determined on a case-by-case basis for each bank.\n\nMonoline  insurer: insurance  company  participating  in  a  credit enhancement  transaction  and  which  guarantees  bond  issues  (for example, a securitisation transaction), in order to improve the issue's credit rating.\n\nNet  earnings  per  share: net  earnings  of  the  company  (adjusted  for hybrid  securities  recorded  under  equity  instruments)  divided  by  the weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\nNet  Stable  Funding  Ratio  (NSFR): this  ratio  aims  to  promote resilience over a longer time horizon by creating additional incentives for banks to fund their activities with more stable sources of funding. This  structural  ratio  has  a  time  horizon  of  one  year  and  has  been developed  to  provide  a  sustainable  maturity  structure  of  assets  and liabilities (Source: December/uni00A02010 Basel document).\n\nNetting  agreement: a  contract  in  which  two  parties  to  a  forward financial  instrument,  securities  lending  or  resale  contract  agree  to offset  reciprocal  claims  arising  from  these  contracts,  with  the settlement of these claims based only on the net balance, especially in the  event  of  default  or  termination.  A  master  netting  agreement enables  this  mechanism  to  be  extended  to  different  kinds  of transactions, subject to various framework agreements under a master agreement.\n\nOperational  risk  (including  accounting  and  environmental  risk): risk  of  losses  or  sanctions,  notably  due  to  failures  in  procedures  and internal systems, human error or external events, etc.\n\nOwn shares: shares  held  by  the  company,  especially  as  part  of  the Share  Buyback  programme.  Own  shares  are  excluded  from  voting rights  and  are  not  included  in  the  calculation  of  earnings  per  share, with the exception of shares held as part of a liquidity contract.\n\nPersonal  commitment: represented  by  a  deposit,  autonomous guarantee or letter of intent. Whoever makes themselves guarantor for an  obligation  binds  themselves  to  the  creditor  to  honour  that obligation,  if the  debtor  does  not  honour  it  themselves.  An independent  guarantee  is  an  undertaking  by  which  the  guarantor binds himself, in consideration of a debt subscribed by a third party, to pay a sum either on first demand or subject to terms agreed upon. A letter  of  intent  is  an  undertaking  to  do  or  not  to  do,  the  purpose  of which  is  the  support  provided  to  a  debtor  in  honouring  their obligation.\n\nPhysical collateral: guarantees consisting of assets including tangible and  intangible  property  and  securities,  including  commodities, precious metals, cash, financial instruments and insurance contracts.\n\nPrime Brokerage: a  bundled package of services dedicated to hedge funds  to  facilitate  and  improve  their  activities.  In  addition  to performing  standard  brokerage  transactions  on  financial  markets (buying and selling on the customer's behalf), the prime broker offers securities  lending  and  borrowing  services  and  financing  services specifically suited to hedge funds.\n\nProbability of Default (PD): likelihood that a counterparty of the bank will default within one year.\n\nRating: assessment  by  a  ratings  agency  (Moody's,  Fitch  Ratings, Standard & Poor's) of the financial solvency risk of an issuer (company, government or other public institution) or of a given transaction (bond loan, securitisation, covered bond). The rating has a direct impact on the  cost  of  raising  capital  (Source:  Bank  of  France  Glossary  Documents et D\u00e9bats - No./uni00A04 - May/uni00A02012).\n\nResecuritisation: securitisation  of  an  already  securitised  exposure where  the  risk  associated  with  underlyings  is  divided  into  tranches and, therefore, at least one of the underlying exposures is a securitised exposure.\n\nResidential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS): see securitisation.\n\nReturn On Equity (ROE): ratio  between  the  net  income  restated  for interest  on  hybrid  securities  recorded  under  equity  instruments  and restated  book  equity  (especially  hybrid  securities),  which  enables return on capital to be measured.\n\nRisk  appetite: level  of  risk,  by  type  and  by  business  line,  that  the Group  is  prepared  to  take  on  with  regard  to  its  strategic  objectives. Risk  appetite  is  derived  using  both  quantitative  and  qualitative criteria. The Risk Appetite exercise is one of the strategic steering tools available to the Group's decision-making bodies.\n\nRisk weight: percentage of weighting of exposures which is applied to a particular exposure in order to determine the related risk-weighted asset.\n\nRisk-Weighted Assets (RWA): value  of  a  bank's  assets  or  exposures, weighted according to risk.\n\nSecuritisation: transaction that transfers a credit risk (loan outstandings) to an organisation that issues, for this purpose, tradable securities to which investors subscribe. This transaction may involve a transfer  of  outstandings  (physical  securitisation)  or  a  transfer  of  risk only (credit derivatives). Securitisation transactions may, if applicable, enable securities subordination (tranches).\n\nThe following products are considered securitisations:\n\nABS: Asset Backed Securities.\n\nCDO: Collateralised  Debt  Obligation,  a  debt  security  backed  by  an asset portfolio (bank loans (residential) or corporate bonds). Interest and principal payments may be subordinated (tranche creation).\n\nCLO: Collateralised  Loan  Obligation,  a  CDO  backed  by  an  asset portfolio of bank loans.\n\nCMBS: Commercial  Mortgage  Backed  Securities,  a  debt  security backed by an asset portfolio of corporate real estate loans leading to a mortgage.\n\nRMBS: Residential Mortgage Backed Securities, a debt security backed by an asset portfolio of residential mortgage loans.\n\nShare: equity  stake  issued  by  a  company  in  the  form  of  shares, representing a share of ownership and granting its holder (shareholder)  the  right  to  a  proportional  share  in  any  distribution  of profits or net assets as well as a right to vote in a General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "Stressed  Value  at  Risk  (SVaR): identical  to  the  VaR  approach,  the calculation method  consists  of  a  'historical  simulation'  with 'one-day' shocks and a 99% confidence interval. Unlike the VaR, which uses  260  scenarios  of  daily  variation  year-on-year,  the  stressed  VaR uses a fixed one-year window that corresponds to a historical period of significant financial tensions.\n\nStructural  interest  rate  and  currency  risk: risk  of  loss  or  of write-downs in the Group's assets arising from variations in interest or exchange  rates.  Structural  interest  rate  and  exchange  rate  risks  are incurred in commercial activities and proprietary transactions.\n\nStructured  issue  or  structured  product: a  financial  instrument combining a bond product and an instrument (an option for example) providing exposure to all types of asset (equities, currencies, interest rates,  commodities).  Instruments  can  include  a  total  or  partial guarantee  in  respect  of  the  invested  capital.  The  term  'structured product' or 'structured issue' also refers to securities resulting from securitisation  transactions,  where  holders  are  subject  to  a  ranking hierarchy.\n\nSystemically  Important  Financial  Institution  (SIFI): the  Financial Stability Board (FSB) coordinates all of the measures to reduce moral hazard  and  risks  to  the  global  financial  system  posed  by  Globally Systemically  Important  Financial  Institutions  (G-SIFI).  These  banks meet  criteria  defined  in  the  Basel  Committee  rules  included  in  the document  titled  'Global  Systemically  Important  Banks:  Assessment methodology  and  the  additional  loss  absorbency  requirement'  and published as a list in November/uni00A02011.  This  list  is  updated  by  the  FSB each November. Banks classified as G-SIBs are subject to increasingly strict capital requirements.\n\nTier 1 capital: comprises Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier  1  capital.  The  latter  corresponds  to  perpetual  debt  instruments, with no incentive to redeem, less prudential deductions.\n\nTier 2 capital: supplementary capital consisting mainly of subordinated notes less prudential deductions.\n\nTier 1 ratio: ratio between Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets.\n\nTotal capital ratio or Solvency ratio: ratio between total (Tier 1 and Tier 2) capital and risk-weighted assets.\n\nTotal  Loss  Absorbing  Capacity  (TLAC): on  10/uni00A0November  2014,  the Financial  Stability  Board  (FSB)  published  for  public  consultation  a term  sheet  proposing  a  'Pillar  1'  type  requirement  regarding loss-absorbing  capacity  in  the  event  of  resolution.  This  new requirement  only  applies  to  G-SIBs  (Global  Systemically  Important Banks). It  is  a  ratio  of  liabilities  considered  to  be  'bail-inable'  in  the event of resolution and calculated with respect to weighted risks or the leverage ratio denominator/uni00A0(Source: Revue de l'ACPR , No./uni00A025).\n\nTransformation risk: appears as soon as assets are financed through resources with a different maturity. Due to their traditional activity of transforming  resources  with  a  short  maturity  into  longer-term maturities,  banks  are  naturally  faced  with  transformation  risk  which itself  leads  to  liquidity  and  interest-rate  risk.  Transformation  occurs when assets have a longer maturity than liabilities; anti-transformation occurs when  assets  are  financed  through longer-maturity resources.\n\nTreasury shares: shares held by a company in its own equity through one or several intermediary companies in which it holds a controlling share either directly or indirectly.  Treasury  shares  are  excluded  from voting  rights  and  are  not  included  in  the  calculation  of  earnings  per share.\n\nValue at Risk (VaR): composite indicator used to monitor the Group's daily market risk exposure, notably for its trading activities (99% VaR in accordance with the internal regulatory model). It corresponds to the greatest  risk  calculated  after  eliminating  the  top  1%  of  most unfavourable occurrences observed over a one-year period. Within the framework  described  above,  it  corresponds  to  the  average  of  the second and third largest losses computed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9",
