        "page_content": "## Chairman's statement\n\nIn 2021, Rio Tinto focused on rebuilding relationships and strengthening our social licence, while producing record financial results as the developed world and China recovered strongly from the economic dislocation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring the first half of 2021, the Board appointed Jakob Stausholm as Chief Executive and Peter Cunningham as Chief Financial Officer, and nine members of the Executive Committee also took up new roles. After this unprecedented period of management change, consolidation and planning for the future were the major focus during the remainder of the year.\n\nFollowing extensive engagement with management and the Board, the new team led by Jakob established four objectives - to become the best operator; achieve impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials; excel in development; and secure a strong licence to operate. In addition, we introduced three new values - care, courage and curiosity - and a new strategy, including significantly more ambitious targets to address climate change.\n\nWith the new leadership team and a clearly articulated strategy in place, in 2022 we will focus on delivering the strategy, in collaboration with our partners and other stakeholders.\n\n## Safety and wellbeing\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto achieved zero fatalities for a third consecutive year in 2021. This reflects the hard work and dedication of our employees and contractors worldwide. Sadly, however, people are still getting injured at work, so we must remain vigilant and focused.\n\nWhile some countries are gradually adapting to life with COVID-19, the/uni00A0pandemic continues to exact a heavy toll, particularly in developing countries, including Mongolia, South Africa and India, and at our non-managed operations in South America. I am very proud of the care shown by our employees and contractors, for each other and for their local communities, by prioritising safety controls, supporting vaccination programmes and setting up vaccination clinics near many of our operations.\n\nRecognising that our responsibility for ensuring the wellbeing of our employees and contractors extends beyond the traditional areas of health and safety, Rio/uni00A0Tinto launched the Everyday Respect initiative in 2021. The objective is to create a safer, more respectful and inclusive environment by preventing, and improving how we respond to, unacceptable behaviour in the workplace.\n\nI am grateful to Elizabeth Broderick, formerly the Australian sex discrimination commissioner, for advising the Everyday Respect task force that we set up to drive this initiative, and to the more than 10,000 employees and contractors worldwide who participated in listening\n\nsessions and surveys as part of the discovery phase. The findings of the Everyday Respect task force were published in February 2022 and made confronting reading. Having established and acknowledged the extent of the problem, we are urgently implementing the recommendations set out in the report.\n\n## Financial performance, economic contribution and dividend\n\nOur operating and project development performance in 2021 was adversely impacted by COVID-19-related travel restrictions and labour shortages, and the transition to improved communities and heritage management processes in the Pilbara and elsewhere.\n\nNevertheless, the Group achieved record financial results, with underlying earnings of $21.4 billion (2020: $12.4 billion) and net cash generated from operating activities of $25.3 billion (2020: $15.9 billion). Profit after tax attributable to owners of Rio/uni00A0Tinto was $21.1 billion (2020: $9.8 billion) and our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net cash of $1.6 billion (2020: net debt of $0.7 billion). These results reflect the quality of Rio/uni00A0Tinto's assets and strong commodity prices, particularly during the first half of 2021.\n\nThe Group's direct economic contribution to the countries where we operate, including payments to employees, suppliers, governments and shareholders, amounted to $66.6 billion (2020: $47 billion). Corporate tax paid in 2021 was $8.5 billion (2020: $5.3 billion), which when combined with royalties and other taxes, and with our share of taxes and royalties paid by equity accounted units, resulted in payments to governments of over $13 billion (2020: $8.4 billion), including over $11 billion (2020:/uni00A0$6.8 billion) paid in Australia.\n\nIn recognition of this strong performance, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 417 US cents (2020: 309 US cents) and a special dividend of 62 US cents per share (2020: 93 US cents), taking total dividends declared to shareholders this year to a new record of/uni00A0$16.8 billion.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG)/uni00A0credentials\n\nClimate change is the defining issue of our time. In October 2021, Jakob and I travelled to Glasgow for COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference, to meet governments, civil society organisations, financiers and business leaders seeking solutions to the common goal of tackling climate change.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nWhile the UN conference achieved some important breakthroughs, it also underlined the urgent need for greater action if the world is to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement and achieve a just transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nJust two weeks before COP26, we announced our new strategy, setting out our plans for growth in materials, such as copper and lithium, that are essential for the energy transition, as well as significantly more ambitious carbon reduction targets in our operations. We have accelerated our target of a 15% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 2030 to 2025, and established a challenging new target to achieve a 50% reduction by 2030.\n\nTo thrive in the long-term, we need to be part of net zero value chains, particularly for steel and aluminium production, so we also have ambitious plans to work in collaboration with our customers and suppliers to reduce our indirect Scope 3 emissions. In 2019, we established our flagship partnership with China Baowu and Tsinghua University, followed by our partnership with Nippon Steel Corporation in 2020. In 2021 we added two new steel decarbonisation partnerships with POSCO in South Korea and BlueScope in Australia. Our efforts to decarbonise aluminium smelting include scaling-up the breakthrough ELYSIS TM technology, for commercialisation by 2024. We also have the ambition to reduce our shipping emissions intensity by 40% by 2025 and to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nOne of the themes at COP26, and the earlier G7 meeting, was an increasing awareness that constraints in the supply of critical raw materials, such as copper, lithium and certain rare earth elements, potentially threaten to delay the transition to a low-carbon economy. We/uni00A0were disappointed to hear recent announcements by the Government of Serbia in relation to the Jadar lithium project. While the benefits of projects like Jadar are significant and global in enabling the energy transition, we acknowledge the concerns of the local community and have worked hard to mitigate local impacts while maximising the potential social and economic benefits to Serbia. Taken together with the responsible development of the Resolution Copper project in the US, our growing lithium portfolio has the potential to strengthen the resilience of supply chains serving the renewable energy sector and electric vehicle manufacturers.\n\nWe are also evaluating the use of our landholdings to develop verifiable, nature-based carbon offsets for those parts of our business where abatement is technologically challenging or prohibitively expensive. These carbon offset projects also have the potential to deliver significant biodiversity, community and water management benefits. In addition, we/uni00A0are participating in two early-stage carbon mineralisation research projects, in Iceland and the US.\n\nIn September 2021, we published an interim report on our communities and social performance commitments, as we continue to implement the recommendations arising from the Juukan Gorge tragedy. We have initiated numerous other workstreams to strengthen our relations and build mutually beneficial partnerships with Traditional Owners and other Indigenous peoples around the world. Further details are set out on pages 94-95 of this report.\n\n## Leadership, culture and values\n\nFollowing his appointment as Chief Executive on 1 January 2021, Jakob moved rapidly to appoint his new leadership team and to roll out a new development programme for our top managers, designed to achieve a more collaborative, inclusive and effective senior leadership team. Over the coming months, over 400 General Managers will join a similar programme. Their leadership will be crucial as we seek to embed the desired values and behaviours.\n\n## Stakeholder and workforce engagement\n\nDespite the travel restrictions imposed by the pandemic, Board members engaged extensively with stakeholders throughout the year, including having regular updates with shareholders, governments, local communities, and Traditional Owners, and hosting three civil society roundtables, in Australia, Europe and North America.\n\nThe Board expanded its engagement with the workforce, through site visits, in-person and virtual town halls, podcasts, videos, and listening sessions. Feedback from these events suggests that our employees are generally optimistic about the future and the changes taking place across the Group. There is good support for the new leadership team, our new strategy and values, and the Everyday Respect initiative, coupled with a realistic acknowledgement that cultural change takes time and the leadership team will be judged by their actions, not their/uni00A0words.\n\nSadly, we are seeing increasing staff turnover, and usage of our Employee Assistance Programme remains high, reflecting the pressures, both at home and at work, that many of our employees are experiencing, in part because of the pandemic.",

The new team, under Jakob's leadership, has worked tirelessly to ensure a smooth transition and to co-create our new strategy and values. I am very grateful to them and to all our employees and contractors for their hard work and commitment during another challenging, but successful, year.\n\nWe were delighted to welcome Ben Wyatt to the Board in September. Ben's knowledge of finance, public policy, trade and Indigenous affairs has already proved to be invaluable. As previously announced, I will step down as Chairman following the Australian annual general meeting in May 2022. I/uni00A0am delighted that the Board has announced the appointment of Dominic Barton as Chair-designate. Dominic has extensive business and international relations knowledge as well as deep understanding of the linkages between business, governments and society. I wish him every success.\n\n## Reflections and outlook\n\nAs I reach the end of my eight years on the Board, it has been a privilege to be part of the leadership team of this great company and I am proud of the direction that Rio/uni00A0Tinto is taking and of the talent, resilience and enthusiasm of our employees and contractors around the world.\n\nOur third successive fatality-free year underlines our commitment to safety and strengthens a mindset where zero fatalities has become the expectation, not the exception. The Group's response to COVID-19 has also been exemplary. We have kept all our managed operations worldwide running safely and smoothly, protecting thousands of jobs at our suppliers and customers, while safeguarding our employees, contractors and local communities. In many ways, the pandemic brought out the best of Rio/uni00A0Tinto. It was inspiring to see how the organisation pulled together to support each other and their communities.\n\nWe have emerged from the challenges of the last few years with a firm commitment to become a more inclusive, respectful and caring company that values genuine partnerships with all our stakeholders. Our purpose remains to produce minerals and metals essential to human progress, and we/uni00A0have set out a new strategy that seeks to re-establish Rio/uni00A0Tinto as a leader in an industry that has a uniquely important and challenging role to play in creating a sustainable and prosperous future for people and the planet. The strategy is designed to achieve a 50% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050, including breakthrough technology to decarbonise the production of aluminium, one of the most energy-intensive industrial processes in the world.\n\nWe have also increased the diversity of our workforce, our management team and the Board, and have taken important steps to ensure that all our operations provide a safe, inclusive workspace, where everyone can achieve their full potential. And last, but not least, we/uni00A0have produced record financial results.\n\nLet me finish by thanking my colleagues on the Board, and especially Jakob, for their hard work, commitment and dedication to Rio/uni00A0Tinto over the past year and for their insights, advice and support during my time as Chairman.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Simon Thompson\n\nChairman\n\n23 February 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Statement from Dominic Barton, Chair-designate\n\nIt is a great honour to succeed Simon Thompson as Chair of Rio/uni00A0Tinto, starting on 5 May 2022.\n\nI am delighted to be joining the Board of this great, long-standing company of almost 150 years. Rio/uni00A0Tinto truly is a global business, with a dedicated and talented workforce, world-class assets, safe and well-run operations, and a strong balance sheet.\n\nImportantly, Rio/uni00A0Tinto has the opportunity to make a significant contribution to society at a pivotal moment in history - by/uni00A0effectively facilitating the transition to a lower-carbon economy. Through our products, people, partnerships and technologies, we aim to help enable a decarbonising world, while maintaining our focus on capital discipline, pursuing growth, and delivering attractive returns to shareholders.\n\nBuilding even stronger relationships with our customers, partners and local communities will be an important part of this journey, and something that I am particularly passionate about. I am also keen to ensure that we create a safe, respectful and inclusive work environment. I welcome the proactive commissioning and subsequent publication of the recent review into workplace culture at Rio Tinto, and I fully support Jakob and the management team in implementing the recommendations.\n\nThere is much work ahead as we navigate a shifting competitive landscape, grapple with the ongoing pandemic and other societal challenges, reset and strengthen relationships, progress our growth projects, and embed a change in mindset and behaviours throughout the organisation in line with Rio/uni00A0Tinto's new/uni00A0values.\n\nI am encouraged by the company's resolve as it seeks to realise these opportunities, and I look forward to working closely with Jakob Stausholm, Peter Cunningham and my Board colleagues as we implement our strategy. With the new strategic direction that we have set in 2021, I am really excited about the opportunities that lie ahead to deliver sustainable growth for Rio/uni00A0Tinto, our shareholders and our wider stakeholders.\n\n## Dominic Barton\n\nChair-designate\n\n23 February 2022",

Building on our strengths and learning from our past, we are determined to shift the way we see ourselves and the world and ensure that Rio/uni00A0Tinto thrives in the decades to come.\n\nSome of my first actions were to stabilise our company, start to rebuild damaged relationships, and set the overall direction to make Rio/uni00A0Tinto stronger. We implemented the biggest management change in our corporate history and rallied our efforts around four objectives: being the best operator, achieving impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials, excelling in development, and strengthening our social licence.\n\nThe four objectives are underpinned by the launch of our Rio/uni00A0Tinto Safe Production System (RTSPS), our new strategy, and a set of simple values that connect us all as human beings - care, courage and curiosity. I am proud of the depths of talent, energy and commitment in our organisation as well as the progress we made in 2021. I know there is still much to do, and we are all committed to making Rio/uni00A0Tinto an even better/uni00A0company.\n\n## Safety above all\n\nSafety is at the core of how we operate each and every day. Nothing matters more than the safety and wellbeing of our employees and contractors, and I am pleased that we have experienced our third consecutive year with no fatalities at our managed operations. While this is good news, being able to go home to one's family at the end of a shift should be a given, not an achievement.\n\nI was extremely saddened when a colleague from Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) was tragically killed this year in a violent incident off-site. To ensure the safety of our team in South Africa, we/uni00A0made the decision to curtail operations at the site for a number of/uni00A0months.\n\nOur all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) increased slightly in 2021, and we are still seeing situations where colleagues could have died, most often from falling objects or falling from heights. While we have made some safety improvements and are on the right path, every injury is one too many. We fundamentally believe that all incidents and injuries are/uni00A0preventable.\n\nThe ongoing pandemic has touched all of us in some way, affecting both our physical and our mental wellbeing. Sadly, we have lost colleagues around the world to this virus. Many of us also lost family and friends, saw people close to us battling COVID-19, or experienced it ourselves. Our thoughts and condolences go out to the families, co-workers and friends of all those who left us in 2021.\n\nOver the last two years, we have continued to prioritise the safety, health and wellbeing of our people, their families and the communities where we operate. I am grateful for the incredible teamwork, resilience and care across Rio/uni00A0Tinto - prioritising controls, supporting government vaccination campaigns, setting up vaccination clinics near our operations, and working tirelessly to help our colleagues and communities with vital supplies and safety protection, such as in India and South Africa. I am also thankful for all those who sacrificed time away from family for extended periods as a result of COVID-19 restrictions, to help us keep the business running and deliver the products our customers need.",

Profit after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto was $21.1 billion (2020: $9.8 billion) and our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with net cash of $1.6 billion (2020: net debt of $0.7 billion).\n\nAs a result, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 417 US cents per share and a special dividend of 62 US cents per share, resulting in total shareholder returns declared this year of $16.8 billion. This is our highest total dividend ever. We recognise that these strong results were supported by the recovery of the global economy and driven by industrial production, which resulted in significant price strength for our major commodities.\n\n## Best operator\n\nOne of our key objectives is restoring Rio/uni00A0Tinto's reputation as the best operator in the business. We are one of the safest mining companies to work for, with pockets of operational excellence across the business, but we know that we can do better. Through RTSPS, we/uni00A0want to further sharpen the consistency of our performance and unlock real and sustainable improvements at each of our assets.\n\nThis is not a one-off improvement programme, but rather a journey. It/uni00A0is/uni00A0being led by our Chief Operating Officer, Arnaud Soirat, whose extensive experience is invaluable. We have begun developing and implementing RTSPS, which leverages all of our people, empowering them to develop and share sustainable, best practice solutions to define the way we work safely and optimally at Rio/uni00A0Tinto.\n\nIn 2021, we launched RTSPS at five different sites - our copper concentrator at Kennecott; Yandicoogina Fixed Plant and drill and blast at West Angelas, both in the Pilbara; the casthouse system at Grande-Baie in the Saguenay; and the concentrator at Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC). We supplemented these deployments with a series of rapid improvement projects targeting short-term bottlenecks.\n\nWe are very excited about where RTSPS will take us, and we will be launching it at many more of our sites over the coming months. It has a long-term focus as we want to build momentum and ensure we facilitate deployment, maximise value and properly embed the gains for the/uni00A0future.",

        "page_content": "## Impeccable ESG credentials\n\nIf anything became clear in the past year, it is that we must align our business priorities with society's expectations and ensure all of our stakeholders benefit from our success.\n\nSociety is demanding a greater commitment on climate change. I was fortunate to attend COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference, in Glasgow, where engaging conversations with civil society organisations, governments and other companies convinced me more than ever that Rio/uni00A0Tinto is an integral part of the solution. We produce materials that are necessary to the world today - and even more so for the transition to a lower-carbon planet. We recognise that we have a major carbon footprint, with significant Scope 1 and 2 emissions and very material indirect Scope 3 emissions. This is a major challenge but also a major opportunity to urgently decarbonise our business and be part of the solution the world is looking for.\n\nIn 2021, we launched our new business strategy, with the low-carbon transition at its heart. This prioritises the opportunity for growth in the materials that will enable the energy transition and accelerates the decarbonisation of our assets. We brought forward our 15% reduction target for our own Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 2030 to 2025, and we more than tripled the target for 2030, seeking to reduce our carbon footprint by 50%.\n\nTo achieve these targets, we will need to switch to renewable power, electrify processing and run electric mobile fleets, and we intend to invest about $7.5 billion in climate-related projects from now to 2030. These projects deliver a range of returns but overall are positive at a modest carbon price. Most importantly, they safeguard the integrity of our assets over the longer term and reduce the risk profile of our cash flows. Our long-term ambition remains to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nWe recognise that processing our products also generates very material indirect Scope 3 emissions. Over 90% of these Scope 3 emissions are generated in countries that have carbon neutrality pledges and 28% of our iron ore sales are directly to steel producers who have set public targets for their Scope 1 and 2 (our Scope 3) emissions, and have ambitions to reach net zero by around mid-century. In 2022, we commit to engage with all our direct iron ore customers to share information on our respective climate change goals and roadmaps, and actively seek areas of mutual collaboration on pathways to net/uni00A0zero.\n\nDecarbonisation partnerships will be key - and we have seen some great examples in 2021, including with BlueScope and POSCO, to explore low-carbon steelmaking pathways. In addition, we have committed to increasing our research and development spend to speed up the development of technologies to enable our customers to decarbonise.\n\nCulture is key to delivering on our strategy. In 2020, reflecting on how we want to think and act, we began to evolve our culture, striving to become a more outward-looking, humble and humane company. In/uni00A02021, we launched new values that we can all stand by as individuals and as a company - showing care for people, communities and the planet, having the courage to stand up for what we believe in, and being curious and open to diverse ideas and learning continuously.\n\n## 'Our society and our company are both at a pivotal moment in history, with challenges and lots of hard work still ahead. But we are excited about the future.'\n\nAs a company, we have made mistakes and are continuing to learn from these. We believe we can and will do better. That starts with making sure that everyone at Rio/uni00A0Tinto can count on a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace. In 2021, we asked experts Elizabeth Broderick & Co. to conduct an independent study to understand the experiences of our workforce and make recommendations on how we can prevent and respond to harmful behaviours such as bullying, sexual harassment, racism and other forms of discrimination in our business. At the beginning of 2022, we published the findings in a comprehensive report - these findings are deeply disturbing and I offer my heartfelt apology to every team member, past and present, who has suffered as a result of these behaviours. This is not the kind of company we want to be. The report also contained 26 detailed recommendations, all of which we will implement. I am determined that by implementing appropriate actions to address the recommendations, and with the management team's commitment to a safe, respectful and inclusive Rio/uni00A0Tinto in all areas, we will make positive and lasting change and strengthen our workplace culture for the long term.\n\nWe also launched an innovative, company-wide leadership programme focused on developing our most senior leaders to be the best versions of themselves. And in 2022, we have started to extend this programme to the next level of leaders throughout the company. Unlocking their full potential will help foster a high-achieving and caring culture and will be critical in achieving the business objectives and strategy we have set.\n\n## Excel in development\n\nOur strategy also focuses on growing in materials required to support the energy transition, such as copper, lithium, aluminium and high-quality iron ore. This will ensure our portfolio remains relevant and is well-placed to meet the commodity needs of future generations.\n\nOur ambition is to increase our investment in growth capital expenditure to up to $3 billion annually by 2023 to 2024, and to prioritise our investments in commodities that are essential for the drive to net zero. We will look for new options and innovative ways of bringing projects on stream faster, but we will only do this in line with our ESG standards and while maintaining our absolute commitment to capital discipline.\n\nIncluded in the growth capital expenditure is the $2.4 billion committed to funding the Jadar lithium-borates project in Serbia. This project remains subject to receiving all relevant approvals, permits and licences. In January 2022, the Government of Serbia cancelled the Spatial Plan for the Jadar Project and required all related permits to be revoked. We acknowledge concerns from the local communities and are committed to exploring all options. We are reviewing the legal basis of the decision and the implications for our activities and people in Serbia.",

        "page_content": "In support of our commitment to the battery materials sector, in December 2021, we entered into a binding agreement to acquire the Rincon lithium project in Argentina from Rincon Mining, for $825 million. This acquisition is strongly aligned with our strategy to prioritise growth capital in commodities that support decarbonisation and to continue to deliver attractive returns to shareholders. This project holds the potential to deliver a significant new supply of battery-grade lithium carbonate, to capture the opportunity offered by the rising demand driven by the global energy transition.\n\nWe also began to broaden our approach to developing our pipeline of growth options, organic and inorganic. To support our focus on excelling in development, we will further strengthen the capabilities in project development, evaluation and execution required to create the portfolio for the next decade and beyond.\n\n## Social licence\n\nNone of our other objectives described above would be possible without trust, meaningful relationships and mutually beneficial partnerships. This is our social licence to operate. It is judged by others and is essential for our long-term future.\n\nThe 24 th of May 2021 marked one year since the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia. Earlier in the year, I was very grateful to meet with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people on their land and personally express my sincere regret for the damage. Being there with them had a profound impact on me. At the end of 2021, the relationship between the PKKP leadership and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Iron Ore is constructive and considered. Together, we are charting new territory. This takes time, but we are moving forward on a model which is respectful and looks to provide certainty of protection for cultural heritage and mining.\n\nThroughout the year, my colleagues and I reflected on how we interact with others, and we invested significant time and effort in resetting relationships and developing stronger connections. In my first year as Chief Executive, despite COVID-19 restrictions, I met many external stakeholders, including in Australia, Canada, the US, Serbia, Mongolia, New Zealand and Guinea - I have a deep appreciation for the importance of relationships and genuinely finding out what is on the minds of various stakeholders.\n\nWe continued to work hard to elevate our approach to social performance to the same level as we do with health, safety and environment. And we remained focused on shaping a shared future and ensuring that Indigenous communities and cultural heritage sites, wherever we operate, are treated with the care they deserve.\n\nThese efforts include growing Indigenous leadership, building cultural awareness capability and competency across the Group as well as a number of other actions to strengthen our cultural heritage approach, processes and performance more broadly and increase transparency. In 2021, we released our Communities and Social Performance Commitments Disclosure Interim Report, Rio/uni00A0Tinto's first report dedicated to sharing the progress on these actions.\n\nWe appreciate there is still more work to do. We know this is a long journey, and we are dedicated to working with and earning the trust of our hosts in every region where we operate worldwide.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nIt has been an intense and extraordinary time on many levels. Our society and our company are both at a pivotal moment in history, with challenges and lots of hard work still ahead. But we are excited about the future.\n\nWe have a clear direction and strategy centred on the transition to a low-carbon economy. We are rebuilding relationships and evolving our culture, supported by simple, human values. We have world-class assets, high-quality products and a strong balance sheet. And in my travels in 2021 to our operations such as in Australia, the US and Canada, I was tremendously impressed by our talented and dedicated people, all of whom want to make a difference.\n\nAs we look ahead to our 150 th anniversary in 2023, I want to thank our thousands of employees and contractors as well as host governments and communities, our customers, our shareholders and our partners. You make our success possible, and we are determined to do the right things to succeed together well into the next 150 years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Jakob Stausholm\n\nChief Executive\n\n23 February 2022",

        "page_content": "## Strategic context\n\nOur strategy is informed by a deep analysis and understanding of global megatrends across key dimensions related to geopolitics, society and technology. These trends set the context for our industry and influence commodity choices for the future of our business as well as expectations about how we produce them.\n\n## Geopolitical tensions\n\nEconomic responses to COVID-19 have differed widely and the past year has been marked by supply chain disruptions as returning demand in some jurisdictions occurred concurrently with pandemic-related production losses and logistical issues. This has resulted in uncertainty in the supply of goods and services and considerable price inflation and volatility.\n\nIn recent years, we have witnessed an evolution in the global geopolitical context, marked by an erosion of global trust in elites and institutions and a backlash in some quarters against globalisation. Despite this, we/uni00A0saw some renewed momentum on global collaboration to tackle climate change around the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in 2021.\n\nTensions between the US and China continue to evolve, but their economies remain closely intertwined, resulting in a mix of competition and cooperation dependent on the issues at hand, from technology leadership to climate change. Balancing our relationships with our host country governments and other stakeholders, alongside those with China as a key customer, partner and shareholder, is a strategic priority.\n\n## Climate action\n\nMany countries and companies have announced long-term pledges to achieve net zero emissions. However, these commitments fall short of what is required to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In recognition of this, and faced with increasing societal demands, governments are setting more ambitious targets and creating policies to support the development of low-carbon economies.\n\nEfforts to contain a global temperature rise will create challenges and opportunities for the mining sector, and companies will need to set aside capital to tackle their carbon footprints. This is also important for our customers attempting to reduce their carbon emissions. Failure to achieve targets on time and within budget, coupled with increasing carbon prices and environmental regulations, could result in an erosion of profit, licence to operate and investor confidence.\n\nIncreasing electrification and the construction of renewable energy infrastructure will drive demand for several commodities critical for the energy transition, including lithium, copper, aluminium, green steel and related high-grade iron ore. Meanwhile, demand for fossil fuels is expected to decline as governments and companies strive to meet their carbon emissions reduction targets.\n\n## Sustainable value chains\n\nWhile a lot of focus has been on reducing carbon emissions, there has been a more holistic shift towards increasingly transparent, sustainable and circular value chains. This is encouraging companies to improve their performance across a broad range of sustainability metrics and map their contributions towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).\n\nAn emerging theme in the development of more sustainable value chains is the circular economy, which is built around the principles of designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. The concept offers a transition away from linear 'take-make-use-dispose' value chains to building more sustainable and resilient supply ecosystems.\n\nThe circular economy presents a risk to primary metal demand growth in some markets, but it also offers unique growth opportunities, from scrap recycling to the monetisation of waste streams. It could also provide a pathway to greatly reduce the environmental and social impacts of metal value chains, while increasing supply security for customers. An/uni00A0increasing number of downstream participants are actively participating in responsible sourcing initiatives (such as the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative and the European Battery Alliance) to/uni00A0help create more ethical and sustainable metal supply chains.\n\n## Convergence of technologies\n\nThe continued development and cost reduction of low-carbon technologies is an ongoing trend that is accelerating many global movements, including the global energy transition and potentially future climate outcomes.\n\n2021 saw unprecedented investment in emerging technologies that could significantly improve the sustainability of the mining sector. These include innovative carbon capture technologies, novel metal-extraction processes (for full-value mining and tailings reuse), innovative electrolyser technologies (for green hydrogen production), biofuels and environmental monitoring solutions.\n\nThe pandemic has also accelerated the use of digital solutions, such as offering customers the opportunity to buy products and conduct end-to-end digital transactions using blockchain technology. This is continuing to improve the efficiency and transparency of global value/uni00A0chains.\n\nIn the mining sector, technology is playing an important role in addressing productivity, growth and sustainability challenges. To find solutions, companies will increase investment in research and development in partnerships with suppliers, technology providers, start ups and other stakeholders across the value chain and other/uni00A0sectors.",

        "page_content": "## Our strategy\n\nIn 2021, we announced a new integrated strategy bringing together a set of new commitments across three pillars of activity with four objectives guiding how we seek to improve our business. We have positioned climate change and the low-carbon transition at the heart of our strategy to strengthen our resilience and pursue new growth opportunities and partnerships. Our culture, underpinned by our new values of care, courage and curiosity, will be a key enabler in the successful execution of our new strategy and the delivery of superior returns to our shareholders and contributions to society.\n\nThe energy transition will create additional demand for our commodities - such as copper, lithium and aluminium. Iron ore will also continue to be an essential raw material for the production of steel, not only for ongoing urbanisation, but also in the development of the infrastructure needed for the low-carbon transition. We expect steel, particularly green steel, to have a bright future as the steel industry decarbonises, supporting stronger demand for high-quality iron ore. Crucially, there are often no alternatives to the commodities we produce.\n\nAt the same time, we are also part of the climate challenge. We have a major carbon footprint with significant Scope 1 and 2 emissions and very material indirect Scope 3 emissions. This needs to change and we are addressing this with urgency, deploying large-scale renewable energy and working in partnerships to develop new low-carbon technologies for both our operations and those of our customers, across our value chains.\n\n## Our new strategy has three key elements:\n\n## Accelerate the decarbonisation of our assets\n\nTo strengthen our alignment with the Paris Agreement and our long-term ambition of achieving net zero emissions by 2050:\n\n- - We/uni00A0are/uni00A0bringing forward to 2025 our previous 2030 target of a 15% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 carbon/uni00A0emissions.\n- - We are more than tripling our previous 2030 target/uni00A0from/uni00A0a 15% reduction to a 50% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions against our 2018 equity/uni00A0baseline.\n\nTo achieve our raised decarbonisation ambition and targets, we will switch to renewables at scale, with a priority focus in the Pilbara. We will accelerate the electrification of our mobile equipment and processes, and empower our people to think differently about energy solutions.\n\nWe expect to invest an estimated $7.5 billion in decarbonisation projects this decade, including around $500 million in each of the next three/uni00A0years.\n\nIn parallel, we will continue to review and enhance the resilience of our assets to physical climate risk.\n\n## Develop products and technologies that help our customers decarbonise\n\nOur products are essential today as enablers of the energy transition and in a net zero world, but we recognise that the processing of our products is resulting in very material indirect Scope 3 emissions.\n\nWe have a role to play in the decarbonisation of the supply chains we are part of, particularly the steel value chain. We will step up our customer engagements to help them meet their Scope 1 and 2 emissions goals and will continue to work towards our 2050 ambition of net zero emissions from the shipping of our products.\n\nWe will increase our investment in research and development to speed up the development of products and technologies that will enable our customers to decarbonise. This includes the continued development of ELYSIS TM for aluminium, finding future pathways for Pilbara ores as the industry transitions to green steel, and studying a hydrogenbased hot briquetted iron (HBI) plant in/uni00A0Canada.\n\nOur effort will require deep collaboration across our industry and beyond, including partnerships with customers, technology providers, research institutes, governments and other stakeholders.\n\n## Grow in materials enabling the energy/uni00A0transition\n\nThe pursuit of the Paris Agreement goals will create additional demand for materials such as copper, lithium, aluminium and high-quality iron ore. These are essential enablers of the energy transition and the development of infrastructure for a low-carbon world.\n\nOur ambition is to increase our growth capital to $3.0 billion annually in 2023 to 2024, depending on opportunities, while continuing to provide attractive returns to our shareholders.\n\nWe will seek to grow further in copper and battery materials, and to bring additional tonnes of high-grade iron ore to market from the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) and the Simandou project in Guinea.\n\nWe will continue to align our exploration spend to supplement our existing growth/uni00A0pipeline.",

        "page_content": "## Our stakeholders\n\nOur business touches the lives of many people around the world. Partnerships and collaboration are essential to the long-term success of our business; they give us a competitive edge and allow us to work more thoughtfully and responsibly. We work with technology experts, universities, suppliers, governments, community groups, industry leaders and civil society organisations at all stages of the mining lifecycle, from exploration to rehabilitation and closure. By continuously engaging with our stakeholders and listening to their views, we can make a more meaningful contribution to society while becoming a more valuable company for our shareholders.\n\n## Workforce\n\nIn 2021, we focused on providing support and care to our people as we continued to face challenges and fatigue due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated disruptions.\n\nWe also made progress in our efforts to create a more respectful workplace by changing the way we engage, interact and operate. Our/uni00A0people are driving the operational and cultural change that we need to become the best/uni00A0operator.\n\nIn 2021, we launched our new values and strategy, with our people at the centre. We believe that our values of care, courage and curiosity will drive superior performance by enabling our people and guiding our decisions and behaviours. We recognise that embedding our values will not happen overnight, and that it is part of a cultural shift that will take time. This will be a main focus for 2022.\n\nEmpowered and engaged people are key to our success. In 2021, we/uni00A0spent a lot of time listening and reflecting on how we can do better. To understand people's experiences of sexual harassment, bullying and racism in the workplace, we launched the Everyday Respect task force and initiated a comprehensive, independent review of our workplace culture. Following the feedback from more than 10,000 of our people, we have set out an action plan to address these issues. This will, over time, contribute to a safer, more respectful and inclusive work environment.\n\nIn our most recent employee survey, conducted in October and November, we saw that many employees like our new strategy. Our/uni00A0new values of care, courage and curiosity also resonated for many, who felt they have more human connection and show the type of company we want to be. However, our employee satisfaction (eSAT) score has gone down from 73 to 71. This is the first decline since 2017, and it happened across most levels, geographies and parts of the business. This is consistent with what Glint, our survey provider and expert in engagement, is seeing across organisations. After a broad increase in eSAT during the first year of the pandemic, there is a general decline across many organisations as fatigue and workload have increased. We are using these insights to guide our actions to support our colleagues and restore employee satisfaction.\n\nOur priorities for our people focus on improving overall safety performance and health; transforming our culture to make it more inclusive and welcoming; finding ways to simplify work and make it more efficient; developing our leaders; offering competitive pay and benefits; and ensuring work-life balance, including a focus on strengthening mental health.\n\n## Communities\n\nCommunities are the places where we operate, live, work and call home - from the Pilbara, Western Australia, to KwaZulu-Natal, South/uni00A0Africa, to/uni00A0Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec, Canada. Our/uni00A0communities are made up of people - employees, Indigenous peoples, suppliers and neighbours - with whom we strive to build long-term, positive partnerships. Our strength is built upon their strength and we want everyone to have a stake in our success. We/uni00A0recognise that, in parts of our business, we have work to do to meet our own standards on open, transparent engagement. We/uni00A0continue to strive to engage consistently and honestly with communities on issues such as jobs and local procurement as well as the impact of our operations on the local/uni00A0environment.\n\nOur Communities and Social Performance (CSP) Area of Expertise has been set up and follows the same model as our well-established Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSES) function. The CSP Area of Expertise supports and complements our asset-based teams by monitoring external societal trends, developing standards, systems and risk and assurance processes, building capability, and providing strategic and technical subject matter advice. Operational leaders within the product groups now have direct responsibility for building and maintaining relationships with their host communities, including Indigenous peoples, ensuring that they have a voice in our mine planning and decision making.\n\nIn 2021, we continued our work to rebuild trust and strengthen the relationships that were damaged by the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in May 2020. We are engaging with Traditional Owners in the Pilbara to modernise and improve agreements. We are also moving to an informed, consultative approach to mine development, together with a broader partnership which will enhance the protection of heritage and provide better outcomes for both Indigenous peoples and our business.

They/uni00A0raise awareness of key issues, advocate for social change, provide input to policy development, and help to hold businesses and governments accountable for their actions. We believe that preventing and addressing the world's many complex and multifaceted environmental, social and governance challenges, such as climate change, human rights violations and bribery and corruption, can only be achieved through genuine dialogue with civil society organisations and other stakeholders. As/uni00A0a result, we regularly engage with civil society organisations and, although our opinions may differ from time to time, we respect their views and value the challenges they set for us to be better across different areas of our business.\n\nSince 2018, we have held annual roundtables with civil society organisations to listen, learn and understand how we can improve. The/uni00A0roundtables provide an opportunity for us to explore and discuss key social, environmental and economic issues facing society and our business. They also provide an important touch point to sense check the issues that matter most to society and help us to better understand evolving expectations. The roundtables are attended by senior Rio/uni00A0Tinto leadership, including members of the Board and Executive Committee. In late 2021, we held three roundtables across Australia, Europe and the UK, and North/uni00A0America. A wide range of topics was discussed, including climate change, biodiversity and water management, human rights, Indigenous engagement and cultural heritage and transparency. A/uni00A0number of agreements were made regarding information-sharing and follow-up meetings, including smaller sessions where more issue and thematic focused dialogues could take place to advance progress on specific shared challenges. More information can be found on page 141.\n\n## Governments\n\nGovernments - federal, state and provincial, and local - are important stakeholders for our business. We regularly engage with officials at all levels on matters including how we explore, mine and process ore; conditions of land tenure; health, safety and environmental issues, including climate change; securities; taxation; intellectual property; competition and foreign investment; data privacy, conditions of trade and export; and infrastructure access.\n\nWe are proud of the economic contribution our business makes to governments around the world. We were the first company in our industry to disclose our payments to governments in detail, and we have been reporting on our taxes and royalties paid, and our economic contribution, in increasing detail, for more than a decade. Over the past ten years, we have paid $74 billion in taxes and royalties globally, of which 78%, or $58 billion, was paid in Australia. Corporate tax paid in 2021 was $8.5 billion (2020: $5.3 billion), which when combined with royalties and other taxes, and with our share of taxes and royalties paid by equity accounted units, resulted in payments to governments of over $13 billion (2020: $8.4 billion), including over $11 billion (2020: $6.8 billion) paid in Australia. This is important because our businesses' economic contribution to governments and communities supports the basic infrastructure of society - bridges and roads, schools and hospitals - as well as other local development priorities, like job creation and skills training.\n\nAt the global level, we engage with multilateral organisations such as the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the United Nations, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We also engage with multi-stakeholder initiatives in which governments participate, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights. These bodies help to define the industry's operating environment and contribute to joint/uni00A0problem solving.\n\n## Investors\n\nOur investors include pension funds, global fund managers, bondholders, and tens of thousands of individuals around the world, including approximately 25,000 Rio/uni00A0Tinto employees who own shares in the company primarily through myShare, our global employee share plan. They have trusted us with their investment, and in return, they expect their investment to grow. They are also increasingly focused on how that return is made, with a shift toward supporting companies that consider long-term sustainability as part of their operations, and/uni00A0behave responsibly across environmental, social and governance (ESG)/uni00A0measures.\n\nWe engaged with current and potential investors through virtual forums for the majority of 2021, providing an opportunity for meetings with our Executive Committee, the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors. Additionally, our two annual general meetings (AGMs) in the UK and Australia provided an opportunity for all investors to question and engage with the Board. Given the growing importance of issues such as climate change, governance, social performance and environment, we present and engage regularly on these topics.\n\nIn March, we held an investor sustainability seminar focused on our approach to cultural heritage. The Chair of the Sustainability Committee, members of the Executive Committee and subject matter experts provided an update on the actions we are taking to improve the Traditional Owner partnerships and cultural heritage aspects of our business, including in the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Canada. In October, we hosted our Capital Markets Day, with the Executive Committee setting out our long-term vision, including how we will deliver value-adding growth, accelerate the decarbonisation of our portfolio, and continue to pay attractive dividends to our shareholders. In 2022, we will hold further environmental, social and governance forums in response to growing investor interest in the company's progress in a number of areas, including climate change, heritage and communities, closure and/uni00A0environment.\n\nThis stakeholder section, together with our stakeholder pages in the governance section, explains how the Board takes account of stakeholder interests, our/uni00A0'section 172(1)/uni00A0Statement'.",

The/uni00A0minerals and metals we produce and sell to our customers are vital ingredients in meeting this challenge.\n\nThe needs of our customers are central to our operational decision making. Using the insights generated from everything we buy, sell and move around the world, our Commercial team works closely with customers to ensure that we deliver industry-leading products that meet their specific requirements. Our new offering, START/uni00A0Responsible Aluminium, which is the first sustainability label for aluminium using blockchain technology, is just one example of our responsiveness to customer requirements.\n\nBuilding trust with our customers is critical, and it requires us to deliver on our promises consistently, and to act with care, courage and curiosity. For the third year, we asked our customers for their feedback via a survey. The insights from this survey are helping us deliver new and better products and initiatives.\n\n## Suppliers\n\nEngaging with suppliers is an important way in which we can have a positive impact on communities. In the areas where we operate, we work hard to partner with and develop local businesses so they can share in our success. In 2021, we spent $19.4 billion with suppliers globally, including almost A$8 billion in Western Australia.\n\nWe/uni00A0increased our spend with Indigenous suppliers in Australia by 40% from 2020 to 2021 to A$400 million. In Mongolia, between 2010 and the end of 2021, Oyu Tolgoi spent $4.1 billion on national procurement*.\n\nQuality relationships with our suppliers are vital to ensure that we remain at the forefront of technological and market developments, and/uni00A0we continually strive to improve our supplier experiences. As with our customers, we ask our suppliers to participate in a yearly survey to ensure we capture their feedback for improvement. To further support our suppliers, in 2021, we introduced new faster payment terms in Australia to ensure Indigenous, small and regional suppliers are paid more quickly.\n\nWe also continue to engage with both customers and suppliers on innovative climate change partnerships, including with BlueScope in Australia, China Baowu in China, Nippon Steel Corporation in Japan and POSCO in South Korea, to tackle emissions across the steel value chain. On the supplier side we are partnering with Komatsu and Caterpillar on zero-emissions haul trucks. More information on some of these partnerships can be found in the Innovation pages 70-71.\n\n*Oyu Tolgoi's (OT) national procurement figure represents spend with suppliers registered in Mongolia and more than 50% owned by Mongolian citizens. It relates to the OT operations only, and does not include the underground project.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We consider new commodities and products with an understanding of customers' and communities' needs. We are also mindful of our potential future social and environmental impact as well as the diversity and balance of our portfolio.\n\nWith the low-carbon transition at the heart of our business, we will continue to focus our exploration efforts on commodities essential for the energy transition. We are also evaluating emerging opportunities in the circular economy and green energy production.\n\nWe assess each potential opportunity with a focus on risk, potential returns, and long-term value and sustainability. Once we have approved an investment, we design and build each operation, informed by input from our partners and those stakeholders most affected. We aim to develop every potential site with safety as our first priority and to achieve optimal, long-term productivity while minimising risks and our environmental footprint. We also consider closure from the start, in the way we design, build and run every site.\n\nWe work in partnership with a growing network of stakeholders - governments, communities, customers and suppliers - who help expand our understanding, capabilities and, ultimately, our ability to be the best operator and a responsible steward of resources.\n\nWe share best practices across our assets to support safe, productive and environmentally responsible operational performances. Our operations benefit local economies by contributing training and skills development, jobs, taxes and royalties, contracts with local businesses, and social and community investment. We also support the economic diversification of regions where we are based, in alignment with national and regional development plans, ensuring host communities can thrive long after our operations close. Our ambition is for our operations to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nBy understanding and respecting our business partners, employees, communities and the environment, we can create sustainable value for all our stakeholders.\n\nWe align our products with market and customer needs. Our minerals and metals are essential as enablers of the energy transition and are used in a vast array of everyday products - from electric vehicles to smartphones to skyscrapers. The transition to net zero will create additional demand for materials such as copper, lithium, aluminium and high-quality iron ore. We will support growth in these commodities while developing new technologies and products that help our customers decarbonise.\n\nOur network of rail, ports and ships enables us to control end-to-end logistics to deliver our products safely, efficiently and reliably.\n\nWe aim to design and run our assets to create a positive legacy once our mining or processing activity concludes. We engage stakeholders of our sites nearing closure - including Indigenous peoples, government, employees and host communities - and actively involve them in the planning.\n\nEach of our sites has rehabilitation plans that we review every year. Planning and operating with the future in mind is integral to running a safe, responsible and profitable business.\n\n## Underpinned by disciplined capital allocation\n\nOur business is underpinned by a disciplined approach to capital allocation; we strive to use every dollar prudently. Today, our balance sheet is a key strength, providing a resilient platform for strong and consistent shareholder returns, as well as enabling us to invest throughout the commodity cycle.",

Essential capital expenditure to maintain future cash flows remains our priority for capital allocation. It includes sustaining capital to ensure the integrity of our assets, high-returning replacement projects and investment to increase and accelerate decarbonisation. This latter investment is set to rise in line with our strategic priorities, with our focus over the next three years on repowering the Pilbara with renewables.\n\nOur next priority is the ordinary dividend within our well-established returns policy. We then test investment in compelling growth against debt management and additional cash returns to shareholders.\n\nIn 2021, we increased our capital expenditure overall by 19% to $7.4 billion, targeting disciplined investment in key projects and commodities. This was comprised of $0.6 billion of growth capital, $3.3 billion of replacement and $3.5 billion of sustaining capital. Our most significant growth project remains the Oyu Tolgoi copper/gold underground mine in Mongolia where we invested around $0.6 billion, on a 100% basis as we fully consolidate Oyu Tolgoi. Much of the 2021 increase in capital relates to our Pilbara replacement iron ore mines as we ramped up the pace of construction.\n\n## Attractive dividends remain paramount\n\nOur shareholder returns policy dates back to 2016. We have committed to returning 40 to 60% of underlying earnings on average through the cycle, with additional returns in periods of strong earnings and cash generation. It is tried and tested and has resulted in record returns. It is a variable policy, in terms of the absolute number, with the denominator moving up and down, mostly in line with commodity prices.\n\nWe have paid out at the top end of the range for the ordinary dividend at 60% of underlying earnings. Overall, due to our strong cash flows, we have consistently exceeded the policy, with a total payout ratio averaging 74% over the last six years, when you include special dividends and share buy-backs and exclude divestment proceeds. For/uni00A02021, we are returning 79% of underlying earnings to shareholders. This is comprised of the full year ordinary dividend of 793 US cents per share and special dividend of 247 US cents per share, bringing the total dividend to 1,040 US cents, or $16.8 billion. While encouraged by growth prospects in the coming year, we remain vigilant in relation to potential disruption from new COVID-19 variants and geopolitical tensions.\n\nWe see the dividend as paramount for maintaining discipline. Our/uni00A0financial strength means that we can reinvest for growth, accelerate our decarbonisation and continue to pay attractive dividends through the cycle.\n\n## Strong foundation for growth, decarbonisation and shareholder returns\n\nWe have an outstanding foundation of long-life assets, producing vital commodities for a decarbonising world. Our balance sheet is stronger than ever and we have a world-class pipeline of projects.\n\nThis means that we have the financial capacity for our ambition to double investment in value-adding growth and accelerate the decarbonisation of our portfolio, while continuing to pay attractive dividends in line with our policy.\n\nBy accelerating our own decarbonisation transition, we will de-risk the company, generate growth, maintain our financial discipline and enhance our competitive advantage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeter Cunningham\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n23 February 2022",

It is net of an increase in taxes and royalties paid in line with higher profits and a rise in working capital, primarily due to higher iron ore portside inventories following higher volumes of SP10 and constrained availability of high-grade blending stocks in the fourth/uni00A0quarter.\n\n## Net debt turned into net cash at 2021 year-end\n\n($ billion)\n\n## Net debt as at 31 December 2020\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities\n\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nDividends\n\nOther\n\nNet cash as at 31 December 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - $7.4 billion capital expenditure was comprised of $0.6 billion of growth capital, $3.3 billion of replacement capital and $3.5 billion/uni00A0of sustaining capital.

        "page_content": "## Our projects and development options\n\n- - We increased our exploration and evaluation spend by 16% to $726 million in 2021, as we advanced our evaluation projects, progressed our greenfield exploration programmes and unlocked new opportunities.\n- - Commissioning and ramp-up of Pilbara growth and brownfield mine replacement projects has been impacted by ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, including labour access and supply chain quality issues. The latter have been exacerbated by an inability to conduct pre-delivery quality assurance and control at international steel and equipment manufacturers due to limitations on travel.\n- - The $2.6 billion 3 Gudai-Darri greenfield iron ore mine in Western Australia is advancing. The first train was loaded from the mobile crushing and screening facilities in December and first production from the main plant is expected in the second quarter of 2022, subject to the continuing impacts of COVID-19. This first phase of Gudai-Darri, with a 43 million tonne annual capacity, will replace depleting orebodies and provide some incremental capacity.\n- - The $0.9 billion 3 (Rio Tinto share) investment in the Robe River Joint Venture replacement iron ore mines is progressing. First ore at West Angelas (C and D deposits) was achieved in June and are now fully commissioned. First ore at Robe Valley (Mesa B, C, H) was achieved in August. Ongoing Mesa A wet plant construction and commissioning challenges have impacted production ramp-up. New wet plant components are on order and production will operate at a reduced capacity until repairs are completed.\n- - The $0.8 billion 3 Western Turner Syncline phase 2 mine, which will also replace existing iron ore production, achieved first ore in October, following commissioning of the autonomous mining truck fleet. Some residual brownfield plant works are due to be complete during mid-year shutdowns.\n- - Underground operations are now under way at the Oyu Tolgoi underground copper/gold project in Mongolia, following the comprehensive agreement reached with our partners on 25 January 2022. Sustainable production is expected in the first half of 2023, with the capital forecast at $6.925 billion, including $175 million of estimated COVID-19 impacts to the end of 2021 4 .\n- - The $0.9 billion first phase of the south wall pushback at Kennecott in the US, extending mine life to 2026, is now complete and we are gradually accessing higher copper grades. Stripping for the $1.5 billion second phase, extending operations to 2032, remains on track. In July, we announced a $108 million investment for underground characterisation studies: potential underground mining would occur concurrently with open pit operations and result in increased output.\n- - At the Jadar lithium-borates project, we committed $2.4 billion of funding in July, subject to receiving all relevant approvals, permits and licences. In January 2022, the Government of Serbia cancelled the Spatial Plan for the Jadar project and required all related permits to be revoked. We are disappointed by this announcement and are committed to exploring all options and are reviewing the legal basis of the decision and the implications for our activities and people in/uni00A0Serbia.\n- - The Zulti South project at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) in South Africa remains on full suspension.\n- - At the Winu copper-gold project in Western Australia, there has been progress towards securing consent from the Traditional Owners to the Project Agreement in advance of submitting the necessary environmental and regulatory approvals. Drilling, fieldwork and study activities continue to progress to schedule.\n- - At the Resolution Copper project in Arizona, we continue to work with the US Forest Service to secure approval of the Final Environmental Impact Statement. In parallel, mine studies and engagement with the Native American tribes and local communities continue to progress.\n- - At the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, we continue to engage with key stakeholders in-country including the Government of Guinea. We remain committed to an inclusive partnership, seeking mutual and sustainable benefits by developing our project in line with international social and environmental standards. A new drilling programme has commenced, and expressions of interest are being sourced for construction and early development works expected to be carried out in 2022.\n\n## Underlying EBITDA and underlying earnings by product group\n\nUnderlying EBITDA\n\nUnderlying earnings\n\n|                                                                        | 2021       | 2020  Adjusted   | Change   | 2021       | 2020  Adjusted   | Change   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------|----------|------------|------------------|----------|\n| Year ended 31 December                                                 | US$m       | US$m             | %        | US$m       | US$m             | %        |\n| Iron Ore                                                               | 2 7, 5 9 2 | 18,837           | 46%      | 1 7, 3 2 3 | 11,398           | 52%      |\n| Aluminium                                                              | 4,382      | 2,152            | 104%     | 2,468      | 471              | 424%     |\n| Copper                                                                 | 3,969      | 2,084            | 90%      | 1,579      | 754              | 109%     |\n| Minerals                                                               | 2,603      | 1,710            | 52%      | 888        | 580              | 53%      |\n| Reportable segment total                                               | 38,546     | 24,783           | 56%      | 22,258     | 13,203           | 69%      |\n| Other operations                                                       | (28)       | 24               | (217)%   | (84)       | (48)             | 75%      |\n| Inter-segment transactions                                             | 42         | (94)             | (145)%   | 19         | (32)             | (159)%   |\n| Product group total                                                    | 38,560     | 24,713           | 56%      | 22,193     | 13,123           | 69%      |\n| Central pension costs, share-based payments, insurance and derivatives | 110        | 117              | (6)%     | 133        | 118              | 13%      |\n| Restructuring, project and one-off costs                               | (80)       | (133)            | (40)%    | (51)       | (108)            | (53)%    |\n| Other central costs                                                    | (613)      | (545)            | 12%      | (585)      | (455)            | 29%      |\n| Central exploration and evaluation                                     | (257)      | (250)            | 3%       | (215)      | (216)            | -%       |\n| Net interest                                                           |            |                  |          | (95)       | (14)             | 579%     |\n| Total                                                                  | 37,720     | 23,902           | 58%      | 21,380     | 12,448           | 72%      |\n\nThe financial information by Product group has been recast in accordance with the organisational restructure announced on 28 January 2021.

All projects have followed government COVID-19 requirements, while focusing on protecting the wellbeing and health of local communities. In 2021, we continued to prioritise our exploration portfolio, with a particular focus on copper projects in Australia, Canada, United States, Kazakhstan and Zambia and increased activity on greenfield nickel projects in Canada and Finland. We continue to partner with other companies in all regions where we explore: examples are our agreement with KoBold Metals for copper and nickel exploration and our agreement with Western Copper and Gold Corporation, where we made a strategic investment to advance exploration on the Casino copper-gold project located in Yukon, Canada. We also signed a mineral investment contract with the Republic of Angola and Endiama to explore for diamonds, and continued mine-lease exploration at our managed businesses including Pilbara Iron in Australia and Diavik in Canada. We renewed our exploration technology strategy and further invested in technology to support our exploration teams on the ground.\n\n## Commentary on financial results\n\nTo provide additional insight into the performance of our business, we report underlying EBITDA and underlying earnings. The principal factors explaining the movements in underlying EBITDA are set out in this table.\n\n|                                         | US$m    |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|\n| 2020 underlying EBITDA                  | 23,902  |\n| Prices                                  | 17,464  |\n| Exchange rates                          | (606)   |\n| Volumes and mix                         | (583)   |\n| General inflation                       | (690)   |\n| Energy                                  | (398)   |\n| Operating cash unit costs               | (1,051) |\n| Higher exploration and evaluation spend | (101)   |\n| Non-cash costs/other                    | (217)   |\n| 2021 underlying EBITDA                  | 37,720  |\n\n## Strong financial results driven by significant momentum from higher prices\n\nWe have continued to safely run our world-class assets and are working hard to improve our operational performance, despite challenging operating conditions from prolonged COVID-19 disruptions. The recovery of the global economy resulted in significant price strength for our major commodities: we maintained our financial discipline in 2021 and were able to retain around 80% of the benefit from higher prices, achieving record financial results.\n\nThe strong commodity prices drove a $17,464 million uplift in underlying EBITDA compared with 2020. This was primarily from the strength in the Platts index for 62% iron fines, partially offset by a higher proportion of lower quality products/uni00A0(+$11,589 million). Higher London Metal Exchange (LME) prices were the main driver for a significant price uplift for copper (+$1,896 million) and for our Aluminium business (+$3,027 million). We have included a table of prices and exchange rates on page 418.\n\nThe 2021 monthly average Platts index for 62% iron fines converted to an FOB basis was 45% higher on average compared with 2020. There was a strong resurgence in demand for iron ore, with global crude steel production estimated to have grown by 6%. Chinese demand strength was most apparent in the first half of 2021/uni00A0while the recovery in demand for steel and iron ore in developed and other emerging economies maintained its momentum. At the same time, seaborne iron ore supply recovered, albeit at a slower than anticipated rate.\n\nThe average LME price for copper was 50% higher, while the LME aluminium price was 46%/uni00A0higher, compared with 2020. The gold price/uni00A0rose 2%./uni00A0\n\nThe mid-west premium duty paid for aluminium in the US averaged $584 per tonne, 119% higher than in 2020.\n\n## Australian and Canadian dollars strengthened during 2021\n\nCompared with 2020, on average, the US dollar weakened by 9% against the Australian dollar, by 7% against the Canadian dollar and by 11% against the South African rand. Currency movements lowered underlying EBITDA by $606 million relative to 2020./uni00A0\n\n## Lower iron ore sales volumes impact underlying EBITDA\n\nLower sales volumes and changes in product mix across the portfolio reduced underlying EBITDA by $583 million/uni00A0compared to 2020. This was mostly attributable to a 3% decline in iron ore shipments from the Pilbara, as a result of above average rainfall in the first half of the year, our focus on cultural heritage management and delays in growth and brownfield mine replacement tie-in projects. Other key variances included lower volumes at Iron Ore Company of Canada (labour and equipment availability challenges) and reduced copper sales volumes at Escondida (prolonged COVID-19 impact leading to lower recoveries and throughput). These were partly offset by higher product premiums in our Aluminium business, increased gold sales from Oyu Tolgoi (the significant improvement in grades is expected to reverse in 2022) and higher refined copper sales at Kennecott despite a furnace failure in September 2021 (2020 was significantly impacted by an earthquake and a major smelter maintenance shutdown)./uni00A0\n\n- 1. This financial performance indicator is a non-GAAP Alternative Performance Measure (APM). It is used internally by management to assess the performance of the business and is therefore considered relevant to readers of this document. It is presented here to give more clarity around the underlying business performance of the Group's operations. APMs are reconciled to directly comparable IFRS financial measures on pages 343 to 347.\n- 2.  Refer to page 243 for pre-tax analysis of impairment charge.\n- 3.  Potential for capital cost to rise by around 15% due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions on commissioning and ramp-up of Pilbara growth and brownfield mine replacement projects, including labour access and supply chain quality issues. The latter has been exacerbated by an inability to conduct pre-delivery quality assurance and control at international steel and equipment manufacturers due to limitations on travel.\n- 4.  These estimates exclude any impacts of delays to work schedules caused by restricted approved budgets since the start of 2021. This, together with any ongoing COVID-19 impacts, will be assessed following the commencement of underground operations with further updates provided to the market in due course. Panels 1 and 2 studies will be ongoing throughout 2022. Further study work is also under way to assess the extraction methodology and ultimate recovery of the Panel 0 recoverable pillars.",

        "page_content": "## Impact of rising inflation and rebound in energy/uni00A0prices\n\nAverage movements in energy prices compared with 2020 reduced underlying EBITDA by $398 million, mainly due to higher diesel prices for our trucks, trains and ships and an increase in power costs at Kennecott. Rising general price inflation across our global operations resulted in a $690 million reduction in underlying EBITDA.\n\n## Focus on cost control\n\nWe remained focused on cost control throughout the year, in particular maintaining discipline on our long-run fixed costs: however, a rise in our operating cash unit costs reduced underlying EBITDA by $1,051 million (on a unit cost basis) compared with 2020. This reflects fixed cost inefficiencies from the reduction in volumes, along with temporary cost pressures over and above general inflation, reflecting higher market-linked prices for raw materials and the constraints that COVID-19 has placed on resourcing and supply chains. We also made targeted investments in our ESG and CSP teams in 2021, in order to advance our social licence priorities. Unit costs at our Pilbara iron ore operations rose to $18.6 per tonne ($19.1 per tonne including COVID-19 costs) contributing to the variance, reflecting: higher input prices, including labour and explosives, an increase in the mine work index, operational readiness costs for our growth and brownfield mine replacement tie-in projects and fixed cost inefficiencies from lower volumes./uni00A0At our Aluminium business, we incurred cyclical cost increases for coke, pitch and alloys, while our Bauxite business in Queensland experienced higher maintenance costs following overruns on planned shutdowns. These cost pressures were partly offset by fixed cost efficiencies at Oyu Tolgoi in line with higher copper and gold/uni00A0production.\n\n## Increasing our global exploration and evaluation activity\n\nWe increased our exploration and evaluation spend by $101 million, or/uni00A016%, to $726 million. This was focused on our greenfield programmes across 18 countries and our highest value evaluation projects, particularly the Winu copper-gold project in Western Australia, Resolution Copper in Arizona, Simandou iron ore in Guinea and Jadar lithium-borates in Serbia.\n\n## Non-cash costs/other\n\nMovements in non-cash costs, one-off and other items lowered underlying EBITDA by $217 million compared with 2020. This mainly reflected the impact of community disruption at RBM in 2021 (-$162 million); reduced capacity at the Kitimat aluminium smelter (-$280 million) following the strike which commenced in July, with agreement reached in October; and additional provisions (-$218 million), mainly environmental, for our legacy operations and Pacific Aluminium smelters. This was partly offset by the non-recurrence of the pot failures at Kitimat in 2020 ($206 million) and the impact of community disruption at RBM in 2020 ($91 million). COVID-19 costs across the Group were $39 million lower than in 2020.\n\n## Net earnings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n$21.1bn\n\n116% increase\n\n## Net earnings\n\nThe principal factors explaining the movements in underlying earnings and net earnings are set out here.\n\n|                                                                                  | US$m    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| 2020 net earnings                                                                | 9,769   |\n| Total changes in underlying EBITDA                                               | 13,818  |\n| Increase in depreciation and amortisation (pre-tax) in  underlying earnings      | (372)   |\n| Decrease in interest and finance items (pre-tax) in  underlying/uni00A0earnings  | (100)   |\n| Increase in tax on underlying earnings                                           | (3,574) |\n| Increase in underlying earnings attributable  to/uni00A0outside/uni00A0interests | (840)   |\n| Total changes in underlying earnings                                             | 8,932   |\n| Changes in exclusions from underlying earnings:                                  |         |\n| Movement in net impairment charges                                               | 918     |\n| Gain on recognition of a new wharf at Kitimat, Canada                            | 336     |\n| Movement in exchange differences and gains/losses on debt                        | 1,810   |\n| Movement in closure estimates (non-operating and fully  impaired sites)          | (671)   |\n| 2021 net earnings                                                                | 21,094  |\n\n## Depreciation and amortisation, net/uni00A0interest,/uni00A0tax and non-controlling interests\n\nThe depreciation and amortisation charge was $372 million/uni00A0higher than 2020, mainly due to the impact of the stronger Australian and Canadian dollars against the US dollar./uni00A0\n\nLower interest and finance items (pre-tax) were reflective of a lower level of net debt on average during the year, in part due to repayment of $526 million of Euro Bonds, which matured in May 2020. It also reflected more of our debt being at floating interest rates and lower LIBOR rates.\n\nThe 2021 effective corporate income tax rate on underlying earnings, excluding equity accounted units, was 28.0%, compared with 29.5% in 2020, mainly due to the re-recognition of deferred tax assets in Australia. The effective tax rate on underlying earnings in Australia was 30% in 2021 compared with 32% in 2020. We anticipate an effective tax rate on underlying earnings of approximately 30% in 2022.\n\n## Items excluded from underlying earnings\n\nNet impairment charges decreased by $918 million compared with 2020. In 2021, we impaired the value of the Kitimat aluminium smelter by $197 million: as a result of a workforce strike in mid-2021, output was reduced to 25% and ramp-up to full capacity will extend through 2022, giving rise to an impairment test. In 2020, we recognised $1,115 million of impairment charges, consisting of $472 million related to three of our Pacific Aluminium smelters (NZAS, Bell Bay and Boyne), $131 million related to the ISAL smelter in Iceland, $220 million for the Sohar smelter in Oman and $292 million related to our interest in the Diavik Diamond Mine.\n\nThere is a detailed explanation of the impairment process on pages 243 to 245.\n\nOn 3 December, we gained control over a new wharf at Kitimat, Canada that was built and paid for by LNG Canada. The $336 million gain on recognition has been excluded from underlying earnings on the grounds of materiality and linkage to the impairment.",

        "page_content": "In 2021, we recognised non-cash exchange and derivative gains of $546 million. This was mainly on US dollar debt in non-US dollar functional currency Group companies, intragroup balances, and the revaluation of certain derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting. These gains compared with a 2020 loss of $1,264 million, giving rise to a positive year-on-year movement of $1,810 million. The exchange gains are largely offset by currency translation losses recognised in equity. The quantum of US dollar debt is largely unaffected and we will repay it from US dollar sales receipts.\n\nIn 2021, we recognised a $671 million increase in closure costs relating to the Diavik Diamond Mine, Gove refinery, ERA and some of our legacy sites, where the environmental impact preceded our ownership. The adjustments at ERA and the Gove refinery have been recognised in the income statement as these are non-operating sites, and excluded from underlying earnings due to the magnitude of the individual updates and materiality when aggregated. In 2020, we initially recognised an increase in the Diavik closure provision based on\n\nour preliminary findings from the pre-feasibility study. On completion of the study in 2021 a true-up was recorded and has been excluded, in line with the treatment of the initial increase in 2020, which was excluded from underlying earnings as Diavik was fully impaired during the year. Other closure costs excluded in 2020 were the increase in the Gove refinery provision offset by a decrease in the Argyle mine provision on completion of pre-feasibility studies at each site. These are included in Movement in closure estimates. Further analysis can be found on page 240.\n\n## Profit\n\nNet earnings and underlying earnings refer to amounts attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto. The net profit attributable to the owners of Rio/uni00A0Tinto in 2021 was $21.1 billion (2020: $9.8 billion). We recorded a profit after tax in 2021 of $22.6 billion (2020: $10.4 billion) of which a profit of $1.5 billion (2020: $0.6 billion) was attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n\n## Net earnings and underlying earnings\n\nThe differences between underlying earnings and net earnings are set out in this table (all numbers are after tax and exclude non-controlling interests).\n\n|                                                                                                                                         | 2021 US$m   | 2020 US$m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Underlying earnings                                                                                                                     | 21,380      | 12,448      |\n| Items excluded from underlying earnings                                                                                                 |             |             |\n| Impairment charges net of reversals                                                                                                     | (197)       | (1,115)     |\n| Gain on recognition of a new wharf at Kitimat, Canada                                                                                   | 336         | -           |\n| Foreign exchange and derivative gains/(losses) on net debt and intragroup balances and derivatives not qualifying for hedge  accounting | 546         | (1,264)     |\n| Net losses from movements to closure estimates (non-operating and fully impaired sites)                                                 | (971)       | (300)       |\n| Net earnings                                                                                                                            | 21,094      | 9,769       |\n\nOn page 240 there is a detailed reconciliation from underlying earnings to net earnings, including pre-tax amounts and additional explanatory notes. The differences between Profit after tax and underlying EBITDA are set out in the table on page 343.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nNet debt reduced by $2.2 billion in 2021, resulting in a net cash position of $1.6 billion at 31 December 2021. This reflected our strong free cash flow, partly offset by dividend payments of $15.4 billion.\n\nOur net gearing ratio (net (cash) / debt to total capital) improved to -3% at 31 December 2021 (31/uni00A0December 2020: 1%).\n\nOur total financing liabilities excluding net debt derivatives at 31 December 2021 (see page 256) were US$13.5 billion (31 December 2020: $13.8 billion) and the weighted average maturity was around 11 years. At 31 December 2021, approximately 85% of these liabilities were at floating interest rates (94% excluding leases).\n\nOn 28 October, we issued $1.25 billion 30-year fixed rate SECregistered bonds with a coupon of 2.75%. The proceeds of the new issuance were used to fund the early redemption and extinguishment of the company's $1.20 billion 3.75% bonds due to mature in June 2025. The maximum amount within non-current borrowings maturing in any one calendar year is $1.4 billion, which matures in 2024./uni00A0\n\nWe had $15.2/uni00A0billion in cash and cash equivalents plus other short-term cash investments at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: $12.9 billion). In November, we took advantage of strong market conditions and completed the renewal of our $7.5 billion of fully committed Revolving Credit Facilities with 26 participating banks.\n\nThe/uni00A0Facilities remained undrawn throughout the period, mature in November 2026 (previously November 2023) and include two consecutive one-year extension options.\n\n## Provision for closure costs\n\nAt 31 December 2021, provisions for close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations were $14.5/uni00A0billion (31 December 2020: $13.3/uni00A0billion). The principal movements during the year were weaker Australian and Canadian currencies (-$0.5/uni00A0billion), increases in existing and new provisions adjusted to mining properties/uni00A0($0.5/uni00A0billion) and charged to profit ($1.5/uni00A0billion), partly offset by utilisations of the provision through spend (-$0.5/uni00A0billion). Of the $14.5/uni00A0billion in provisions, $10.7/uni00A0billion relates to operating sites and $3.8/uni00A0billion is for legacy sites. Remaining lives of operations and infrastructure range from one to over 50 years with an average for all sites, weighted by present closure obligation, of around 16 years (2020: 17 years).\n\nThe provisions are based on risk-adjusted cash flows using a real-rate discount rate of 1.5% to reflect the obligations at present value.\n\nIn 2022, we expect to utilise around $0.7 billion of the provisions as we advance our closure activities at Argyle, ERA, Gove alumina refinery and legacy sites.\n\nWe have disclosed further information, including the composition of the provision by cost category and by geography, on pages 258 to 259.",

In the Pilbara region of Western Australia (WA), we operate a network of 17 iron ore mines, four port terminals and a rail network spanning nearly 2,000 kilometres. Steel remains essential/uni00A0for ongoing urbanisation and will support the global shift to decarbonise.\n\nWe produce five mainstream iron ore products in WA, including the Pilbara Blend TM , the world's most traded brand of iron ore. Our Iron Ore product group includes Dampier Salt - also in WA - the world's largest exporter of seaborne salt.\n\nOur fully integrated portfolio of quality assets, highly valued product suite and committed people allow us to export our products to our customers safely, reliably and efficiently.\n\nWe continue to transform our safe operating performance by implementing the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Safe Production System (RTSPS). RTSPS will become the blueprint for how we continuously improve our business. In 2021, two of our iron ore operations started RTSPS pilot projects.\n\nWe are focused on building new mines for a better future. In 2021, we progressed the replacement of around 40% of our mine capacity with brownfield mines at Robe Valley, West Angelas and Western Turner Syncline Phase 2, and continued the construction of our most technologically advanced mine, Gudai-Darri. This is the largest mine replacement programme in our history, safely progressed during the pandemic, and it will enable us to continue to deliver the product blends the market needs.\n\nWe commissioned more autonomous haul trucks in 2021 than in any prior year, which means that around 80% of our fleet will be autonomous in 2022. In addition, AutoHaul TM , our automated train network, has delivered benefits beyond expectations.\n\nWe are on a pathway to decarbonising our business with plans to electrify our Pilbara operations. The delivery of one gigawatt of renewables in the Pilbara will support abatement of about one million tonnes of our CO2 emissions. Two-thirds will come from the displacement of power generation gas emissions, and one-third from providing electricity to enable the transition away from diesel.\n\nWith people at the heart of everything we do, nothing is more important than the physical and psychological safety of our people. We are committed to creating a workplace that is safe, respectful and inclusive for everyone, everywhere, and we are taking a number of actions to make this a lived reality for our people.\n\nThe destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in May 2020 was a clear breach of our values. We have redesigned our planning and operational practices to protect heritage sites. This includes removing 100 million tonnes of reserves from our mine plans in the past two years and continuing a process to modernise and strengthen our agreements with Traditional Owners to ensure the destruction of a site of such exceptional cultural and archaeological significance never happens again. We have placed the accountability for Traditional Owner relationships with senior leaders of our Pilbara assets, to create direct partnerships. Read more about our communities and social performance commitments on pages 94 and 95.\n\nWe are committed to continuing to engage with our partners and build the business we need for the future.",

In many applications, there is no viable substitute for steel. The challenge is to remove carbon from the steel manufacturing process, enabling green steel to play a critical role in reducing global carbon emissions. We are committed to developing the technology needed to prepare Pilbara iron ore for a green-steel future.\n\nThe Pilbara, with its natural advantages in solar and wind, is at the forefront of our global plans to decarbonise. We are on a pathway to decarbonise our business through multiple initiatives:\n\n- - We are electrifying our Pilbara operations, including haul trucks, mobile equipment and rail operations, replacing existing emissionsheavy diesel fleets with battery or hydrogen technology, while continuing to produce iron ore for the world's energy transition.\n- - A key focus for the Iron Ore product group will be deploying one gigawatt of renewable energy to power our mining operations and communities in the Pilbara.\n- - The Group's estimated $7.5 billion in capital expenditure to decarbonise our business has a focus on renewable power for iron ore, and we have applications for new tenure to support potential wind power/uni00A0initiatives.\n- - The construction of our first 34MW solar plant at the Gudai-Darri mine is an important step in reducing our carbon footprint in the Pilbara. The average annual emissions savings (battery and solar combined) are equivalent to powering about 6,000 homes.\n- - We are partnering with Komatsu and Caterpillar to fast-track the development and implementation of zero-emission haulage solutions, including haul trucks. To support these partnerships, we are also collaborating with the industry more broadly on the Charge On Innovation Challenge, an innovative problem-solving partnership to develop mobile fleet charging solutions.\n\nImmediate reductions across our iron ore operations will not occur overnight, as research and development, and the deployment of these technologies will take some years.\n\nIn 2021, Iron Ore's absolute greenhouse gas emissions were 3.0Mt/uni00A0CO2e (on an equity basis), an increase of 0.34Mt CO2e compared to the 2018 emissions baseline, driven largely by an increase in diesel emissions due to increased haul distances, pre-strip ratios and material movement.\n\n## Safety and wellbeing\n\nIn 2021, the number of potentially fatal incidents (PFIs) increased by 25% compared to 2020. We are focusing on impactful actions stemming from incident investigations, to ensure learnings are embedded across the business, and we have allocated dedicated resources to address specific critical risks such as falling objects.\n\nThe rate of injuries also increased with our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) at 0.67 for 2021 compared to 0.53 for 2020. The rate of injuries was higher in our contractor workforce than our employees. A tight labour market and onboarding challenges (particularly for our contract partners) contributed to this increase.\n\nSpecific focus areas for 2022 include the safety of our onsite contractors, improving our first line assurance, reducing fatigue risks, and fostering a healthy workplace. We continue to implement the safety maturity model and our mental wellbeing framework to achieve our objective of creating a physically and mentally healthy workplace for our employees and contractor partners.\n\nIn 2021, we conducted planned health and hygiene monitoring for known workplace exposures such as noise and dust. We also continued to assess the individual health status of exposed workers for the purpose of early detection and intervention including hearing and lung function screening. A new periodic medical programme was trialled across two locations, to proactively identify and manage non-work related health conditions with potential safety impacts.\n\nIn October, the WA Government announced COVID-19 vaccinations would be mandatory for workers in the resources industry. As such, all employees, contractors and visitors accessing a Rio/uni00A0Tinto workplace in Western Australia are required to have up-to-date COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nIn 2021, we worked with the WA Government to boost vaccination rates across Western Australia. In partnership with the State Government, we/uni00A0set up vaccination clinics at Perth Airport and regional locations, including Tom Price, Paraburdoo and Pannawonica, helping to vaccinate more than 10,000 of our workforce and community members.",

Shipments were impacted by lower mined production due to aboveaverage rainfall in the first half of 2021, cultural heritage management and delays in growth and brownfield mine replacement tie-in projects.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA of $27.6 billion was 46% higher than 2020, driven by higher prices ($10.3 billion), with a 45% rise in the monthly average Platts index for 62% iron fines adjusted to an FOB basis compared with 2020. This more than compensated for the impact from reduced shipments and rising unit costs.\n\n2021 Pilbara unit cash costs, which were $18.6/uni00A0per tonne (excluding COVID-19 costs of $0.5 per tonne), marginally exceeded guidance of $18.0 to 18.5 per tonne and compared with $14.8 per tonne in 2020 (excluding COVID-19 costs of $0.6 per tonne). Unit cost performance was driven by higher input prices including labour, explosives and energy, a 9% stronger Australian dollar, an increase in the mine work index, operational readiness costs for our growth and brownfield mine replacement tie-in projects and fixed cost inefficiencies from lower volumes.\n\nWe have continued investing in productivity and automation: around 80% of the haul truck fleet is now autonomous.\n\nOur Pilbara operations delivered an underlying FOB EBITDA margin of 76%, compared with 74% in 2020.\n\nWe price the majority of our iron ore sales (77%) by reference to the average index price for the month of shipment. In 2021, we priced approximately 11% of sales with reference to the prior quarter's average index lagged by one month with the remainder sold either on current quarter average, current month average or on the spot market. We made approximately 72% of sales including freight and 28% on an FOB basis.\n\nWe achieved an average iron ore price of/uni00A0$132.3 per wet metric tonne on an FOB basis (2020: $91.0 per wet metric tonne) across our product suite. This equates to $143.8 per dry metric tonne, assuming 8% moisture (2020: $98.9 per dry metric tonne), which compares with the monthly average Platts index for 62% iron fines converted to an FOB basis of $146.9 per dry metric tonne (2020: $101.3 per dry metric tonne). The slightly lower realised price compared to the Platts index was due to the higher proportion of SP10 volumes and the increased discounts for lower grade products, particularly in the second half of 2021.\n\n## Leveraging our success to create value for/uni00A0others\n\nIn 2021, we spent almost A$8 billion on goods and services with more than 2,000 Western Australian businesses, including nearly A$300 million with local Indigenous businesses.\n\nLearn more about how we are working with local businesses at riotinto.com/stories.\n\nGross product sales for our Pilbara operations included freight revenue of $2.7 billion (2020: $1.5 billion).\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities of/uni00A0$19.2 billion was 45% higher than 2020, in line with the movement in underlying EBITDA. Free cash flow of $15.2 billion was 48% higher than 2020, due to a 34% increase in capital expenditure to $3.9 billion, relating to construction of growth and brownfield mine replacement tie-in projects.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nPilbara operations produced 319.7 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share 266.8 million tonnes) in 2021, 4% lower than 2020, for the reasons mentioned above. Ongoing COVID-19 restrictions and a tight labour market have further impacted our ability to access experienced contractors and particular skill sets.\n\nProduction from the new greenfield mine at Gudai-Darri and brownfield mine replacement project at Robe Valley was delayed due to the COVID-19 impact on labour availability and other factors, including/uni00A0an inability to conduct pre-delivery quality assurance and control at international steel manufactures due to limitations on travel. First ore from Gudai-Darri was railed in December from the modular crushing and screening plant installed to supplement production and mitigate commissioning delays. Robe Valley production was significantly impacted by the Mesa A wet plant commissioning delays.\n\n2021 shipments of 321.6 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share 267.9 million tonnes) included 36.6 million tonnes of lower grade SP10 products, 11% of shipments, on a 100% basis (2020: 3%). As growth and replacement mines ramp up through the first half of 2022, we expect to see a gradual decrease in SP10 over the medium term.\n\nWe continue to increase our iron ore portside sales in China, with a total of 14.0 million tonnes in 2021 (2020: 5.5 million tonnes). We experienced increased inventory levels of Pilbara product at the port at December (2021: 8.8 million tonnes, 2020: 1.7 million tonnes), due to higher volumes of SP10 and constrained availability of high grade blending stocks in the fourth quarter. Our portside operation handles product from the Pilbara and Canada as well as third-party product, and provides blending and screening capabilities. Approximately 81% of portside sales in 2021 were either blended or screened in Chinese ports.",

The latter have been exacerbated by an inability to conduct pre-delivery quality assurance and control at international steel and equipment manufacturers due to limitations on travel.\n\nMining and operational readiness activities are progressing at the $2.6 billion 1 Gudai-Darri mine and the railway is operational. The first train was loaded from the mobile crushing and screening facilities in December and first production from the main plant is now expected in the second quarter of 2022, subject to the continuing impacts of COVID-19. This new production hub will be our most technologically advanced, incorporating a processing plant and infrastructure including an airport, camp and a 166-kilometre rail line connecting the mine to our existing network. Once fully commissioned, this first phase will have an annual capacity of 43 million tonnes, replacing depleting orebodies and providing some incremental capacity.\n\nOur $0.8 billion 1 investment in the Western Turner Syncline phase 2 mine, part of Greater Tom Price operations, will facilitate mining of new deposits and includes construction of a new crusher and a 13-kilometre conveyor. The project achieved first ore in October, following commissioning of the autonomous mining truck fleet. Some residual brownfield plant works are due to be complete during mid-year shutdowns.\n\n## Our people\n\nIn 2021, building on the work of the Everyday Respect task force, we took steps towards fostering a psychologically safer work environment.\n\nIn addition to the task force's listening sessions and survey, we further opened up discussions with our teams through the Stop for Respect initiative, where we took the unprecedented step to stop all of our WA operations and projects for at least 30 minutes, allowing people time to reflect on what a respectful workplace is, share stories, and commit to actions to become more respectful and inclusive.\n\nWe also announced our plans to partner across industry, education, government and subject matter experts to design education awareness packages to increase awareness of bullying, sexual harassment, and racism - collectively referred to as Psychosocial Awareness. In time, these packages will be made available across broader industries and shared in other parts of Australia.\n\nWe still have much more to do in this space and we are committed to taking further action on the findings and recommendations outlined in the Everyday Respect report and Inquiry recommendations.\n\nWe are also investing $1.7 billion 1 with our joint venture partners, Mitsui and Nippon Steel Corporation (our 53% share is $0.9 billion), at the Robe Valley and West Angelas operations. First ore at West Angelas C and D was achieved in June, and the mines are now commissioned. At/uni00A0Robe Valley (Mesa B, C, H), the autonomous mining truck fleet has been commissioned. Since achieving first ore in August, ongoing Mesa A wet plant construction and commissioning challenges have impacted production ramp-up. New wet plant components are on order and production will operate at a reduced capacity until repairs are completed.",

A/uni00A0critical material - lightweight and infinitely recyclable -/uni00A0aluminium is found in diverse products ranging from solar/uni00A0panels to electric vehicles and smartphones.\n\nThe aluminium industry is highly energy-intensive and contributes significantly to the world's carbon emissions. Around 60% of the world's smelters currently use coal-based electricity. Decarbonising the industry, therefore, represents significant challenges and opportunities.\n\nWe produce some of the highest-quality, lowest-carbon footprint aluminium in the world. The greenhouse gas emissions intensity of our Canadian smelters is more than 80% lower than the industry average. This is possible in part to our hydro facilities, which we have operated for almost 100 years.\n\nOur ELYSIS partnership with Alcoa, supported by Apple and the Governments of Canada and Quebec, is scaling up a technology with the potential to transform the aluminium industry through a significant reduction in its carbon footprint. In 2021, ELYSIS achieved a key milestone by successfully producing carbon-free aluminium at the Industrial Research and Development Centre in/uni00A0Saguenay.\n\nWork is now focused on accelerating the scale-up of the zero carbon ELYSIS TM technology towards the demonstration of even larger commercial-size cells in 2023. Construction of the first commercial-scale prototype cells using ELYSIS TM inert anode technology has now begun at our Alma smelter in Saguenay-LacSaint-Jean, Quebec, Canada.\n\nIn November, we announced an $87 million investment to increase our low-carbon aluminium production in Canada with 16/uni00A0new smelting cells at our AP60 smelter, in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.\n\nWe continue to partner with governments, organisations and communities to further decarbonise the aluminium supply chain. In/uni00A02021, we developed partnerships in Australia to find ways to repower our smelters and to study the use of green hydrogen to replace natural gas in our alumina refineries.\n\nOur structurally advantaged integrated business includes bauxite mines, alumina refineries and smelters producing aluminium certified as responsible. Managing the process from mine to metal allows us to independently deliver fully traceable products to our customers, reliably and efficiently. In 2021, we launched START, the first sustainability label for aluminium, which is being delivered to customers using blockchain technology.",

Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as underlying earnings excluding net interest divided by average capital employed.\n\n## Enabling the low-carbon transition\n\nAluminium is one of the world's fastest-growing major metals. We/uni00A0produce some of the highest-quality, lowest-carbon footprint aluminium in the world. The Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity of our Canadian smelters is less than one-fifth of the industry/uni00A0average.\n\nOur Aluminium business supports our pathway to zero emissions through several initiatives:\n\n- - Construction of the first commercial-scale prototype cells of ELYSIS TM inert anode technology has now begun at our Alma smelter in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean.\n- - We signed a Statement of Cooperation with the Queensland Government, agreeing to work together to help the Central Queensland region decarbonise. This includes finding the best pathway to repower our Australian smelters to make them more competitive and sustainable.\n- - We are partnering with Carbfix to capture carbon and permanently store it underground at our ISAL aluminium smelter in Iceland.\n- - We began construction of a new 4MW solar farm and battery storage at Weipa. This will triple the local electricity network's solar generation capacity and help provide cleaner power to our operations.\n- - We partnered with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) to research the potential for using green hydrogen to replace natural gas in the calcination process of alumina refining at Yarwun. We partnered with Sumitomo Corporation on a study into building a hydrogen pilot plant at Yarwun.\n\nMore information on Carbfix, ELYSIS and our Yarwun hydrogen partnerships can be found in our Innovation pages 70-71.\n\nIn 2021, our Aluminium business's absolute greenhouse gas emissions (21.9Mt CO2e) were 1% lower than the 2018 equity baseline (22.1Mt CO2e). This reduction includes improvements in processing efficiency, an increased use of hydroelectric boilers in refining, instead of natural gas boilers, and a reduction of production at the Kitimat smelter due to a strike. The 2021 emissions intensity of our managed Atlantic smelters, powered by hydroelectricity, was 2.17t CO2e per tonne of aluminium. Our Vaudreuil alumina refinery has the lowest carbon footprint of any alumina refinery in the world today.\n\n## Safety and wellbeing\n\nIn 2021, the number of potentially fatal incidents (PFIs) more than doubled compared with 2020. Increased incident identification and proactive learning from each has been a positive improvement in the safety culture. Given that falling objects accounted for 60% of the PFIs, a work programme was undertaken at our sites to address overhead asset maintenance. A robust monthly PFI-sharing meeting was also introduced to encourage our people to share learnings across our sites and leverage technical support to the sites as needed.\n\nWe ended 2021 with an all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) of 0.26 among our employees and 0.44 among our contractors. While our overall AIFR decreased to its lowest ever at 0.33, we saw a slight regression for employees when compared to 2020 (0.20) and an improvement for contractors when compared to 2020 (0.57).\n\nWhile 2021 marked the seventh consecutive fatality-free year for our managed operations, sadly a non-managed operation, Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin\u00e9e, experienced three fatalities. We are working closely with the teams on-site to ensure process safety and incident/uni00A0prevention.\n\nWe continued to improve the safety maturity of our sites by emphasising leadership coaching and critical risk management. In/uni00A02021, we completed over 215,000 verifications on critical controls, including more than 39,000 verifications specific to COVID-19.\n\nAluminium has the largest number of water and tailings dams in the company. In 2021, we implemented a telemetry programme across our tailings and water storage facilities to collect measurements and data from remote points and automatically transmit them for monitoring. This/uni00A0work, to be completed by the first quarter of 2022, will ensure that all our major water and tailings facilities have real-time monitoring. We/uni00A0have also begun implementing the new Global Industry Standard in Tailings Management (GISTM), with a particular focus on the community engagement and dam design safety elements.\n\nIn partnership with local governments, we administered more than 18,000 vaccines against COVID-19 to employees, contractors, families and the community at Aluminium-supported vaccination centres in Kitimat and Saguenay, Canada; Queensland, Northern Territory and Tasmania, Australia; and New Zealand.",

This will improve the rigour in our incident investigations to drive to systemic root causes, ensuring that our critical risk controls are regularly and thoroughly verified. Our daily visible leadership in the field will also continue to build trusting, transparent relationships and reinforces safe work behaviours.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nIn 2021, aluminium prices rallied to multi-year highs, following a firm recovery in global demand and extensive power-related supply disruptions in China, which led to a global market deficit. This rebound in sales prices, together with increased demand for value-added product (VAP), were the key drivers for our aluminium business to more than double underlying EBITDA and deliver a substantial increase in cash flow.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA of $4.4 billion, which was 104% higher than 2020, benefited from the stronger pricing environment, in particular for primary metal and alumina, and higher product premiums for primary metal. This was only partly offset by the impact of stronger local currencies, lower bauxite and alumina shipments and cyclical cost inflation for coke, pitch and alloys. This increased our industryleading/uni00A0underlying EBITDA margin to 38%.\n\nWe achieved an average realised aluminium price of $2,899 per tonne, 49% higher than 2020 ($1,946 per tonne). This comprised the LME price, a market premium and a product (VAP) premium. The cash LME price averaged $2,480 per tonne, 46% higher than 2020, while in our key US market, the midwest premium duty paid increased by 119% to $584 per tonne (2020: $267 per tonne). Our VAP sales represented 50% of the primary metal we sold (2020: 43%) and generated product premiums averaging $230 per tonne of VAP sold (2020: $213 per tonne).\n\nWe generated $3.6 billion in net cash from operating activities, reflective of the higher underlying EBITDA achieved, net of a $0.5 billion build in working capital, driven by the higher pricing environment and supply chain constraints. Free cash flow increased by 155% to $2.3 billion.\n\n## Meeting growing demand for transparency and traceability\n\nSTART Responsible Aluminium sets the standard for sustainable aluminium production through transparency, traceability and technology. Key/uni00A0information is provided for ten Rio/uni00A0Tinto Aluminium sustainability criteria, from mine to metal.\n\nLearn more about START at riotinto.com/stories.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nBauxite production of 54.3 million tonnes was 3% lower than 2020 due to severe wet weather in the first quarter impacting system stability throughout the year, equipment reliability issues and overruns on planned shutdowns at our Pacific operations.\n\nWe shipped 37.6 million tonnes of bauxite to third parties in 2021, 4% lower than the same period of 2020 due to the major weather events in the first quarter causing shipment delays. In 2021, gross product sales for bauxite declined 4% to $2.2 billion: this includes freight revenue of $462 million (2020: $423 million).\n\nAlumina production of 7.9 million tonnes was 2% lower than 2020, as a result of outages during the year at the Yarwun refinery in Queensland, Australia and at Vaudreuil refinery in Quebec, Canada. Production at the Queensland refinery remained stable year on year.\n\nAluminium production of 3.2 million tonnes was 1% lower than 2020 due to reduced capacity at our Kitimat smelter in British Columbia following a strike which commenced in July. Agreement was reached with the labour union and employees in October, with a gradual restart in 2022 and full capacity expected to be reached by December 2022. The reduced capacity was partly offset by a robust performance across the remaining smelting portfolio.\n\n## Our principal projects and growth options\n\nAt the Kemano project in Kitimat, British Columbia, where we are constructing a second tunnel to de-risk our 100% owned hydropower facility, the tunnel boring machine is being dismantled and removed following breakthrough in October. Although COVID-19 continues to affect the workforce, completion remains on schedule for the second half of 2022. Total approved capital stands at $0.8 billion.\n\nIn December 2021, we opened a newly extended wharf that will increase the capacity of our port facilities in Kitimat and support economic diversification in Northern British Columbia. The new wharf will be used for imports of alumina, anodes and other supplies, and for exports of low-carbon aluminium made at our BC Works smelter in Kitimat. As the wharf was built and paid for by LNG Canada, when we gained control over it in December we recognised a $336 million gain, which has been excluded from underlying earnings on the grounds of materiality and linkage to the impairment recognised in 2021.",

ELYSIS aims to have its technology available for installation from 2024 and production of larger volumes of carbon-free aluminium approximately two years later.\n\nWe announced an $87 million investment to increase aluminium production with 16 new smelting cells at our AP60 smelter, in the Saguenay. Production will rise by around 45%, or 26,500 tonnes of primary aluminium per year, to a capacity of 86,500 metric tonnes.\n\nWe announced a number of investments to sustain our assets in the Saguenay, including C$92 million to refurbish the Isle-Maligne hydroelectric power station, the oldest in our network, commissioned 95 years ago, and C$105 million to modernise the Port-Alfred port/uni00A0facilities.\n\nAt our Weipa bauxite mine in northern Queensland, construction of a new 4MW solar farm and 4MW/4MWh battery storage commenced, which will triple the local electricity network's solar generation capacity. The new facility will be built, owned and operated by EDL and will complement the existing 1.6MW solar farm at Weipa, which was completed in 2015.\n\nWe partnered with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to research the potential for using clean hydrogen to replace natural gas in the calcination process of alumina refining at Yarwun. We are also partnering with Sumitomo Corporation to study the construction of a pilot plant at Yarwun, which could produce hydrogen for the Gladstone Hydrogen Ecosystem.\n\n## Our people\n\nOur priority is to be a people-centric organisation where all employees have a sense of purpose, responsibility and empowerment to make decisions regarding our business. We continue to invest in enhancing the skills and leadership capabilities that influence safety and business performance. In parallel, we are embedding our new core values care, courage and curiosity - to assist in creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable to speak up and challenge.\n\nThe strike and situation in Kitimat is a case where we have a large gap to close. We are committed to implementing a new way of working based on trust where the entire workforce feels listened to and cared for. The cultural reset is under way and has included a reorganisation of the BC Works leadership team. Beyond this, the team is focusing on training, redesigning some operational processes and more structured engagement with the workforce and union leaders.\n\nWe also continued our focus on inclusion and diversity. In 2021, we increased our workforce gender balance by 1.6%, to 16.4%. Over 40% of our senior leadership positions are held by women. Specific actions occurred on all sites across our Atlantic and Pacific operations to increase attraction, development and retention of a diverse workforce at all levels. Our sites in Gladstone introduced a female leadership development pilot to build career pathways and develop the capability of our female talent in frontline leader roles. Our Alma smelter, in partnership with the USW Alma union in Quebec, conducted a pilot to increase female representation by understanding women's experiences, addressing issues and incorporating mechanisms to better integrate and retain them in operations.\n\nIn 2021, our leadership across the organisation committed to improving the psychological safety and wellbeing of our employees through collegiality, feedback and everyday respect. This will remain a focus for the coming years.",

        "page_content": "## Copper\n\nCopper is essential to modern life and plays a fundamental role in creating a sustainable, low-carbon world. Rapid/uni00A0electrification and an increasing adoption of renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, are set to drive greater demand for copper. With assets spanning the globe, we are well-positioned to deliver on this potential.\n\nWe are building on over 100 years of history and experience, with world-class deposits and operations as the bedrock for future growth. Kennecott, our US operation based in Salt Lake City, Utah, has been mining and processing minerals since 1903, with the largest open pit mine in operation in the world and one of only two copper smelters in the US. Kennecott's long history of innovation is set to continue as we explore growth projects for this valuable asset. Building on this experience, we are developing the equally transformational Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in the South Gobi Desert of Mongolia, a project that is almost unrivalled in the industry in its complexity and scale - where we are building one of the largest block cave mines in the world to access an orebody nearly the size of Manhattan island.\n\nAt every site and asset, we maintain a strong focus on innovation and responsible production. We delivered strong safety and financial performance despite significant challenges in 2021, from managing the varying and complex impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic across our global footprint, to major geotechnical issues at Oyu Tolgoi and Kennecott. Our team demonstrated resilience and technical capability in keeping our assets running and our people safe.\n\nWe also continued our focus on safety and wellbeing outside of our operations, strengthening our partnerships with communities, stakeholders and Indigenous peoples with ancestral connections neighbouring our assets - by providing critical support in areas ranging from food security to wildfire response.\n\nAs the world's demand for copper grows, we are ready to grow with it, with a pipeline of growth projects at various stages of development. In Arizona, US, the Resolution Copper project continues to progress through comprehensive and independent social and environmental regulatory reviews. In parallel, we advanced our consultation and partnerships with neighbouring communities and Native American tribes throughout 2021. Of/uni00A0particular note is our partnership with Western Apache tribes and the US Forest Service to implement the Emory Oak Collaborative Tribal Restoration Initiative, centred on advancing Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge.\n\nManagement of Winu, our copper-gold discovery in Western Australia, transitioned from the Exploration group to Copper. Over/uni00A0the year, we have focused on engaging Traditional Owners on project plans, agreements and regulatory approvals while continuing drilling activities. Importantly, we successfully piloted our approach for Net Zero Pathway studies, and developed an assessment methodology for physical resilience to climate change risks, which will be replicated across other assets.\n\nIn addition to copper, our product group also includes the Simandou project in Guinea, the largest known undeveloped high-grade iron ore deposit in the world. High-grade iron ore is a key pillar for the decarbonisation of the steelmaking process, and a critical priority as the world progresses on the road to a low-carbon future.",

Following a reorganisation of the management team in 2021, the Diamonds business is reported within Minerals and the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea is reported within Copper. 2020 comparatives have been adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Enabling the low-carbon transition\n\nCopper plays a key role in electrification and power generation, including renewable energy and electric vehicles. A single 1MW offshore wind turbine uses more than six tonnes of copper, and electric vehicles have a copper intensity three to four times higher than traditional combustion engine vehicles. Across our own operational footprint, we are developing pathways to zero emissions through multiple initiatives, supported by a cross-functional team responsible for identifying a pipeline of emissions reduction projects.\n\n- - In partnership with ENGIE, we completed an emissions reduction pilot study at Winu in early 2021 to better understand existing and emerging technologies for improving renewable power to our operations. Having evaluated the emissions profile and current demands at one of our projects, plans are under way to apply this approach across all Copper assets, expected to be completed in/uni00A02022.\n- - At Kennecott, we are updating eight haul trucks with lower emission engines, as well as conducting a trial to understand the potential for using renewable diesel, for completion in 2022. We also received approval for a 30MW solar power plant to be constructed in two phases: 5MW to be completed by 2023, expanding to 30MW by/uni00A02025.\n- - Following the closure of Kennecott's coal-fired power plant in 2019, the annual 1.5MWh Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) acquired far exceeded Kennecott's requirements. In 2021, we transferred excess RECs from Kennecott to Resolution Copper, resulting in zero carbon emissions from electricity for both assets.\n- - At Oyu Tolgoi, we are working on several initiatives to reduce energy consumption and introduce renewable solutions. Studies on the use of solar power to provide energy to camp areas and other ancillary buildings will be initiated in 2022. In addition, the opportunity for wind-based renewable energy is being explored via a wind feasibility assessment.\n\nIn 2021, our Copper product group's greenhouse gas emissions were 2.2Mt CO2e, a reduction of 1.2Mt CO2e or approximately 35% compared to our 2018 emissions baseline*.\n\n## Safety and wellbeing\n\nOur operations recorded a third fatality-free year, but there was a slight deterioration in other key safety metrics, including a doubling of reported potentially fatal incidents (PFIs) to 18, due in part to improving the culture around reporting and transparency. We ended 2021 with all-injury frequency rates (AIFRs) of 0.25 among employees and 0.17 among our contractors, compared to 0.21 and 0.28 respectively in/uni00A02020.\n\nIn addition, we achieved a significant improvement in the effectiveness of our controls through critical risk elimination and engineering actions. Despite COVID-19 challenges, we completed over 200,000 critical risk management verifications, including over 41,000 COVID-19 verifications.\n\nOur people continued to sustain our operations through the pandemic and we recognise the personal and professional challenges that many have experienced. In line with the Group health and wellbeing frameworks, we built on existing resources to deliver tailored and integrated approaches to improving safety and wellbeing dialogue among our workforce at each of our assets.\n\nCOVID-19 continues to present challenges and our workforce has become fatigued - this was made clear by our People Survey. We are adapting and introducing new workplace procedures to address these challenges, as well as supporting vaccination rollouts across our assets to try to ensure that our workforce remains protected, healthy and safe.\n\n- - At Winu, we piloted a new risk assessment methodology delivered by EY to assess business resilience to potential physical impacts of climate change. The assessment included key climatic variables relevant to the mine site, transportation routes and key infrastructure. The methodology and lessons learned from the Winu pilot will be replicated across our sites and operations on a priority basis beginning in 2022.\n- * The Copper group's carbon emissions are reported on an equity basis and therefore include Rio/uni00A0Tinto's 30% share in Escondida. The new power contract at Escondida, which replaces fossil-fuel based electricity with renewable energy, came into effect in 2021, and is a major contributor to emissions reduction of the Copper group.",

We also benefited from higher sales volumes of refined metal at Kennecott in the US and temporarily higher gold grades at Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia. These compensated for lower volumes at Escondida in Chile, where ongoing preventive measures in response to COVID-19 continued to impact workforce availability. As a result, underlying EBITDA was up 90% to $4.0 billion, with margins rising to 59%.\n\nPrice movements for all products benefited underlying EBITDA by $2.2 billion for the full year. Our average realised copper price increased by 50% to 424 US cents per pound, even before taking into account the provisional pricing benefit to revenues of $246 million in 2021, while the benchmark gold price rose just 2% to $1,799 per ounce. We incurred additional costs related to our response to COVID-19, higher energy costs, notably in the US driven by higher diesel costs, and higher unit costs at Escondida due to lower concentrator throughput. These were offset by an improvement in volumes at Oyu Tolgoi and higher refined copper volumes at Kennecott, despite a furnace failure in September 2021, which was followed by safe restart in October. Downtime in 2020 was more significant, due to an earthquake and a major smelter maintenance shutdown.\n\nOur copper unit costs, at 82 cents per pound in 2021, were 26% lower than in 2020, but marginally above guidance of 75 to 80 cents per pound. Lower throughput and grades at Escondida and higher royalties, in line with stronger prices, at Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi were offset by higher production of copper and, in particular, gold at Oyu Tolgoi, driven by higher grades.\n\nWe continue to advance our future evaluation projects, in particular at Resolution Copper in Arizona, at Winu in Western Australia and at the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea.\n\n## A decade of innovation, a lifetime of opportunity\n\nAward-winning copper, enriched communities, an underground oasis, and sustainable cashmere are among the many standout moments during Oyu Tolgoi's first ten years of operation.\n\nLearn more about Oyu Tolgoi at riotinto.com/stories.\n\nWe generated $2.6 billion in net cash from our operating activities, a 168% increase on 2020, from the same drivers as underlying EBITDA and a $0.8 billion increase in dividends from our 30% equity holding in Escondida to $1.4 billion, partly offset by a $0.4 billion tax payment in Mongolia. Free cash flow of $1.3 billion/uni00A0reflected the higher operating cash flow and high level of capital investment ($1.3 billion), mainly relating to the ongoing development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground project, where we have a 34% effective interest but fully consolidate on the basis of management control.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nMined copper, at 494 thousand tonnes, was/uni00A07% lower than 2020, due to lower recoveries and throughput at Escondida as a result of the prolonged impact of COVID-19, partly offset by higher recoveries and grades at Oyu Tolgoi and Kennecott.\n\nKennecott's mined copper production was 14% higher than 2020, with higher grades and recovery but less than expected production due to a slope failure in May. The transition to the south wall is complete, with copper head grade exceeding 0.5% in the second half. Refined copper production was 69% higher than 2020 as a result of improved performance through most of the year relative to 2020, despite the furnace failure in September 2021. The smelter was safely restarted in late October and has been stable since. In 2020, there was significant downtime following an earthquake and major maintenance.\n\nEscondida's mined copper production was 17% lower than 2020, mainly due to 10% lower grade in ore feed to the concentrators, 4% lower throughput and 31% lower recoverable copper in ore stacked for leaching, mostly caused by continuous COVID-19 restrictions in 2021 which impacted mine development due to lower workforce availability.\n\nOyu Tolgoi's mined copper production from the open pit was/uni00A09% higher than 2020 with improved performance, a temporary increase in grades and increased mill feed following geotechnical issues in the first half, partly offset by lower staffing levels due to COVID-19.",

        "page_content": "## Our principal projects and growth options Oyu Tolgoi underground project\n\nThe Oyu Tolgoi underground project in Mongolia is expected to produce 500,000 tonnes of copper per year on average, from 2028 to 2036, from the open pit and underground and an average of around 350,000 tonnes for a further five years (from 2037 to 2041) 1 , compared to 163,000 tonnes from the open pit in 2021. The underground Ore Reserve has an average copper grade of 1.52%, which is more than three times higher than the open pit Ore Reserve, and contains 0.31 grammes of gold per tonne. 2\n\nBy 2030, Oyu Tolgoi is expected to be the fourth-largest copper mine in the world. It is a complex greenfield project comprising an underground block cave mine and copper concentrator as well as an open pit mine which has been successfully operating for ten years. It is also one of the most modern, safe, sustainable and water-efficient operations globally, with a workforce which is more than 96% Mongolian. Since 2010, Oyu Tolgoi has spent a total of $13.4 billion in-country, including $3.6 billion of taxes, fees and other payments to Mongolian national and local governments. The size and quality of this Tier 1 asset provides additional options, which could see production sustained for many decades.\n\nIn December 2021, the updated Resources and Reserves were registered in Mongolia in accordance with Mongolian regulations, and approval from the Mongolian authorities of the 2022 Annual Mine Plan was received.\n\nA comprehensive agreement was reached with all partners on 25 January 2022, resetting the relationship between the partners, increasing the value the project delivers for Mongolia, and allowing underground operations to commence.\n\nAs part of a comprehensive package, Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ) agreed to waive in full, funding balances arising from a carry account loan with Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi (EOT) of $2.4 billion, comprising the amount of common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi LLC funded by TRQ on behalf of EOT to build the project to date, plus accrued interest.\n\nThe Parliament of Mongolia has approved a resolution (Resolution 103) that substantially resolves the outstanding issues that have been subject to negotiations with the Government of Mongolia over the last two years in relation to addressing Parliament Resolution 92 (December 2019).\n\nAn updated funding plan has been agreed to address the current estimated funding requirement for the project. Until sustainable underground production is achieved, Oyu Tolgoi will be funded by cash on hand and rescheduling of existing debt repayments, together with a pre-paid copper concentrate sales agreement with TRQ. This is in line with restrictions on debt financing contained in Resolution 103, passed by the Parliament of Mongolia on 30 December 2021.\n\nRio Tinto and TRQ have amended the Heads of Agreement signed in April 2021 to ensure they appropriately fund Oyu Tolgoi, including seeking to reschedule existing project finance repayments and raising additional supplemental debt on terms acceptable to all the parties, as well as a loan facility from Rio Tinto and up to $1.5 billion of equity offerings by TRQ, with an initial offering of at least $650 million in 2022. The capital forecast stands at $6.925 billion, including $175 million of estimated COVID-19 impacts to the end of 2021 3 , with sustainable production expected in the first half of 2023. A reforecast will be undertaken in the first half of 2022 to determine a revised cost and schedule estimate that will reflect any further COVID-19 impacts; any additional time-based impacts and market price escalation arising from resequencing due to 2021 budget constraints (as a result of the Oyu Tolgoi Board not approving the capital budget uplift at the time the Definitive Estimate was finalised); and updated risk ranging reflecting the latest project execution risks.\n\nThe Oyu Tolgoi Board has also approved the signing of an electricity supply agreement to provide Oyu Tolgoi with a long-term source of power from the Mongolian grid, under terms already agreed with the Government of Mongolia. In meeting Oyu Tolgoi's commitment to sourcing power domestically, we will work with the Government to support long-term renewable energy generation in support of the Mongolian grid. The Government of Mongolia and Oyu Tolgoi are in constructive discussions with the Inner Mongolia Power International Cooperation Company (IMPIC) for an extension of current power import arrangements beyond the current agreement of July 2023. IMPIC has indicated its support for an extension and commercial terms are being finalised.\n\n## Other principal projects and growth options\n\nThe $0.9 billion investment in phase one of the south wall pushback project at Kennecott, extending mine life to 2026, is complete and we are gradually accessing higher grades. The $1.5 billion phase two investment will further extend pre-stripping and support additional infrastructure development, allowing mining to continue into a new area of the ore body between 2026 and 2032, generating attractive returns. Pre-feasibility studies are also being progressed to extend open-pit mining beyond 2032, with a further pushback of the north wall. In July, we announced the approval of a $108 million investment to support an underground mine below the existing open pit, with studies due to be complete by 2024. Potential underground mining would occur concurrently with open pit operations and result in increased copper output.\n\nAt the Resolution Copper project in Arizona, the US Forest Service (USFS) published the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) in January 2021, six months behind the target date in its original project schedule set in 2015 by the Obama Administration. In March 2021, the US Department of Agriculture directed the USFS to rescind the FEIS to allow the agency to undertake further review and consultation. Resolution Copper has used this time to deepen dialogue and partnerships with local communities and Native American tribes, building on the significant consultation undertaken over the past decade.\n\n- 1. The 500ktpa target (stated as recovered metal) for the Oyu Tolgoi underground and open pit mines is underpinned 17% by Proved Ore Reserves and 83% by Probable Ore Reserves for the years 2028-2036. The 350ktpa production target for the following five years is underpinned 18% by Proved Ore Reserves and 82% by Probable Ore Reserves. These production targets have been scheduled from current mine designs by Competent Persons in accordance with the requirements of the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Minerals Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012 Edition (the JORC code).\n- 2.  This information in relation to the underground Ore Reserves was previously reported in the release to the ASX dated 16 December 2020. The Competent Persons responsible for reporting the Ore Reserves were Ferrin Prince and Mark Bixley, Competent Persons, who are a Member and Fellow respectively of The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy. Rio Tinto is not aware of any new information or data that materially affect these Ore Reserve estimates and confirms that all material assumptions and technical parameters underpinning the estimates continue to apply and have not materially changed. The form and context in which the Competent Persons' findings are presented have not been materially modified from the release dated 16 December 2020.\n- 3.  These estimates exclude any impacts of delays to work schedules caused by restricted approved budgets since the start of 2021. This, together with any ongoing COVID-19 impacts, will be assessed following the commencement of underground operations with further updates provided to the market in due course. Panels 1 and 2 studies will be ongoing throughout 2022. Further study work is also under way to assess the extraction methodology and ultimate recovery of the Panel 0 recoverable pillars.",

        "page_content": "There are five different Native American groups, the O'odham, Hopi, Pueblo of Zuni, Western Apache, and Yavapai, who traditionally used and occupied this land, each with unique histories and interactions, cultural traditions, and perspectives on the way of life. The O'odham, Hopi and Zuni have ties to this land dating back thousands of years. From these five groups, there are 11 federally recognised tribes which establishes them as domestic dependent nations within the US with inherent sovereign authority who are part of the formal consultation process, all of whom have different views around this project. We are already progressing partnerships with over half of these tribes and our aim is to have a mutual dialogue with all tribes. For example, in the second quarter of 2021 the USFS, in partnership with Resolution Copper and Western Apache Tribal elders began a restoration effort for Emory Oak trees, guided by Indigenous Traditional and Ecological Knowledge. The project has advanced restoration activities at a dozen priority Emory Oak Groves identified by Western Apache elders on Arizona National Forests, White Mountain Apache Tribal lands and Resolution Copper private property.\n\nIn 2021, we also hosted tribal leaders and elders in our business and local community to share the importance of their culture and acknowledge their ancestral ties to Arizona's landscape. Throughout the year, we continued to support fieldwork by Native American tribal monitors who use traditional knowledge to identify ancestral sites, seeps, springs and medicinal plants on Resolution Copper private lands and partner with us on preservation and co-management approaches.\n\nAt the Winu copper-gold project in the Paterson Province of Western Australia, we continue to actively engage with the Traditional Owners and have begun discussions on the initial scope and mine design with Western Australia's Environmental Protection Authority. We have taken particular care to build transparent, credible and trusting relationships with the Traditional Owners and continue to prioritise building these partnerships moving forward. Drilling, fieldwork and development activities continue to progress to schedule. Timelines to sanction and first production will be disclosed on completion of relevant agreements and permitting processes.\n\nWe continued to engage with the Guinean authorities on potential mechanisms for collaboration on infrastructure development, while seeking mutual and sustainable benefits by developing our projects in line with international social and environmental standards and practices. We have continued to work closely with local communities, supporting them through the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe remain committed to the development of Simandou, one of the world's largest and richest iron ore deposits, demand for which is increasing as steelmakers look to reduce carbon emissions, while delivering benefits to our partners, local communities and the people of Guinea.\n\n## Our people\n\nOur people are a critical differentiator as we future-proof our business and continue the decarbonisation journey. One example this year of our people's role in our future success could be seen at Kennecott, where we are building on a foundation of more than 100 years of pioneering history.\n\nOur Kennecott Concentrator was chosen as the first site across Rio/uni00A0Tinto to test, improve and embed the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Safe Production System (RTSPS). The system is different to what we have tried in the past. This time we are designing and building it from the ground up, with our people's voices being heard right across the business. Critical to our success will be how we lead. Our leaders are becoming coaches so our people have the autonomy they need to make decisions at the right level, to innovate, and to problem solve. Our people are building a production system that simplifies what we do, upskills our workforce in problem solving and brings consistency to our operations by sharing best practices and continuously improving them.\n\nAs we continue to roll out RTSPS, we are building the foundation of a new way of working that is future-ready and brings us together to become the best operator.\n\nAt the Simandou iron ore project 4 in Guinea, technical optimisation work continued in 2021 with the support of China-based institutions and partners. Progress continued on updating and implementing our 2012 Social and Environmental Impact Assessment, alongside a new drilling programme that commenced in the fourth quarter. We established a new office in Conakry to accommodate our expanding in-country team and have issued expressions of interest for construction and early development works and in-country activities to be carried out in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Minerals\n\nOur Minerals portfolio encompasses a global suite of businesses producing materials essential for sustainable development in a decarbonising world. Our products are crucial to a wide variety of industries, ranging from agriculture to/uni00A0renewable energy and electric vehicles.\n\nOur Minerals product group produces high-grade, low-impurity iron ore pellets and concentrate, titanium dioxide, diamonds, and borates from operations in Canada, Madagascar, South Africa and the US. We contribute to Rio/uni00A0Tinto's sustainable growth by unlocking value from our high-grade orebodies and developing new materials. By reprocessing mining waste to extract valuable by-products, we are expanding our frontiers and meeting the increasing demand for critical minerals. We apply innovative technology and processes to deliver products that contribute to a decarbonising and sustainable world.\n\nOur borates business, U.S. Borax, supplies almost 30% of the global demand for borates. It is used in everything from agriculture to fibreglass insulation and in materials for renewable energy for/uni00A0both wind and solar projects.\n\nOur iron and titanium business is a major global producer of high-grade titanium dioxide, with operations in Canada, Madagascar and South Africa. We also operate a metal powder annealing facility in Suzhou, China. Titanium dioxide is used to whiten a wide range of products, from paint and textiles to paper. When it is smelted and processed into metallic form, titanium is light, resilient and corrosion-resistant. The nature of the orebodies allows us to produce by-products such as monazite and scandium.\n\nLocated in northeast Canada, the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) is a fully integrated business with mine, processing, railway, and port facilities. IOC is the leading North American producer and exporter of premium iron ore pellets and high-grade concentrate with some of the lowest levels of impurities in the market.\n\nThe Diavik Diamond Mine is known for its beautiful and sought-after white diamonds. Situated 200km south of the Arctic Circle, Diavik is committed to protecting the biodiversity of this delicate ecosystem. The site is home to an award-winning wind farm that has offset over 28 million litres of diesel since its inception - prioritising environmental sustainability in the way that we mine.\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto's 2021 Argyle Pink Diamonds\u2122 Tender of 70 rare pink and red diamonds delivered the most significant record breaking results in its 38 year history. We will retain and manage the Argyle Pink Diamonds brand and associated intellectual property through a proprietary Argyle pink diamond trading platform, certification processes and ongoing collaborations with trusted/uni00A0partners.\n\nWe have made significant progress across critical minerals that are essential for a low-carbon future through our lithium and scandium projects. This year, we entered into a binding agreement to acquire the Rincon lithium project in Argentina from Rincon Mining, for $825 million. We also committed $2.4 billion to the Jadar lithium-borates project in Serbia. The project remains subject to receiving all relevant approvals, permits and licences. In/uni00A0January 2022, the Government of Serbia cancelled the Spatial Plan for the Jadar project and required all related permits to be revoked. We remain committed to exploring all options and are reviewing the legal basis of the decision and the implications for our activities and people in Serbia.\n\nWe also successfully produced battery-grade lithium from waste rock at a demonstration plant at the Boron mine in California, US.\n\nWe are extracting scandium sustainably from the waste streams of titanium dioxide production, without the need for any additional mining at our new commercial-scale demonstration plant at the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Fer et Titane (RTFT) metallurgical complex in Sorel-Tracy, Quebec. Scandium oxide is used to improve the performance of solid oxide fuel cells and to produce high-performance aluminiumscandium alloys for the aerospace, defence, and 3D printing industries.\n\nLooking ahead, the Minerals product group strives to be a leader in the green economy, a growth contributor, and an employer and partner of choice. Collaboration with our stakeholders, including governments and the communities surrounding our operations, is/uni00A0central to our strategy.",

Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and purchases less sales of other intangible assets.\n- 4.  Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as underlying earnings (product group operations) excluding net interest divided by average capital employed.\n- 5.  Following a reorganisation of the management team in 2021, the Diamonds business is reported within Minerals and the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea is reported within Copper. 2020 comparatives have been adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Enabling the low-carbon transition\n\nThe minerals we produce are essential to a low-carbon future. Our/uni00A0premium iron ore pellets and high-grade concentrate from the Iron/uni00A0Ore Company of Canada (IOC) enable our customers to operate more productively, reduce emissions and produce higher-quality steel for the modern world. With lithium, we will support the growing demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage. We also recover valuable minerals from waste, making the most of what we extract from the ground.\n\nThe Minerals product group supports our pathway to zero emissions through several initiatives:\n\n- - We are investing in battery manufacturer InoBat Auto to support the development of a battery ecosystem in Europe, one of the world's largest and rapidly growing electric vehicle (EV) markets. InoBat is a European-based battery technology and manufacturing company with a battery research and development centre and pilot battery line under development in Voderady, Slovakia. Our investment follows a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed with InoBat in May 2021 to help fund and complete this facility. In our MoU, we have agreed to work together to progress the establishment of a 'cradle-to-cradle' EV battery value chain in Europe - covering the full commodity lifecycle from mining through to recycling of lithium.\n- - We have partnered with the US Department of Energy's Critical Materials Institute (CMI) to develop processes to extract lithium from waste material.\n- - In December, we announced the launch of the construction of the renewable energy plant that will power our QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) operations, with our partner CrossBoundary Energy. The plant will consist of over 18,000 solar panels and four wind turbines. The solar plant is expected to be operational in 2022, and the wind power facility will be completed in 2023.\n- - At the IOC operations in Canada, we are working on developing low-emissions process heat technology, including the trialling of plasma torches.\n- - Our Diavik Diamond Mine reduced diesel consumption by approximately 4.5 million litres in 2021 alone through their awardwinning wind farm. This amount accounts for about 10% of Diavik's annual diesel consumption.\n\n- - Boron in California, US, started to trial the first renewable dieselpowered haul truck in Rio/uni00A0Tinto. Manufactured using organic biomass, the renewable diesel fuel is set to produce up to 80% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than regular diesel on a lifecycle basis.\n- - We are pursuing a project to produce hot briquetted iron (HBI) with high-grade iron ore and hydro-based green hydrogen in Canada.\n- - We are also working on initiatives that will help decarbonise our energy supply in Africa and implement alternative industrial heat sources and reductants for our industrial processes across our/uni00A0operations.\n\nIn 2021, our Minerals product group's absolute greenhouse emissions were 3.4Mt CO2e, a reduction of approximately 8% from 2018 levels. The decrease in emissions was mainly driven by reductions in production and associated energy use at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) due to halted operations.\n\n## Safety and wellbeing\n\nOur Minerals operations recorded notable progress across key safety metrics this year. For a third year in a row, we recorded zero fatalities. The rate of injuries decreased, with our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) at 0.38 compared to 0.43 in 2020. The number of potentially fatal incidents (PFI) was 47% lower than in 2020. For 2021, we had six process safety incidents, up from five last year. Our focus on reducing injuries at the sites results from our continued implementation of best practice standards in health and safety, and completing significant projects to remove our people from hazard exposure. We have thoroughly reviewed our risks across the product group and improved controls to mitigate and manage them. We strongly believe our leaders have a key role in our health and safety performance, and we were able to continue our coaching approach across all our sites despite COVID-19 restrictions. We have also made significant progress with our contractors' safety performance, resulting in an AIFR of 0.22, compared to 0.38 in 2020.\n\nThe QMM team marked a significant safety milestone by reaching, at/uni00A0the end of 2021, 14 million hours worked without lost-time incidents. The RBM team recorded exceptional safety performance with an AIFR/uni00A0of 0.06 in 2021. The Jadar project recorded three years without recordable injuries, and the Borates packaging and distribution facility in Nules, Spain, reached an impressive 25 years without a lost-time incident.",

Sadly, another colleague was killed in a public bus accident near RBM. Our sympathies are with their families and loved ones, and we are offering ongoing support to their families and colleagues.\n\nIn 2022, we will continue to grow our safety culture in line with our safety maturity model (SMM) by learning from the best sites within the business. We will also continue to integrate SMM with our contractors, building on the success of our teams at RBM who reduced the contractors' rolling AIFR from 0.85 in January 2020 to 0.00 in May 2021 and recorded one injury for the contractor workforce in 2021, down from three in 2020. To support our ambition of becoming the best operator, we will also roll out the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Safe Production System (RTSPS), which was launched this year at the Iron Ore Company of Canada.\n\nAs COVID-19 continues to be prevalent in our everyday lives, our teams across all Minerals sites are taking proactive steps to ensure the health and safety of our employees and host communities. We maintain a range of COVID-19 specific measures to align with directives from governments and health authorities in the respective jurisdictions. Our/uni00A0strict COVID-19 protocols allow us to continue to operate while simultaneously reducing the risk of transmission for our employees, contractors and communities.\n\nIn 2021, we supported government vaccination campaigns. For example, in Canada, we partnered with governments, communities and other local businesses to deploy vaccination clinics at our facilities and trained staff to administer doses to employees and members of the/uni00A0communities.\n\n## A critical mineral hiding in the desert\n\nAt our Boron operations in the US, we are testing a process to extract high grades of lithium from waste rock created from over 90 years of mining boron.\n\nLearn more at riotinto.com/stories.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nIn 2021, we benefited from strong market conditions in particular for iron ore pellets and concentrate, but also for titanium dioxide pigment and borates, driven by global economic growth and underpinned by a/uni00A0robust construction market. We also saw a recovery in diamond prices following a pandemic-related build-up of demand and low inventory levels.\n\nThe business continued to comply with government-imposed COVID-19 restrictions, notably in Canada, the US and South Africa./uni00A0At/uni00A0our titanium dioxide business we experienced 9% lower production, as a result of community disruptions and subsequent curtailment of operations at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) in South Africa for around three months coupled with an extended ramp-up period, as well as unplanned maintenance and equipment reliability issues at Rio Tinto Fer et Titane (RTFT) in Canada.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA of $2.6 billion was 52% higher than 2020, primarily due to the strong pricing environment which more than offset the impact of lower volumes, which in turn drove up cash unit costs due to fixed cost inefficiencies.\n\nWe generated net cash of $1.4 billion from our operating activities, and $0.8 billion of free cash flow, 28% and 19% higher than 2020, respectively, reflecting the strong pricing environment and higher dividends paid to holders of non-controlling interests at Iron Ore Company of Canada.",

On 24 August, RBM resumed operations following stabilisation of the security situation, supported by the national and provincial government, as well as engagement with host communities and their traditional authorities.\n\n## Borates\n\nBorates production was in line with 2020 and benefited from improved refinery operating rates following the successful implementation of productivity initiatives supporting system stability.\n\n## Diamonds\n\nOn 18 November, we announced we had become the sole owner of Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest Territories of Canada, continuing its leading role in the Canadian diamond industry. Carats recovered at Diavik were 3% higher than in 2020, due to the increased share of production from November, which offset lower ore grade. The/uni00A074% decline in diamond production reflects the closure of the Argyle mine on 3 November 2020.\n\n## Our principal projects and growth options\n\nThe $463 million Zulti South project at RBM remains on full suspension.\n\nOn 27 July, the Board committed $2.4 billion of funding for the Jadar lithium-borates project in Serbia, subject to receiving all relevant approvals, permits and licences. In January 2022, the Government of Serbia cancelled the Spatial Plan for the Jadar project and required all related permits to be revoked. We are disappointed by this announcement and are committed to exploring all options and are reviewing the legal basis of the decision and the implications for our activities and people in Serbia.\n\nIn December, we entered into a binding agreement to acquire the Rincon lithium project in Argentina, demonstrating our commitment to build our battery materials business and strengthen our portfolio for the global energy transition. Located in the heart of the lithium triangle in Salta Province, Rincon is a long-life, scaleable resource capable of producing battery-grade lithium carbonate. It also has the potential to have one of the lowest carbon footprints in the industry that can help deliver on our commitment to decarbonise our portfolio. The transaction is expected to be complete in the first half of 2022, subject to approval by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board.\n\nAt our Boron operations in California, US, we have successfully produced battery-grade lithium from waste rock at our lithium demonstration plant as part of continued research, development, testing and experimentation of our proprietary technology in this space. The demonstration plant has a design capacity of ten tonnes per year. We are progressing with a feasibility study to evaluate options to expand to a 5,000 tonne per annum capacity.\n\n## Our people\n\nCaring for our people is a top priority. Across Minerals operations and offices, initiatives have been put in place to ensure that our employees feel safe, heard, included and motivated.\n\nOne example is the Women in Mining Forum at our RBM operations in South Africa, sponsored by the site leadership team. Discussion forums between senior management and female employees at the site were held to foster dialogue and identify areas for improvement to break down gender bias and inequality. The forum also spearheaded community initiatives to support young girls attending high school, with care packages and career guidance.\n\nAs a result of these joint efforts, this year's graduate cohort is 70% female. The Imbokodo programme - implemented in 2005 - is a second initiative led by RBM to improve gender diversity in the workplace by providing training and career opportunities to women in our surrounding communities.",

We/uni00A0are the primary interface with markets, customers and suppliers - local, regional and global - through a network of 37,000 suppliers and almost 2,000 customers.\n\nOur Commercial group is focused on building industry-leading customer and supplier partnerships to deliver innovation, ESG leadership, and create future value for the company.\n\nIn 2021, we refocused the Commercial group to prioritise the delivery of marketing and procurement excellence, provide sustainability leadership, drive optimisation across the Group, and establish integrated trading activities.\n\nThis year also saw an increased focus on the Asia region for the Commercial group as our Chief Commercial Officer also became the Group Executive responsible for China, Japan and South Korea.\n\nThe expansion of our marketing activity is helping position us to meet demand for Rio/uni00A0Tinto products driven by customer expectations and consumer behaviour, government stimulus initiatives in response to COVID-19 impacts, and the longer-term opportunities generated by climate change policies.\n\nWe are already seeing enduring market changes - whether it be mechanisms such as premium pricing for green products or demand advantage for low-carbon products.\n\nThere is a growing number of customers who require products to be responsibly produced, and who seek access to favourable green financing or opportunities that mandate green credentials.\n\n## Safety and wellbeing\n\nIn 2021, we continued to focus on the safety and health of our employees, contractors and stakeholders, recording zero fatalities and a 0.07 all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) for the year.\n\nCOVID-19 continues to be a global risk, managed across our workforce and supply chains with appropriate physical mitigations in place; regular facilitated discussions on mental health, resilience and wellbeing; and the collaborative sourcing and delivery of critical health equipment to colleagues and communities in medically underserved regions.\n\nAs our business continues to navigate COVID-19 impacts, we have maintained our strong focus on critical risk management and prevention programmes across areas of greatest exposure. For/uni00A0example, we continue to undertake risk analysis for each of our dangerous goods supply chains, and develop appropriate critical/uni00A0control plans.\n\nIn 2021, the Commercial group successfully managed a maritime fleet of more than 230 contracted and owned vessels. Our Marine team focuses on managing fatal risks by ensuring Critical Control Verifications are performed for all tasks. Over 300,000 operator verifications were performed and recorded during 2021, the highest number within the company during the past 12 months. This has helped our Marine team deliver an outstanding safety performance on our fleet of 17 owned vessels with a zero AIFR for 2021 and 12 months rolling, with the last recordable injury in July 2020. We are working hard with our partners to achieve the same results at our non-managed marine operations where we tragically witnessed three fatalities in 2021 and one in early 2022 on chartered vessels. We started collecting data on these fatalities in 2019, with three fatalities on non-managed vessels in 2019 and 2020.\n\nTo manage risks to seafarers from COVID-19 restrictions on crew changeovers, we continued to work with the industry, our shipowner partners, and regulators to support crew changes and protect crew welfare. This commitment was confirmed when we became a founding signatory to the Neptune Declaration on Seafarer Wellbeing and Crew/uni00A0Change.\n\n## Customer focus\n\nWe continue to lead the industry in the availability of our products, use of secure technology and application of streamlined financial platforms. For/uni00A0example, the increasing use of bonded warehousing and portside sales for our iron ore and aluminium products in China is supporting customer diversity with more than 20 million tonnes of portside iron ore sales achieved.\n\nOur pioneering first paperless iron ore transaction in Chinese renminbi between Rio/uni00A0Tinto and Baosteel last year was recognised for industry excellence at the 2021 Asset Awards, and as one of the best deals from the market by Global Trade Review.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to simplify the customer experience by incorporating secure digital platforms, such as WeChat into our Boron marketing and Ouyeel and EFFITRADE into our iron ore sales.\n\nDuring the year, we celebrated major destination milestones with the delivery of our three billionth tonne of iron ore to China and two billionth tonne of iron ore to Japan.",

We now offer ASI Aluminium from eight smelters.\n\nThe transition to a lower-carbon world also offers us opportunities to grow our business. For example, to meet the growing demand for boron and zinc in fertilisation programmes, U.S. Borax launched two new products - Anhybor TM and Zincubor TM - to help farmers and fertiliser manufacturers unlock crop potential.\n\nWe partnered with Comptech to bring a new generation of aluminium alloys to the market for use in advanced technologies such as electric vehicles and 5G antennas.\n\nWe signed an MoU with InoBat to establish a 'cradle-to-cradle' battery manufacturing and recycling value chain, and we marked the first sale of aluminium-scandium alloys to Amaero for use in 3D printing of industrial products.\n\nWe are also progressing innovative ways to reduce waste from our operations and strengthen our position in the supply of critical minerals by converting it into valuable products and services. Some new potential revenue streams include the extraction of tellurium at Kennecott in Utah, pathways to extract lithium from tailings at Boron in California, and the extraction of high-purity scandium from titanium dioxide production in Sorel-Tracy, Quebec and monazite at QMM in/uni00A0Madagascar.\n\nOur commitment to a sustainable circular economy also included a first-of-its-kind, multi-product collaboration with Schneider Electric.\n\nWe announced the development of zero-emissions technologies and applications for mine-haulage systems with key supplier partners Komatsu and Caterpillar. By 2025, we will be piloting both zeroemissions haul trucks and locomotives with the goal to stop buying new diesel haul trucks and locomotives before 2030.\n\nPartnerships aimed at delivering low-carbon and sustainable value chains have also continued with China Baowu, Tsinghua University and Nippon Steel Corporation, and new ones were created with Sumitomo Corporation, POSCO, the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, BlueScope and others.\n\nMore information on our low-carbon initiatives can be found in the Innovation pages 70-71.\n\n## Market insight and outlook\n\n2021 presented a number of challenges along the path of economic revival, but perhaps most surprising was the breadth of the recovery/uni00A0itself.\n\nFollowing China's remarkable, commodity-intensive recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, other major economies also largely navigated out of the restrictions that impacted economic activity in/uni00A02021.\n\nThe vaccine rollout, while geographically uneven, defied most expectations and, coupled with ongoing accommodative monetary policy, allowed business across much of the world to begin the process of rejuvenation.\n\nUnfortunately, the force of the global recovery caused numerous supply and demand imbalances that tested the world's production, commerce and trade.\n\nAlthough we remain cautious of ongoing supply chain and COVID-19 challenges, we are encouraged by growth prospects in the coming year.",

        "page_content": "## Iron ore\n\nIron ore demand and prices rose to record highs during 2021 as China's imports remained well above one billion tonnes while consumption in the rest of the world largely recovered to pre-COVID/uni00A0levels.\n\nGlobal scrap generation and consumption also regained their pre-pandemic volumes, but significant incremental high-cost iron ore supply was required to balance the market.\n\nThe monthly average Platts Index for 62% iron fines converted to a free on board (FOB) basis rose by 45% (from $101/dmt in 2020 to $147/dmt in 2021 in nominal terms) year on year in order to incentivise the seaborne supply response.\n\nWith the exception of products sold at ports in China, all of our Pilbara products are priced with reference to the 62% index.\n\nThe steel intensity of the global economic recovery also lifted steel prices and steelmaking profitability across regions to record levels, and global crude steel production grew by almost 100 million tonnes year on year - one of its largest absolute annual increments in history to/uni00A0an unprecedented total of almost two billion tonnes.\n\nSteel output in Europe and North America rebounded by 16% and 19% year on year, respectively, and exceeded pre-pandemic levels in India, ASEAN and the Middle East.\n\nOn the seaborne iron ore supply side, the major producers maintained their 2020 aggregate shipments, but volumes remained below those delivered in the 2018 calendar year (pre-Brumadinho tragedy) for the third consecutive year.\n\nThe demand and price premiums for iron ore concentrate and pellets were supported by the recovery in ex-China steel production as steelmakers in developed regions responded to record margins by seeking to ramp up capacity and boost productivity using high-quality raw materials.\n\n## Aluminium\n\nAluminium prices rallied in 2021 to multi-year highs, on firm recovery in global demand, and extensive power-related supply disruptions in China. This led to a global market deficit. Coupled with logistical disruptions, raw materials and energy cost inflation, physical markets remained tight and supportive of higher prices.\n\nAluminium semi-fabricated demand rose by approximately 7% in 2021, following a decline of approximately 4% in 2020. A robust recovery in global demand across end-use sectors, including packaging, transport, building and construction, led the recovery. This was despite the impact of the semiconductor shortage on automotive production.\n\nDemand recovery was notable in Europe and the US, leading to strong value-added products demand for extrusions billet and rolled sheet.\n\nWe expect overall global demand to improve in 2022, but geopolitical risks remain, as well as lower growth in China.\n\nThe global alumina market remains in overcapacity, which led to subdued prices earlier in 2021. However, severe disruptions to refineries in the Atlantic and China led to a spike in prices later in the year, but prices retreated by the fourth quarter on ample supply in/uni00A0China.\n\nChina continues to drive demand in the global seaborne bauxite market as a result of stricter environmental measures and the depletion of domestic bauxite.\n\n## Copper\n\nCopper prices peaked in May at all-time highs (486c/lb LME copper cash, official daily price) driven by renewed speculative interest, declining LME stocks, a weaker dollar and lower production that suggested COVID-related supply problems would persist.\n\nPrices eased over the remainder of 2021, barring a brief spike above 480c/lb in October due to speculation by financial investors and low exchange inventories on the major commodities exchanges of LME, COMEX and SHFE.\n\nDespite headwinds of renewed lockdowns and logistical issues, softening demand and subsequent deterioration in global macroeconomic sentiment, full-year demand surpassed its prepandemic highs.\n\nSupply struggled to keep up with rising demand as the lingering effects of COVID-19, workforce constraints and adverse weather conditions limited operating rates.\n\nSupply growth is expected to pick up in 2022 as projects approved in 2017-2018 enter the market.\n\nCopper inventories are at low levels. Throughout 2021, total visible inventory continued to decline, and Chinese inventories reached the lowest level on record. Stocks in LME warehouses rose with inflows to European warehouses in the first half of the year.\n\n## Minerals\n\nUnderlying demand for titanium dioxide pigment has been strong throughout 2021, underpinned by robust construction. Leading indicators, such as housing starts in the US, suggest continued growth in 2022.\n\nStructural factors relating to orebody depletion remain favourable for high-grade TiO2 feedstock and zircon markets.\n\nLithium prices have risen sharply through 2021 amid accelerated demand and growth projections for electric vehicles. Increased model variety and the adoption of targets to transition to electric vehicles by major economies underpin this growth.\n\nA strong demand uptick for borates in 2021 was driven by economic growth, with specific applications to construction and elevated crop prices. Supply bottlenecks further contributed to market tightness. Underlying fundamentals remain intact for 2022.\n\nIn diamonds, pandemic-related build-up of demand resulted in robust rough sales. Inventory levels dropped to an all-time low, resulting in a recovery in prices.",

Empowering our people to innovate is especially important as we tackle climate change and support our customers on their own journeys to decarbonisation.\n\nIn 2021, we cemented our focus on research and development (R&D) and technology with the appointment of our Chief Scientist and the development of detailed R&D roadmaps to support the delivery of our business priorities. These include technology and inventions that deliver improved health and safety outcomes, productivity benefits and contribute to our climate goals. This year, we progressed both small initiatives and game-changing innovations across each area.\n\n## Improving health and safety through/uni00A0technology\n\nHealth and safety are at the centre of everything we do, and technology solutions remained key in keeping our operations running safely during the year. Some health and safety initiatives included:\n\n- - Investment in personal monitoring technology to help manage the risk of fatigue and heat stress in our workforce, particularly important where our people are exposed to extreme temperatures and humidity. The technology was tested at our Resolution Copper project in Arizona this year, and the trial identified key learnings and positive outcomes. Further options will be reviewed in future phases.\n- - At Oyu Tolgoi, a pilot for a Vehicle Interaction Management Situational Awareness System. This new system will improve and support underground mine safety by enhancing environmental visibility and awareness for underground mobile equipment operators. The pilot included 26 vehicles and went live as a fully operational safety system in January 2022.\n- - Automation of high-risk tasks to reduce our people's exposure to live-energy sources and confined spaces - two critical fatality risks in our business. For example, our Aluminium business has used robots to complete non-destructive testing as a proof of concept, and drones to inspect confined spaces.\n\n## Working smarter\n\nA strategic priority in 2021 has been to continue our investment in next-generation technologies to deliver greater efficiency and lower production costs. Some initiatives include:\n\n- - Deployment of a decision support and alerting software application across our Pilbara mine operations. This technology puts rich, real-time information into the hands of our frontline mine operations workforce, so they can make more informed and productive operational decisions.\n- - Deployment of the world's first fully autonomous water trucks at Gudai-Darri in the Pilbara, in collaboration with Caterpillar. These joined our autonomous heavy mobile equipment fleet, including haul trucks and autonomous drills.\n- - Application of computer vision, a type of artificial intelligence, on our Kemano T2 hydropower project in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nThis/uni00A0intelligence delivered productivity improvements in our tunnel boring machine as it journeyed through more than seven kilometres of mountainside to ensure the long-term reliability of the power supply for our BC Works smelter in Kitimat.\n\n- - Construction of a tellurium recovery plant at our Kennecott operations. This is part of our commitment to minimise waste streams by optimising extraction from the material we mine and process. An/uni00A0increasingly valuable by-product of copper smelting, tellurium is a critical mineral and an essential component of cadmium telluride, a/uni00A0semiconductor used to manufacture thin film photovoltaic solar panels. The $2.9 million investment has moved tellurium production forward with a commissioning phase that began in 2021. The plant is set to produce approximately ten tonnes of tellurium annually, developing a new US supply stream for the renewable energy industry.\n- - Development of a world-first Jadarite extraction process for our project in Jadar, Serbia. As Jadarite is a new mineral, there was previously no known process to extract it. At our Bundoora Technical Development Centre in Melbourne, Australia we created a pilot plant to develop and test extraction processes and validated a viable process.\n- - We began the design and rollout of the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Safe Production System (RTSPS), which simplifies what we do, frees our people up to innovate, and brings consistency of performance to our operations. Through RTSPS, we make sure our people can contribute to their full potential by upskilling them in problem solving. We are also drawing on data more efficiently to understand asset health, maintenance scheduling and bottleneck solutions, to optimise the end-to-end value chain. We have selected a number of pilot sites across our product groups to progressively test and refine the system as we look to deploy it globally over the next five years.\n\n## Accelerating the net zero transition\n\n## Tackling our operational emissions\n\nWe all have a role to play in addressing the climate challenge, and we know we cannot realise a decarbonised world without significant progress in technology solutions. Partnering with suppliers, industry and other organisations to reduce emissions, as well as growing and developing new markets, remain key components in our decarbonisation journey. Some of our activities this year include:\n\n## Decarbonising power:\n\n- - Long duration energy storage (between eight to 150 hours) will be required as we decarbonise our businesses through the adoption of renewable power from wind and solar sources as they become the dominant source of energy. In 2021, we became an Anchor member of the newly created Long Duration Energy Storage Council, which was launched at COP26. Through the Council, we aim to partner",

This/uni00A0global initiative challenges technology innovators to develop concepts for large-scale haul truck electrification systems to help the mining sector to reduce its consumption of diesel fuel and significantly cut emissions from surface mine operations.\n- -We are also fast-tracking the development of zero-emission mining haulage solutions, including autonomous haul trucks, through partnerships with key suppliers Komatsu and Caterpillar.\n\n## Decarbonising anodes and reductants:\n\n- -ELYSIS marked a significant milestone, successfully producing aluminium without any direct greenhouse emissions at its Industrial Research and Development Centre in Saguenay, Quebec, Canada. ELYSIS is our joint venture with Alcoa, supported by Apple and the Governments of Canada and Quebec.\n\n## Carbon-neutral solutions :\n\n- -We began collaborating with Carbfix, an academic-industrial partnership that has developed a novel approach to capturing and storing CO2. Carbfix will use our land surrounding the ISAL smelter in Iceland for onshore CO2 injection in the world's first carbon mineral storage hub, the Coda Terminal. Liquified CO2 will be captured from European industrial plants' emissions and transported to Iceland by specifically designed ships operating on sustainable fuel.\n\n## Nurturing an innovative culture\n\nAt Rio/uni00A0Tinto, innovation is core to what we do. We/uni00A0are driving change internally, encouraging our people to show care, courage and curiosity through our Pioneering Pitch programme. It is an inclusive, global programme designed to capture our employees' creative ideas and accelerate innovative solutions by providing seed funding to develop those ideas further.\n\nIn 2021, we held our sixth Pioneering Pitch session and funded eight projects for further development. In total, we have funded 47 projects and invested over $8 million in our employees' ideas and projects.\n\n## Learn more about Pioneering Pitch at riotinto.com/stories.\n\n## Partnering to address emissions across our value chains\n\nWe operate in energy- and carbon-intensive value chains particularly steel and aluminium production - and recognise that we have an important role to play in addressing the resulting emissions.\n\nOur approach to Scope 3 emissions is to work in partnership with our customers to support the decarbonisation of their processes. In the steel value chain, our goal is to invest in technologies that could deliver reductions in steelmaking carbon intensity of at least 30% from 2030.\n\nWe are also working in partnerships to develop breakthrough technologies with potential to deliver carbon-neutral steelmaking pathways by 2050. These are subject to deployment by our customers.\n\n## Examples of some initiatives include:\n\n- - Supporting our customers' blast furnace optimisation to enable sizeable potential carbon emission reductions.\n- - Developing three decarbonisation pathways for our Pilbara iron ore:\n- - Iron ore beneficiation and agglomeration with customers and research institutions.\n- - Assessing a mid-grade direct reduced iron (DRI) produced with green hydrogen and processed in an electric melter.\n- - A new low-carbon steel process that aims to replace coking coal with sustainable plant biomass when converting iron ore fines into steel. The patent-pending, laboratory-proven process has been developed over the past decade and is now being further tested in a small-scale pilot plant as the initial step in our scale-up process.\n- - Pursuing a project to produce hot briquetted iron (HBI) with high-grade iron ore and hydro-based green hydrogen in Canada.\n- - In China, we are working with China Baowu, the world's largest steel group, to support low-carbon steelmaking projects and research. The first $5 million committed in 2021 will initially prioritise the development of lower-carbon ore preparation processes. We committed a further A$4.5 million over five years to our partnership with China's Tsinghua University to support research projects at the Tsinghua-Rio/uni00A0Tinto Joint Research Centre for Resources, Energy and Sustainable Development.\n- - Through our memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Japan's Nippon Steel Corporation, we identified areas of mutual interest and are progressing projects in decarbonisation of iron and steelmaking, and shipping.\n\nFurther details on these initiatives can be found in our 2021 Climate Change Report. Our initiatives relating to our products can be found in our Commercial pages 66-68 in this report.",

We spent the year listening, learning and reflecting on who we are as a business, to better understand stakeholder expectations of us and how we can make a more meaningful contribution to addressing some of the world's most urgent challenges.\n\nWe have had some difficult conversations, both within our business and with stakeholders, about our actions, performance and culture. This feedback has helped shape a new direction for our leadership team and our business as a whole.\n\nWe are looking to the future and our role in tackling climate change, as well as the opportunities doing so might bring. The world is not doing enough to reduce carbon emissions and curtail the impact of climate change. Our business strategy, released in October 2021, has sustainability at its core. It sets a new direction for Rio/uni00A0Tinto, and an accelerated timeframe for us to deliver significant reductions in emissions from our operations and our value chain.\n\nIn 2021, we also set a goal to achieve impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials, in line with societal expectations. We know that responsibly managing our business impacts is fundamental if we want to continue to grow and deliver on our strategy.\n\nWe can only achieve this in a culture of care, courage and curiosity - our new values.\n\nWe faced some confronting truths about our culture this year as we worked to better understand people's experiences of bullying, sexual harassment, racism and other forms of discrimination in the workplace through a comprehensive, independent review of our culture. Following the feedback from more than 10,000 of our people, we have set out a plan of action to improve how we prevent and respond to harmful behaviours in the workplace. This will, over time, contribute to a more safe, respectful and inclusive work environment.\n\nWe know we have lots of work to do, but we are optimistic about our future.\n\nOur people demonstrated enormous resilience and commitment as we navigated the second year of the global pandemic, which for many presented even greater challenges than 2020. We continued to work closely with our employees and contractors, communities and governments to protect people's health and safety and facilitate access to vaccinations.\n\nIn 2021, we boosted our in-house expertise and capability across several disciplines, including communities, cultural heritage, social performance and environment, to support our operations. We also reviewed many of our organisational structures, standards and processes to ensure we have the right systems in place to effectively manage our impacts.",

Our business operations also contribute to eight supporting SDGs (3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 15) while SDG 17 (partnerships for goals) reflects our approach to achieving our sustainability objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSDG 12 relates to how we mine, process and produce materials and contribute to ethical global supply chains, including trusted lifecycle assessments. This SDG builds on our existing health, safety, environment and community performance standards and our membership of responsible production and product stewardship programmes. It extends our thinking into how we can, in partnership, accelerate efforts to decarbonise our own operations, and those of our customers, and extract the most value from the materials we produce.\n\n## To further this goal in 2021, we:\n\n- - Announced new climate targets, including new commitments to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030. We also intend to invest an estimated $7.5 billion in climate abatement projects until 2030, including the installation of one gigawatt of solar and wind power in the Pilbara.\n- - Recovered critical mineral by-products from waste across several sites, including tellurium, a critical mineral used in solar panels, from Kennecott, lithium from our Borates business in the US, scandium oxide at Rio/uni00A0Tinto Fer et Titane and monazite at QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM).\n- - Launched START, the first sustainability label for aluminium using blockchain technology, setting a new standard in transparency and traceability for the industry.\n- - Achieved industry and commodity accreditations and certifications, including the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative, the Copper Mark, the/uni00A0Responsible Jewellery Council, and the Mining Association of Canada's Towards Sustainable Mining standard to independently verify our ESG/uni00A0performance.\n- - Signed two memoranda of understanding (MoU) with POSCO and BlueScope to investigate options to decarbonise the steel value/uni00A0chain.\n- - Developed a business model and signed an MoU with our partner RESOLVE to form Regeneration Enterprises, a for-purpose and for-profit company that will combine the re-mining and processing of waste with site closure and rehabilitation, with the ambition to create full restoration outcomes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSDG 8 speaks directly to our values and commitments to creating a safe and inclusive working environment, as well as promoting education and training partnerships that support social and economic development, and help develop skills for the future. We are committed to ensuring Traditional Owners and Indigenous peoples have a stronger voice in the decisions that affect their lands. Alignment with this goal also requires us to think carefully about how the decisions we make today will impact communities in the future.\n\n## To further this goal in 2021, we:\n\n- - Expanded our target of a 2% increase in the number of women in leadership roles, to a 2% increase in women in all roles across our business. We did not meet the target. On a broader level, we increased the representation of women in our workforce by 1.5%.\n- - Committed $50 million in Indigenous leadership development in Australia over five years. In 2021, the number of Australian Indigenous leaders in our business increased fivefold.\n- - Continued our commitment to source and hire locally, wherever possible, through asset-based employment and local procurement targets. For example, in Mongolia more than 96.5% of Oyu Tolgoi's workforce is Mongolian, of which 22% are from the neighbouring communities in our host Umnugovi province. In 2021, 71% of our total operational procurement was spent in-country.\n- - Developed partnerships and contributed $72 million to community programmes covering the health, education, environmental protection, housing, agricultural and business development sectors. Some initiatives included:\n- - A partnership with the Mongolian University of Science and Technology to build the capability of geotechnical and mining professionals in Mongolia.\n- - A partnership with Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi (UQAC) for an institutional research structure dedicated to the indigenisation of higher education focused on training the next generation of Indigenous scientists.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We/uni00A0asked participants what was important to them now, and what they think will be important in five to ten years.\n\nLower materiality\n\nMedium materiality\n\n## Higher materiality\n\n## What is important now\n\nWe found that our top four priority issues were clearly aligned with those of our external stakeholders. Climate change clearly stood out as the most important issue for all of us.\n\nConcerns about climate change extended beyond emissions reduction to the need to consider our impact on nature more holistically, for example, on water and biodiversity, and how resilient the natural environment is to climate-induced change.\n\nRespecting human rights, cultural and heritage site management, and health, safety and wellbeing, were the next most significant topics for both internal and external stakeholders. The safety and wellbeing of our people remains our highest priority and we have, over a number of years, made significant progress in ensuring our people return home safely. Business integrity and governance, and local community relations, remain important topics as we continue to rebuild trust with our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMateriality to Rio Tinto\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## What will be important in the future\n\nOur internal and external stakeholders feel that climate change will only continue to increase in importance over the next decade, as will geopolitical uncertainty, the impact of technology, and end-to-end materials management. Other emerging topics include water management due to the reliance of local communities and mining operations on an increasingly scarce resource, and biodiversity due to the increasing impacts of climate change. Human rights will also continue to be of high importance - it is a critical foundation of our social licence to operate.\n\nIt is also clear that supply chain accountability and ESG transparency are becoming increasingly important to customers, consumers, investors and financial markets, including our insurance providers. As/uni00A0we produce more critical minerals for batteries, electric vehicles and renewable energy technology, there will be a higher burden of proof in value chain provenance.\n\n## Reporting our performance\n\nOur sustainability materiality assessment records the threshold at which an issue or topic becomes important enough to be reported on externally. Not all sustainability-related topics have the same risk profile. A/uni00A0sustainability materiality assessment differs from financial materiality, which may use financial metrics or other quantitative analyses to determine what would be considered a significant or material impact.\n\nAs a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), we commit to reporting on our sustainability performance against Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards (Core option).\n\nThe majority of our sustainability reporting is incorporated into our Annual Report and supplemented by our full Sustainability Fact Book containing current and historical data on topics, including health, safety, environment, climate, communities, human rights, responsible sourcing and transparency. Additional information is available at/uni00A0riotinto.com.\n\n## Governance and assurance\n\nThe Sustainability Committee oversees strategies to manage social and environmental risks, including management processes and standards. The/uni00A0Committee reviews the effectiveness of management policies and procedures relating to safety, health, employment practices (apart from remuneration, which is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee), relationships with neighbouring communities, environment, security and human rights, land access, political involvement and sustainable development. Given its strategic significance, climate change is overseen directly by the Board. See the Governance section (pages 156-158) for more information about the Sustainability/uni00A0Committee.\n\nThis year, KPMG, the Group's auditor, was/uni00A0again engaged to provide the Directors of Rio/uni00A0Tinto with assurance on/uni00A0selected sustainability subject matters.\n\nKPMG's limited assurance statement satisfies the requirements of subject matters 1 to 4 of the ICMM assurance procedure. See pages 153-154 in the Governance section for more information about our external auditors and internal assurance.\n\n## Non-financial information statement\n\nThis section provides information as required by regulation in relation to:\n\n- - Environmental matters - pages 72-89\n- - Our employees - pages 101-103\n\n- Social matters - pages 90-95\n\n- - Human rights - page 104\n- - Corruption and bribery - pages 107-108\n\nOther related information can be found as follows:\n\n- - Our business model - page 23\n- - Principal risks and how they are managed - pages 117-130\n- - Non-financial key performance indicators - pages 24-28\n\n## Notes on data\n\nThe data summarised in this sustainability section relates to calendar years. Unless stated otherwise, parameters are reported for all managed operations without adjustment for equity interests. Where possible, we include data for operations acquired before 1 October of the reporting period. Divested operations are included in data-collection processes up until the transfer of management control.\n\nWe report against the GRI standards and the requirements of other select reporting frameworks, and we reflect the ten principles of the ICMM and the mandatory requirements in the ICMM position statements within our policies, standards and procedures.

Copper, lithium, aluminium and other minerals are essential to increase renewables capacity and for electric vehicles. Steel is an irreplaceable material in many applications, and iron ore is an essential ingredient for the new technologies required to produce green steel.\n\nWe have an important role to play in supporting and enabling the transition to net zero emissions. We will do this by producing materials that are essential to the energy transition, decarbonising our own assets, and partnering to develop the technologies and products that will enable our customers to decarbonise their own processes.\n\nMost of our assets sit in the low end of their commodity carbon intensity curves and 75% of the electricity used at our managed operations is from renewable sources. Our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2021 were 31.1Mt CO2e (2020: 31.5Mt CO2e), 4.3% below our 2018 equity emissions baseline. The reductions achieved since 2018 are primarily the result of switching to renewable electricity contracts at Kennecott in the US and the Escondida mine in Chile (managed by BHP; Rio Tinto owns 30%), and also relate to unplanned operational disruptions in 2021 at Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa and the Kitimat aluminium smelter in Canada.\n\n## Decarbonising our operations\n\nIn the lead up to the UN Climate Change Summit in Glasgow, we announced that we will accelerate actions to decarbonise our assets in the short term and aim for a 15% reduction in emissions by 2025 - five years earlier than originally planned. We increased our 2030 target to a 50% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and remain committed to reaching net zero by 2050.\n\nTo achieve this, we aim to:\n\n- - Develop renewable power in the Pilbara. The 34MW solar plant at Gudai-Darri and the 45MW battery system at Tom Price that we approved in 2020 are expected to come online in 2022. We are now targeting the rapid deployment of one gigawatt of wind and solar power. This will replace gas power and meet demand from our fixed plants and infrastructure, as well as support the early electrification and decarbonisation of our mobile fleet.\n- - Work with state and federal governments, power companies and renewable developers to dramatically increase the availability of renewables in eastern Australia, and aim to develop green repowering solutions for the Boyne Island and Tomago smelters.\n- - Advance the projects in our Marginal Abatement Cost Curve such as the deployment of zero-emission trucks and the use of hydrogen at our alumina refineries.\n- - Use a $75/t CO2e internal carbon price to incentivise energyefficiency investments and identify new mitigation projects.\n- - Scale up the ELYSIS TM technology with the goal to have it available for installation from 2024. Construction of the first commercial-scale prototype cells of the inert anode technology has begun at our Alma smelter in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec.\n\nWe estimate that we will invest approximately $7.5 billion in capital between 2022 and 2030 to deliver our decarbonisation strategy (approximately $1.5 billion over the period 2022 to 2024). There will also be incremental operating expenditure on building new capabilities, energy efficiency initiatives, and research and development of approximately $200 million per year to 2030.\n\n## Alignment with 1.5\u00b0C\n\nWe conclude that our Scope 1 and 2 targets for 2030 and our commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050 are aligned with efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C, which is aligned with the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. While there is no universal standard for assessing the alignment of targets with the Paris Agreement goals, the basis for our conclusion is provided in the 2021 Climate Change Report.\n\nKPMG has provided limited assurance over our Scope 1 and 2 target information presented in the 2021 Climate Change Report, including the process to set the target, the alignment with 1.5\u00b0C and the roadmap to achieving the target.\n\n## Partnerships across our value chains\n\nWe operate in energy- and carbon-intensive value chains particularly steel and aluminium production - and recognise that we have a role to play in addressing the resulting emissions. We have updated our approach to calculating Scope 3 emissions to use regional factors rather than a global average. Our estimated Scope 3 emissions in 2021 were 553.5Mt CO2e, and around 95% is from the processing of iron ore, bauxite and other products by our customers. Aside from the revision to the reporting methodology, the change from 2020 is primarily due to changes in production of iron ore and bauxite. 94% of these processing emissions take place at our customer facilities in China, South Korea, Japan and other countries that have pledged to be carbon neutral by around mid-century.\n\nOur approach to addressing Scope 3 emissions is to engage with our customers on climate change, to share information on respective goals and targets, and work with them to develop the technologies to decarbonise steel and aluminium production. We will continue to report on progress each year.\n\n## Steel value chain\n\nSteel is a vital material for low-carbon infrastructure and, with limits to recycling, our iron ore products have an important future role to play. The future trajectory of our Scope 3 emissions is dependent on our customers' decarbonisation roadmaps, which in turn will be guided by technology development and government policies, including carbon pricing. The Net-Zero Steel Initiative (NZSI) is an industry platform, part of the Mission Possible Partnership, that brings together stakeholders across the whole steel supply chain to help put the sector on a path to net zero emissions by mid-century. The NZSI considers 20 technology archetypes and the decision-making process to deploy these at individual steel plants based on lowest total cost of ownership. Should the industry follow the NZSI Tech Moratorium scenario, we estimate that Rio/uni00A0Tinto's iron ore-related Scope 3 emissions would fall by 23% by 2035 and 42% by 2040, relative to our 2020 emissions.\n\nAbout 28% of our iron ore sales are directly to steel producers that have already set public targets for their Scope 1 and 2 emissions (our Scope 3), and have ambitions to reach net zero by around mid-century. In 2022, we commit to engage with all our direct iron ore customers (representing approximately 75% of our iron ore sales and related Scope 3 emissions) to share information on our respective climate change goals and roadmaps, and actively seek areas of mutual collaboration on pathways to net zero, such as those highlighted in our iron and steel decarbonisation goals.",

        "page_content": "Our approach is to pursue and support a range of decarbonisation options aligned with the technology pathways highlighted by the NZSI analysis, through proactive partnerships with our customers, including China Baowu, Nippon Steel Corporation, POSCO and BlueScope, as/uni00A0well as technology providers, universities and research institutes. This/uni00A0is consolidated under the following focus/uni00A0areas:\n\n- - Support our customers' blast furnace optimisation, with potential carbon emission reductions of up to 30%;\n- - Explore future carbon-neutral pathways for our Pilbara iron ores through: existing and new technologies to beneficiate Pilbara ores; a/uni00A0proprietary low-carbon research project using microwave energy and sustainable biomass as a reductant; and assessing a mid-grade direct reduced iron (DRI) produced with green hydrogen and processed in an electric melter;\n- - Pursue a project to produce hot briquetted iron (HBI) with high-grade iron ore and hydro-based green hydrogen in Canada;\n- - Find a pathway to develop Simandou to meet the future demand of high-quality iron ore for low-carbon steelmaking technologies.\n\n## Aluminium value chain\n\nAs a leading producer of low-carbon aluminium, we are actively involved in the decarbonisation of the value chain from bauxite to alumina and primary metal production, and we are committed to support the industry's transition. About 74% of our Scope 3 emissions related to the downstream processing of bauxite and alumina sold to our customers is from the use of electricity, predominantly in China. The remainder is from the energy used for process heat at the alumina refineries of our bauxite customers and from the use of carbon anodes in aluminium smelting. Our plan is to address these through:\n\n- - A commitment to engage with all our bauxite customers to seek areas of mutual collaboration in alumina decarbonisation projects, leveraging existing technical support relationships;\n- - The continued development of the ELYSIS TM inert anode technology, with the goal to have it available for installation at our smelters from 2024, following the construction of large-scale commercial prototype cells at our Alma smelter in the Saguenay by 2023;\n- - Leveraging START, a new standard we launched in 2021 for transparency and traceability across the aluminium value chain, to support customer and consumer demand for sustainable products.\n\n## Shipping\n\nWe have an ambition to reach net zero emissions from the shipping of our products by 2050 and expect to meet the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) decarbonisation goal of 40% reduction in shipping emissions intensity by 2025, five years ahead of the IMO deadline. We/uni00A0expect to introduce net-zero emission vessels into our portfolio by/uni00A02030.\n\n## Enhancing our resilience to physical climate risk\n\nOur assets, infrastructure, communities and broader value chains are exposed to chronic and acute climate change risks, such as the impacts of extreme weather events. Managing physical climate change risk through risk-based adaptation practices is essential to enhance the resilience of assets and communities, and it is the fourth pillar of our approach to climate change. Following a Group-wide exposure assessment, the next stage has been to conduct asset-level risk assessments to confirm the effectiveness of our controls. This work was paused in 2020 due to the prioritisation of the COVID-19 response and restrictions on travel to our sites. In 2021, the Energy and Climate Change Centre of Excellence and Risk Area of Expertise have been preparing to engage the product groups for detailed physical risk assessments in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Revolutionising aluminium production\n\nThe ELYSIS TM technology will reduce the carbon footprint and operating costs of aluminium smelters while increasing production capacity. In Canada alone, the ELYSIS TM technology has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7 million tonnes.\n\nLearn more about ELYSIS TM at riotinto.com/stories.\n\n## Disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendations\n\nClimate-related disclosures on governance, strategy, risk management, as well as metrics and targets, are integrated into this Annual Report in the following sections: Strategic Context, Key Performance Indicators, Innovation, Risk Management, Principal risks and Uncertainties, Governance, the Sustainability Committee report, the Remuneration Committee report and in the notes to the accounts.\n\nGiven space constraints in the Annual Report, other reports supplement the disclosures on climate-related governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets that are made in this report. These are available at riotinto.com/reports. Our/uni00A02021 Climate Change Report provides further detail on our approach including our Climate Action Plan, the way we evaluate and manage climate-related risks, progress towards our targets and our value chain partnerships.

We increased our internal technical expertise and capability by recruiting subject matter experts in a number of disciplines to support practitioners at the asset level. We reviewed our control framework across all Environment disciplines and identified critical controls at a Group level to better manage risks across the portfolio. We also worked on our data collection and monitoring processes to improve data access and analysis to allow better data-driven decision-making and management practices, more transparency and improved environmental outcomes.\n\n## Water\n\nIncreasingly disrupted weather patterns and more extreme weather events due to climate change, and a growing world population, mean efficiently managing our water impacts is more important than ever. Water/uni00A0is a shared resource critical to sustaining biodiversity, people and their economic prosperity. The way we think about water, and manage the risks, reflects the diversity of our operations and geographic locations.\n\nWater scarcity is an issue for some of our assets operating in desert locations, while others must remove excess water to allow safe mining operations. Some of our assets are powered by water via hydroelectricity and, in all locations, we carefully manage our use and reuse of water, and consider the potential long-term impacts on water sources. This complexity means we are developing a catchment-level approach to water management and manage our impacts, risks and potential solutions within our operations with the understanding that we share water with surrounding communities and nature. We understand this responsibility extends beyond the life of our operations.\n\nWe aim to avoid permanent impacts to water resources by carefully managing the quality and quantity of the water we use and return to the environment. We work to balance our operational needs with those of local communities and ecosystems, and factor in the impact of climate change, which is already affecting rainfall and water security at many of our sites. We use baseline water stress as determined by the World Resource Institute to identify operational catchments of most concern.

        "page_content": "To manage our water impacts well, we first need to understand the specific risks at more than 50 operating sites, as well as our overall Group impacts. To do this, we think about water issues in four ways:\n\n- 1.  Water resource\n- 2. Quality and quantity\n- 3. Dewatering\n- 4. Long-term obligations\n\nWe use this framework to identify, assess and manage water risks. This/uni00A0comprehensive approach extends beyond our mandatory reporting obligations and allows us to have relevant conversations about water risks internally and with stakeholders in the communities where we/uni00A0operate.\n\nOur Group water risk profile (below) shows the level of exposure against each of the four themes, or risks. Most of our water risks sit in the 'low' to 'moderate' range. There are some in 'very high' and 'high' categories for each. Regardless of the level of risk, we apply rigorous standards and processes to manage them.\n\n## Group water risk profile (% of managed operations) 1\n\n## Water resource\n\nIs there enough water available for both environment and community needs, and our operational use?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLow\n\nModerate\n\nHigh\n\nVery high\n\nNot applicable\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe water resource risk at Oyu/uni00A0Tolgoi in Mongolia is assessed as moderate, even though it is located in the Gobi Desert. Oyu/uni00A0Tolgoi sources its water requirements from a deep water supply, the Gunii Hooloi aquifer, a 150-metre deep resource holding around 6.8 billion cubic metres of non-drinkable saline water. Oyu/uni00A0Tolgoi uses this water source efficiently with water recycling and conservation practices implemented across the operation. For more information see riotinto.com/water.\n\nOur QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) operation in Madagascar operates in a highly sensitive area from a water, broader environment and community perspective. The discharges from our operation have the potential to impact receiving water quality and, therefore, the water quality risk is assessed as high . We are working to improve management activities on site, including our ability to more accurately measure our water discharge quality, and the deployment of a dedicated water treatment plant to adjust the discharge pH.

Returning water to the aquifers impacted by our mining activities in a controlled manner is the focus of a number of studies. More information on our current programme of managed aquifer recharge trials in the Pilbara is available on riotinto.com/water.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water quality/quantity\n\nDoes the way we manage water on site, or discharge excess water, cause environmental impacts or operational constraints?\n\n2%\n\n## Dewatering\n\nDoes the removal of water from the operational areas of our sites impact regional aquifers or our mine plans?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe may sometimes generate impacts that we are required to manage over the long term. Whether they are associated with the management of post-closure pit lakes formed in our mining pits in the Pilbara, or the ongoing management of potential seepage from our waste rock or tailings facilities in our aluminium and copper facilities, our systems and standards aim to ensure that the risk is identified early and managed appropriately and responsibly throughout the asset lifecycle.\n\n## Long-term obligations\n\nDo our operational activities generate long-term or ongoing obligations related to water?",

These targets, and the data required to measure progress against them, are helping us become better water stewards.\n\nOur water targets were set in 2019 and consist of one Group target and six site-based targets, again reflecting our catchment-based approach and recognising that we manage vastly different waterrelated risks across our business. The site-based targets were chosen based on their water risk profile, our International Council on\n\nMining and Metals (ICMM) commitments, and local community and environmental interdependencies.\n\nWe continued to make progress against our Group target in 2021 and remain on track to meet it by 2023. We collected water allocation volume data for all sites and estimated surface water catchment rainfall-runoff volumes for our managed operations. We also implemented the last component of the framework - the Group water control library - which describes all controls identified to manage our water risks. In 2022, we will continue embedding our water risk framework and associated controls across our product groups and focus on delivering our site-based targets.\n\n## Progress against our targets\n\n| Group target                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Water risk theme Status                                                        |                                                                               | Commentary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rio/uni00A0Tinto Group (Tier 1)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Rio/uni00A0Tinto Group (Tier 1)                                                |                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| By 2023, we will disclose - for all managed operations -  permitted surface water allocation volumes, annual   allocation usage and the associated surface water   allocation catchment rainfall-runoff volume estimate.                                                                                                              | Water resource                                                                 | On track                                                                      | Progress remains on track against target schedule.

        "page_content": "## Biodiversity\n\nThe associated impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss pose significant risks to people and the environment on which we all rely. We recognise our responsibility to effectively mitigate the impact of our operations on nature - and we are mindful of our own dependence on healthy ecosystems to run a successful business.\n\nHealthy natural environments with relatively intact ecosystems are key to climate resilience. They also provide important services to the communities where we operate and our business. We are committed to protecting biodiversity with the ambition of achieving no net loss. This means striking a balance between negative impacts on biodiversity and positive outcomes achieved through mitigation.\n\nIn 2020, we reported on the biodiversity sensitivity of our assets using a database developed by the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP WCMC) methodology that combined global datasets of threatened species and conservation and protected areas. Building on this, in 2021 we worked with Birdlife International to understand how our biodiversity programmes might also contribute to carbon sequestration and began to understand how we might apply nature-based solutions within our/uni00A0landholdings. This/uni00A0work will continue to mature in 2022.\n\nAs a founding partner of UNEP WCMC's 19-year-old Proteus Partnership, we committed to the next five-year phase of this crosssectoral association. Through this partnership, and as part of our drive to build our internal capability, we have delivered biodiversity training to more than 200 employees across the business in 2021.\n\nWe were unable to complete an independent review of the monitoring programmes of our high-priority biodiversity sites in 2021 due to pandemic-related restrictions. However, we had independent assessments completed for five of eight sites and completed an internal assessment of all plans. We aim to complete this work in 2022 to ensure that management plans and actions adequately address risks to nature.\n\n## Land stewardship\n\nIn 2021, our land footprint - total disturbed area was 3,734 square kilometres, an increase of 105 square kilometres compared to 2020. This includes all disturbance of our operating assets and activities, such as exploration activities, smelters, mines and supporting infrastructure.\n\nWe are temporary custodians of the land on which we operate, and our aim is to rehabilitate the land as soon as it becomes available. In 2021, we rehabilitated 20 square kilometres of land, mostly at our bauxite mines in Australia, mineral sands mines in South Africa and Madagascar, and exploration areas in the Pilbara, Western Australia.\n\nOur rehabilitation teams work in partnership with research centres and universities to refine rehabilitation approaches and improve outcomes. In/uni00A02021, as a member of the Cooperative Research Centre for Transformations in Mining Economies, we participated in foundational projects intended to identify gaps affecting rehabilitation, closure and post-closure outcomes to guide upcoming research that will assist our Australian operations. In another example, through a partnership with the company Virotec, we are reprocessing a by-product from bauxite refining (red mud) into a commercial product that can be used in the treatment and regeneration of soils. In/uni00A0addition, 22 of our operations completed rehabilitation trials to improve outcomes relating to seed germination, erosion and topsoil/uni00A0quality.\n\n## Contributing to a resilient environment\n\nOur environment technical experts work with our process safety and operational engineers to ensure our operating systems and processes are managed to prevent harmful discharges or releases to the/uni00A0environment.\n\nAt a minimum, we comply with national and local environmental regulations related to waste management, water discharge and air emissions. We also apply our own standards, which set the minimum requirements to define, monitor and manage emissions at all our managed operations to prevent harm to people and the environment. These standards require us to set performance requirements for resource efficiency, particularly relating to mineral and non-mineral waste management.\n\nWe contribute to sustainability initiatives across the value chain through our work with peers, industry associations, and customers. And we continually improve our due-diligence mechanisms and assess the environmental performance of new suppliers and customers.\n\n## Managing waste\n\nWaste and residues from our operational activities are a key area of environmental risk management for us. In 2021, we renewed our focus on managing potential contamination from these sources. We conducted a detailed analysis of hazardous materials and non-mineral waste to assess and prioritise our contamination risks. To reduce further contamination risks, we are banning the use of PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in fire-suppression systems at our sites by the end of 2022.\n\nAt some of our long-life assets, waste management practices of the past have led to a need for remediation in the present. For example, at New Zealand's Aluminium Smelter (NZAS), which has operated for more than 50 years, a detailed site investigation was completed in 2021 to guide remediation work. The study identified localised areas of contamination confined to the smelter footprint, informing a targeted rehabilitation strategy for the site. NZAS has committed to removing all Spent Cell Lining waste generated in the process of relining reduction cells with refractory materials, managing waste and remediating the site.",

        "page_content": "## Protecting air quality\n\nClean air is critical for the health of our host communities and of the surrounding ecosystems. Across the business, we continue to pursue improvements to air quality management, focusing on emissions of greenhouse gases and particulate matter and gases emitted by our operational activities, including mining, materials handling, processing and transportation. The potentially hazardous emissions we monitor at operations are:\n\n- - Sulphur oxides (SOx), mainly at our aluminium and copper/uni00A0smelters\n- - Nitrogen oxides (NOx), mainly from burning fossil fuels\n- - Gaseous fluoride emissions from aluminium smelters\n- - Respirable particulate emissions (PM10 and PM2.5), very fine particles from mining and processing operations, and from burning fossil fuels\n\nOur emphasis is on prevention, managing air quality through operational discipline and process improvement.\n\nMany of our assets have multi-year air quality improvement projects in place. For example, at the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC), plans are under way to reduce emissions with additional dust collection and to reconfigure the stacks to improve dispersion in the atmosphere. At/uni00A0our Atlantic aluminium smelting operations in Canada, enhanced monitoring for key air pollutants that links emissions and operational data has reduced response times for upset conditions. Phase 1 of this project has reduced, by 90%, the amount of time stack emissions exceed recommended particulate concentrations.\n\nIn some instances, we did not comply with permissible emission limits. For example, our Kennecott smelter experienced temporary equipment failures that, for safety reasons, required us to vent gases containing sulphur oxides directly to the stack. This resulted in short-term non-compliance but we remained compliant with our daily and annual limits and our continuous monitoring system indicated there was no adverse impact on ambient air quality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Topsoil-free rehabilitation\n\nWith topsoil in short supply at our Gove bauxite mine in the Northern Territory, Australia, we have been working on a new topsoil-free rehabilitation approach to reduce reliance on topsoil in the future while minimising environmental impacts and/uni00A0cost.\n\nLearn more about our rehabilitation work at riotinto.com/stories.\n\n## Operational environment overview (2017-2021)\n\n|                                                       | 2021   | 2020   | 2019 2018   | 2019 2018   |       | 2017       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|------------|\n| Significant environmental incidents                   | 3      | 0      |             | 0           | 0     | 0          |\n| Fines and prosecutions - environment ($'000) 4        | 7.4    | 27.4   |             | 19.0        | 284.7 | 89.5       |\n| Land footprint - disturbed (square kilometres)        | 3,734  | 3,629  |             | 3,626       | 3,595 | 3,616      |\n| Land footprint - rehabilitated (square kilometres)    | 495    | 491    |             | 490         | 485   | 497        |\n| Mineral waste disposed or stored (million tonnes)     | 1,005  | 987 3  |             | 905         | 886   | 1,188      |\n| Non-mineral waste disposed or stored (million tonnes) | 0.65   | 0.47 3 |             | 0.28        | 0.27  | 0.33       |\n| SOx emissions (thousand tonnes)                       | 70.2   | 75.7 3 |             | 79.0        | 84.2  | 86.9       |\n| NOx emissions (thousand tonnes) 1                     | 88.5   | 85.6   | 64.3        |             | 62.0  | 65.8       |\n| Fluoride emissions (thousand tonnes)                  | 2.36   | 2.27 3 |             | 2.34        | 2.61  | 2.49 112.4 |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Tailings\n\nResponsibly managing waste from mining operations is essential, as is being transparent with our stakeholders about our tailings storage facilities and how we manage them. We engage with stakeholders throughout the lifecycle of our tailings storage facilities, from design to/uni00A0closure.\n\nWe manage 106 tailings storage facilities (TSFs) across our global assets. There are a further 41 non-managed TSFs. Altogether, there are 65 active TSFs, 36 are inactive and 46 are closed. There have been no external wall failures at any of our TSFs for more than 20 years.\n\nWe work through technical committees and joint venture relationships to support leading practice in tailings management. Our full tailings disclosure is available at riotinto.com/tailings and we periodically update the list of TSFs to reflect operational and ownership changes, including changes due to the transition of closure or remediation obligations for legacy assets and reclassification of facilities. Our list of TSFs also includes those managed by our joint venture partners.\n\nIn May 2021, we updated previously disclosed information on each of our global TSFs. All facilities were assigned a consequence classification in accordance with the regulatory or industry body that oversees tailings in each region or jurisdiction. Additional technical data from updated downstream impact assessments, required under the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) and Rio/uni00A0Tinto's internal standard for tailings and water storage facilities, resulted in a modification to hazard classifications of some facilities. Consequence classifications are not ratings of the condition of a facility or the likelihood of failure; instead, they rate the potential consequence if they were to fail.\n\nOur facilities are regulated, permitted and have been managed for many years to comply with local laws, regulations, permits, licences and other requirements. Tailings management has been included in the Group risk register since 2010, and our Group safety standard for tailings and water storage facilities has been in place since 2015. Our internal assurance processes verify that our managed TSFs operate in accordance with this standard, which we updated in 2020.\n\nOur operational TSFs have emergency response plans - tested through training exercises in collaboration with stakeholders such as local emergency services - and follow strict business resilience and communications protocols.\n\nSince the launch of GISTM in August 2020, we have continued work on our implementation plan. We completed a gap analysis against our internal tailings management, environment, and communities and social performance standards, and developed improvement plans to close identified gaps. While COVID-19 restrictions delayed a few items, we plan to complete all outstanding actions as quickly as possible, while adhering to restrictions in each jurisdiction. We are on track to have all TSFs with a potential consequence rated 'extreme' or 'very high' in conformance with GISTM by August 2023, with all remaining facilities in conformance by August 2025.\n\nWe played an active role in the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) tailings working group in 2021, which focused on the development of the GISTM conformance protocol as well as a tailings good practice guide designed to help support industry-wide adoption.\n\nThis year, we also:\n\n- - Appointed Accountable Executives for tailings and established the Tailings Management Committee, which provides governance of tailings management practices across the Group to ensure we meet the GISTM and the relevant Rio/uni00A0Tinto standard requirements.\n- - Updated our tailings disclosure information and released our updated D5 Standard for the management of tailings and water storage facilities on our website in May 2021.\n- - Published our Tailings Policy on our website in August 2021.\n- - Consolidated our Group-wide controls for tailings management in our centralised risk management system so that, no matter where in the world our people are, controls relating to tailings can be consistently applied and verified.\n- - Continued to support the Future Tails partnership, a collaboration between Rio/uni00A0Tinto, BHP and the University of Western Australia (UWA), launched the first micro-credentials, and enrolled the first cohort of more than 90 students for the Graduate Certificate in Tailings Management at UWA.",

        "page_content": "## Communities\n\nThe communities where we live and work are fundamental to our business. They include Indigenous peoples, landowners, governments, business partners, neighbours and our colleagues - without their support, we cannot operate. We aim to contribute to a shared future and positive legacy by developing lasting relationships with people, learning about and supporting their goals and aspirations, avoiding or mitigating adverse impacts, and respecting connections to lands and waters.\n\nThe destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in May 2020 was a clear breach of our values and the trust placed in us by the Indigenous peoples to respect the lands on which we operate. It was a tragedy that prompted us to review our mindset and practices and commit to improve. In May 2021, we recognised a year since the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters by reflecting on the loss and hurt that we caused and renewing our commitment to learn the lessons from Juukan Gorge.\n\n## How we work with communities\n\nMining and processing, by its very nature, disturbs the environment and can impact surrounding communities. It also delivers significant economic and social benefits, including the production of essential materials, employment, small business development, tax and royalty streams, training and skills development, and socioeconomic programmes. We/uni00A0recognise that while many of the benefits of our activities are widespread, many of the negative impacts are localised. Our teams work in partnership with communities to understand how our activities impact their lives, culture and heritage. Through meaningful engagement, we can respond to community concerns, optimise socioeconomic benefits and mitigate negative impacts.\n\n## Engaging with communities on a low-carbon/uni00A0future\n\nWe believe we have an important role to play in ensuring that the green energy transition is progressed in a fair and socially inclusive way. This/uni00A0will be a key focus for our Communities and Social Performance teams from 2022 and will include active community engagement, managing potential adverse social and human rights impacts, and exploring and enabling ways for host communities to share in economic opportunities. In 2021, QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) and its partners laid the foundation stone for a new solar and wind energy plant. This, in addition to allowing Rio/uni00A0Tinto's operations in Madagascar to reach carbon neutrality by 2023, will replace the majority of the electricity it currently supplies to the town of Fort Dauphin and its 80,000 community members with clean energy. QMM and its partners are working with local authorities to develop manufacturing capacity to produce equipment for the renewable industry locally.\n\n## Strengthening social performance\n\nWe have strengthened our social performance structure, governance approach and processes. In September 2021, we released our Communities and Social Performance Commitments Disclosure Interim Report, our first report dedicated to sharing the progress on the actions from the 2020 Board Review of cultural heritage management. Read more about progress on our commitments on pages 94-95.\n\n## Working with First Nations, Canada\n\nIn Canada, we continue to work with Indigenous peoples on the implementation of agreements signed with communities, and we are progressing discussions on four new agreements with Indigenous communities in Quebec, Saskatchewan and British Columbia.\n\nTo advance reconciliation efforts in 2021, we focused on strengthening our employees' cultural awareness. In June, our business celebrated National Indigenous History Month by supporting a series of events across the country, including a fireside chat between Former National Chief Phil Fontaine and our Aluminium Chief Executive, Ivan Vella. In/uni00A0September, we commemorated National Truth and Reconciliation Day by hosting an awareness session which provided employees with information on the residential schools in Canada, including a first-hand account from a survivor.\n\n## Resolution Copper project, Arizona, US\n\nAt our Resolution Copper project in Arizona, we continue to build relationships with impacted communities and Native American tribes. We recognise the enduring historical connection Native American tribes have with the land at, or near, the proposed mine. We are committed to ongoing consultation with Native American tribes and working together in a manner consistent with the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining. We are progressing partnerships with over half of these tribes and our aim is to have a mutual dialogue with all tribes. Since 2013, the US Forest Service (USFS) has led a rigorous review of the project, including consulting 11 Native American tribes with historic connections to the land around Resolution Copper. This/uni00A0dialogue has led to changes in the project design and the implementation of other measures to address stakeholder concerns. While the USFS published the Final Environmental Impact Statement in January 2021, the US Department of Agriculture directed the USFS to review and engage further with consulting Native American tribes. We/uni00A0support the National Environmental Policy Act process and continue to engage with local communities and Native American tribes to further shape the Resolution Copper project.\n\n## Richards Bay Minerals (RBM), South Africa\n\nWe are committed to fostering broad-based development of the four/uni00A0local communities that host our RBM mine in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. However, following a series of business disruptions that put the safety of our employees at risk, we declared force majeure at the operation in June 2021. Significant work has been done to improve the situation, including reaching milestone agreements with traditional leaders, local youth and business forums. In August 2021, RBM and representatives of all four communities reached an agreement to release 130 million rand from the community trusts. These/uni00A0funds will be channelled towards local economic development initiatives. The agreement also aims to secure improved community trust governance.\n\n## Simandou project, Guinea\n\nAt our Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, we continue to engage with stakeholders and local communities to deliver a range of economic development and community health initiatives, including COVID-19 and Ebola response programmes. We are working with communities to help them prepare for future operations, identify and manage our impacts, and design and deliver regional and local economic development programmes. We engaged with other mining projects in Guinea to discuss the potential for enhancing offset options, as well as supporting the Centre Forestier N'Z\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 and Pic de Fon Classified Forest management committee.",

        "page_content": "## Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia\n\nOyu Tolgoi supports economic opportunities through livelihood and economic diversification initiatives for communities in Umnugovi aimag. We support herders' cooperatives and work with local subject matter experts to improve livestock health services, increase the productivity of livestock, encourage vegetable and dairy production, and foster new business development through capacity building, strengthening market linkages and nurturing entrepreneurial mindsets amongst local communities. Our Oyu Tolgoi South Gobi Development Strategy will expand on this work over the next five years to boost local procurement and employment above their current levels of 24.5% and 24.8%, respectively.\n\n## Jadar lithium-borates project, Serbia\n\nIn 2021, we committed $2.4 billion to the Jadar lithium-borates project in Serbia, one of the world's largest greenfield lithium projects.\n\nIn January 2022, the Government of Serbia cancelled the Spatial Plan for the Jadar project and required all related permits to be revoked. We/uni00A0remain committed to exploring all options and are reviewing the implications for our activities and our people in Serbia.\n\nWe acknowledge the concerns from local communities and are committed to meaningful engagement to explore ways to address these concerns.\n\n## Panguna mine, Bougainville, Papua New Guinea\n\nThe Panguna mine was operated by Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL), majority-owned by Rio/uni00A0Tinto, for 17 years from 1972 until 1989, when operations were suspended due to an uprising against the mine and a civil war. Rio/uni00A0Tinto has not had access to the mine for over 30 years. In 2016, Rio/uni00A0Tinto transferred its 53.83% majority shareholding in BCL to the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) and the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Government for no consideration, enabling the ABG and PNG to hold an equal share in BCL of 36.4% each.\n\nIn September 2020, the Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC) filed a complaint against Rio/uni00A0Tinto on behalf of 156 Bougainville residents with the Australian National Contact Point (AusNCP) regarding the Panguna site. The complaint alleges that we are accountable for significant breaches of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises relating to past and ongoing environmental and human rights impacts arising from the Panguna mine.\n\nIn July 2021, following months of constructive discussions facilitated by the AusNCP, Rio/uni00A0Tinto and Bougainville community members, represented by the HRLC, announced an agreement to identify and assess the legacy impacts of the mine.\n\nA joint committee of stakeholders, the Panguna Mine Legacy Impact Assessment Committee, has been formed to oversee a detailed independent assessment of the Panguna mine to identify and better understand the environmental and human rights impacts of the mine. The Committee was established by the ABG and the parties to the AusNCP process (Rio/uni00A0Tinto, the HRLC and the community members the HRLC represents). It is chaired by an independent facilitator with representatives from the Independent State of PNG and BCL, as well as other clan landowners and community representatives. The first meeting of the Committee was held on 30 November 2021. This was a constructive and important first step towards resolving the highly complex legacy of the Panguna mine.\n\n## Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin\u00e9e SA (CBG), Guinea\n\nCBG is a bauxite operation in Guinea owned by Halco Mining Inc. (51%) and the Guinean Government (49%). Halco is a consortium comprised of Rio/uni00A0Tinto (45%), Alcoa (45%) and Dadco Investments (10%). We participate on the boards of Halco and CBG, with representation on various shareholder oversight committees.\n\nThrough our board and committee roles, we have been proactively monitoring CBG's approach to environmental protection, community issues and human rights. We are aware of the concerns regarding access to land and water, the pace of livelihood restoration programmes as well as aspects of CBG's stakeholder engagement.\n\nIn 2021, sustainability advisory committees were created at Halco and CBG levels, strengthening our oversight and providing support to CBG/uni00A0for the improvement of its social and environmental practices, including their response to a complaint made to the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) Office of the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO).\n\nThe mediation process facilitated by the CAO reached an important milestone in 2021 with an agreement to adjust the mitigation measures related to blasting.\n\nHalco continues to participate in the mediation process as an observer, alongside the IFC.\n\n## Socioeconomic contribution\n\nIn 2021, our direct economic contribution was $66.6 billion, including the total value of operating costs, employee wages and benefits, payments to providers of capital, payments to governments, development contributions, payments to landowners and community investments. Catalysing economic opportunities for our host communities and regions continues to be a priority. We strive to employ local people, buy local products and engage local services. For/uni00A0example, we awarded contracts valued at over A$500 million to local Western Australian and Pilbara Aboriginal businesses for the Greater Tom Price operations.\n\nThrough social investment, we seek to deliver positive, measurable social outcomes and support communities to achieve their goals and aspirations. Our total voluntary global social investments amounted to $72 million, covering health, education, environment, agricultural and business development programmes. This is an increase of approximately 53% on our 2020 voluntary social investment spend. This increase is associated with the completion of the $25 million COVID-19 pledge, a review of social investment strategies across product groups, and the launch of a number of significant multi-year partnerships, particularly through Rio/uni00A0Tinto Iron Ore.",

        "page_content": "## Progress on our communities and social performance commitments\n\nFollowing the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in May 2020, we have strengthened our approach to managing Indigenous cultural heritage. We are determined to build more meaningful and genuine relationships with Indigenous peoples and host communities around the globe.\n\nAs part of our efforts to improve transparency, we have committed to providing updates on the work we are undertaking to enhance our communities and social performance practices. In September 2021, we released our first Communities and Social Performance Commitments Disclosure Interim Report.\n\nOn 18 October 2021, the Joint Standing Committee for Northern Australia (JSCNA) released its final report. JSCNA restated the recommendations made in the December 2020 interim report and focused on the legislative frameworks governing the protection of cultural heritage. Recognising that there is still much work ahead, we are learning from the outcomes of the review and our ongoing dialogue with stakeholders as we continue to deliver on our commitments to ensure a tragic incident like Juukan Gorge never happens again.\n\nAn update on our commitments is provided below.\n\n## 1. Remedying and rebuilding our relationship with the PKKP people\n\nWe are working under the direct guidance of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people to remediate Country. Throughout our journey with the PKKP people, they have graciously shared their knowledge to ensure our remediation efforts deliver the best possible outcomes. During this time, we have been reminded of the importance of trusted relationships and valued partnerships through listening and continuously demonstrating mutual respect.\n\nWe continue to work in partnership with the PKKP people to finalise co-management principles under which we can work together to enhance protection of heritage and achieve better outcomes. The/uni00A0new model will involve earlier and more detailed consultation, increased sharing of information and greater involvement of PKKP representatives in Rio/uni00A0Tinto's decision making throughout the lifecycle of the mine.\n\n## 2. Partnering with Pilbara Traditional Owners in modernising and improving agreements\n\nDuring the year, we continued to actively engage with Traditional Owners in Western Australia to better understand existing and historic issues and define ways we can jointly deliver more effective outcomes. We have developed a set of principles to guide the agreement modernisation process which seeks to address areas where current agreements have not met the Traditional Owners' aspirations of partnership.\n\nIt is our intention that revised agreements will seek to agree on a clear pathway for resolution of any differences of views that may emerge. We will also continue to work with Traditional Owners and local communities to build sustainable business development and employment participation opportunities.\n\nIn Canada, we currently have 11 active long-term Life of Mine agreements and are engaging on four new agreements with Indigenous communities in Quebec, Saskatchewan and British/uni00A0Columbia.\n\n## 3. Establishing the new Communities and Social Performance model\n\nIn 2021, we established our new Communities and Social Performance (CSP) model to increase our social performance capacity and capability across the business. We now have more than 400 technical CSP professionals working on 60 sites in 35 countries (compared with 250 professionals in 2020).\n\nA central CSP Area of Expertise complements our asset-based teams by monitoring external societal trends, developing and reviewing standards, systems and risk and assurance processes, building capability, and providing strategic regional and technical advice to our businesses.\n\n## 4. Building local capability and capacity to support the site General Manager\n\nOperational leaders play a critical role alongside our CSP teams in our social performance. Product group Chief Executives have overall accountability for relationships with Indigenous peoples, supported by line managers who have direct responsibility for maintaining relationships with host communities, including Indigenous peoples.\n\n## 5. Improving our governance, planning and systems where it relates to communities\n\nIn 2021, we designed a new social performance strategy and set CSP targets for 2022 to 2026 to support its achievement. We also strengthened our governance including a review of our global CSP/uni00A0Standard and Cultural Heritage Group Procedure for Australian businesses, and improved assurance and risk management processes.\n\nAs part of our global Risk Control Framework, we created a standardised library of cultural heritage controls across the Group. This will enhance control effectiveness across our business.\n\nA substantive independent review of our cultural heritage performance is currently under way at all our businesses, to redefine best practice for cultural heritage management in our organisation. Phase one of the review focuses on Australian assets, in consultation with a number of Indigenous groups, and is being led by the sustainability consultancy Environmental Resources Management. Phase two is due to be awarded at the end of the first quarter, with completion planned for the end of 2022.\n\nWe have also established an internal global Indigenous Coordination Committee which meets monthly to ensure crossfunctional alignment on Indigenous strategy and activities.",

        "page_content": "## 6. Reducing barriers to, and increasing, Indigenous/uni00A0employment\n\nWe know that a diverse workforce is an important factor in business performance, and we are committed to Indigenous peoples having a stronger voice. In Australia, we have committed $50 million over five years to attract, retain and grow Indigenous leaders, and we have increased the number of Australian Indigenous leaders in our business fivefold since November 2020.\n\nWe are partnering with Traditional Owners and local stakeholders to deliver initiatives that contribute to improving the pathways to employment for Indigenous peoples, increasing the number of employment opportunities and providing positive experiences for current and future employees. In 2021, 76 Indigenous employees paired with senior leaders participated in our two-way mentoring programme across our Australia business to deepen cross-cultural understanding and responsiveness. In Western Australia, we have launched an Indigenous participation strategy which seeks to improve the opportunities for Indigenous peoples to participate in/uni00A0employment.\n\n## 7. Increasing Indigenous leadership and developing cultural competency within Rio/uni00A0Tinto\n\nThe Indigenous leadership commitment is designed to fast-track Indigenous Australians into professional and leadership roles. During the year, 126 Indigenous employees earned promotions across Australia.\n\nIn Australia, 80% of our senior leaders completed our Cultural Connection programme in 2021. We also launched a digital cultural onboarding platform to enhance and support cultural safety and understanding. In the second half of 2021, 65 employees and new starters completed the experience with their/uni00A0leaders.\n\nA component of our 2021 ESG short-term incentive was linked to an increase in cultural awareness training. The target was risk-based, by identifying cohorts of employees and contractors whose roles interface with cultural heritage. Business units and product groups identified their training cohorts, and training programmes were designed to reflect the local context. The length of programmes varied according to context and risk profile.\n\nIn our Iron Ore group, our immersive virtual reality cultural awareness training was rolled out in 2021 and is now part of our onboarding process. We are also implementing regionally specific, Traditional Owner-led cultural awareness training.\n\nIn North America, two virtual cultural awareness sessions were facilitated by an Indigenous-owned business, and numerous site-based sessions were held in 2021, including at our IOC/uni00A0operations, which have introduced mandatory cultural awareness for employees and contractors and achieved full compliance in 2021. We have also launched online cultural awareness training on Canadian Indigenous peoples' history, culture and industry interaction.\n\n## 8. Establishing a process to redefine and improve cultural heritage management standards\n\nIn Iron Ore, our Integrated Heritage Management Process (IHMP) ensures heritage considerations are embedded throughout the mine development process, from early resource planning and studies through to closure. By the end of 2021, we had reviewed over 2,200 heritage sites in the Pilbara, adding further protection controls. Through ongoing consultation with Traditional Owners, we/uni00A0have removed 100 million dry tonnes of iron ore from reserves in 2020 and 2021 through this process.\n\nThe core principles from IHMP have informed the Cultural Heritage Group Procedure update and our cultural heritage global control library, and we continue to explore opportunities to embed these across the business.\n\n## 9. Establishing an Australian Advisory Group\n\nWe have established an Australian Advisory Group (AAG) to provide guidance on current and emerging issues, and better manage policies and positions that are important to both Australian communities and our broader business. We have confirmed the inaugural Chairperson as Professor Peter Yu, and other members include Michelle Deshong, Nyadol Nyuon, Yarlalu Thomas, Djawa/uni00A0Yunupingu, Cris Parker, and Shona Reid. The first AAG meeting will be held in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## 10. Elevating external consultation\n\nIn 2021, we established the Chief Executive Australia role to focus on rebuilding trust and strengthening external relationships across Australia, and a Chief Adviser Civil Society and Outreach role to expand our capacity to engage on key matters globally. We continue to increase our dialogue with government, civil society organisations, Indigenous leaders, Traditional Owners and other stakeholders at all levels of our organisation, and will explore further opportunities to engage in 2022.\n\n## 11. Elevating employee engagement\n\nWe are focused on keeping our people informed of our commitments and achievements, through the implementation of new communications tools, channels and platforms. And through training, networking opportunities and cultural competency programmes, we are increasing cultural awareness at every level of/uni00A0our business.\n\n## Progress on best practice cultural heritage/uni00A0management\n\nWe remain committed to achieving best practice cultural heritage management. We will continue to work with Indigenous peoples and communities to ensure we better understand their priorities and concerns, minimise our impacts, and responsibly manage Indigenous cultural heritage within our operations.\n\nWe support the strengthening of cultural heritage legislation and advocate for more meaningful engagement, the protection of heritage values, strengthened agreement-making, and certainty for all stakeholders.\n\nMore information is available in our Communities and Social Performance Commitments Disclosure Interim Report. Our next dedicated report is due to be released in the third quarter of 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Closure\n\nWe aspire to leave a positive legacy for future generations. We do this in partnership with our stakeholders, embedding closure considerations throughout the entire lifespan of our assets - in the way we design, build, run, close and transition them.\n\nAlthough mining and processing activities extend over decades, we recognise they are temporary and that other activities and land use will follow. To mitigate the impacts of a shift to a new use, we engage our stakeholders early and transparently, to contribute to a shared vision for the future of the land and associated communities. We balance environmental and social considerations with costs and look for opportunities associated with progressive closure, remediation and repurposing, and where appropriate, long-term monitoring and maintenance.\n\n## Closure execution\n\nIn 2021, we progressed closure execution work at a number of assets, including the Gove refinery and the Argyle diamond mine, and our subsidiary Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) continues to progress the closure of the Ranger uranium mine.\n\n## Argyle diamond mine\n\nOur Argyle diamond mine, in Western Australia, ceased production in 2020. We are in the first year of a four-year plan to dismantle the operational infrastructure, reshape the land and undertake revegetation activities to enable the re-establishment of a natural ecosystem. Once completed, as agreed with the Traditional Owners and the Western Australian Government, we will release our landholding and support the land being returned to the Traditional Owners for activities such as cattle grazing, Indigenous cultural tourism, cultural use and possibly small-scale agriculture and native food production alongside longer-term monitoring activities. We are committed to support the development of long-term sustainable local businesses and local employment. In 2021, we spent 14% of our annual closure budget with Traditional Owner business.\n\n## Gove refinery and residue disposal areas\n\nWhile mining continues at our Gove bauxite operations in the Northern Territory, we are implementing progressive closure activities, including the decommissioning and demolition of the refinery and progressive capping of the red mud ponds. The refinery demolition is one of the largest in Australia. The Gove closure execution programme will take approximately ten years to complete followed by ongoing monitoring, with mining operations expected to cease no later than 2030. This year's work saw the commencement of the capping of pond 5 within the Residue Disposal Area; the completion of the feasibility study of the refinery complex; and optimisation of our waste liquor treatment plant performance. Our Closure team is working with the Gove operations team, Traditional Owners, local business, and the Northern Territory Government, to contribute to the Traditional Owners' future vision for the Gove Peninsula, with the intention to maximise commercial opportunities that Rio/uni00A0Tinto has available through to closure. As agreed with stakeholders, the refinery will be demolished and the underlying land will be remediated. It can then be used for industrial purposes with the intent that certain assets, such as the light fuel farm, cargo wharf, warehouses and administration buildings may be retained for future use by Traditional/uni00A0Owners.\n\n## Ranger uranium mine\n\nThe Ranger uranium mine in the Northern Territory is owned and operated by ERA. ERA's shares are publicly held and traded on the Australian Securities Exchange, with Rio/uni00A0Tinto holding 86.3% of ERA's shares. In accordance with the Ranger s41 Authority, production at the Ranger uranium mine ceased in January 2021.\n\nOn 2 February 2022, ERA released the preliminary findings from its reforecast of the cost and schedule for the Ranger rehabilitation project, which had been subject to an independent review. Rio/uni00A0Tinto is reviewing the preliminary findings of this reforecast and have advised ERA that we are committed to working with the company to ensure the rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area is successfully achieved to a standard that will establish an environment similar to the adjacent Kakadu National Park.\n\n## Legacy sites\n\nWe also manage a number of historic sites - known as legacy sites some we did not operate but acquired through corporate acquisitions after they were closed. Where required, we rehabilitate these sites and, where and when we can, transfer them to local authorities or third parties for future land use. In North America, we are progressing the remediation of a number of sites. We have settled our obligations at the Vernon, a former aluminium cast plate facility in California, and are undertaking seven studies at other sites to develop a path to divest our landholdings or optimise ongoing monitoring and maintenance.\n\nIn Europe, we are remediating the historic white and red mud deposits at Salindres, France, and have commissioned a soil treatment plant at Dammarie to enable the site to be repurposed in the future. In the UK, we continue to optimise our long-term treatment of water at Whinnyhall, a historic bauxite residue disposal site.\n\nAt the end of 2021, closure provisions on our balance sheet totalled $14.5/uni00A0billion (compared with $13.3 billion in 2020). We continue to optimise closure costs through sharing good practice with product groups, finding more efficient closure execution methods, building synergies through sequential closures, and targeting research and development opportunities (including water and waste treatment, material movement, community engagement methodologies and/uni00A0partnering).",

        "page_content": "## Strengthening our approach\n\nSuccessful closure needs to meet our host communities and long-term stewards' expectations. To achieve this, we are working with host communities, including Indigenous partners, on rehabilitation, revegetation and long-term monitoring of the land at many sites. In 2021, the first Argyle Rangers completed their Conservation and Land Management traineeship and joined our team full-time. The programme was developed to upskill Traditional Owners on various land management, community and cultural activities that will be undertaken during the closure execution phase, and post-closure monitoring and maintenance phase. Our focus is to support Traditional Owners to ultimately lead the important environmental monitoring and maintenance work required on site until approximately 2035.\n\nIn some locations, our landholdings are a significant contributor to land, water and biodiversity value. We have earmarked land for transfer to national parks and support a number of protected forests and parks across our portfolio. We are exploring options to repurpose several legacy sites for renewable energy, such as our pilot photovoltaic cell facility at Marignac, France, a former ferroalloy plant.\n\nWe have expanded our partnerships with universities and other organisations to find opportunities to repurpose and reprocess waste, improve water and waste treatment, and explore the social aspects of mine closure.\n\n## For example:\n\n- - Together, with our partner RESOLVE, we developed a business model and signed a memorandum of understanding to form Regeneration Enterprises, a for-purpose and for-profit company that will combine the re-mining and processing of waste with site closure and rehabilitation, with the ambition to create full restoration outcomes.\n- - As part of RemovAL, a European Commission H2020-funded Innovation Action, we continue to work with ZaaK Technologies to demonstrate at pilot scale the upcycling of bauxite residue into Smart Spheres \u00ae - an engineered lightweight aggregate that can be used in a range of civil engineering applications.\n- - We are a partner in the ReActiv project, which looks at new uses for bauxite residue produced during alumina refining in cement production.\n- - We are a member of the Social Aspects of Mine Closure Research Consortium, an initiative of the University of Queensland's Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining. The consortium was established in 2019 and is a multi-party, industry-university research collaboration to conduct research that challenges industry norms and practices, and places people at the centre of mine closure/uni00A0activities.\n\nTo realise these opportunities, we must have the basics in place. All our operating assets have closure plans aligned with our closure framework. We regularly update these plans to ensure they reflect stakeholder expectations and build on experience from closure practices as we learn from them. We have an internal assurance programme, and closure plans are audited every five years against our internal requirements. At operations with joint ownership structures, we work in partnership with the asset owners to embed closure into asset design, planning and operations.\n\nIn 2021, we completed asset closure strategies covering another six of our operating assets. These strategies are now in place for 42 assets, contributing to host communities' vision for future land use after our operations cease and ensuring closure is considered throughout the asset lifecycle to identify opportunities while in operation.\n\nThis year, to enhance our internal governance processes, we updated our Closure Standard that outlines our minimum closure requirements to mitigate risks associated with the permanent cessation of exploration, mining, processing, and logistics operations. We also updated the internal procedure for how we estimate and report on closure costs. More information on closure provisions and financial statements can be found on pages 229-230 of this report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Holden mine remediation leads to land/uni00A0conservation\n\nIn 2021, we contributed to the Chelan-Douglas Land Trust's establishment of the Chelan Coulees Reserve for permanent conservation as part of an environmental offset for work on the Holden remediation project. The long-term conservation will support native species and habitats unique to the Chelan area and provide benefits for generations to come.\n\nLearn more about our remediation work/uni00A0at riotinto.com/stories.",

Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and/uni00A0communities.\n\nWe believe all incidents and injuries are preventable, so our focus is on identifying, managing and, where possible, eliminating risks. In 2021, for/uni00A0the third year in a row, we had zero fatalities. While we recognise the commitment made by all our employees and contractors to achieve this milestone, we know we can always do better.\n\nAlthough we have had no fatalities on our managed sites in 2021, we/uni00A0are saddened by the loss of life at our suppliers and non-managed operations this year. Two people tragically drowned when a marine vessel delivering materials sank while en route to our Kemano operations in British Columbia, Canada. Three mariners also lost their lives in incidents on chartered vessels. At one of our non-managed joint-ventures, the Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin\u00e9e SA (CBG), three workers lost their lives in three separate workplace incidents. We/uni00A0are working closely with our partners to understand what happened in each of these events. We will work with our contractor partners and joint venture owners to support the implementation of actions to make these facilities and operations safer and eliminate fatalities in our industry. We also felt immense sadness this year when one of our colleagues from Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) lost his life tragically to violence on his way to work.\n\nWe still see some serious incidents at our own operations. A significant risk at our sites is falling objects, accounting for 38% of our potentially fatal incidents (PFIs). Focused improvements are under way to manage this critical risk. In the second half of the year, three people fell from significant heights in three separate events causing serious injury that could have resulted in a fatality. These incidents are stark reminders that we must continue to share the learnings across our business, both among our employees and our contractor partners. Over the last year, we have included contractors more in our safety efforts and are taking action across our product groups to support greater consistency in the application of our safety systems.\n\nWe had another challenging year managing the pandemic and we saw a small increase in the number of people hurt on the job. Our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) in 2021 was 0.40 compared to 0.37 in 2020. While we continue to build our safety maturity, we are seeing the impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on our operations, with fatigue across the organisation and, in some areas, tightness in the labour pool.\n\nIn 2021, we launched our Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSES) Transformation programme, a three-year programme to transform the way we access and use our health, safety and environment data, improving our data collection processes and, ultimately, our strategic decision making.\n\n## Safety and health performance 1 2017-2021\n\n|                                                            | 2021    | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fatalities at managed operations                           | 0       | 0      | 0      | 3      | 1      |\n| All-injury frequency rate (per 200,000 hours worked)       | 0.40    | 0.37   | 0.42   | 0.44   | 0.42   |\n| Number of lost-time injuries                               | 218     | 187 2  | 229 2  | 226    | 199    |\n| Lost-time injury frequency rate (per 200,000 hours worked) | 0.25    | 0.22   | 0.27   | 0.27   | 0.25   |\n| Safety maturity model (SMM) score 3                        | 5.7     | 5.4    | 4.5    | -      | -      |\n| New cases of occupational illness (per 10,000 employees)   | 12.1 5  | 16.9 2 | 21.3 2 | 29.6   | 24.6   |\n| Number of employees 4                                      | 49,000  | 47,500 | 46,000 | 47,500 | 47,000 |\n| Fines and prosecutions - safety (US$'000)                  | 646.2 6 | 25.4   | 40.7   | 59     | 29     |\n| Fines and prosecutions - health (US$'000) 8                | 5 8     | 0      | 1.4    | 0      | 7.1    |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Mental health and wellbeing\n\nMental health is a core part of our safety culture. We have continued to support several initiatives, including flexible work schedules, greater access to health and medical resources, improved benefits for better access to mental health specialists and virtual care packs, to help our people manage the impacts of COVID-19 on their mental health and/uni00A0wellbeing.\n\nIn 2021, we progressed the implementation of our mental health framework to raise awareness of mental wellbeing, reduce stigma and increase the capacity of our leaders to recognise and support individuals experiencing mental illness. We have used this framework in our product groups to better understand the current state of our employees' mental health, and to put in place control measures for mental wellbeing based on ease of implementation and breadth of/uni00A0impact.\n\nTo support the proactive management of mental wellbeing and to give our employees the tools and skills they need to build resilience and positive mental health, we continue to provide and promote the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), our mental health toolkit and our Peer Support Programme, which has expanded globally to now include 1,200 peer supporters worldwide.\n\nIn October 2021, we held our mental health week, with the aim of increasing mental wellbeing in the communities where we operate and encouraging our people to support and look out for one another. We also continue to support global mental health campaigns, including World Mental Health Day and R U OK? Day.\n\nIn 2021, we continued the rollout of our domestic violence support programmes, which now cover 100% of our employees.\n\nOur mental health strategy has moved us from an individual wellbeing mindset to a psychological health and safety risk management focus. We plan to progress our efforts in 2022 by addressing psychosocial hazards in the workplace using a risk management approach to further support better workplace mental health.\n\n## Occupational health\n\nIn 2021, we recorded fewer occupational health illnesses compared to the previous year, with 51 (2020: 68). However, we conducted fewer health assessments due to COVID-19 restrictions. We completed more than 366,000 health control verifications, of which 221,000 were COVID-19 control verifications, to assess the efficiency of our health controls, such as physical distancing and hygiene controls.\n\nThis year, we were able to return most of our operations to their routine hygiene-sampling activities to gather data on exposures to noise, dust and other contaminants, to evaluate the risk to people and determine control effectiveness and compliance. We reinstated health surveillance activities for those with exposures in the workplace, including fitness assessments as well as hearing and blood tests. We/uni00A0have not yet universally returned to lung-function testing due to difficulties with COVID-19 controls, but we are looking at strategies to reinstate this activity as soon as it can be safely conducted.\n\n## Strengthening our safety performance\n\nEliminating fatalities requires a strong safety culture and systems designed to mitigate risk and continually improve the safety of our work. Much of the success of our safety culture is a result of the work accomplished through the implementation of our safety maturity model (SMM), now in its third year. The SMM provides a roadmap for leaders to advance the foundations of safety without being overly prescriptive. These foundations include leadership and engagement, learning and improvement, risk management, and work planning and execution. We/uni00A0assess our assets' progress annually against each of these/uni00A0elements.\n\nIn 2021, we undertook an extensive review of the model and committed to introducing some enhancements from 2022 onwards, addressing areas where we can improve, including bridging the disparity in safety performance between employees and contractors and assessing the maturity of core systems, symbols and behaviours that drive safe operations. We will also place a greater emphasis on our people and their mindsets to build psychologically safe operations and extend our leadership maturity approach to environment and health management.\n\nOur critical risk management (CRM) system, a tool used to verify controls to prevent fatalities are in place before starting each task, is fundamental. In 2020, we expanded CRM to include COVID-19 critical controls and, in 2021, we further strengthened the system with improvements to the existing set of control verification checklists, in consultation with frontline leaders, and the addition of new checklists to address emerging risks such as the use of autonomous equipment.\n\nWe have also identified opportunities to improve safety in our Marine business and have embarked on a multi-year programme to improve all aspects of safety, health and the wellbeing of seafarers. A key focus will be the increased data collection of safety incidents and sharing learnings through training and coaching to avoid repeat incidents. Our/uni00A0goal is to drive visibility and accountability by engaging and partnering with other organisations to foster a safer future for the/uni00A0industry.\n\n## Transforming our HSES systems\n\nThe three-year HSES Transformation Programme was established in 2021 to simplify our health, safety, environment and security processes and technology systems into a handful of integrated tools. This will free up our leaders' time, and make our data more reliable and our business safer. This year's focus has been on the global design process, building and testing the processes and technology, and planning for rollout during 2022 and 2023.\n\n## Safety standards\n\nOur standards (available at riotinto.com) and procedures provide a consistent approach to managing hazards across our managed operations. We audit managed operations against our standards and require our businesses to meet their health and safety performance requirements and targets.\n\nIn 2021, we reviewed our underground control framework, updating the underground safety standard and adding 13 new Group procedures to support our understanding of our critical controls. We trained our underground leaders and implemented improved assurance activities to ensure our underground operations and projects have the technical capability to manage major hazards. We are now applying new technology underground to support geotechnical monitoring at Oyu/uni00A0Tolgoi, and in 2022, we will trial Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) at/uni00A0our underground project at Kennecott.",

        "page_content": "## COVID-19\n\nWhen COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic, we put strict protocols in place in line with government directives, many of which still remain. In 2021, we focused our efforts on the pathway out of the pandemic. We helped governments boost vaccination rates by opening our own vaccination hubs and encouraged our communities to get vaccinated to protect their loved ones.\n\nBuilding on measures introduced in 2020, all our operations and offices adopted screening measures, such as health questionnaires and temperature checks and, in most locations, virus screening. We track the situation in every region where we operate, and adapt control measures as needed, in line with government directives. Our specialist in-house team follows the latest health research and advice, and monitors new variants. Their expertise also helps to inform our policies and control measures.\n\nThe pandemic is ongoing and is continuing to present new challenges for our operations and supply chains. We are constantly evaluating the situation and addressing emerging issues as they/uni00A0arise.\n\n## Supporting our communities\n\nOmicron, our Business Resilience teams/uni00A0throughout the world, together with Group Services, Global Procurement and our Global Health teams worked to safeguard the health and safety of our people by securing medical services and equipment. We also worked with our partners to extend our care to vulnerable people in the communities.\n\n## COVID-19 vaccination support\n\nNow/uni00A0that vaccines are available, we have supported government vaccination campaigns and set up vaccination clinics near our operations in several locations across the US, Mongolia, South Africa, Madagascar, Canada and Australia - for our employees, contractors, their families, and community members.\n\n## Position statement on COVID-19 vaccination\n\nIn line with our commitment to the safety, health and wellbeing of our employees, contractors, their families, and the communities where we operate, we have updated our position statement regarding COVID-19 vaccinations. It reflects our commitment to ensuring our people are vaccinated against COVID-19, based on key principles, including regional risk assessments to determine whether certain roles, locations or tasks require individuals to be vaccinated. Our approach is guided by our commitment to respect human rights. Any vaccination requirements will be closely managed with care and will consider those who are unable to be fully vaccinated.\n\nWith COVID-19, none of us will be safe until everyone is safe. While we saw hope in some parts of the world, in other parts, there was an alarming resurgence of the virus.

        "page_content": "## People\n\nEmpowered and engaged colleagues are key to our success, but we recognise that the work culture in some parts of our business has not always supported this. As a result, we have launched a number of initiatives to evolve our culture, so our people feel safe, respected and included, and they are supported to use their knowledge and experience, drive improvements, and deliver transformation and growth.\n\n2021 was a challenging year with COVID-19 continuing to impact our ways of working and our lives at home. Our new leadership team focused on building trust and listening to our people. With the safety and wellbeing of our 49,000 employees top of mind, we have taken steps to shift our mindsets and simplify our processes.\n\n## Evolving our culture\n\nIn 2021, we launched our new strategy as well as our new values of care, courage and curiosity, which will reinforce the culture change that we are driving and enable greater performance. We recognise that embedding our values and evolving our culture will take time, but we are making important progress.\n\nWithin the mining industry, and across society as a whole, we see unacceptable behaviours such as bullying, sexual harassment, racism. To address this proactively within our own company, we commissioned expert and former Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick*, to conduct an independent review of our workplace culture, as part of our Everyday Respect task force. More than 10,000 people shared their experiences and suggestions, through listening sessions, surveys and written submissions.\n\nThe Board and Executive Committee fully endorse the recommendations set out in the report, which focus on a framework for prevention and response via three key areas:\n\n- - Leadership and behavioural change: A commitment from the company's leadership to create safe, respectful and inclusive working environments to prevent harmful behaviours and better support people in vulnerable situations. This includes increasing diversity within the company.\n- - Safe and inclusive facilities: Ensuring the company's camp and village facilities are safe and inclusive. This includes applying the same safety and risk processes that Rio/uni00A0Tinto uses to prevent harm in operations to create a safe environment for all employees and contractors.\n- - Caring response: Making it as easy and safe as possible for all people to call out unacceptable behaviours, highlight issues when they happen and receive support. This includes introducing early intervention options and improving how the company responds to formal complaints in the workplace.\n\nIn 2021, we also took part in the Western Australian Parliamentary Inquiry into sexual harassment of women in the fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) mining industry. We made our submission to the Inquiry in August and are absolutely committed to eradicating all forms of sexual harassment, racism and bullying in our workplace, wherever we operate globally. Everyone deserves to feel physically and psychologically safe at work, without exception. This is core to our values and what we stand for as a/uni00A0company.\n\nThis year, we also updated our confidential reporting programme, myVoice, with a number of enhancements designed to make it easier for our people to voice concerns when something at work does not feel right. The myVoice programme will continue to evolve to reflect the feedback received through the independent review. More information is available on page 107.\n\nWe know that addressing these issues will, over time, contribute to a safer, more inclusive and respectful work environment. It will help improve wellbeing, increase collaboration, and help to attract and retain diverse people. Continuing to focus on our culture will remain a key priority for all leaders in 2022.\n\nTo help catalyse change, we rolled out a major leadership development programme to our top 115 leaders. Over the next two years, a further 400 of our senior leaders will go through the same programme. We are also investing in developing our frontline colleagues, and we are focusing on more delegation and empowerment, as well as simplifying our governance processes. In 2022, we will also review our incentives and rewards to ensure they support and align with our desired culture, values and strategy.\n\nIn 2021, we also undertook two Group-wide employee engagement surveys to help us understand how our people feel about the company and our direction. In our latest survey in October, close to 27,000 employees completed the survey and provided over 62,000 comments. Results show that the new strategy was well-received, and our new values resonated for many who felt they have a stronger human connection and reflect what we want to be as a company.\n\nHowever, our employee satisfaction (eSAT) score, which measures how happy people are working at Rio/uni00A0Tinto, has gone down from 73 to 71. This is the first decline since 2017, and is seen across most levels, geographies and parts of the business. This is consistent with what Glint, our survey provider and expert in engagement, is seeing across organisations. After a broad increase in eSAT during the first year of the pandemic, there has been a general decline across many industries and organisations as fatigue increases. This is a combination of increasing workload to cover absenteeism, additional pandemicrelated work and the isolation for those working from home leading to higher levels of employee burnout.\n\n## Building a workforce that reflects the diversity of our community\n\nIn 2021, our workforce grew by 3,001 and we hired 7,895 people, of which 3,098 were contractors who became permanent Rio/uni00A0Tinto employees.\n\nWe continue to focus on the representation of women across all levels. This year, we expanded our gender diversity targets beyond women in senior leadership to women at all levels and increased the representation of women in our workforce by 1.5%. Overall, we increased female representation from 20.1% to 21.6%, hiring 2,524 women, 32% of all new hires. Gender diversity also improved among our senior leadership, up 1.3% to 27.4%. Also, for the first time in five years, our frontline operator female representation grew by 0.9%, from 14.2% to 15.1%.\n\nInitiatives to increase the representation of women include the Women in Mining Forum at our Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) operations in South Africa, sponsored by the site leadership team. Discussion forums were held between senior management and female employees at the site to foster dialogue and identify areas for improvement to break down gender bias and inequality. Our Gladstone leadership development pilot programme is another example from this year where we focused on building career pathways to develop the capability of our female talent in frontline leader roles. The programme was rolled out across the Boyne Smelters, Queensland Alumina and our Yarwun refinery, and our plan is to deploy this programme across our Pacific Operations.\n\n- * Elizabeth Broderick AO, Principal, Elizabeth Broderick & Co.

        "page_content": "Our graduate programme is one avenue where we can make sure our leaders of tomorrow reflect the diversity of our community. For our 2021 intake, 58% of the graduates are female and 35% from nationalities where we are building new businesses. In Australia, 10% of the graduate intake and 15% of our vacation student programme are Indigenous, both up from 8% in 2020. We are also investing in the development of our graduates through our new graduate development programme. Due to COVID-19, this programme is now a two-year virtual journey that ensures that all graduates, regardless of where they are located, have access to the same curriculum. It prepares graduates to be future leaders with experiences including the future of work and our role in society. In 2021, the programme received an innovation award through the Human Resources Canada Awards.\n\nWe know that having an inclusive and diverse workforce improves performance, and we are committed to Indigenous peoples having a stronger voice across our business. We are one of the largest employers of Indigenous Australians, with almost 1,500 Indigenous employees and contractors working across our Australian business, but we recognise that we have more work to do to increase representation in professional and leadership roles. We have committed $50 million over five years to attract, retain and grow Indigenous professionals and leaders in Australia, and we have increased the number of Australian Indigenous leaders in our business fivefold since November 2020. We have also developed a national cultural competence programme which was launched in 2021 and will continue to be delivered to our leaders across our business in 2022.\n\n## Ensuring equality through pay equity\n\nEquity is intrinsically linked to our commitment to inclusion and diversity. Ensuring that employees with similar skills, knowledge, qualifications, experience and performance are paid equally for the same or comparable work remains a core focus. Our gender pay gap reporting consists of two metrics:\n\n- - Our equal pay gap, the primary lens we use when assessing gender pay, measures the extent to which women and men employed by our company in the same location and performing work of equal value receive the same pay. In 2021, we further reduced our gender pay gap compared to 2020, which is less than 1.5% in favour of men.\n- - Gender pay is a measure of the difference between the average earnings of women and men across the Group (excluding incentive pay), regardless of role, expressed as a percentage of men's earnings. In/uni00A02021, our gender pay gap is unchanged with just over 1% in favour of/uni00A0women.\n\nMultiple factors impact this more high-level indicator, including our approach to promoting equity, reflecting higher increases in average earnings for women and an increase in the number of women in higher-paying roles. During the year, we increased our headcount by around 7%. This included a significant proportion of male hires in lower paying roles within the operational workforce, which contributed to the overall outcome. More information on our commitment to pay equity can be found at riotinto.com/payequity.\n\n## Other activities in 2021:\n\n- - Launched the development of the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Safe Production System (RTSPS) to support our ambition of becoming the best operator. RTSPS empowers our frontline employees, simplifies what we do, frees our people to innovate and brings consistency to our operations. We began testing the model at five sites in 2021: at our copper concentrator at Kennecott, Yandicoogina Fixed Plant, and drill and blast at West/uni00A0Angelas in the Pilbara, the casthouse system at Grande-Baie in the Saguenay, and the concentrator at the Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC).\n- - Launched a programme to streamline processes and remove bureaucracy to further empower our people. As an example, we are ensuring authority is delegated to the appropriate level and have completed improvements to our workflows, representing approximately 16,750 approvals per year and returning almost 2,800 hours annually to our leaders.\n- - Expanded our technical expertise through the RioExcel programme with 36 people formally recognised as technical RioExperts, bringing our total number to 109. Of these, 18% are women and our total RioExpert population represents 14 technical disciplines across six countries.\n- - Partnered with Mindgym to conduct 15 virtual learning sessions for over 500 people globally (in English and French) about inclusion, being a better ally and creating a sense of belonging.\n- - Continued to encourage skills development through LinkedIn Learning. Since its launch in May 2020, more than 17,000 of our colleagues have registered for the platform and completed more than 16,200 courses and 24,500 hours of learning.\n- - Increased the employee contribution caps in our Global/uni00A0Employee Share Plan, myShare, further increasing the attractiveness of the programme. The number of employees who hold Rio/uni00A0Tinto shares through myShare/uni00A0increased by 14% this year - to more than 25,000 employees.\n- - Researched our global mobile talent to understand the impact of the pandemic on how people view international assignments and what support they need to thrive. Outcomes from this research will inform the shape of the mobility programme to ensure we provide the right support and growth opportunities.\n- - Established a partnership with the Australian Graduate School of Management (AGSM) at the University of New South Wales to deliver the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Emerging Indigenous Executive Leaders Programme (EIELP) to 20 Indigenous leaders. This programme focuses on developing executive-ready Indigenous future leaders who will have an influential role in shaping the future of our business.\n- - Completed the first round of the Indigenous two-way mentoring programme. We matched 31 of our Indigenous employees with senior leaders across our Australia businesses. We have now launched round two of this programme, with 45 Indigenous employees participating.",

        "page_content": "## Human rights\n\nOur commitment to human rights is core to our values. It is fundamentally about treating people with dignity and respect - our employees and contractors, workers in our value chain, communities and others with whom we interact.\n\nOur Board Sustainability Committee oversees our approach, as we work to improve our human rights performance. This includes strengthening our processes to prevent any involvement in adverse human rights impacts and, importantly, to provide for, or co-operate in, remediation when we identify that we have caused, or contributed to, human rights harm.\n\nOur salient human rights issues are those where we could have the most severe impacts on people through our own activities or business relationships. Taking into account our operational footprint, value chain and external contexts, we updated our salient human rights issues in 2021 to include land access and use; Indigenous peoples' rights; security; inclusion and diversity; community health, safety and wellbeing; workplace health and safety; labour rights; and climate change and just transition (respecting human rights while transitioning to a low-carbon economy).\n\nWe recognise the importance of acting on any involvement we might have in human rights harm through our business relationships with our suppliers, customers and joint venture partners, in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and international standards. We look for ways to work with our business partners to advance respect for human rights in line with international standards and our values.\n\nUsing a risk-based approach, we pre-screen potential business partners on human rights and require suppliers (including subcontractors) to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which requires respect for human rights. Our standard global supply contract and purchase order terms and conditions, as well as our Marine chartering contracts, include modern slavery provisions.\n\nWe build our employees' understanding through general and targeted human rights training.\n\n## Commitment to international standards\n\nWe are committed to respecting all internationally recognised human rights, as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and implementing the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). We voluntarily uphold a range of other international standards, including the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (OECD Guidelines) and the UN Global Compact's Ten Principles.\n\nConsistent with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, we are committed to acknowledging and respecting Indigenous peoples' connections to lands and waters and strengthening the application of the principles of Free, Prior and Informed Consent of affected Indigenous communities in line with the International Council on Mining and Metals Position Statement on Indigenous Peoples and Mining. We acknowledge that the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge was a breach of our values, standards and procedures, including those that help us respect human rights. This year, we progressed a remedy process with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people. We continue to engage with Traditional Owners, Indigenous groups, civil society organisations and other stakeholders, to inform our approach to the management and protection of cultural heritage.\n\n## Key actions during 2021\n\n## Governance\n\n- - Revised our salient human rights issues.\n- - Consulted on an updated human rights policy to be published in 2022.\n- - Started development of a responsible sourcing labour rights action plan to evolve our approach on labour rights risk management across Rio/uni00A0Tinto Procurement managed suppliers.\n- - Completed an external audit of our community complaints, disputes and grievance mechanisms for alignment with the UNGPs' criteria for effective non-judicial grievance mechanisms.\n- - Integrated human rights considerations into our refreshed marine safety and crew welfare strategy.\n\n## Training and awareness-raising\n\n- - Delivered mandatory human rights training for Rio/uni00A0Tinto Procurement and Logistics.\n- - Provided targeted human rights training for our Sales and Marketing, Ethics and Compliance, Legal, Communities and Social Performance, and Marine teams, including our ship managers for our Rio/uni00A0Tinto owned fleet.\n- - Refreshed our VPSHR training for security personnel.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement and reporting\n\n- - Published our fourth VPSHR Implementation Report and our fifth Modern Slavery Statement in compliance with the Australian and UK Modern Slavery Acts.\n- - Engaged with the Australian National Contact Point responsible for promoting the OECD Guidelines, the Human Rights Law Centre and community representatives regarding the former Panguna copper mine in Bougainville. More information can be found on page 92.\n- - Provided support to the Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin\u00e9e SA, in its discussions with the International Finance Corporation's Office of the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman and community complainants regarding the Sangaredi mine in Guinea.\n- - Engaged with human rights-related shipping initiatives, including in relation to the risks faced by seafarers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- - Hosted more than 40 civil society organisations in three environmental, social and governance roundtables with Board and Executive Committee members in North America, Europe and the UK, and Australia which included discussions about human rights.",

Materials used in products today may not be the preferred choice in the future if they cannot establish their environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials or develop strong circular solutions. This starts with transparency and includes our suppliers, operations and customers.\n\nWe are part of a huge ecosystem that includes 37,000 suppliers and 2,000 customers across multiple industries and countries. More than 230 marine vessels transport our products. We are improving our knowledge of suppliers through enhanced due diligence and ongoing monitoring.\n\n## Working across our value chain\n\nWe progressed a number of activities to reduce our impacts in 2021.\n\n## Mining\n\n- - Electrifying mine trucks through the Charge On Innovation Challenge\n- - Zero-emission autonomous mining haulage with Caterpillar and Komatsu\n- - Trialling our first renewable diesel-powered haul truck using organic biomass at Boron in the US\n- - Additional solar generation capacity at Weipa in Australia\n- - Renewable energy for QMM in Madagascar\n\n## Processing and production\n\n- - Transforming iron ore pellets into hot briquetted iron using green hydrogen and hydro-electricity\n- - Producing low-carbon aluminium at the ELYSIS Industrial Research and Development Centre\n- - Developing a new steel powder and aluminiumscandium alloy for 3D printing applications using materials extracted from/uni00A0waste\n- - Assessing the use of hydrogen in alumina refining processes with ARENA\n\n## Lifecycle\n\n- - Exploring a lithium battery lifecycle initiative with InoBat\n- - Joined Japan's Green Value Chain Platform Network to lead transparent decarbonisation efforts\n- - Launched START, an aluminium traceability and transparency initiative\n\nOur Supplier Code of Conduct lays out our expectations on human and labour rights, safety and environment. Our global supply contract outlines our expectations for how our suppliers should manage modern slavery risks.\n\nIn our operations, we are providing our customers with assurance that our value chain is responsible through independent industry stewardship programmes. Our Kennecott and Oyu Tolgoi copper operations have been awarded the Copper Mark, the copper industry's independently assessed responsible production programme. In 2021, our ISAL smelter in Iceland was certified under the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative, joining other aluminium assets in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Our three Canadian mines - Diavik Diamond Mine, Iron Ore Company of Canada, and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Fer et Titane - are assured under the Towards Sustainable Mining programme. See the 2021 Sustainability Fact Book for more information.\n\nWe also have a product stewardship strategy and programmes that guide our approach to managing regulatory and sustainability risks and opportunities in delivering our product to market. Our programmes address the regulatory requirements of both our host countries and end markets, as well as those that apply during transport.\n\n## Distribution and customer use\n\n- - Studying ammonia as a zero-carbon marine fuel with ITOCHU\n- - Building a fleet of liquefied natural gas (LNG) dual-fuel vessels\n- - Transitioning to a lowcarbon emission steel value chain with POSCO\n- - Exploring low-carbon steelmaking using Pilbara iron ores with BlueScope\n- - Researching low-carbon ironmaking, combining raw, sustainable biomass with/uni00A0microwaves\n\n## End of life\n\n- - Extracting high-purity scandium oxide from waste streams of titanium dioxide production\n- - Recovering tellurium as a by-product of copper smelting\n- - Melting scrap to make alloys with recycled content for aluminium customers with Shawinigan Aluminium Inc.\n- - Launching Regeneration Enterprises to re-mine and process waste from legacy mine sites with the ambition to create full restoration outcomes",

Sometimes this requires courage, which is one of our values. This expectation extends to our partners, that they behave and operate in a way that aligns with our values and priorities.\n\n## Business integrity\n\nOur code of conduct is clear that we do not offer, pay or accept bribes, no matter where we operate, what the amount, what the situation, and who is involved. Our code of conduct applies to all our people and is available to our external partners and stakeholders at riotinto.com/ethics. In 2021, we updated the code of conduct to reflect our new values of care, courage and curiosity and the new name of our confidential reporting programme, myVoice. Our Business Integrity Standard and Procedure require our employees, core contractors and any third parties acting for, or on behalf of, the company to not commit, authorise or be involved in bribery, corruption, fraud or other economic crimes. We/uni00A0also have clear rules regarding third-party benefits, managing conflicts of interest, facilitation payments, sponsorships, donations and community support, mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures, and engaging third parties. Our Ethics and Compliance team helps our people navigate any grey areas.\n\nThis year, we updated our Business Integrity Standard and Procedure to simplify and optimise the efficiency of our processes and better guide our people on how to make the right decisions and demonstrate ethical behaviours. In 2021, we updated the New Country Entry Procedure outlining steps to assess the potential risks (including corruption risks), and internal approvals process, for us to enter a new country. This year, we also established the Export Controls Procedure setting out the requirements for compliance with export control laws.\n\nWe have further enhanced our Risk Monitoring Review Forum to regularly review Group-level business integrity risks, and to identify and mitigate new and existing business integrity risks across our operations. In 2021, we established the Group Ethics & Compliance Committee, a sub-committee of the Executive Committee, to provide strategic oversight and input on compliance matters. The Committee provides a formal, structured forum for senior leaders to discuss compliance risks, and ensure the compliance programme is working effectively in practice. In addition, the Board oversees ethics and compliance matters, including myVoice, our confidential reporting/uni00A0programme.\n\nWe encourage and equip our people to do the right thing. Our employees are required to complete annual online compliance training, tailored to suit the risks they are most likely to encounter in their specific role and team. We are also continuing our ethics ambassador programme to extend the sharing and reach of integrity initiatives and champion an integrity-driven culture across the business. In 2022, we will update our code of conduct to align with our new strategy and values. We will also ensure it reflects our increased focus on supporting a culture where everyone feels safe to challenge and speak up freely when something does not feel right.\n\n## Working with third parties\n\nUnderstanding the beneficial ownership and activities of the parties with whom we transact business is an important part of living our values and maintaining impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials.\n\nIn 2021, we amalgamated the Know Your Supplier and Know Your Customer Procedures into a single Know Your Third Party Procedure. This simplified document aligns risk criteria and clearly articulates the due-diligence requirements for all types of third parties. We have also included additional risk criteria to address human rights, labour rights, and modern slavery risk. We also implemented a new Sanctions Standard in March 2021, setting out the requirements and framework for compliance with applicable economic sanctions laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, and all our third parties are screened for sanctions.\n\nEY completed an external review of our due diligence process. This/uni00A0work will help guide us to streamline and automate processes and better align the level of due diligence with the assessed third party's inherent risk.\n\n## myVoice, confidential reporting programme\n\nIn 2021, we launched our enhanced confidential reporting programme, myVoice, designed to help our people voice concerns about potential misconduct or improper behaviour. We have increased the independence and effectiveness of the programme through organisational changes and clearly defined governance, responsibilities and accountabilities. The programme is managed by a dedicated Business Conduct Office (BCO) reporting to the Chief Legal Officer & External Affairs. The BCO and the Investigations team report regularly to the Group Ethics & Compliance Committee.\n\nOur employees' response has been positive, and we are seeing an increase in reporting and believe this means that more people are feeling comfortable to share their concerns. In 2021, for the period from 1 January to 31 December, we received 1,246 reports through the myVoice programme channels. Of these cases, 51% were substantiated including 18 cases which were reports received in 2020. The substantiation rate increase in 2021 reflects a single substantiated incident where 139 reports were received.\n\n## myVoice - confidential reporting programme\n\n| myVoice 1  case activity              | 2021         | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of reports                     | 1246/uni00A0 | 748    | 805    | 679    | 712    |\n| Number of reports per 1,000 employees | 26.0/uni00A0 | 16.3   | 17.9   | 14.3   | 15.1   |\n| Substantiated claims (%)              | 51%/uni00A0  | 42%    | 34%    | 34%    | 33%    |\n\n- 1.

We are a founding member of the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) and have actively supported EITI's principles and global transparency and accountability standards since 2003. In 2018, we became a signatory to the B Team Responsible Tax Principles. In 2021, we reinforced our commitment to transparency over tax reporting by being one of the first companies to fully implement the disclosure requirements under the Global Reporting Initiative Tax standard GRI 207.\n\nIn 2021, we joined other leading extractive-sector companies in confirming our commitment to support beneficial ownership transparency, including through the disclosure of ownership information, and in using ownership information in undertaking due diligence on partners and suppliers.\n\n## Political integrity\n\nWe do not favour any political party, group or individual, or involve ourselves in party political matters. We prohibit the use of funds to support political candidates or parties. Our business integrity procedure includes strict guidelines for dealing with current and former government officials and politicians, and they cannot be appointed to senior employee positions or engaged as consultants, in certain circumstances, without the approval of executive management and our Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer.\n\nWe regularly engage with governments and share information and our experiences on issues that affect our operations and our industry.\n\nWe join industry associations where membership provides value to our business, investors and other stakeholders. At riotinto.com/industryassociations, we outline the principles that guide our participation, the way we engage, as well as a list of the top five associations by membership fees paid. We also track and disclose how we engage on climate policy issues, disclosing when the policies and advocacy positions adopted by industry associations differ materially from ours.\n\nThis year, we have further strengthened our approach and disclosures on industry associations.\n\n## Training\n\nIn total, 4,307 employees and contractors in 18 countries had face-toface training, and over 23,000 had online training in recognising and managing business integrity/uni00A0dilemmas.\n\n## Value chain\n\n|                                                                 | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Due-diligence checks on third parties                           | 4,754  |\n| Due-diligence checks on third parties - baseline screening only | 8,040  |\n| Centrally monitored third parties 1                             | 44,495 |\n\n- 1. Once third parties are screened, they then form part of ongoing monitoring.\n\nWe have applied the reporting principles of GRI 101: Foundation 2016 Standard in this report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Partnering to strengthen business ethics in Mongolia\n\nIn partnership with the Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MNCCI), and Transparency International Mongolia, we launched a new Business Integrity Centre in 2021 to help support the country's efforts to promote transparency, business ethics, and corporate governance.\n\nLearn more at riotinto.com/ethics.",

External organisations and initiatives assess and recognise our performance, and we participate in industry accreditation programmes for some of our products. These organisations and initiatives include the following:\n\n## Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI)\n\nThe ASI aims to create sustainability and transparency throughout the aluminium industry. It has developed the world's first global Responsible Aluminium Standard, used to assess environmental, social and governance practices across the aluminium supply chain for responsible sourcing. We were the first company in the world to receive certification under the ASI.\n\n## Blue Green Alliance (BGA)\n\nThe BGA aims to solve environmental challenges in ways that create and maintain quality jobs and build a stronger, fairer economy. We are on the Advisory Board of the BGA.\n\n## Business for Social Responsibility (BSR)\n\nBSR is a global non-profit organisation that works with its network of more than 250 member companies and other partners to build a just and sustainable world. As a member, we share information on sustainable practices.\n\n## Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)\n\nWe are a founding member of the EITI and have played an active role in this global standard since 2003. The EITI promotes open and accountable management of natural resources to make sure our activities benefit the many, not the few. We are transparent about the taxes and royalties we pay - publishing an annual Taxes Paid Report since 2010.\n\n## Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n\nGRI is an international independent organisation with an international framework and standards for sustainability reporting. Our Group-level sustainability reporting is informed by the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (Core option) and the GRI Mining and Metals Sector/uni00A0Supplement.\n\n## International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM)\n\nAs a member, we commit to implementing and reporting on ICMM's Ten Principles for Sustainable Development. These cover corporate governance, environmental stewardship and community engagement. Our Chief Executive is a member of the ICMM Council, and we participate actively in various working groups, such as the climate change and energy working group. In 2021, our Chief Executive signed the ICMM Climate Change statement, committing Rio/uni00A0Tinto and other member companies to a goal of net zero by 2050 or sooner.\n\nWe are also committed to implementing the ICMM Performance Expectations (PEs). The ICMM Mining Principles framework focuses on the implementation of systems and practices related to a broad range of sustainability areas. Eleven Rio/uni00A0Tinto managed assets completed self-assessments in 2021. These assets met the requirements in the areas of ethical business practice, decision making, health and safety, social performance, and stakeholder engagement. Our teams identified opportunities to improve our performance in human rights, risk management, environmental performance, conservation of biodiversity, and responsible production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kimberley Process (KP)\n\nWe participate in the Kimberley Process through our involvement with the World Diamond Council (WDC). The KP is a joint initiative between governments, diamond industry bodies and civil society organisations, mandated by the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, to stem the flow of 'conflict diamonds'.\n\n## London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)\n\nThe LBMA has renewed Rio/uni00A0Tinto Kennecott's responsible gold and silver certificate, which guarantees that the precious metals produced from Kennecott's refinery are accepted and traded globally. The certificate is one of the requirements for precious metal refineries to be placed on the LBMA's Good Delivery List (GDL), an internationally recognised standard for quality and responsible production. Many precious metal exchanges will accept gold and silver bars only from refiners that appear on the GDL.",

They include non-binding principles and standards for responsible business conduct in a global context consistent with applicable laws and internationally recognised standards. These guidelines are a multilaterally agreed and comprehensive code of responsible business conduct that governments have committed to/uni00A0promoting.\n\n## Proteus Partnership\n\nThe Proteus Partnership was formed in 2003 as a collaborative effort between leading extractive companies and the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) to improve accessibility to biodiversity data for better decision making and support the development of global biodiversity resources. As a Proteus Partner, we have access to the UNEP-WCMC online biodiversity assessment tool, which allows us to scan for potential sensitive areas in places where we are seeking tenure before major investments are made.\n\n## Responsible Jewellery Council (RJC)\n\nThe RJC is an international non-profit organisation that promotes transparent and responsible ethical, human rights, social and environmental practices throughout the jewellery industry - from mine to retail. We are a founding member and were the first mining company to be certified in 2012. Since then, we have continued to uphold the ESG standards and maintained RJC certification, which needs to be renewed every three years. We were re-certified in 2021 against the RJC Code of Practice Standards. RJC certification covers operations or activities of our businesses that produce diamonds, gold or gold in concentrates that contribute to the jewellery supply chain. This includes our Diavik Diamond Mine in Canada and our Kennecott copper mine in Utah for gold.\n\n## The B Team Responsible Tax Principles\n\nWe are a signatory to The B Team Responsible Tax Principles, developed by a group of cross-sector, cross-regional companies to define what leadership in responsible tax looks like. The disclosures in our Taxes Paid Report, available at riotinto.com/taxespaidreport, demonstrate our approach to The B Team's seven Responsible Tax/uni00A0Principles.\n\n## The Copper Mark\n\nDeveloped by the International Copper Association - with input from a range of stakeholders, including customers, NGOs and producers - The Copper Mark is a comprehensive assurance framework to demonstrate the copper industry's responsible production practices and contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Our Kennecott mine, in Utah, US, and Oyu Tolgoi, in Mongolia, were the first producers to be awarded the Copper Mark - verifying our copper as responsibly produced.\n\n## Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM)\n\nWe participate in the TSM programme through our membership of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC). TSM is a sustainability certification that applies to members of MAC operating in Canada.\n\n## United Nations Global Compact (UNGC)\n\nThe UNGC is a voluntary initiative based on CEO commitments to implement universal sustainability principles and to take steps to support UN goals.

We/uni00A0seek to operate in a manner consistent with the UNGPs.\n\n## United Nations Sustainable Development Goals/uni00A0(SDGs)\n\nThe SDGs are a set of 17 goals and 169 targets endorsed by the UN in 2015. These present a broad sustainability agenda focused on the need to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and respond to climate change by 2030. Please see page 75 for more on our approach to the SDGs.\n\n## United Nations Universal Declaration of/uni00A0Human Rights (UDHR)\n\nThe UDHR is a milestone document in the history of human rights, which sets out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be respected. We respect and support all internationally recognised human rights consistent with the UDHR.\n\n## Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR)\n\nThe VPSHR guides extractives companies on how to maintain the safety and security of their operations in line with respect for human rights. Participants, including governments, companies and nongovernmental organisations, agree to proactively implement or support the implementation of the VPSHR. We published our VPSHR Report for the first time in 2018 (previously only provided to other participants) and have committed to doing this each year.\n\n## World Economic Forum (WEF)\n\nWEF brings together the foremost political, business, cultural and other leaders of society to shape global, regional and industry agendas. It is independent, impartial and not tied to any special interests. The Forum strives to demonstrate entrepreneurship in the global public interest while upholding the highest standards of governance.",

We embed risk management at every level of the organisation to effectively manage threats and opportunities to our business and host communities, and our impact on the environment. The Board and the Executive Committee provide oversight of our principal risks, and the Audit Committee monitors the overall effectiveness of our risk management processes and internal controls. All employees are required and empowered to identify and manage the risks that arise within their area of/uni00A0responsibility.\n\nOur management system consists of six core elements (see page 114) that we continuously monitor and improve to ensure that we are effectively managing current risks and identifying emerging risks.\n\nThe tragic events at Juukan Gorge in May 2020, highlighted the importance of having a strong risk culture as well as robust risk management practices and systems, to ensure a resilient organisation. To achieve this, we have enhanced our internal training and guidance materials for leaders and risk owners on risk management responsibilities and practices, including the disclosure and escalation of risk information to ensure management response is at the right level of the organisation.\n\nWe will continue to invest in ways to support and coach our leaders and teams in risk management, ensuring alignment with our risk appetite and code of conduct.\n\nOur three lines of defence provide assurance that risks are effectively managed in line with our policies, standards and procedures. You can view our risk management policy and standard at riotinto.com/policies.\n\nThe risk management framework sets out clear roles and responsibilities, standards and practices. The overall effectiveness of the risk management framework requires clear expectations and consistency in the application of internal controls across the Group.

As the pandemic is now becoming more endemic with varying pathways to recovery across countries, the longer-term impact of how we adapt to this new normal is still uncertain. This includes the productivity of a hybrid workforce environment, the impacts of tighter labour markets, and supply chain disruptions.\n\nThe recent disruptions caused by the post-pandemic demand surge and the inability of supply chains to keep up, have highlighted the complexity and vulnerability of the global supply chain infrastructure. Supply chain disruptions can also be caused by a number of principal risk events - as described in our principal risks and uncertainties section - such as natural disasters and geopolitical tensions. Inflationary pressures may also affect the competitiveness of suppliers, leading to supplier market contraction further impacting supply chain resilience. Severe supply chain disruptions have the potential to impact not only inbound and outbound flows of our feedstock, services and products, but also the delivery of our sustaining and growth projects.\n\nIn the longer term, as the world transitions to a low-carbon future and consumer demand for sustainable goods flows through the value chain, the supply-demand dynamics of commodities are expected to shift. This will lead to increasing demand for sources and solutions with low CO2 emissions, and a lower social and environmental footprint, in addition to a growing demand for transparent, sustainable and circular value chains. While the commodities within our portfolio are needed in a decarbonising world, this shift will shape the future of the mining industry, impacting supply cost structures, and demand for global commodities, and increasing the focus on the non-financial performance measures.\n\nOur future reserves are increasingly overlapping with sensitive social and ecological regions, requiring new extraction and technology advancements to minimise our impact when exploring, mining and processing. Technology advancement will not only be a key enabler for us to reach our net-zero emissions ambition, but it will also play a key role in how we achieve impeccable ESG credentials.\n\nOur 2021 Climate Change Report explains in detail our current and future initiatives and partnerships, and how they will help us meet our Scope 1 and 2 targets.\n\n## Longer-term viability statement\n\n## Business planning process\n\nOur long-term planning reflects our business model of running our business in a way that is safer, smarter and more sustainable. To ensure we remain resilient in the long term, our business model is continuously stress tested against the key uncertainties within the emerging risks areas with recommended actions to mitigate the potential downside. These are presented to the Board annually as part of the Group strategy discussions. We then develop our strategy and make capital investment decisions based on this assessment. We also regularly assess our financial capacity to ensure our capital commitments can be funded in line with our disciplined approach to capital allocation.\n\nOur business planning processes include preparing a one-year detailed financial plan and a longer-term life-of-asset outlook. This/uni00A0planning process includes modelling a series of macroeconomic scenarios and using a range of assumptions that consider both internal and external factors. As part of our robust risk management framework, we closely track, monitor and mitigate principal risks to our business plan and model.\n\nThe main assumptions underpinning our long-term plan include:\n\n- - long-term economic growth and commodity demand in major markets, such as China;\n- - continued access to, and economic viability of, resources and reserves to support organic and inorganic growth programmes;\n- - pathways to reduce our carbon footprint;\n- - sensitivities to potentially disruptive technologies and productivity improvements;\n- - no operational risks materially impacting the long-term plan; and\n- - continued access to capital markets.\n\n## Viability assessment process and key assumptions\n\nThe assumptions underlying our business plan and macroeconomic forecast have the greatest level of certainty for the first three years. However, like last year, our longer-term viability assessment examines the first five years (2022-2026) of the business plan. This enables a detailed analysis of the potential impact of risks materialising in quick succession in the first three years, and to further stress test the business plan for risk materialising towards the end of the time period, although with less certainty. This allows Directors to assess Rio/uni00A0Tinto's capacity to exercise financial and other levers available in both the three-year and five-year timeframes to maintain the Group's/uni00A0viability.\n\nOur principal risks and uncertainties, as outlined in the following section, are risks that could materially affect our performance, future prospects or reputation. For the viability assessment, we have considered principal risks that could have a severe impact on the Group's liquidity and solvency in addition to non-financial consequences.",

        "page_content": "## Assessment of viability\n\nThe principal risks and assumptions considered in our longer-term viability assessment are as follows:\n\n## -Commodity economic risk (economic-focused risk):\n\nA global financial crisis is triggered as the COVID-19 pandemic persists and global tensions intensify, resulting in positive but low growth in China and an economic downturn in the rest of the world. Large negative pricing shocks are assumed in 2022, sustained through 2023 and followed by slow growth rates.\n\nThere continues to be great uncertainty on the recovery pathway from the COVID-19 pandemic as the situation evolves with new variants and varying actions by governments. To mitigate some of this uncertainty, and to give a greater level of confidence to the Directors in assessing our long-term viability, we have assumed a cautious recovery pathway in our scenario.\n\n## -Major hazards risks (operationally focused risk):\n\nOccurrence of a singular catastrophic event resulting from a major operational failure, such as a tailings and water storage facility failure, an extreme weather event, or an underground or geotechnical event resulting in multiple fatalities and/or the cessation of operations incurring significant financial impacts. We have assumed that two such events occur within the assessment period ie in 2022 and 2025.\n\n## -ESG-focused risk:\n\nMaterialisation of an ESG-focused risk, impacting how we operate and our ability to access current and future resources. This could include a severe deterioration in our relationship with Indigenous peoples or communities where we operate, new prohibitive laws or regulations, or water scarcity. We have assumed an impact on our current development pipeline and considered available alternatives. The financial impact assumed here is in addition to any non-financial impact, such as reputational damage to the Group or the disruption to the culture and way of life of the communities where we operate.\n\nWe quantify the expected financial impact of each risk based on internal macroeconomic and business analysis, as well as internal and external benchmarking on similar risks. We apply a probabilistic approach to quantify risks and impacts where relevant.\n\nThe first five years of the Group's business plan were stress tested for each risk to assess the impact on the Group's longer-term viability, including whether additional financing facilities would be required. In addition to liquidity and solvency, the assessment also considered other financial performance metrics as well as dividend payments. These metrics are subject to robust stress tests and reverse stress tests.\n\nThe most severe scenario considers the financial impact of all three risks materialising at the start of the assessment period, followed by a second operational risk occurring towards the end of the five-year time period. Without management action, this scenario would create both an immediate and prolonged severe impact, resulting in the Group's free cash flow performance over the assessment period being an estimated negative $20 billion in aggregate.\n\nThe Group has a suite of management actions available to preserve resilience through the period of assessment, including accessing lines of credit, reducing organic and inorganic growth capital expenditure, and raising capital. Our financial flexibility could potentially be limited during the peak of the crisis, but the longer-term viability of the Group under all the scenarios tested remains sound.\n\nWe have also conducted reverse stress testing by assessing the impact of reducing price levels, on a synchronised basis, and concluded that the Group remains viable in a very low probability event of prolonged price declines across all commodities.\n\nThe resilience of the Group's business model is largely underpinned by four factors:\n\n- - The competitive position and diversification of our commodities portfolio.\n- - The disciplined capital allocation framework and commitment to prudent financial policy.\n- - The payout shareholder return policy based on earnings, and accordingly more sustainable.\n- - The objective to achieve impeccable ESG performance and, therefore, strengthening our social licence and allowing for growth and maintaining access to debt capital and bank loan markets.\n\nTaking into account the Group's current position and the robust assessment of our principal risks, the Directors have assessed the prospects of the Group over the next five years (until 31 December 2026) and have a reasonable expectation that we will be able to continue to operate and meet our liabilities as they fall due over that/uni00A0period.\n\nThe following principal risks, which have longer-dated consequences or continue to evolve, could potentially have a material impact on our business beyond the viability assessment period. Please refer to the Emerging risks and Principal risks and uncertainties sections for further details and current management responses.\n\n- -Developing products and technologies that enable our customers to decarbonise\n\nAs the global effort to tackle climate change continues, consumer demand for sustainable goods is expected to flow through the value chain. If our customers do not reduce Scope 3 emissions, demand for our products may decline as lower-carbon alternatives are developed and adopted.\n\n- -Our ability to replenish or convert resources to reserves in a timely/uni00A0manner\n\nAs market dynamics, regulations, cultural and environmental assessments, and societal expectations change, key assumptions underlying our ore resources and reserves and project development plans could change with material impact to the Group (positive or negative). This is addressed in our principal risks 'Growing in materials essential for energy transition' and 'Resources to reserves conversion of our existing assets'.\n\n- -Closure, reclamation, rehabilitation and legacies\n\nPlans and provisions for closure, reclamation and rehabilitation at our operational and legacy sites could be impacted by changes in stakeholders' expectations, legislation, standards, technical understanding and techniques.",

Implementation of these proposals poses the threat of contagion across other jurisdictions. The OECD digital reforms may incentivise additional domestic proposals, raising the risk of double taxation and/or bi-lateral and multi-lateral disputes. The/uni00A0translation of the new global tax framework into domestic law poses significant uncertainty and potential for double taxation/disputes. Increasing pressure on stabilisation/investment agreements is expected.\n\nExposure: The potential financial consequences of these risks are significant given the political dynamic and the COVID-19 economic recovery effort. Domestic resource tax proposals in countries like Chile would have a material impact on business value and pose contagion threat across that region. The/uni00A0OECD digital proposals are expected to result in material additional taxation and will place additional strain on stabilisation arrangements.\n\n- - Verifying our compliance to our Tax Policy through our Internal Audit which sets the following expectations:\n- - Ensuring full compliance with statutory obligations accompanied by full disclosure\n- - Ensuring high standards of tax risk management\n- - Fostering constructive working relationships with tax administrators\n- - Proactively managing taxes pursuant to a robust tax governance/uni00A0framework",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's introduction\n\nEffective corporate governance is a continuous process of prioritisation and improvement, and we must adapt our processes and activities to be relevant to the evolving external and internal landscapes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs expectations about the role of business in society evolve, we must adapt and continuously improve our corporate governance processes to ensure that they remain fit for purpose in a rapidly changing internal and external environment.\n\nThe matters on which the Board and its committees focused in 2021 evolved in line with developments in the external environment, the unprecedented senior management changes that took place at the start of the year, the approval of our new strategy and values, and the need to ensure that the lessons learned from the tragic events at Juukan Gorge in May 2020 are fully embedded in our management processes and culture.\n\n## Culture and values\n\nAs Rio/uni00A0Tinto resets its strategy and priorities under the new leadership team, culture and values will play a critical role in meeting the company's aspiration to become the best operator, to excel in development and to achieve impeccable ESG credentials, while strengthening our social licence to operate.\n\nAmong the many lessons from Juukan Gorge was the recognition that any risk management system will fail unless we create a work culture where everyone considers the impact of our individual and collective actions on other people and the environment, actively listens and questions how we can do things better, and feels empowered to speak up when something is wrong.\n\nThese lessons were reinforced by the findings and recommendations outlined in the Everyday Respect report, which we commissioned to better understand and improve our work culture. This year we introduced our new values of care, courage and curiosity. These values will guide how we work and how we treat each other, drive better decision-making, strengthen relationships and enable us to deliver superior performance by unlocking the knowledge and insights of the entire workforce.\n\nFeedback from our employee engagement survey, conducted in late 2021, suggests that the new values resonate well with our workforce. But actions speak louder than words and it will take time and consistent commitment by leaders throughout the organisation to embed the changes we are seeking.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nThe Board has long recognised the importance of understanding the views of our workforce to ensure they are considered in Board discussions and decision making. In 2021, we took a further step to enhance this approach with the appointment of Simon McKeon as the designated Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement. In this role, Simon oversees the annual programme of engagements and regularly reports back to the Board on the insights gained, to ensure our people's voices are heard and acted upon in the boardroom.\n\n## Board changes and succession planning\n\nWe welcomed Ben Wyatt as a Non-Executive Director this year. Together with the three Non-Executive Director appointments in 2020, these new voices in the boardroom have challenged and tested our thinking in a very positive way and brought fresh and diverse perspectives to our discussions.\n\nThis continual refreshment of Board composition will receive further impetus in 2022 under Dominic Barton's leadership, with mining experience a key focus.\n\nThe other matters we discussed in 2021 are detailed on the following pages. This work has taken place within the context of continuing COVID-19 restrictions, largely preventing meetings in person and Board visits to operations. While there is no substitute for face-to-face meetings, I am grateful to my colleagues for the commitment and flexibility they have shown to enable our programme of work to be completed so effectively via virtual Board meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Thompson\n\nChairman\n\n23 February 2022",

In addition to strengthening crisis management and communications, the key learnings which the Board and Executive team are committed to addressing are: (i) promoting an inclusive, open and transparent culture that empowers people to raise and escalate concerns on operational and ethical issues; and (ii) applying a more values-driven approach to guide decision making. Our new values of care, courage and curiosity, support these desired behaviours.\n\n## Employee survey\n\nThe Board received and considered reports and updates from the Chief People Officer on the results of our twice-yearly employee engagement survey in July and December, which provided useful insights into themes arising from the rollout of the Group's new strategy and values. In considering the reports, the Board made a number of recommendations aimed at improving: (i) communications from senior leadership to the wider workforce; (ii) opportunities for career growth and learning; and (iii) psychological safety to embed the desired leadership ethos in the organisation and support and incentivise the desired behaviours and values.\n\n## Employee engagement sessions\n\nAs part of the Board's ongoing commitment to engage with our people, a number of interactive employee sessions were held during the year.\n\nThe first session was with Simon Thompson, Simon McKeon, Simon/uni00A0Henry, Ngaire Woods, Hinda Gharbi and some of our RioExperts (employee representatives from RioExcel, a Technical Excellence initiative designed to grow technical expertise and capability by creating a technical career pathway for recognised experts). At the session, the/uni00A0group discussed our new values and how to embed them, the importance of research and development, and enabling employees to be innovative.\n\nThe second session was attended by Megan Clark, Jennifer Nason, Ben Wyatt, Sam Laidlaw and a group of employees from our graduate development programme. The discussions focused on leadership, our culture, and our values, including why they have evolved and how to embed and measure them.\n\nWe also held employee town halls in Melbourne, London and Serbia. In/uni00A0Melbourne, Simon McKeon spoke about a range of issues, including: his role as Senior Independent Director; the appointment of Dominic Barton as Chair-designate; Juukan Gorge; climate change; and cultural heritage. He took questions on our reputation, risk management, and the challenges we might face in the future.\n\nAt the town hall in London, Simon Thompson shared his reflections on the year, including on Board changes, our new priorities, values and strategy, our safety performance, and the challenges of COVID-19. He/uni00A0took questions from our people covering topics including why our values have evolved, growth opportunities for the Group, embedding our new strategy and values, and how to maintain employee wellbeing.\n\n## Employee dashboard\n\nThe Board received a quarterly 'employee dashboard' which provides insights into how management is progressing with employee-related initiatives, key employee metrics, a summary of employees' concerns and interests, and people-focused activities that will be undertaken in the following quarter.\n\nThe dashboard covers the following people metrics: progress with female representation; fatigue management and annual leave usage; reports received via myVoice (our enhanced confidential reporting programme); Employee Assistance Programme usage; and employee turnover and absenteeism.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the following topics were top of mind for employees: our Everyday Respect initiative; COVID-19 and vaccines; fatigue and mental wellbeing; and our new strategy and values.\n\n## Ben Wyatt visits the Ranger Mine\n\nIn September, Ben Wyatt, Non-Executive Director, visited the Ranger Mine near the town of Jabiru in the Northern Territory, Australia. During/uni00A0the visit, Ben met with the Chief Executive, Australia, the General Manager, Communities and Social Performance, and representatives of Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) to discuss the asset. ERA employees gave Ben a tour of Jabiru. He also met with the CEO of Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation (GAC), the Senior Adviser to GAC, and a group of Traditional Owners.\n\nBen also visited the Ranger site and the Traditional Owners took him to Madjedbebe, a very significant heritage site that confirms human occupation of the area going back more than 50,000 years. This is on the edge of the Jabiluka mineral lease and has very high concentrations of rock art and a significant burial ground.\n\n## Simon Thompson and Megan Clark visit/uni00A0Karratha\n\nIn 2021, Chairman Simon Thompson and Independent Director Megan/uni00A0Clark visited the Pilbara to engage first-hand with stakeholders, including representatives of a Pilbara Aboriginal Corporation.\n\nSimon and Megan spent time listening and hearing stories to understand the deeply felt experience stakeholders have with Rio/uni00A0Tinto and how changes to the way we manage cultural heritage within our operations are being received.",

COVID-19 travel restrictions required in-person site visits to be undertaken by individual committee members. Committee members visited the Brockman mine and the Winu project in Western Australia, the Resolution Copper project in Arizona, US, and Energy Resources Australia in the Northern Territory, Australia.\n\nAt these site visits, Sustainability Committee members received briefings on Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSES) and Community and Social Performance (CSP) matters and the management of material HSES and CSP risks, and met with key personnel. These visits gave the Directors a chance to observe the culture and leadership, consider the CSP frameworks and management systems, and see the daily cadence of risk management with a diverse cross-section of the workforce from frontline to leaders, partners and contractors. These visits provide a valuable opportunity to assess whether we are meeting the expectations of Traditional Owners, First Nations peoples, and local communities.\n\n## Winu project site, and Brockman 4 mine, Western/uni00A0Australia\n\nMegan Clark visited the Winu project in the Paterson region of Western Australia and received briefings on engagement with Traditional Owners, the Nyangumarta Warrarn and Martu, drilling results, health and safety systems and risk management. Daily pre-start meetings showed our safety maturity model in action.\n\n## China Advisory Panel\n\nAt the China Advisory Panel in December 2021, members of the Board and Executive Committee heard from a diverse group of external experts, and discussed the potential impacts of domestic and international China-related developments for the Group. The topics discussed included:\n\n## China's national climate change policy and the implications for the mining industry and metal sectors\n\nThe discussion on this topic focused on the challenge of balancing economic development with carbon reduction, the future development of the aluminium industry in China, and on the policy framework to be applied to energy and carbon-intensive industries, and the need for technological innovation.\n\n## China's 14 th Five-Year Plan and implications for China's domestic social and economic development pathways\n\nThe policies were expected to serve the interest of healthier, environmentally friendly, and fairer growth in the long term, and ensure more resilient and sustainable economic and political development.\n\nRecent Chinese Government policymaking and the potential impact on foreign investment.\n\nThe attendees recognised the key dynamics influencing international political and economic relations, and the role of trade and investment for long-term sustainable growth and best practice sharing.\n\nShe also visited Brockman 4 operations and reviewed the progress of the Juukan Gorge remediation programme with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama Elders. While on site, the front line leaders also shared real life examples of the Integrated Heritage Management Process, including the new heritage checklist for blasting activities and their approach to water management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our stakeholders - Section 172(1) statement\n\nThe Board is required by the UK Companies Act 2006 to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of our shareholders, and in doing so, to take into account the interests of our wider stakeholders. Our key stakeholders are our workforce, the communities in which we operate, civil society organisations, governments, our investors, our customers, and our/uni00A0suppliers.\n\nOn pages 20-22 of this report, we have set out why the interests of these stakeholders are of strategic importance to Rio/uni00A0Tinto. In the section below, we provide more information on how the Board engages and communicates with stakeholders, and how it takes account of their interests in its decision making.\n\nThis section, together with the information on pages 20-22, constitutes our section 172(1) statement.\n\n## Our workforce\n\n## How we engage and communicate\n\nWe engage with our workforce regularly and through a wide variety of channels. In 2021, these channels included twice-yearly engagement surveys and more regular, local surveys to gauge concerns around COVID-19, as well as email and video updates on subjects such as people changes, safety shares and Group news, including video interviews with the Chief Executive and Chairman during COP26. In addition, we held focus groups with members of the Board, town halls with the Chief Executive, Chairman, Executive Committee members and our local Business Resilience Teams, and shared these events more widely via our intranet, Element, and employee app, RT Connect.\n\nDuring the year, we also launched a series of podcasts entitled 'Conversations with the Board'. In the first of these, Ben Wyatt and Ngaire Woods spoke about their thoughts on the company's key priorities, its values, what attracted them to join Rio/uni00A0Tinto, and their first impressions of the Board and the Group. The second podcast featured Jennifer Nason and Simon McKeon who reflected on how the Group has evolved since they joined the Board, how they see their role in supporting our new strategy, with the low-carbon transition at its heart, and what they took away from their engagement sessions with some of our RioExperts and employees from our graduate development programme.\n\nIn March, we launched a new, enhanced confidential reporting programme - myVoice. It is designed to help our people voice concerns when something at work does not feel right. To date, we have seen a noticeable increase in reporting, which we believe indicates that more people are feeling comfortable to share concerns and more confident that they will be addressed.\n\nIn response to employee focus groups held in 2020 and new research into workplace culture, the Everyday Respect task force was launched in March 2021 to improve how we prevent and respond to bullying, sexual harassment, racism and other forms of discrimination at work. The work of the task force has been shaped by our people, combined with the support of independent, external subject matter experts and well-founded research. The first step was to listen to our people. We held 109 group listening sessions and had more than 10,000 survey responses, and over 3,000 frontline insights were shared. More information about Everyday Respect can be found on page 101.\n\n## How the Board has taken account of these interests\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, we appointed Simon McKeon as our designated Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement. In this role, Simon has overseen the development of the programme of workforce engagement events (including the town halls, podcasts, videos and site visits described above) and reports back to the Board twice-yearly on feedback received via these engagements. These reports are supplemented by a newly developed quarterly 'employee dashboard' which provides insights into our people's interests and concerns. See page 138 for more details on the employee dashboard.\n\nThe results and reflections of our twice-yearly People Survey are also considered by the Board, together with proposed actions and improvement ideas.\n\nAs part of our commitment to ensure sustained cultural change across our global operations, we commissioned a comprehensive review of our workplace culture by Elizabeth Broderick & Co. The review identified disturbing findings of bullying, sexual harassment, racism and other forms of discrimination throughout the Group.\n\nThe Board reviewed a draft of the report as part of the work being undertaken by our Everyday Respect task force. The Board fully endorsed management's recommendation to publish the findings of the review in full as part of the Group's commitment to creating a safer, more respectful and more inclusive workplace. It also fully supports the recommendations of the report and will monitor the progress of their implementation.\n\nIn recognition of the findings in the Everyday Respect report, the management team recommended that a downward adjustment be made to the 2021 STIP payments. The Remuneration Committee concluded that a reduction of 5% should be applied to the total STIP payment for current Executive Committee members and an equivalent adjustment be made to the 2020 unvested Bonus Deferral Awards (BDA) held by former Executive Committee members. The STIP for 2022 will also include objectives linked to the recommendations arising in the report.\n\n## Communities\n\n## How we engage and communicate\n\nWe have made numerous improvements to the way we connect with communities and Traditional Owners. Accountability for Traditional Owner and community relationships has been reallocated to sit clearly with the site General Manager. This means that Traditional Owners and those in the community now have direct access to the site team and are able to resolve issues much more quickly.\n\nBoard members have met many Traditional Owners and communities at site visits, four of which took place during the year. More information on the site visits can be found on pages 138-139.\n\n## How the Board has taken account of these interests\n\nIn response to the Board Review following the tragic destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, a Communities and Social Performance (CSP) Area of Expertise (AoE) was established, reporting to Kellie Parker, our Chief Executive, Australia who is based in Brisbane and is a member of our Executive Committee. The CSP AoE ensures",

        "page_content": "conformance with Group policies, standards and procedures, including/uni00A0the Integrated Heritage Management Process, and shares best practice worldwide. The CSP AoE sits alongside the existing Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSES) function. This helps to ensure that communities and heritage risk processes are aligned with our existing robust health, safety and environmental systems. The CSP AoE also oversees internal assessments and reviews, including deep dives and operational reviews in conjunction with experts from our Group Risk function.\n\nThe framework includes a rigorous annual self-assessment and certification of impacts and risks. Internal Audit provides a third line of/uni00A0defence.\n\nIn September 2021, we published our first Communities and Social Performance Commitments Disclosure Interim Report. We are committed to ensuring that the Traditional Owners of the lands on which we operate contribute to and shape how we report. During July and August 2021, we sought feedback from Traditional Owner groups in the Pilbara on our progress regarding some of the commitments made as part of the Board's review of our management of cultural heritage.\n\nWe have established an Australian Advisory Group (AAG) which brings together an eminent group of independent advisers to provide guidance on current and emerging issues, and better manage policies and positions that are important to both Australian communities and our broader business. This is one of the 11 commitments we made as part of our action to strengthen our processes and approach to cultural heritage, following the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in May 2020. Advising the Chief Executive, Australia, the AAG will comprise a minimum of 60% Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander membership, with an Indigenous Australian Chairperson. The Sustainability Committee will engage with the AAG to share experiences in the Australian context. The group has not yet met, with the first AAG meeting to be held in late March, 2022. Recognising that trust still needs to be earned, the inaugural meeting will explore how the group will work together with Rio Tinto leaders. This will include setting of expectations and co-designing protocols for the group's governance. More information can be found on page 95.\n\n## Civil society organisations\n\n## How we engage and communicate\n\nWe use different methods to engage with civil society organisations and tailor those methods to the needs of each group. We have established channels of dialogue with community organisations at our sites and projects, and since 2018 have held annual regional roundtable discussions involving civil society organisations, members of the Board, Executive Committee members and senior leaders.\n\nBy highlighting concerns about environmental, social and governance issues, and advising us on how we can improve, civil society organisations can be an important advocate for change. We believe that significant progress in preventing and addressing complex ESG challenges will only be achieved through genuine dialogue and engagement between governments, business, investors, consumers and civil society organisations. The challenges include climate change, water management, biodiversity, human rights violations, and bribery and corruption. In order to build trust and sustain public support, we also recognise that it is vital that all parties adopt high standards of integrity, transparency and accountability in their work in these areas and that civil society organisations maintain their independence from party politics.\n\n## How the Board has taken account of these interests\n\nIn November 2021, the Board held three roundtables in Australia, northern America and Europe. A diverse group of civil society organisations was represented. The agendas were tailored for each region and informed by preparatory conversations with the participants.\n\nTopics discussed were wide ranging and included our new strategy, our new climate change targets, nature, Juukan Gorge, QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM), human rights, and our key projects.\n\nA number of agreements were reached regarding information sharing, follow-up meetings were arranged, and actions were agreed by members of the Board, Executive Committee and senior leaders in response to the issues raised by the civil society organisations that attended. We also sought feedback on the sessions from the attendees via a survey and some direct messages. In general, participants felt the roundtables provided a valuable opportunity to engage with senior leaders and welcomed the tone and openness to listening to their/uni00A0perspectives.\n\nThe members of the Board who did not join the meetings received and noted a paper which summarised the discussions and outcomes.\n\nRepresentatives of civil society organisations are periodically invited to engage directly with the Board to inform decision making on critical areas of policy or strategy development. In 2021, the Board received a presentation from the World Benchmarking Alliance, which represents organisations working at global, regional and local levels to shape the private sector's contributions to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). See page 75 for information on our approach to the UN SDGs.\n\n## Governments\n\n## How we engage and communicate\n\nWe engage with governments at all levels on issues that affect, or could affect, the Group. We do this via direct engagement and indirectly through our trade association partners and international forums, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and the International Council on Mining and Metals. We contribute relevant evidence and information, and share experiences and expertise that help to inform the development of robust public policy and regulation.\n\nIn 2021, we engaged with the Australian Government regarding our senior leadership changes, heritage issues, our investment strategy, energy and decarbonisation. With support from the Governments of Canada and Quebec, we continue to progress ELYSIS, our project with Alcoa that aims to eliminate direct greenhouse gases from the aluminium smelting process. We continue to work with the Government of Guinea to explore ways to optimise, develop and fund the worldclass Simandou iron ore deposit. We regularly contribute to EU public policy development on issues such as critical minerals strategy, battery legislation, green mining principles and due diligence legislation. We/uni00A0work closely with the Government of South Africa to support the operational stability at Richards Bay Minerals. In the US, we advocate on public policy related to the North American supply chain and, specifically, alignment on climate change, critical minerals and materials, renewable energy, and trade.\n\n## How the Board has taken account of these interests\n\nThe Board receives regular updates and papers regarding all of these projects and in doing so oversees engagement with governments and considers their interests. Members of the Board also engaged directly with representatives of the Governments of Australia, Guinea, Serbia, Mongolia, Canada and the UK and discussed a wide range of issues including:\n\n- - Heritage issues, investment and decarbonisation, in Australia.\n- - The Jadar project, the development of battery and electric vehicle value chains in Serbia and Europe.\n- - The development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground project.\n- - Decarbonisation opportunities in Canada.\n- - The UK Government's critical minerals strategy.",

        "page_content": "## Investors\n\n## How we engage and communicate\n\nWe hold two annual general meetings (AGMs) each year, one in Australia and one in the UK. Due to COVID-19-related restrictions, our UK AGM was an online event for the second consecutive year. However, we were able to host a hybrid AGM in Perth, Western Australia. Institutional and retail investors were able to engage directly with the Board and management at and around the AGMs.\n\nWe also maintain a programme of engagement with investors and analysts to ensure both current and potential new investors have the opportunity to hear from executives, the Chairman and subject matter experts from across the business. We held an online Communities and Social Performance seminar in March in which the Chair of our Sustainability Committee, our Chief Executive, our Chief Executive, Australia, our Chief Technical Officer and other experts from across the Group provided investors and analysts with an update on our approach to cultural heritage, which also included case studies from some of our operations in Canada and the Northern Territory of Australia.\n\nEvery two years, we update financial markets on our strategy. In October, we held an in-person Investor Seminar in London, hosted by our Chief Executive and the entire Executive Committee, which included presentations from Perth, Brisbane and Singapore. The focus of the event was to outline the actions being taken to strengthen the business and improve performance. At the event, we also unveiled our longerterm strategy to ensure we thrive in a decarbonising world and continue to deliver attractive shareholder returns, in line with our policy.\n\n## How the Board has taken account of these interests\n\nIn responding to feedback from investors, the Board has continued to deliver a strategy of maximising shareholder returns while allocating capital with discipline for future growth and sustained operational performance through the macroeconomic and commodity cycles.\n\nGiven investor interest in ESG issues, including climate change and our work with communities around the world, the Board considers these issues during its strategy sessions when assessing our portfolio positions.\n\nThe Chairman engaged extensively with investors across multiple markets in advance of our AGMs to understand their perspectives. He also led twice-yearly meetings with the Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) investor groups in Europe and Asia, to convey how our new strategy integrates the net zero transition into our business, including our portfolio, capital investment decisions, and business planning. The discussions focused on the key indicators in the CA100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark. In/uni00A0particular, our Scope 1 and 2 targets, the approach to Scope 3 emissions, capital allocation alignment, governance, and our climate policy engagement. These engagements with CA100+ provide us with a valuable sounding board as we implement our strategy, respond to requisitioned resolutions and develop our reporting.\n\nAt the 2021 AGMs, we received strong shareholder support for our new Remuneration Policy which included the introduction of ESG metrics into our incentives. At the same AGMs, shareholders also registered a vote against our Remuneration report, specifically in response to the treatment of departing executives in the light of Juukan Gorge. The Committee engaged extensively with shareholders and proxies before and after the AGMs on remuneration-related matters. The feedback received contributed to the establishment of the Consequence Management Framework that provides a set of guardrails to guide the Remuneration Committee in the exercise of discretion and application of malus and clawback. In addition, we updated the Long term incentive plan leaver provisions to further strengthen the Committee's ability to apply discretion so as to ensure that incentive pay outcomes are fair, appropriate and defensible.\n\n## Customers\n\n## How we engage and communicate\n\nThroughout 2021, we have expanded our commercial activities into new areas to meet customer needs. This includes the expansion of our portside sales presence to 15 ports in China, meeting demand from more than 80 iron ore customers, and the expansion into bonded warehouse sales for our aluminium business. Following a successful rollout in other products, including iron ore, we expanded our WeChat presence to the boron agriculture market in China. This new channel provides a simple way for customers to interact with our local team.\n\nClimate change is one of the biggest challenges facing our customers and our supply chains, and it will take a coordinated effort to make meaningful progress. We continue to focus on innovative partnerships with customers to meet their needs and help produce sustainable products. This includes partnering to develop new products such as with AB InBev to produce beverage cans made from low-carbon aluminium that meets industryleading sustainability standards. We are also partnering with Shawinigan Aluminium, to create custom alloys containing our lowest carbon metal with our customers' scrap. In/uni00A0addition, we are partnering with our customers to support the decarbonisation of their processes to reduce Scope 3 emissions. More/uni00A0information can be found on page 71.\n\nFor the past three years, we have sought feedback annually via our customer survey, the results of which are shared with the Board by the Chief Executive and allow us to continue to shape these important relationships.\n\n## How the Board has taken account of these interests\n\nIn response to customer requirements for greater transparency on ESG standards throughout the value chain, we have set a new standard in traceability for the aluminium industry with START, a 'nutritional label' for responsible aluminium. Through blockchain technology, START helps customers meet the demand from consumers for transparency on where and how the products they purchase are made and aims to empower end-users to make informed choices about the products they buy.\n\nWe continue to work closely with our customers to manage the pressures placed on the supply chain as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Suppliers\n\n## How we engage and communicate\n\nOur suppliers are critical to the development and safe running of our global operations and we are committed to continuing to build strong relationships with them. We engage regularly with our supplier partners. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic our relationships with our suppliers have deepened. We have partnered with key suppliers, Komatsu and Caterpillar, to develop zero-emissions technologies and applications for mine-haulage systems.\n\nFor the past two years, we have sought our suppliers' feedback annually via our supplier survey, the results of which are shared with the Board by the Chief Executive. The survey results allow us to continue to shape these important relationships, building on general satisfaction and areas for improvement. The Board began tracking the progress of supplier satisfaction from the baseline developed in the 2020 survey.\n\n## How the Board has taken account of these interests\n\nWe fully recognise the importance of paying suppliers promptly, in particular in the case of smaller companies. In 2021, we introduced faster payments for small suppliers across much of the world. We also reduced payment terms for regional and Indigenous suppliers in Australia.\n\nFor more information on our work with our suppliers, including our partnerships to reduce emissions and decarbonise, and our work with local suppliers, see pages 66-67 and 70-71.",

        "page_content": "## Matters discussed in 2021\n\nThe Board had seven scheduled meetings in 2021 and three additional meetings were held to discuss matters outside the Board's regular agenda items. Set out below are some of the matters which the Board has considered during the year.\n\nAt every Board meeting, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer report on the safety, operating and business performance of the Group against our key performance indicators, as well as how certain material stakeholder issues are being managed. The Board also received detailed reports from the management team relating to progress on major growth projects and updates on operations. In addition, the Board invites external subject matter experts to present on issues relevant to major strategic or operational matters. Examples in 2021 included:\n\n## Growth projects\n\n- - In April, the Board considered and approved a proposal to enter into binding heads of agreement with Turquoise Hill Resources for an updated funding plan for the completion of the Oyu Tolgoi underground project in Mongolia.\n- - In July, the Board considered and approved a request for development capital of $2.4 billion for the Jadar lithium-borates project in Serbia. This project remains subject to receiving all relevant approvals, permits and licences.\n- - In December, the Board considered and approved a request to acquire the Rincon lithium project in Argentina.\n- - In December, the Board also noted an update regarding our capital projects, including Resolution Copper and Simandou.\n\n## Operational\n\n- - In February, the Board received an update on the Resolution Copper project. The project had achieved a critical permitting milestone with the publication of the Final Environmental Impact Statement under the United States National Environmental Policy/uni00A0Act.\n- - In July, the Board received an update on Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) and the transfer of tenure for the town of Jabiru. The Board agreed to include ERA as a regular item on the Sustainability Committee's agenda as part of that Committee's responsibility in monitoring progress on cultural heritage management issues across the Group.\n- - In July, the Board also received an update on challenges at Richards Bay Minerals. The Board considered the security situation and endorsed the management team's proposal that operations would not be restarted until the community-related issues were resolved satisfactorily. The Board acknowledged that the priority was to understand and resolve the root causes of the community issues.\n- - In December, the Board discussed and approved the Group's IS&T strategy and the Group's risks and controls relating to cyber security.\n- - In December, the Board reviewed an evaluation of the status of the Group's ore reserves and mineral resources.\n\n## ESG\n\nThe Board has ultimate oversight of environmental, social and governance matters, but has delegated responsibility for certain matters to the Sustainability Committee.\n\nDuring the year, the Board reviewed its forward agenda of matters to be discussed, considered its constitution, composition and performance, and reviewed any new or amended Group policies. In/uni00A0addition, it considered the following governance matters:\n\n- - In February, the Board received and noted a paper regarding the Board and committee evaluation plan.\n- - In April, the Board was updated on the steps being taken to rebuild stakeholder relations in Australia following the tragic events at Juukan Gorge in May 2020. During the update, the Board noted that listening to our stakeholders and ensuring that we meet their expectations will be critical to regain their trust. The need to focus on improving and consistently demonstrating our ESG credentials was also recognised. The management team continued to work on defining initiatives to rebuild trust with each stakeholder group.\n- - In July, the Board received an update regarding a number of initiatives to continue to strengthen and improve our approach to cultural heritage and community relations. In particular, the Board considered progress with the Australian Advisory Group and our approach to the modernisation of our Rio/uni00A0Tinto Iron Ore agreements.\n- - In September, the Board and Executive Committee participated in a joint review of the events surrounding the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters. The aim was to analyse our response to the crisis, share and understand each other's experiences and perceptions during the crisis, reach a common understanding of lessons learned, reset and strengthen the relationship between the Board and the new Executive Committee, and improve our collective response to any future crisis.\n- - In December, the Board considered and endorsed the 2022 annual plan and received and noted an update on ethics and compliance.\n- - In December, the Board noted a paper regarding the draft 'say/uni00A0on climate' resolution to be proposed at the 2022 AGMs.",

        "page_content": "## Evaluating our performance\n\nAn effective Board depends on the personal development of individual Directors and continuous improvement in the operation of the Board as a whole.\n\nThe Board recognises the benefit of an evaluation exercise that provides meaningful insight to Board and committee members on how they can improve their individual and collective contribution to the leadership and effectiveness of the Group. The evaluation also provides an important opportunity to agree on priorities for the coming year and develop an appropriate Board agenda.\n\nThe Board undertakes an evaluation on an annual basis. This year, we/uni00A0undertook an internal evaluation which was facilitated by the Group Company Secretary and Lintstock, who consolidated responses to the questionnaires. The evaluations of the Board and committees were based on questionnaires distributed to all Directors. The views of Directors were consolidated into formal reports which were discussed by the Chairman with individual Directors and then in a plenary session by the Board and the relevant committees. A questionnaire was also sent to members of the Executive Committee and the Group Company Secretary to obtain their perspectives on the effectiveness of the Board and its committees.\n\nEvery third year, we engage a professional external adviser to carry out the Board review to obtain an independent evaluation. The next external review will take place in 2022.\n\n## Board and committee composition\n\nWhile the size of the Board and the level of diversity amongst Directors received high ratings, the range of skills and geographic representation were identified as an area for further focus. It was agreed that the key changes that should be made to the Board's profile over the next three to five years might include (i) greater mining expertise, (ii) China experience, (iii) North America, particularly Canadian experience, and (iv) stronger ESG/decarbonisation expertise. It was also agreed that the Board should at least maintain the level of Australian representation.\n\n## Actions:\n\n- - Reinstate face-to-face meetings and site visits as soon as possible.\n- - Add one additional member to the Audit Committee with recent and relevant financial experience.\n- - Review the size and composition of the Sustainability Committee.\n- - Review Board composition after appointment of the new Chair to ensure appropriate geographical representation and mining/uni00A0expertise.\n\n## Stakeholder oversight\n\nThe Board's understanding of investors received a high rating, while the knowledge of other key external stakeholders received positive ratings overall. The value of the Board engaging with external stakeholders directly was highlighted by a number of respondents, for/uni00A0example through site and community visits, and the importance of maintaining a balanced understanding of stakeholder relationships was stressed. A few respondents indicated that there was scope to improve the understanding of communities and civil society organisations in particular. The/uni00A0importance of the monitoring of employee sentiment and culture was highlighted, acknowledging the COVID-19 constraints as in 2020. The decision to appoint a designated Non-Executive Director for employee engagement was supported.\n\n## Actions:\n\n- - Make greater use of the China Advisory Panel and other outside/uni00A0speakers.\n- - Schedule talent pipeline and succession planning for the Executive Committee, including diversity.\n- - Promote culture and values.\n- - Enhance oversight of community management outside Australia and environmental management (particularly water and biodiversity).\n\n## Board dynamics\n\nIt was noted that relationships are developing well with the new Executive Committee, and that these benefited from the reset as part of the lessons learned from Juukan Gorge. The importance of the Board meeting face-to-face and resuming in-person site visits, when possible, was emphasised.\n\n## Management and focus of meetings\n\nThe management of Board meetings received high ratings.\n\n## Actions:\n\n- - Increase regularity of updates on major projects, with emphasis on what has changed since the last review.\n- - Increase focus on operational delivery, through individual product group presentations.",

A few respondents indicated that gaining additional external perspectives on the company would be useful. The importance of the Board devoting more time to the understanding of new technologies and digitalisation, in terms of the opportunities and threats they represent for the business, was/uni00A0stressed.\n\n## Actions:\n\n- - Improve benchmarking against competitors.\n- - Arrange presentations from each product group to provide the link between strategy and execution.\n- - Continue to focus on China and technology/digital.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nSome respondents indicated that the Board should devote more time to risk, and in supporting the Executive Committee in continuing to enhance risk management processes. The importance of ensuring balanced consideration of both financial and non-financial risks was stressed.

In his first few months as Chief Executive, Jakob's priorities included the appointment of his new Executive Committee and a review of their development needs. The Committee supported Jakob in this process. In addition to the appointments of Peter as Chief Financial Officer, nine other members of the Executive Committee took up new roles during 2021.\n\nFollowing the departure in October 2021 of our Group Executive Strategy & Development, the Committee agreed with the recommendation of management that the role should cease as an Executive Committee position and endorsed a reallocation of the responsibilities, including:\n\n- - Business Development, Mergers and Acquisition (M&A) and Strategy now report to the Chief Financial Officer.\n- - Closure, Exploration and Energy & Climate Change report to the Chief/uni00A0Technical Officer.\n\n## Chair succession\n\nOn 19 December 2021, the Board announced that it had selected Dominic Barton to succeed Simon Thompson as Rio/uni00A0Tinto's new Chair. Dominic will join the Board with effect from 4 April 2022 and be appointed to the role of Chair at the conclusion of the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited annual general meeting on 5 May 2022. Simon Thompson will step down as a Non-Executive Director of Rio/uni00A0Tinto and as Chairman at the same time on 5 May 2022, having served as Chairman for four years and as a Non-Executive Director since/uni00A02014.\n\nA Ugandan-born Canadian, Dominic spent over 30 years at McKinsey & Company, including nine as the Global Managing Partner and six as Asia Chairman. Most recently, he has been Canada's Ambassador to China since 2019. He brings a wealth of global business experience having advised clients in a range of industries, including banking, consumer goods, high tech and industrials, as well as a deep insight of geopolitics, corporate sustainability and governance.\n\n- - Health, Safety, Environment & Security (HSES), Communities & Social Performance (CSP) and Energy Resources of Australia report to the Chief Executive, Australia.\n- - Brand and Reputation, Communications and Media report to the Chief Legal Officer & External Affairs.\n\nFollowing this period of unprecedented management change, during 2022/uni00A0the Committee, and the Board, will refocus on broader talent management and succession planning. Following the appointment of Dominic Barton as our new Chair, the Committee will also review the composition of the Board to ensure, amongst other things, that it has adequate mining expertise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Thompson\n\nNominations Committee Chairman\n\n23 February 2022\n\nDominic's previous corporate governance work includes being Chair of Teck Resources, a Non-Executive Director at the Singtel Group in Singapore and a Non-Executive Director at Investor AB in Sweden. He has held various public sector leadership positions, including Chair of Canada's Advisory Council for Economic Growth and Chair of the International Advisory Committee to the President of South Korea on National Future and Vision. His/uni00A0business acumen and public sector insights position him to provide critical guidance and oversight to Rio/uni00A0Tinto's leadership team.\n\nThe Board is delighted to have appointed such an outstanding individual and is confident Dominic will lead the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Board with distinction. He has an impressive track record, with extensive and broad business and international relations knowledge, particularly in Asia, and a deep understanding of the link between business, governments and society.",

A member during 2021, stood down at the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited AGM in May 2021.\n\n## Appointments to the Board - our policy\n\nWe base our appointments to the Board on merit, and on objective selection criteria, with the aim of bringing a range of skills, knowledge and experience to Rio/uni00A0Tinto. This involves a formal and rigorous process to source strong candidates from diverse backgrounds and conducting appropriate background and reference checks on the shortlisted candidates. We aim to appoint people who will help us address the operational and strategic challenges and opportunities facing the company and ensure that our Board is diverse in terms of gender, nationality, social background and cognitive style. As such, we/uni00A0only engage recruitment agencies that are signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct on diversity best practice.\n\nWhen recruiting government or former government officials to join the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Board, we comply with any restrictions and obligations existing pursuant to relevant laws and regulations, including with respect to confidentiality, lobbying and conflicts of interest. For example, the timing and terms of the recent appointments of Ben Wyatt and Dominic Barton complied with all relevant restrictions and obligations. In Mr Wyatt's case, there was no requirement for any 'cooling off' period between Mr Wyatt ceasing to serve as a government official and joining the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Board as a Non-Executive Director. However, as a matter of good practice, a six-month 'cooling off' period after leaving office was mutually agreed by both parties.\n\nWe believe that an effective Board combines a range of perspectives with strong oversight, combining the experience of Directors who have developed a deep understanding of our business over several years with the fresh insights of newer appointees. We aim for our Board composition to reflect the global nature of our business. We currently have four different nationalities (including dual nationalities) on a Board of 11.\n\nThe Committee engaged Spencer Stuart to support the search for a new Chair. The recruitment of Ben Wyatt as a Non-Executive Director was not supported by an external agency. The Committee is satisfied that Spencer Stuart does not have any connections with the company or individual Directors that may impair their independence.\n\nThe key skills and experience of our Board are set out in the table at the end of this report.\n\nOur diversity and inclusion policy sets out our expectations around the behaviours needed for an inclusive and diverse workplace. The policy is co-owned and supported by the Board and Executive Committee. At a Group level, we report against gender diversity targets (see page 28) and achievement of these targets contributes to the variable remuneration of senior executives. In addition, each of our operations has locally-set employment targets. Their performance against these targets can be found in our 2021/uni00A0Sustainability Fact/uni00A0Book.\n\nRead our full policy on our website - riotinto.com/sustainability/policies.\n\n## Our key responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Nominations Committee is to review the composition of the Board. The Committee leads the process for appointments, making recommendations to the Board as part of succession planning for both Non-Executive and Executive Directors. It/uni00A0also approves proposals for appointments to the Executive Committee and monitors the succession planning and development of a diverse talent pipeline for Executive Committee members and their direct reports.\n\n## Membership of the Committee\n\nAll Non-Executive Directors are members of the Nominations Committee.\n\nThe Chief Executive and the Chief People Officer are invited to attend all or part of meetings, as appropriate. The Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board, unless the matter under consideration relates to the role of the Chairman. During 2021, the Chairman did not attend meetings where his succession was discussed.\n\nThe Committee had six meetings in 2021. Attendance at these meetings is included in the table on page 147.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\nThe Board recognises that it has a critical role to play in creating an environment in which all contributions are valued, different perspectives are embraced, and biases are acknowledged and overcome. The Board shares ownership with the Executive Committee of the Group's inclusion and diversity policy, which can be found at riotinto.com. We also discuss diversity and inclusion in the Sustainability section of this Annual Report.\n\nThe proportion of women on the Board is 36.4% (four women and seven men). The Group has continued to set measurable gender diversity objectives for the composition of senior leadership and graduate intake. Progress on diversity is shown in the Sustainability section on pages 101-102, where we show a breakdown by seniority.\n\n## Length of tenure of Non-Executive Directors\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is set out in detail over the following pages, but in this introduction I would just like to highlight a few aspects of the year.\n\nAs usual, a significant proportion of the Committee's time has been spent considering the significant issues of judgment relating to the financial statements. In 2021, these included impairment charges/ reversals, exclusions, closure provisions, climate change, tax, litigation and, for the first time, potential provisions for liabilities associated with Traditional Owners of land on which we operate. Our/uni00A0primary focus has been on potential impairments of assets and future closure liabilities. In each case, our/uni00A0work is focused on ensuring issues are identified early, the correct accounting judgments are made and that these matters are appropriately disclosed in our financial reporting. Further detail on these issues is provided on page/uni00A0153.\n\nIn 2021 the Board has seen a further intensification of the focus on climate change. The Audit Committee has focused on the potential implications for the financial statements, in particular on price scenarios, asset valuations, lifetime of resources and future costs of closure. These matters contain significant uncertainties and complexity from an accounting perspective, and the Committee has carefully considered the accounting judgments involved and appropriate disclosures in our financial reporting. Further/uni00A0information on climate change-related financial reporting is provided on page 155 of the Audit Committee report.\n\nWe closely monitor developing regulatory requirements in the three jurisdictions in which we are listed, and have contributed fully to the likely 2022 release of new requirements in the UK. Our intent is to be a valued contributor to positive developments in corporate governance, and to adopt new requirements in a timely way. In addition, it is clear that regulator and societal expectations are increasing within existing requirements, and we have worked with our external auditors to ensure that our risk, control and assurance frameworks are developing at pace in line with best practice. In 2021, together with the Sustainability Committee, the Audit Committee has taken a particular interest in the effective development and operation of the 'three lines of defence' assurance model. The Company's Internal Audit function has played a major role here, overseen by the Committee.\n\nLastly, I would like to express my thanks to my fellow Committee members and to others who support the work of the Committee. Sadly,/uni00A02021 has seen the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, and/uni00A0the travel restrictions associated with it have meant it has remained largely impossible for us to meet in person. That the Committee has managed to complete its full programme of work despite this challenge is testament to the skill and commitment of all involved.\n\nI hope that readers will find the information set out on the following pages interesting and informative.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Henry\n\nAudit Committee Chair\n\n23 February 2022\n\n## Audit Committee members\n\nSimon Henry (Chair)\n\nHinda Gharbi\n\nSimon McKeon\n\n## Membership\n\nThe members of the Committee are all independent Non-Executive Directors, and their biographies can be found on pages 134-135. The Chairman of the Board is not a member of the Committee.\n\nAs Rio/uni00A0Tinto's securities are listed in Australia, the UK and the US, we follow the regulatory requirements and best practice governance recommendations for audit committees in each of these markets.\n\n## Australian listing requirements\n\nIn Australia, the members, and the Committee as a whole, meet the independence requirements of the ASX Principles. Specifically, the Committee members between them have the accounting and financial expertise and a sufficient understanding of the industry in which the company operates to be able to discharge the Committee's mandate effectively.\n\n## UK listing requirements\n\nIn the UK, the members meet the requirements of the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, and the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to audit committee composition. Simon Henry, the Chair of the Committee, is considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial experience.\n\nSimon Henry and Hinda Gharbi both have extensive prior experience of the natural resources sector. Simon McKeon has gained experience of the mining sector by serving on the Board and on the Committee, and through regular site visits, reports and presentations. The Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector in which the company operates.\n\n## US listing requirements\n\nIn the US, the requirements for the Committee's composition and role are set out in SEC and NYSE rules. The Board has designated Simon Henry as an 'audit committee financial expert'. The Board also believes that the other members of the Committee are financially literate by virtue of their wide business experience.",

        "page_content": "## Committee remit\n\nThe Committee's objectives and responsibilities are set out in our terms of reference (see riotinto.com). These follow the relevant best practice recommendations in Australia, the UK and the US.\n\n## Our main duties are:\n\nFinancial reporting - we review the key judgments needed to apply accounting standards and to prepare the Group's financial statements. We also review the narrative reporting that goes with these, with the aim of maintaining integrity in the Group's financial reporting. Finally, we monitor any exclusions made in deriving alternative (non-GAAP) performance measures such as underlying earnings.\n\nExternal audit - we oversee the relationship with the external auditors and review all the non-audit services they provide, and the fees for these, to safeguard the auditors' independence and objectivity. We/uni00A0also assess the effectiveness of the external audit and, when necessary, carry out a formal tender process to select new auditors.\n\nFramework for internal control and risk management - we monitor the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls, including those over financial reporting. We also oversee the Group's risk management framework.\n\nGroup Internal Audit (GIA) - we oversee the work of GIA, and its head, who reports functionally to our Committee Chair.\n\nMineral resources and ore reserves - we oversee the reporting and assurance of mineral resources, and consider the impact on financial/uni00A0reporting.\n\nDistributable reserves - we provide assurance to the Board that distributable reserves are sufficient, and in the correct corporate entities, to support any dividend proposals.\n\nThese duties feed into an annual work plan that ensures we consider issues on a timely basis. The Committee has authority to investigate any matters within its remit. We have the power to use any Group resources we may reasonably require, and we have direct access to the external auditors. We can also obtain independent professional advice at the Group's expense, where we deem necessary. No such advice was required during 2021.\n\nThe Committee Chair reports to the Board after each meeting on the main items discussed, and the minutes of our meetings are circulated to the Board.\n\nWe had six Committee meetings in 2021. Attendance at these meetings is included in the table on page 147. The Committee has met three times to date in 2022.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial Controller and the heads of GIA and Risk regularly attend our meetings, as do the Chief Legal Officer & External Affairs, and the Group Company Secretary. We invite other senior executives and subject-matter experts as needed.\n\nThe external auditors were present at all of the Committee meetings during the year. The auditors review all materials on accounting or tax matters in advance of each meeting, and their comments are included in the papers circulated to Committee members. The audit partners also meet with our Committee Chair ahead of each meeting to discuss key issues and raise any concerns.\n\nThe Committee meets regularly in private sessions. We also hold regular private discussions with the external auditors. Management do not attend these sessions. The Committee Chair also has regular contact and discussions with these stakeholders outside the formal meetings.\n\n## Use of Committee meeting time in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other focus areas in 2021\n\nIn addition to our scheduled workload, the Committee also considered:\n\n- - An annual review and benchmarking of Rio/uni00A0Tinto's accounting policies and an overview of newly issued International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) standards and/uni00A0interpretations.\n- - A summary of the key financial measures relating to the Group's pension plans and the factors affecting those figures.\n- - Possible enhancements to the Group's long-term viability statement, and the scenario modelling that underpins it, based on the recommendation in the Brydon Report.\n- - After a robust process, in early 2022 the Committee recommended to the Board that the draft 2021 Annual Report is, taken as a whole, fair, balanced and understandable.\n\nWe also reviewed the quality and effectiveness of the Group's internal control and risk management systems in a joint session with the Sustainability Committee, which oversees a number of key corporate risks. This review included the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls over financial reporting, and the Group's disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with sections 404 and 302 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002. The Committee also considered reports from GIA and KPMG on their work in reviewing and auditing the control/uni00A0environment.\n\n## Contact with regulators\n\nDuring the year, the Company received a letter from the FRC's Corporate Reporting Review team requesting information in relation to their review of the 2020 financial statements. The principal areas where they required further information related to: Funding of Oyu Tolgoi, Alternative Performance Measures and deferred tax assets. Management's response was reviewed by the Committee Chair and discussed with the external auditors and additional disclosure has been incorporated in the 2021 financial statements in relation to these areas. The FRC Review team was satisfied with the response from the company and the proposed enhancements to disclosures. The/uni00A0scope of the review by the FRC was limited to reviewing the 2020/uni00A0Annual Report and correspondence with management and does not provide assurance that the report and accounts are correct in all material respects.",

Impairment triggers were identified at the Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat cash-generating units. The Committee  considered the key judgments made by management in relation to discount rates, forecast commodity  prices and sensitivities in relation to climate change. Specifically with respect to Oyu Tolgoi the  Committee received an update on the status of negotiations with the Government of Mongolia, technical  readiness for the undercut and mine design. The Committee reviewed disclosures related to impairment  reviews in note 6 and the impairment charges of $0.3 billion. |\n| Application of the policy for items  excluded from underlying earnings               | The Committee reviewed the Group's policy for exclusion of certain items from underlying earnings and  confirmed the consistent application of this policy year on year. The items excluded from underlying  earnings comprised a net expense of $0.3 billion. A reconciliation of underlying earnings to net earnings  is presented in note 2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Estimate of provision for closure,  restoration and environmental  obligations       | The Committee reviewed the significant changes in the estimated provision for closure, restoration and  environmental obligations by product group and legacy management. The Committee received updates  on closure studies completed in the period and discussed with management the accounting policy for  legacy sites. The Committee noted the steps undertaken by management to review the preliminary  information available from the reforecast of the closure costs for the Ranger Rehabilitation area at the  Ranger Uranium mine and related controls undertaken as a result of the limited time available to reassess  the provision. At 31 December 2021, the Group's balance sheet included a provision for close-down,  restoration and environmental obligations of $14.5 billion.  |\n| Climate change                                                                       | The Committee received an overview of the work management is undertaking in relation to climate  change and the potential financial reporting implications thereof. The Committee reviewed the climate  change summary provided in note 1 and discussed with management the three strategic scenarios,   the portfolio strategy, and the linkage to accounting judgments. The/uni00A0Committee was pleased to see   the enhanced voluntary disclosure of carrying value and useful economic lives of power generating   assets in note 14.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| The Group's tax exposures                                                            | The Committee considered management's assessment of the Group's tax exposures, including                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                                                                                      | the recoverability of deferred tax assets which are uncertain due to the timing of expiry of tax loss  carry-forwards in certain jurisdictions. The Committee received updates on the status of ongoing  discussions with the Australian Tax Office relating to the transfer pricing of certain transactions with   the Group's commercial centre in Singapore and considered the appropriateness of provisions for  uncertain tax positions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\n## External auditors\n\n## Engagement of the external auditors\n\nFor the 2021 financial year, KPMG are serving as our auditors. The UK entity of KPMG audits Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc, and the Australian entity audits Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited. The UK audit engagement partner, Jonathan Downer, was appointed in March 2021 and the Australian partner, Trevor Hart, was appointed in 2020.\n\nWe agreed the scope of the auditors' review of the half-year accounts, and of their audit of the full-year accounts taking into consideration the key risks and areas of material judgment for the Group. We also approved the fees for this work and the engagement letters for the/uni00A0auditors.\n\n## Safeguarding independence and objectivity, and/uni00A0maintaining effectiveness\n\nIn our relationship with the external auditors we need to ensure that they retain their independence and objectivity, and are effective in performing the statutory audit.\n\n## Use of the external auditors for non-audit services\n\nThe external auditors have significant knowledge of our business and of how we apply our accounting policies. That means it is sometimes cost-efficient for them to provide non-audit services. There may also be confidentiality reasons that make the external auditors the preferred choice for a particular task.\n\nHowever, safeguarding the external auditors' objectivity and independence is an overriding priority. For this reason, and in line with the FRC's Ethical Standard, the Committee ensures that the external auditors do not perform any functions of management, undertake any work which they may later need to audit or rely upon in the audit, or serve in an advocacy role for the Group.",

        "page_content": "We have a policy governing the use of the auditors to provide non-audit services. The cap on the total fees that may be paid to the external auditors for non-audit services in any given year is 70% of the average of the audit fees for the preceding three years. This is in line with the FRC's Ethical Standard. Non-audit assignments fall into two broad categories:\n\n- - Audit, audit-related or other 'pre-approved' services where we believe there is no threat to auditors' independence and objectivity, other than through the fees payable.\n- - Other services approved under delegated authority. We apply different approval regimes to these areas of work. Approval of 'pre-approved' services is as follows:\n- - Up to $50,000 - subject to prior notification to management, this/uni00A0work can be awarded.\n- - From $50,001 to $100,000 - requires the Chief Financial Officer's/uni00A0approval.\n- - Over $100,000 and with a tender process - if the external auditors are successful in the tender, the appointment requires the Chief Financial Officer's approval.\n- - From $100,001 to $250,000 without a tender process - requires the Chief Financial Officer's approval.\n- - Over $250,000, without a tender process - requires the Committee's or Committee Chair's approval.\n\nIn each case, the nature of the assignment and the fees payable are reported to the Committee.\n\nThe Chief Financial Officer can approve other services up to the value of $50,000 and an aggregate value of no more than $100,000. Fees exceeding $100,000 in aggregate require approval from the Committee or the Committee Chair.\n\nAt the half-year and year-ends, the Chief Financial Officer and the external auditors report to the Committee on non-audit services performed and the fees payable. Individual services are also reported to the Committee at each meeting that have either been approved since the previous meeting, or that require approval for commencement following the meeting.\n\nAll of the non-audit services provided by KPMG in 2021 were either within the predetermined approval levels or approved by the Committee. We are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by KPMG in accordance with this procedure is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors and the other requirements of the relevant Australian, UK and US regulations.\n\n## Fees for audit and non-audit services\n\nThe amounts payable to the external auditors, in each of the past two/uni00A0years, were:\n\n|                                 | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Audit fees                      | 21.2      | 17.3      |\n| Non-audit service fees:         |           |           |\n| Assurance services              | 3.7       | 2.2       |\n| Taxation services               | 0.0       | 0.0       |\n| All other fees                  | 0.2       | 0.1       |\n| Total non-audit service fees    | 3.9       | 2.3       |\n| Non-audit: audit fees (in-year) | 18%       | 13%       |\n\nFor further analysis of these fees, please see note 38.\n\nNone of the individual non-audit assignments was significant, either in terms of the work done or the fees payable. We have reviewed the non-audit work in aggregate. We are satisfied that neither the work done, nor the fees payable, compromised the independence or objectivity of KPMG as our external auditors.\n\n## Independence of the external auditors\n\nKPMG are required to provide a declaration to the Directors in relation to their compliance with the independence requirements of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and the professional code of conduct for external auditors. A copy of this is on page 324.\n\nNo person who served as an officer of Rio/uni00A0Tinto during 2021 was a director or partner of KPMG at a time when they conducted an audit of the Group.\n\n## Effectiveness of the external auditors\n\nWe review the effectiveness of the external auditors annually. We consider the results of a survey containing questions on the auditors' objectivity, quality and efficiency. The survey, conducted in May 2021, is completed by a range of operational and corporate executives across the business, and by Committee members. In addition, the 2020 audit was the subject of an inspection by the Audit Quality Review team of the FRC with no significant findings.\n\nWe are satisfied with the quality and objectivity of KPMG's 2020 audit. 2020 represented KPMG's first year as external auditor and, unsurprisingly, some transition challenges were encountered which were exacerbated by COVID-19-related restrictions impacting the efficiency of the audit. We have seen improvement on this through 2021 as audit routines and testing programmes continue to embed across our Group functions and businesses.\n\n## Appointment of the auditors\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of KPMG as external auditors in 2021 and in the year to date. We have recommended to the Board that KPMG should be retained in this role for 2022, which the Board supports.\n\nKPMG have indicated that they are willing to continue as auditors of Rio/uni00A0Tinto. A resolution to reappoint them as auditors of Rio Tinto plc will therefore be proposed as a joint resolution at the 2022 AGMs, together with a separate resolution seeking authority for the Committee to determine the external auditors' remuneration.\n\nSubject to the approval of the above resolution, KPMG will continue in office as auditors of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited.\n\n## Risk management and internal controls\n\nWe review Rio/uni00A0Tinto's internal control systems and the risk management framework. We also monitor risks falling within our remit, especially those relating to the integrity of financial reporting. A/uni00A0summary of the business's internal control and risk management systems, and of the principal risks and uncertainties we face, is in the strategic report on pages 117-130.\n\nImportantly, responsibility for operating and maintaining the internal control environment and risk management systems sits at asset level. Leaders of our businesses and functions are required to confirm annually: that adequate internal controls are in place; that these are operating effectively and are designed to identify any failings and weaknesses that may exist; and that any required actions are taken/uni00A0promptly.",

        "page_content": "Two management committees, the Executive Committee and the Disclosure Committee, review reports on the Group's control framework. The work they do satisfies the relevant requirements of the Code, the ASX Principles, the NYSE Standards and section 404 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.\n\nThe Audit Committee also regularly monitors our risk management and internal control systems (including internal financial controls). We aim to have appropriate policies, standards and procedures in place, and ensure that they operate effectively.\n\nAs part of considering the risk management framework, the Committee receives regular reports from the Group Financial Controller, the Chief Legal Officer & External Affairs, and the Head of Tax on material developments in the legal, regulatory and fiscal landscape in which the Group operates.\n\nThe Board, supported by the Audit Committee, has completed its formal annual review of the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control systems. This review included consideration of our material financial, operational and compliance controls. The Board concluded that the Group has an effective system of risk management and internal control.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe main features of our internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting are explained on page 204.\n\n## Internal audit programme structure\n\nGIA provides independent and objective assurance of the adequacy and effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems. It also may recommend improvements.\n\nWhile the head of GIA reports administratively to the Chief Financial Officer, appointment to, or removal from, this role requires the consent of the Audit Committee Chair. The head of GIA is accountable to the chairs of both the Audit and the Sustainability Committees, communicates regularly with both, and attends all regular committee meetings. Our GIA team therefore operates independently of management. Its mandate is set out in a written charter, approved by the Audit Committee. GIA uses a formal internal audit methodology, which is consistent with the Institute of Internal Auditors' (IIA's) internationally recognised standards.\n\nWhen needed, the team brings in external partners to help achieve its goals. There is a clear policy to address any conflicts of interest, which complies with the IIA's standards on independence. This policy identifies a list of services which need prior approval from the head of GIA.\n\n## Governance of the annual plan\n\nEach year's internal audit plan is approved by the Audit Committee and the Sustainability Committee. The plan is focused on higher-risk areas and any specific areas or processes chosen by the committees. It is also aligned with any risks identified by the external auditors. Both committees are given regular updates on progress, including any material findings, and can refine the plans as needed.\n\n## Effectiveness of the internal audit programme\n\nThe Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of the GIA function throughout the year, with updates on performance at every meeting.\n\nWe are satisfied that the quality, experience and expertise of GIA are appropriate for the business and that GIA was objective and performed its role effectively. We also monitored management's response to internal audits during the year. We are satisfied that improvements are being implemented promptly in response to GIA findings, and believe that management supports the effective working of the GIA function.\n\n## Committee effectiveness\n\nThe Committee reviews its effectiveness annually. In 2021, this was accomplished through an internally facilitated evaluation of the Board and its committees.\n\nThe performance of the Audit Committee was highly rated, with no areas of concern raised and no significant changes recommended. In/uni00A0terms of improvements, it was suggested that a further in-depth session on risk management/risk tolerance would be useful, together with the resumption of themed teach-ins (assuming a return to physical meetings in 2022).\n\n## Climate change-related financial reporting\n\nThe Directors have considered the relevance of the risks of climate change and transition risks associated with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement when preparing and signing off the company's accounts. The narrative reporting on climate-related matters is consistent with the accounting assumptions and judgments made in this report. The Audit Committee reviews and approves all material accounting estimates and judgments relating to financial reporting, including those where climate issues are relevant.\n\nIn developing its commodity price forecasts, the Group considers three strategic scenarios with differing underlying assumptions about geopolitics, technology and society. As/uni00A0existing climate policies in many countries are not aligned with achieving the Paris Agreement, only one of the three strategic scenarios assumes a temperature increase of well below 2\u00b0C. The three scenarios include differing assumptions on carbon pricing and result in differing commodity price forecasts. Our central case commodity price forecasts represent a blend of the three scenarios.  As a consequence, our central case is not aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. These central case commodity price forecasts are used pervasively in our financial processes including impairment testing, estimating remaining economic life, and discounting closure and rehabilitation provisions.\n\nWe have disclosed sensitivity information based on cash flows flexed for the carbon and commodity price forecasts generated by the one scenario that we believe is consistent with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. These sensitivities indicate that, in relation to impairment testing for example, higher recoverable amounts would have been determined had we applied commodity price forecasts aligned with the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn addition to commodity price forecasts, given the significant investment we are making to abate our carbon emissions, we have also considered the potential for asset obsolescence, with a particular focus on our investments in the Pilbara, but no material changes to accounting estimates have been necessary. The closure date and cost of closure is also sensitive to climate assumptions, but no material changes have been made in the year specific to climate change.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability Committee report\n\nCaring for our people and our communities, and helping to solve the world's biggest environmental challenges, sits at the heart of Rio/uni00A0Tinto's approach to sustainable development.\n\nThe purpose of the Sustainability Committee is to enhance Rio/uni00A0Tinto's social licence to operate by supporting and monitoring the sustainable development of Rio/uni00A0Tinto's businesses. This includes our work to support the health and safety of our people, the many ways we help our local communities, and our partnerships with Traditional Owners and First Nations peoples.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee oversees Rio/uni00A0Tinto's frameworks, management systems, and processes for ensuring the health and safety of our employees and contractors; monitors our key environmental risks such as water, tailings management and biodiversity; and supports the Group's contribution to the sustainable development of the communities in which we operate. In 2021, the Committee also monitored climate risk, and our progress against our climate change strategy.\n\nThe Committee has overseen a focus on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) within the business, and the new sustainability framework reflects our focus on two lead goals - SDG12 (responsible consumption and production) and SDG8 (decent work and economic growth), which are most relevant to our business, and where we can have the most significant impact. In 2021, progress on SDG12 was made through a focus on recovery of critical minerals from waste, sustainability transparency and traceability in the aluminium value chain through START; and on SDG8 through increased investment in Indigenous leadership development, leading to a fivefold increase in Indigenous leaders in Australia, and an increase of approximately 53% on our 2020 voluntary social investment spend/uni00A0globally.\n\nFor the third year running, we experienced zero fatalities at our managed operations. While this is heartening, our people are still suffering injuries at our assets and we saw a small increase in our all-injury frequency rate in 2021. We believe all injuries are preventable and the Committee reviewed selected potentially fatal incidents with business leaders during the year to ensure that important lessons are learned from these incidents and communicated.\n\nCore to our ongoing improvement in safety performance is the safety maturity model, which focuses on leadership behaviours in the field and critical risk management. In 2021, the Committee reviewed contractor safety action plans developed by management for each product group. We will further integrate contractors into the safety maturity model from 2022, to close the disparity in safety performance between employees and contractors. Our safety maturity model will also assess mindsets and behaviours to help create a safe work environment and support the work needed on the Everyday Respect initiative to ensure our workplaces are free from bullying, sexual harassment, racism and other forms of discrimination.\n\nTragically, there were eight fatalities across our non-managed operations and contracted marine transportation operations during 2021. We continue to work with our joint venture partners and shipping industry peers and counterparties to improve safety performance at those operations.\n\nWe continue to work on rebuilding respectful relationships with the Traditional Owners in the lands on which we operate following the tragic destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in May 2020. The Committee reviewed actions to strengthen our approach and processes for managing cultural heritage - both within our Iron Ore business, and across our operations globally. On 30 September 2021, to ensure transparency of the work we are undertaking in this area, we/uni00A0released our first report on the progress we are making. The report includes an update on our progress against the recommendations of the interim report from the inquiry into Juukan Gorge by the Australian Government's Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia. It also includes feedback from Traditional Owner groups in the Pilbara on our progress on some of the key commitments made as part of the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Board's 2020 review of our cultural heritage management. The/uni00A0full report is available at riotinto.com and an update on our progress is available on pages 94-95 of this report.\n\nThis year, our Chief Executive outlined a revised strategy that will see the company accelerate its decarbonisation by switching to renewable power, electrifying processing, and running electric mobile fleets. An/uni00A0increased research and development spend on technologies will enable our customers to decarbonise and we will prioritise growth capital in commodities that are essential to build a clean energy future.\n\nIn 2021, the Group continued to navigate the significant challenges to resourcing our operations presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our/uni00A0leadership team is to be commended for the measures adopted to keep our people healthy, and for keeping our operations running safely and smoothly. We have developed a position supporting vaccination of our people in line with the latest scientific knowledge, industry best practice and local regulatory requirements, and we have stepped up our support for employees in areas such as mental health, managing fatigue, and adjusting to working from home.",

We have accelerated our target reduction of 15% in our absolute Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions from 2030 to 2025, and established a new target to achieve a 50% reduction by 2030, more than tripling our previous target.\n\nDespite operational challenges, Rio/uni00A0Tinto delivered record financial results and returns to shareholders of US$15.4 billion during 2021. In support of our battery materials strategy, we committed to fund the high-quality Jadar lithium project, subject to receiving all relevant approvals, permits and licences, and the announcement of a binding agreement to acquire the Rincon lithium project. We continue to make progress, identifying opportunities for operational improvement, and advancing our ambitious ESG agenda.\n\n## 2021 AGMs voting outcome\n\nAlthough our Remuneration Policy received strong support (96.8%), shareholders registered significant concerns about the treatment of departing executives in light of the Juukan Gorge tragedy, with a significant vote against the Remuneration report. The Committee acknowledges that our pay policies, and the constraints they imposed on our ability to exercise discretion, were found to be insufficient in the unforeseen circumstances of the Juukan Gorge tragedy.\n\nResponding to this, the new Policy approved in 2021, includes an expanded scope for the application of malus and clawback to cover events that impact on our social licence to operate. It also incorporates ESG targets in the short-term incentive plan (STIP) that are meaningful, transparent and quantifiable, and in 2021 specifically recognised the importance of communities and social performance, including/uni00A0heritage.\n\nOver the past 12 months, I have engaged with shareholders and proxy advisers to explain the rationale for the decisions reached in 2021 and, most of all, to listen. The Committee revisited the questions as to whether greater sanctions could be applied. The/uni00A0legal advice remains that, following the agreements reached with the relevant departing executives, greater sanctions are not possible absent any new material information coming to light. However, the Committee has responded to the concerns expressed by shareholders by introducing two significant changes to our/uni00A0Policy.",

        "page_content": "## Consequence Management Framework\n\nWe have established a clear Consequence Management Framework to provide guidelines as to how the Committee's discretion to apply malus and clawback will be exercised in the future. The framework underpins the exercise of discretion in our incentive plan rules, the scope of those discretions and their practical application across a range of circumstances. This has been informed by insight from remuneration consultants and external legal counsel, our own experience, as well as the Juukan Gorge tragedy.\n\nWe fully recognise that this framework can only ever be a guide and should avoid being overly prescriptive. Otherwise, it would deliver formulaic outcomes that fail to take account of all relevant and prevailing circumstances at any given point of time. We consider the framework to be a critical and practical reference point for future decision making in ensuring that our incentive pay is fair, transparent, appropriate, proportionate and supportable.\n\nThe Committee recognises that voting outcomes on future Remuneration reports will continue to be impacted by the actual decisions made by the Committee, and we will provide a transparent rationale for such decisions.\n\n## Equity Incentive Plan leaver provisions\n\nWe have also changed the structure of the leaver provisions in our Equity Incentive Plan 2018 (EIP) rules that will apply to prospective long-term awards. Prior to this change, the presumption is that long-term awards vest except in bad (ineligible) leaver circumstances. Going forward, awards will only vest if the Committee is satisfied the individual is an eligible leaver. This meaningfully strengthens the Committee's hand in the instances where it is appropriate, proportionate and fair to lapse all or part of unvested awards.\n\nPages 163-164 expand further on the Consequence Management Framework and leaver provisions on a forward-looking basis, and detail specific responses to investor feedback received during 2021.\n\n## Chief Financial Officer succession\n\nThe Committee also determined the remuneration of Peter Cunningham in his new role as Chief Financial Officer, following Jakob Stausholm's appointment as Chief Executive on 1 January 2021. All terms are consistent with the shareholder approved Remuneration Policy. Further details are outlined on page 185.\n\n## Short-term incentive plan\n\n## Safety performance\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto has now achieved three consecutive years fatality free. This is a significant milestone given that 2019 was the first time in 147 years we were fatality free.\n\nThe company had another challenging year managing the pandemic and regrettably we saw a small increase in the number of people hurt on the job. The all-injury frequency rate in 2021 was 0.40 compared to 0.37 in 2020. There were no permanent disabling injuries (PDI) recorded across the Group in 2021.\n\nThe safety maturity model (SMM) was introduced to the business in 2019 and is now in its third year of implementation. Once again, most sites showed improvement from their baseline score. There is an increase across the Group from a combined average baseline of 5.0/uni00A0(evolving) to an average maturity of 5.7 (evolving).\n\nOverall, the Group's safety performance is 66% of maximum.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nAs a reminder, in comparing financial performance against the annual plan, we measure half against the original plan; the other half is 'flexed' to exclude the impact of variations during the year associated with quoted metal and other prices along with foreign exchange rates, which are outside management's control. When commodity prices rise, or the variation in exchange rates results in a favourable impact to the financial results, we protect shareholder returns by ensuring that 50% of the STIP opportunity (as relates to financial performance) is denied the benefit of that rise. When the reverse happens, and commodity prices fall or there is a negative impact of exchange rates, the STIP opportunity is safeguarded (by 50%) against the fall. Our view is that this approach maintains appropriate incentive for executives, even in times of significant market volatility.\n\nIn 2021, Rio/uni00A0Tinto benefited from attractive trading conditions and the company was able to achieve record financial results. However, certain elements of operating performance were behind expectation. The ongoing impacts from COVID-19 caused significant headwinds which resulted in labour constraints, supply chain disruptions and project delays. The Group's unadjusted financial result of 60% of maximum is underpinned by the high pricing environment experienced in 2021, driving strong financial results on an unflexed basis (the earnings result exceeded the outstanding range while the cash flow result was just below outstanding). However, the challenging operating environment during the year resulted in the financial targets being towards the lower end of the range on a flexed basis.\n\nThe Committee considered whether any adjustments were warranted to ensure the outcome was a fair reflection of underlying performance. The adjustments made related to tax prepayments and the buyout of the French pension plan which did not reflect current year performance. Accordingly, the adjusted Group performance against the financial targets is 63% of maximum.\n\n## ESG performance\n\nAs part of the new Policy, we introduced an ESG component into the STIP scorecard in 2021 to complement the long-standing safety component. Overall, good progress was made against the different dimensions comprised in this component with an overall performance outcome of 52.3% of maximum.\n\nFor the Environment component, important steps were taken in 2021 to advance towards the company's ambitious climate change targets by approving abatement projects and the delivery of goals to progress our Scope 3 partnership strategy.\n\nFor the Social component, Rio/uni00A0Tinto's aspiration is to foster an environment where all aspects of diversity are represented, included and respected. Representation of women in the company's workforce increased by 1.5%, which was the highest increase in the last five years. However, the target of 2% was not achieved.\n\nFinally, for the Governance component, following the Juukan Gorge tragedy, efforts were focused on strengthening the frameworks and processes by delivering the Group communities and social performance (CSP) improvements, developing and delivering locally and regionally relevant cultural awareness training to employees globally, as well as improving the Group's assurance and risk management.\n\nFurther details on our performance against the 2021 STIP measures are set out on pages 175-177.",

        "page_content": "## Everyday Respect\n\nIn March 2021, we launched our Everyday Respect task force to better understand, prevent and respond to harmful behaviours in the workplace, specifically bullying, sexual harassment, racism and other forms of discrimination. To support the work of the task force, we engaged Elizabeth Broderick & Co. to conduct an independent review and to make recommendations to strengthen our culture and ensure sustained change. The report was published on 1 February 2022 and the findings shared are upsetting and confronting. We are committed to making the changes required to create a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace for our people.\n\nOur new values of care, courage and curiosity reflect who we aspire to be. They guide the Committee in its decision making and are foundational to our remuneration-related policies, principles and practices. In recognition of the findings in the Everyday Respect report, the management team recommended that a downward adjustment be made to the 2021 STIP payments. The Committee concluded that a reduction of 5% should be applied to the total STIP payment for current Executive Committee members and an equivalent adjustment be made to the 2020 unvested Bonus Deferral Awards (BDA) held by former Executive Committee members. The STIP for 2022 will also include objectives linked to the recommendations arising in the report.\n\n## 2021 short-term incentive plan awards\n\nThe adjusted 2021 STIP award for the Chief Executive is 61.3% of maximum, and for the Chief Financial Officer is 57% of maximum. This includes a personal performance score in which the Committee considered their achievements against personal objectives.\n\nThe Committee considered the Chief Executive's performance against his individual objectives, which included redefining and restructuring the Executive Committee, articulating the new strategy including the four objectives, resetting the culture and launching the company's new values, further development of the projects portfolio, and making good progress in restoring our reputation and licence to operate. For the Chief Financial Officer, this included strengthening the balance sheet through disciplined focus on cost management, being a key contributor in the evaluation and approval of key growth projects and capital improvement programmes, and leading our investor relations strategies across key markets. The Committee determined the Chief Executive's performance to be 80% of maximum and the Chief Financial Officer's performance to be 50% of maximum. Refer to pages 178-179 for further detail.\n\n## Long-term incentive plan\n\nThe estimated vesting for the 2017 Performance Share Award (PSA), combining the two TSR and EBIT margin portions, is two-thirds of maximum. In determining the estimated vesting of the 2017 PSA, the Committee considered the Consequence Management Framework principles to ensure the vesting outcome was fair and representative of the shareholder experience.\n\nThe portion of the award relating to TSR vests on 24 February 2022. The Committee will make a final determination of the relative improvement in the EBIT margin measure when the final EBIT margin performance of the comparator group companies becomes available in May 2022. If applicable, this portion of the award will vest on 31 May/uni00A02022.\n\n## Pay in the broader context\n\nThe Board continued to engage with employees through the year, as detailed on page 140. These engagements enable the Board to hear directly the views of our people on pay. The Committee remains cognisant of executive pay in the broader context of a post COVID-19 world, ensuring our Policy is implemented with the desired attributes of fairness, transparency, simplicity, proportionality, and alignment to broader organisational culture and societal expectations.\n\nThe median Chief Executive pay ratio of 32:1 is materially lower than last year, primarily because Jakob joined the Group after the award of the 2017 LTIP that vests in 2022. His first LTIP award is to be performance tested at the end of 2022.\n\nOur focus on pay equity is evident in our gender pay metrics on which we continue to make progress. Pay equity is a key pillar of our annual remuneration approach. Gender diversity in senior management roles also remains a key aspect of our broader agenda on diversity and inclusion. Further details on both equal pay and the gender pay gap, together with a wider discussion on diversity and inclusion, are provided in the Sustainability section of this report on pages 101-103.\n\nAs always, I welcome shareholder feedback and comments on our 2021 Directors' Remuneration report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSam Laidlaw\n\nRemuneration Committee Chair\n\n23 February 2022",

Our actions have focused on how the Remuneration Policy is implemented. It is noted that the Remuneration Policy received support of 96.8% at the 2021 AGMs.\n\n## Changes approved at the 2021 AGMs\n\n## Changes post the 2021 AGMs/uni00A0\n\n- - Malus and clawback under incentive plans have been expanded to specifically include any future events that materially impact our social licence to operate.\n- - ESG measures have been introduced into the STIP and the implementation of these in 2021 meaningfully aligns with our climate change ambition, our commitment to diversity and inclusion, our external partnerships and the communities which we operate in, as well as the governance of our cultural heritage management.\n- - The establishment of a Consequence Management Framework to further underpin the exercise of discretion in the incentive plan rules. The framework comprises a series of questions across a number of dimensions (including individual demeanour, leadership standards and alignment to company values) to be considered by the Committee in the context of exercising its discretion on future malus and clawback adjustments to variable pay outcomes. Further details are set out below.\n- - The leaver provisions in the EIP rules made a presumption that eligible leaver treatment applied to all leavers, except those leaving by reason of resignation, dismissal for cause or for any other reason as the Committee decided. For future awards, the rules have been amended to presume that EIP awards lapse, unless the Committee determines that eligible leaver status should apply.\n\n## Consequence Management Framework\n\nThe Consequence Management Framework tests the extent that incentive pay is fair, appropriate and defendable. In instances where this is not the case, including scenarios where behavioural and leadership standards are not met, discretion would be exercised to adjust the outcome. The key elements of the framework are set out below.\n\nProportionate in factoring the appropriate levels of responsibility, accountability and materiality\n\nDefendable against external scrutiny, while considered fair and justifiable to the executive\n\nContextualised where possible, learn from the past and take any relevant precedents (internal and external) into/uni00A0account\n\nNon-arbitrary and evidence-based with a clear rationale for decisions made on executive pay\n\n## Framework guidelines\n\n## Discretion assessment\n\n- - Shareholder experience\n- - Other relevant factors and dimensions\n- - Exceptional events\n\n## Determining incident severity\n\n- - Severity of incident's impact\n- - Extent of accountability/responsibility\n- - Individual demeanour and leadership\n\n## Nature and scope of adjustment\n\n- - Determine nature of adjustment (malus, clawback, or suspension)\n- - Determine element(s) of variable remuneration impacted\n- - Determine magnitude of adjustment",

This/uni00A0is a broad discretion that would apply as an overlay to the more formulaic calculation of the outturn on the performance metrics based on defined calculation criteria and frameworks.\n\nIn circumstances where the Committee determines that the application of malus, clawback and/or suspension is warranted under Step 1, Step 2 guides the Committee in determining the appropriate type and extent of adjustment by considering the nature and severity of incidents both within the company and more broadly, underpinned by a consistency check against other incidents. Step 2 will also include consideration of the time horizon within which the issue arose to assist the Committee in determining which awards should be subject to/uni00A0adjustments. Importantly, the Committee will consider the nature, immediacy and extent of remedial actions, if any, that have been undertaken, and outstanding remediation that needs to be undertaken.\n\nIn the first instance, careful consideration of the incident against the backdrop of our values including codes of conduct (codified and implied) and behavioural standards needs to occur to guide the nature and direction of the remedial action(s). In addition, the Committee will need to consider, where relevant, the period of time it might take for the full extent of certain issues to emerge to enable a fulsome assessment of the severity and impact. In certain instances, it may be appropriate to suspend or make an initial adjustment to demonstrate timely action, position this accordingly and retain flexibility to revise it when the full impact of the incident is/uni00A0known.\n\nOnce the Committee has formed a view on the severity of the incident and determined that an adjustment to pay outcomes is a component of the remedial action, the variable compensation element(s) in scope, whether short-term, long-term or both, and the magnitude of the adjustment will need to be considered.\n\nOnce the Committee has come to a provisional determination in relation to the remedial action(s) and adjustment to be made to the relevant executive's variable remuneration, a 'consistency' check will be carried out. Whilst it is acknowledged that expectations and standards evolve and the past should not automatically guide the future, it provides a useful additional lens and perspective which should ensure that:\n\n- i. (if applicable) the proposed method and quantum of malus/clawback is consistent between different employees involved in a similar incident or event;\n- ii.  the determination is appropriate and proportionate when compared to previous unrelated malus/ clawback determinations made by the Committee pursuant to the framework; and\n- iii. if necessary, reassess precedent and establish a new standard.",

        "page_content": "## How is the Policy applied to the wider employee population?\n\nThe remuneration standard applied to the wider employee population is inspired by and consistent with the Policy applicable to the executives. This allows the total reward offering to employees to be competitive and strongly linked to performance whilst maintaining alignment with the company culture.\n\n## Remuneration principles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fairness\n\nFacilitating the achievement of equal pay for equivalent roles, contribution and performance. Pay equity is closely scrutinised and monitored through different lenses:\n\n- - In-depth pay equity analysis in the remuneration review process. Feeds into managing pay gaps from multiple perspectives including gender.\n- - Minimum global standards implemented across all countries to ensure the foundations of our total reward offerings meet levels determined by the Group irrespective of local market practices. Examples include global standards for parental leave and life assurance.\n\n## Ownership\n\n- - Promoting material participation in all-employee share plan (myShare) to give employees a sense of ownership and alignment with shareholders.\n- - As at 31 December 2021, approximately 25,000 (2020: 22,000) of our employees across more than 30 countries are shareholders in the company.\n- - Employees invest approximately US$16m (2020: US$14m) in Rio/uni00A0Tinto shares every quarter through the myShare plan.\n- - Employees eligible for LTIP awards receive these as either MSA, vesting over three years and not subject to performance conditions, and/or PSA which are performance tested over five years.\n\n## Consistency\n\n- - Consistency in implementation of the Remuneration Policy allows for more uniform approaches to remuneration across the Group.\n- - A good example is the incentive plans applicable to executives that are cascaded down to the broader employee population.\n\n## Wellbeing\n\n- - Leading benefits programmes across multiple industries, focused on holistic and integrated support for physical, mental and financial wellbeing.\n- - Providing flexible benefits that can be tailored to suit different needs and life stages, including employee assistance, minimum standard for life, accident and disability insurances, medical plans and virtual care, health screening and prevention, and subsidised health and wellbeing services.\n- - Understanding life is about more than work: family-friendly leave provisions and 100% employee coverage for our Family and Domestic Violence programme.\n\n## Security\n\n- - Reward principles that protect employee purchasing power globally.\n- - Accurate and timely payment of remuneration.\n- - Appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay at all levels.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Australia, we need to report on a wider group of executives, as described in the following paragraph. In addition, as set out in the summary table below, the two reporting regimes follow different methodologies for calculating remuneration.\n\nIn the UK, disclosure is required for the Board, including the Executive Directors. The Australian legislation requires disclosures in respect of 'key management personnel' (KMP), being those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group. Accordingly, our key management personnel comprise the Board, all product group Chief Executives, the Chief Commercial Officer, and until 18 October 2021, the Group Executive Strategy & Development.\n\nThroughout this Remuneration report, KMP are collectively referred to as 'executives'. They are listed on page 186, with details of the positions held during the year and dates of appointment to those roles.\n\nThe single total figure of remuneration table on page 174 shows remuneration for our Executive Directors, gross of tax and in the relevant currency of award or payment.\n\nIn table 1a on pages 191-192, we report information regarding executives in accordance with Australian statutory disclosure requirements. The information is shown gross of tax and in US dollars. The remuneration details in table 1a include accounting values relating to various parts of the remuneration package, most notably LTIP awards, and require a different methodology for calculating the pension value. The figures in the single total figure of remuneration table are therefore not directly comparable with those in table 1a. Where applicable, amounts have been converted using the relevant average exchange rates included in the notes to table 1a.\n\nIn table 1b on page 193, we report the remuneration of the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors. Certain information contained within the Remuneration report is audited, as outlined on page 198.\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nThe Implementation report, together with the annual statement by the Remuneration Committee Chair, is subject to an advisory vote each year as required by UK legislation. Under Australian legislation, the Remuneration report as a whole is subject to an advisory vote. All remuneration-related resolutions will be voted on at the AGMs as Joint Decision Matters by Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited shareholders.\n\n## The differing approaches explained\n\nAs well as the difference in methodology for measuring remuneration, there are also key differences in how remuneration is reported in the UK and Australia.\n\n## UK\n\n- - For reporting purposes, remuneration is divided into fixed and variable/uni00A0elements.\n- - We report remuneration in the currency it is paid, for example, where a UK executive is paid in pounds sterling, remuneration is reported in pounds sterling.\n\n## Australia\n\n- - For reporting purposes, remuneration is divided into short and long-term elements.\n- - All remuneration is reported in US dollars, so using the previous example, the UK executives' remuneration would be converted to US dollars using the average exchange rate for the financial year (except STIP, which is converted at the year-end exchange rate).\n\nThe table below summarises the elements of each component of remuneration, as well as the significant differences in the approaches to measurement.\n\nUK\n\nAustralia\n\nTotal remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Committee responsibilities\n\nThe Committee's responsibilities are set out in our terms of reference, which we review each year, and are published in the corporate governance section of riotinto.com. Our responsibilities include:\n\n- - Determining the Group's remuneration structure and policies, and assessing their cost, including pension and superannuation arrangements for executives.\n- - Determining the mix and use of short and long-term incentive plans for executives and ensuring alignment with the company's strategic/uni00A0objectives.\n- - Overseeing the operation of the Group's short and long-term incentive plans for executives, including approving awards, setting performance criteria, and determining any vesting, and where necessary applying the Consequence Management Framework to current and prior awards.\n- - Determining contractual notice periods and termination commitments, and setting retention and termination arrangements for executives.\n- - Determining awards under the Group's all-employee share plan.\n- - Monitoring gender pay.\n- - Determining the terms of service upon appointment for the Chair and executives, and any subsequent changes.\n\nWe consider the level of pay and conditions for all employees across the Group when determining executive remuneration.\n\n## Committee membership\n\nThe members of the Committee during the year and to the date of this report were:\n\nSam Laidlaw (Committee Chair)\n\nMegan Clark\n\nSimon McKeon\n\nJennifer Nason\n\nSimon Thompson\n\nNgaire Woods\n\n## How we work\n\nThe Group Company Secretary (or their delegate) attends meetings as secretary to the Committee. The Chief Executive, Chief People Officer and Head of Reward attend appropriate parts of the meetings at the invitation of the Committee Chair. No individual is in attendance during discussions about their own remuneration.\n\n## Independent advisers\n\nThe Committee has a protocol for engaging and working with remuneration consultants to ensure that 'remuneration recommendations' (being advice relating to the elements of remuneration for KMP, as/uni00A0defined under the Australian Corporations Act) are made free from undue influence by key management personnel to whom they may relate. We monitored compliance with these requirements throughout 2021. Deloitte, the appointed advisers to the Committee, gave declarations to the effect that any remuneration recommendations were made free from undue influence by KMP to whom they related, and the Board has received assurance from the Committee and is satisfied that this was the case.\n\nDeloitte are members of the Remuneration Consultants' Group, and voluntarily operate under its Code of Conduct (the Code) in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Code is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and confidentiality. Deloitte has confirmed that they adhered to the Code throughout 2021 for all remuneration services provided to Rio/uni00A0Tinto. The Code is available online at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the Deloitte engagement partners and advisory teams that provided remuneration advice to the Committee do not have any connections with the company or individual directors that may impair their independence. During 2021, Deloitte's services also included attending Committee meetings, support on the new Policy and giving advice in relation to management proposals and shareholder consultations. Deloitte was paid US$365,777 (2020: US$268,394) for/uni00A0these services. Fees were charged on the basis of time and expenses/uni00A0incurred.\n\nWillis Towers Watson provided general and technical executive remuneration services. These services predominantly related to remuneration of employees other than KMP. We/uni00A0received other services and publications relating to remuneration data from a range of sources. During the year, Deloitte also provided internal audit, tax compliance and other non-audit advisory services. These services were provided under separate engagement terms and the Committee is satisfied that there were no conflicts of interest.",

As part of the policy review, we introduced an ESG component into our STIP scorecard in 2021 to complement our long-standing safety component. Overall, we made good progress against the three dimensions of this component with an outcome of just above target.\n\nOn the environment, we took important foundational steps to advance towards our ambitious climate change targets by approving abatement projects and progress our Scope 3 partnership strategy.\n\nOn social, our aspiration is to foster an environment where all aspects of diversity are represented, included, and respected. The target related to improving female representation in the workforce by at least 2%. We achieved 1.5% which was the highest increase in the last five years but fell short of target.\n\nIn March 2021, we commissioned an independent review into sexual harassment, racism and bullying the findings of which were published 1 February 2022. The findings are deeply disturbing and are a source of enormous regret to have learnt the extent to which bullying, racism and sexual harassment are happening at Rio/uni00A0Tinto. This is not the kind of company we aspire to be. In recognition of the gravity of the findings, the management team recommended that a downward adjustment be made to the individual STIP payments to Executive Committee members. The/uni00A0Committee concluded, after applying the Consequence Management Framework, that a reduction of 5% should be applied to the total STIP payment for current Executive Committee members and an equivalent adjustment be made to the 2020 unvested BDA held by former Executive Committee members.\n\nOn governance, our efforts in 2021 were focused on strengthening our CSP frameworks, processes and risk management. This included important work on our Standard and Cultural Heritage Group Procedure for external engagement, the development and delivery of locally and/or regionally appropriate cultural awareness training to the majority of local risk owners and asset/project owners and the development of measurable outcomes-based asset-level CSP metrics and targets across the Group up to 2026.\n\n## Individual performance\n\nWeighted\n\n|                  | Weighting   (out of 100%)   | Result   (% of maximum)   | result (out of 100%)   | Commentary on  individual measures   |\n|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Jakob Stausholm  | 15%                         | 80%                       |                        | 12% Refer to page 178                |\n| Peter Cunningham | 15%                         | 50%                       |                        | 7.5% Refer to page 179               |",

As such, the specific targets for these measures, and the performance against them, are expected to be described retrospectively in the 2022 Implementation report.\n\n## 2022 ESG measures, weightings and targets\n\nAs safety is clearly linked to sustainability, we have decided to simplify the STIP in 2022 to combine all ESG measures (including safety) into an ESG scorecard. The weighting for safety and other ESG metrics will remain consistent with 2021, however we have updated the ESG metrics to continue to stretch our performance and drive towards achieving impeccable ESG credentials.\n\nAs expectations evolve and we improve across the three ESG pillars, we may replace or amend ESG metrics and targets included in the STIP in future years. Other ESG-related objectives outside the STIP will continue to be actively managed and may form part of the executives' individual performance objectives. In selecting the focus areas and metrics for the ESG component, we have been conscious and mindful of the need to set credible stretch targets aligned to our strategic agenda that are transparent and measurable whilst recognising some inevitable limitations of what is possible.\n\nThe ESG metrics and targets for 2022 set out below were considered and approved by the Board.\n\nWeighting\n\n|                                                                                                                                    | Threshold                  | Target                                                                             | Outstanding                                                                                              | (out of 100%)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Safety -

This is due to the reporting timeframes for companies in the EBIT margin comparator group and the time taken for the external source (currently S&P Capital IQ) to report the relevant data. The EBIT margin comparator group includes Alcoa, Anglo American, Antofagasta, Barrick Gold, BHP, Fortescue, Freeport, Glencore, Teck Resources and Vale.\n\nAccordingly, the value of the shares vesting included in the single total figure of remuneration table for 2021 is an estimate, which is finalised once the actual figures are known. The original estimate is based on:\n\n- - The TSR portion of the award (with estimated associated dividend equivalent shares) which vest in February following the end of the five-year performance period.\n- - An estimate of vesting of the EBIT margin portion of the award (with estimated associated dividend equivalent shares) based on the analysis of the latest available EBIT margin ranking prior to publication of this report.\n- - The average share prices for Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited over the last quarter of the relevant year, as the share price on the date on which all shares vest is not ascertainable by the date on which the Remuneration report is approved by the Board.\n\nThe actual values associated with the PSA vesting are determined following the vesting of the EBIT margin portion of the award at the end of the following May, based on the actual share prices on the date of vesting. The estimated LTIP values are then restated, if applicable, in the following Remuneration/uni00A0report.\n\n## Calculation of 2017 PSA vesting\n\nOur remuneration consultants, Deloitte, calculated performance against the TSR measures. The dual TSR measures recognise that the company competes in the global market for investors as well as within the mining sector, and rewards executives for returns over the long term that outperform both the broader market and the mining sector.\n\nWeighted\n\n|                                          | Performance                                 | Vesting   | Weighting   | achievement   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|\n| TSR relative to EMIX Global Mining Index | TSR relative to EMIX Global Mining Index    |           |             |               |\n| Threshold                                | Equal to index                              | 22.5%     | One-third   |               |\n| Maximum                                  | Outperformance of the index by 6% per annum | 100%      |             |               |\n| Actual                                   | 16.7% per annum                             | 100%      |             | One-third     |\n| TSR relative to MSCI World Index         | TSR relative to MSCI World Index            |           |             |               |\n| Threshold                                | Equal to index                              | 22.5%     | One-third   |               |\n| Maximum                                  | Outperformance of the index by 6% per annum | 100%      |             |               |\n| Actual                                   | 21.2% per annum                             | 100%      |             | One-third     |\n| Improvement in EBIT margin               |                                             |           |             |               |\n| Threshold                                | Above the sixth ranked company              | 22.5%     | One-third   |               |\n| Maximum                                  | Rank of 1 st  or 2 nd                       | 100%      |             |               |\n| Estimate                                 | 6 th                                        | 0%        |             | Nil           |\n| Overall vesting                          |                                             |           |             | Two-thirds    |\n\n|                    |                                     |          |                              | Estimated          | Estimated                                 | Estimated                                  | Estimated     | Estimated             | Actual                         | Actual                         | Actual        | Actual        |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Executive Director | Year   included   in single  figure | Award    | EBIT margin   rank out of 11 | Overall  vesting % | Dividend  equivalents  (% of face  value) | Shares  (including  dividend  equivalents) | Share   price | PSA  outcome  (\u00a3'000) | EBIT   margin   rank out of 11 | Overall  vesting %             | Share   price | PSA   outcome |\n|                    |                                     |          |                              |                    |                                           |                                            |               |                       |                                |                                |               | (\u00a3'000)       |\n| Peter Cunningham   | 2021                                | 2017 PSA | 6 th  rank                   | 66.7%              | (38%)                                     | 18,892                                     | \u00a347.18        | 891                   |                                | Will be determined in May 2022 |               |               |\n\nThe TSR component of the 2016 PSA vested in full on 18 February 2021 with Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited share prices of \u00a362.35 and A$127.47 respectively.

A minimum shareholding requirement of 300% of base salary applies on appointment.\n\n## Departures from the Executive Committee\n\n## Peter Toth\n\nPeter Toth resigned and stepped down from the Executive Committee on 18 October 2021. He remained in an advisory role until the end of/uni00A02021.\n\nHe will continue to receive his normal base salary and other contractual benefits until 5 April 2022. He remained eligible to receive 50% of the STIP award for the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021, which will be calculated on actual business and individual performance and will be paid in cash in March 2022. The remaining 50% deferred into the BDA will be forfeited. Outstanding LTIP awards were lapsed from resignation. Unused and accrued vacation amounting to \u00a324,251 will be paid at his termination date in line with UK policy.\n\n## Broader employee disclosures\n\n## Chief Executive pay ratio\n\nThe ratio of the single total figure of remuneration for the Chief Executive to the lower quartile, median and upper quartile Rio/uni00A0Tinto Australian employee population for 2021 is set out in the table below.\n\n|          |   Lower quartile |   Median |   Upper quartile |\n|----------|------------------|----------|------------------|\n| 2021     |               49 |       32 |               26 |\n| 2020 (a) |              131 |       94 |               77 |\n\nThe median CEO pay ratio of 32:1 is materially lower than last year, primarily because Jakob joined the Group after the award of the 2017 LTIP that vested this year. The first LTIP award for which he was eligible is due to vest at the end of the 2022 performance year. The Committee continues to be mindful of the relationship between executive remuneration and that of our broader workforce. The Committee's decision making will continue to be supported by regular and detailed reporting on these matters.\n\nAs the company employs fewer than 250 employees in the UK, this analysis has been provided on a voluntary basis.\n\n## Relative spend on remuneration\n\nThe table below shows our relative spend on remuneration across our global employee population and distributions to shareholders in the year.

All other fees are subject to review by the Board on the recommendation of the Chair's Committee.\n\nThe Chair's Committee conducted a review of Non-Executive Director fees in November 2021. Following this review, it was determined that all fees and travel allowances should remain unchanged.\n\nThe additional \u00a310,000 allowance for eligible Australian directors is to compensate them for additional UK National Insurance contributions which, unlike directors based in other jurisdictions, they are not able to offset against their local tax payments.\n\nWe set out details of each element of remuneration, and the single total figure of remuneration, paid to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors during 2021 and 2020 in US dollars in table 1b on page 193. No post-employment, termination or share-based payments were made. Statutory minimum superannuation contributions for Non-Executive Directors are deducted from the director's overall fee entitlements when these are required by Australian superannuation law.\n\nThe total fee and allowance payments made to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors in 2021 are within the maximum aggregate annual amount of \u00a33 million set out in the Group's constitutional documents, approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGMs.\n\n## Terms of appointment of the incoming Chair\n\nDominic Barton will join the Board with effect from 4 April 2022 and be appointed to the role of Chair at the conclusion of the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited annual general meeting on 5 May 2022. On his appointment to Chair, he will receive the same base fee as his predecessor, Simon Thompson. Relocation benefits will be provided in accordance with our Policy to include flights, shipping, short-term accommodation, tax filing and immigration support.\n\n## Share ownership policy for Non-Executive Directors\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto has a policy that encourages Non-Executive Directors to build up a shareholding equal in value to one year's base fee within three years of/uni00A0their appointment. Details of Non-Executive Directors' share interests in the Group, including total holdings, are set out in table 2 on page 194.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors' share ownership\n\nThe Non-Executive Directors' shareholdings are calculated using the market price of Rio/uni00A0Tinto shares on 31 December 2021:\n\n| Director       | Share ownership level at 31 December 2021  as a multiple of base fee (or Chair's fee) (a)   | Share ownership level at 31 December 2020  as a multiple of base fee (or Chair's fee)   |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Simon Thompson | 3.8 (0.5)                                                                                   | 4.4 (0.6)                                                                               |\n| Megan Clark    | 3.3                                                                                         | 3.9                                                                                     |\n| Hinda Gharbi   | 0.7                                                                                         | 0.9                                                                                     |\n| Simon Henry    | 0.8                                                                                         | 0.9                                                                                     |\n| Sam Laidlaw    | 3.9                                                                                         | 4.4                                                                                     |\n| Simon McKeon   | 5.2                                                                                         | 6.1                                                                                     |\n| Jennifer Nason | 0.9                                                                                         | 1.1                                                                                     |\n| Ben Wyatt (b)  | -                                                                                           | -                                                                                       |\n| Ngaire Woods   | 0.3                                                                                         | -                                                                                       |\n\n(a) The fee multiple as at 31 December 2021 is lower than the multiple reported as at 31 December 2020 as a result of lower share prices.\n\n(b) Ben Wyatt joined the Board on 1 September 2021.",

Rio/uni00A0Tinto's share plans are therefore part of its standard remuneration practice, to encourage employee share ownership and create alignment with the shareholder experience. Executives may participate in broad-based share plans that are available to Group employees generally and to which performance conditions do not apply.\n\nA global employee share purchase plan is normally offered to all eligible employees unless there are local jurisdictional restrictions. Under the plan, employees may acquire shares up to the value of US$5,250 (or equivalent in other currencies) per year, or capped at 15% of their base salary if lower. Each share purchased will be matched by the company, providing the participant holds the shares, and is still employed, at the end of the three-year vesting period.\n\nOver 25,000 (54%) of our employees are shareholders as a result of participating in these plans. In the UK, these arrangements are partially delivered through the UK Share Plan which is a UK tax approved arrangement. Under this plan, eligible participants may also receive an annual award of Free Shares up to the limits prescribed under UK tax/uni00A0legislation.\n\n## Management Share Awards (MSA)\n\nThe MSA are designed to help the Group attract the best staff in a competitive labour market, and to retain key individuals as we deliver our long-term strategy. MSA are conditional awards that are not subject to a performance condition. They vest at the end of three years subject to continued employment. Shares to satisfy the awards are bought in the market or re-issued from treasury. Executive Committee members are not eligible for the MSA after appointment.\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nIn the table below, we set out the results of the remuneration-related resolutions voted on at the Group's 2021 AGMs. Our meetings with shareholders in 2021 provided an opportunity for the Committee Chair to consult with shareholders on the voting outcomes and next steps.\n\nVotes\n\n| Resolution                                                            | Votes for   | Votes against   | withheld (a)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Approval of the Directors' Remuneration report: Implementation report | 38.4%       | 61.6%           | 16,456,963     |\n| Approval of the Remuneration Policy                                   | 96.8%       | 3.2%            | 22,272,424     |\n| Approval of the Directors' Remuneration report                        | 39.2%       | 60.8%           | 16,222,350     |\n\n(a) A vote 'withheld' is not a vote in law and is not counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes for and against the resolution.",

Steve's and Tim's qualifications and experience are described on page 135.\n\n## Indemnities and insurance\n\nThe Articles of Association of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited provide for them to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, Directors and officers of the companies, including officers of certain subsidiaries, against liabilities arising from the conduct of the Group's business. The Directors, Group company secretary and joint company secretary of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited, together with employees serving as Directors of eligible subsidiaries at the Group's request, have also received similar direct indemnities. Former Directors also received indemnities for the period in which they were Directors. These are qualifying third-party indemnity provisions for the purposes of the UK Companies Act 2006, in force during the financial year ended 31 December 2021 and up to the date of this report. During 2021, Rio/uni00A0Tinto paid legal costs under the terms of those indemnities for certain former Directors and officers totalling $9,032,915.\n\nQualifying pension scheme indemnity provisions (as defined by section 235 of the UK Companies Act 2006) were in force during the course of the financial year ended 31 December 2021 and up to the date of this Directors' report, for the benefit of trustees of the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Group pension and superannuation funds across various jurisdictions. No amount has been paid under any of these indemnities during the year.\n\nThe Group purchased Directors' and officers' insurance during the year. In broad terms, this cover indemnifies individual Directors and officers against certain personal legal liability and legal defence costs for claims arising out of actions connected with Group business. During 2021, the Group paid premiums totalling $39,819,792 net of statutory taxes and other local charges for this Directors' and officers' insurance.\n\n## Employment of people with a disability\n\nWe acknowledge the systemic barriers facing people with disabilities in attaining meaningful employment. We further acknowledge the efforts necessary to fully support people who acquire a disability and we seek to implement the accommodations they need to fulfil their role, or an alternative role if required.\n\nOur inclusion & diversity policy sets out our expectations around the behaviours needed for an inclusive and diverse workplace, where we embrace different perspectives, valuing diversity as a strength.\n\nOur employment policy outlines how we are committed to preventing discrimination and that we consider applications based on the job requirements without discriminating on grounds of disability. It also explains how we ensure our people are trained to perform their role. More information can be found on our website riotinto.com.\n\nIn 2021, we joined the IncludeAbility Employer network, which was set up by the Australian Human Rights Commission and aims to increase access to meaningful employment opportunities for people with a disability. We will continue to seek opportunities to improve how we provide meaningful opportunities for people with a disability.\n\n## Engagement with UK employees\n\nOur statement on engagement with UK

No political donations were made by the Group for political purposes during the year. In the US, in accordance with the United States Federal Election Campaign Act, we provide administrative support for the Rio/uni00A0Tinto America Political Action Committee (PAC), which was created in 1990 and encourages voluntary employee participation in the political process. All Rio/uni00A0Tinto America PAC employee contributions are reviewed for compliance with federal and state law and are publicly reported in accordance with US election laws. The PAC is controlled by neither Rio/uni00A0Tinto nor any of its subsidiaries, but instead by a governing board of five employee members on a voluntary basis. In 2021, contributions to Rio/uni00A0Tinto America PAC by 11 employees amounted to $8,310.60, and Rio/uni00A0Tinto America PAC donated $37,000 in political contributions in 2021.\n\n## Government regulations\n\nOur operations around the world are subject to extensive laws and regulations imposed by local, state, provincial and federal governments. These regulations govern many aspects of our work - from how we explore, mine and process ore, to conditions of land tenure and health, safety and environmental requirements. They also govern how we operate as a company in relation to securities, taxation, intellectual property, competition and foreign investment, provisions to protect data privacy, conditions of trade and export and infrastructure access. In addition to these laws, several of our operations are governed by specific agreements made with governments, some of which are enshrined in legislation.\n\nThe geographic and product diversity of our operations reduces the likelihood of any single law or government regulation having a material effect on the Group's business as a whole.\n\n## Environmental regulations\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries where it has operations. Rio/uni00A0Tinto measures its performance against environmental regulation by tracking and rating incidents according to their actual environmental and compliance impacts using five severity categories (minor, medium, serious, major or catastrophic). Incidents with a consequence rating of major or catastrophic are of a severity that require notification to the relevant product group Chief Executive and the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Chief Executive immediately after the incident occurring. In 2021, there were three environmental incidents at managed operations with a major impact. There were no environmental incidents with catastrophic impact.\n\nDuring 2021, three managed operations incurred fines amounting to $7,414 (2020: $27,387). Details of these fines are reported in the Sustainability section of this report on page 88.\n\nAustralian corporations that exceed specific greenhouse gas emissions or energy use thresholds have obligations under the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER). All Rio/uni00A0Tinto entities covered under this Act have submitted their annual NGER reports by the required 31 October 2021 deadline.\n\nFurther information on the Group's environmental performance is included in the Sustainability section of this Annual Report, on pages 72-97, and at riotinto.com.",

Rio/uni00A0Tinto does not report on the proportion of CO2 emissions associated with the UK and offshore area since it has no producing assets in the UK, only offices, and consequently falls below Rio/uni00A0Tinto's threshold level of reporting.\n\n## Exploration, research and development\n\nThe Group carries out exploration, research and development, described in the Innovation section on pages 70-71. Exploration and evaluation costs, net of any gains and losses on disposal, generated a net loss before tax of $719 million (2020: $624 million). Research and development costs were $65 million (2020: $45 million).\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nDetails of the Group's financial risk management objectives and policies, and exposure to risk, are described in note 29 to the financial statements.\n\n## Dealing in Rio/uni00A0Tinto securities\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto securities dealing policy restricts dealing in Rio/uni00A0Tinto securities by Directors and employees who may be in possession of inside information. These individuals must seek clearance before any proposed dealing takes place.\n\nOur policy also prohibits such persons from engaging in hedging or other arrangements which limit the economic risk in connection to Rio/uni00A0Tinto securities issued, or otherwise allocated, as remuneration that are either unvested, or that have vested, but remain subject to a holding period. We also impose restrictions on a broader group of employees, requiring them to seek clearance before engaging in similar arrangements over any Rio/uni00A0Tinto securities.\n\n## Financial reporting Financial statements\n\nThe Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial period that give a true and fair view of the state of the Group at the end of the financial period, together with profit or loss and cash flows for that period. This includes preparing financial statements in accordance with UK company law and preparing a Remuneration report that includes the information required by Regulation 11, Schedule 8 of the Large- and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) and the Australian Corporations Act 2001.\n\nIn addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Board provides a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects in its external reporting.\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto's management conducts extensive review and challenge in support of the Board's obligations, aiming to strike a balance between positive and negative statements and provide good linkages throughout the Annual Report.\n\nThe Directors were responsible for the preparation and approval of the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2021. They consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable, and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records, in accordance with UK and Australian legislation. They have a general responsibility to safeguard the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are also responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems are in place to maintain and preserve the integrity of the Group's website.\n\nLegislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from current and future legislation in other jurisdictions. The work carried out by the Group's external auditors does not take into account such legislation and, accordingly, the external auditors accept no responsibility for any changes to the financial statements after they are made available on the Group's/uni00A0website.\n\nThe Directors, senior executives, senior financial managers and other members of staff who are required to exercise judgement while preparing the Group's financial statements, are required to conduct themselves with integrity and honesty and in accordance with the highest ethical standards, as are all Group employees.",

        "page_content": "The Directors consider that the 2021 Annual Report presents a true and fair view and has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, using the most appropriate accounting policies for Rio/uni00A0Tinto's business, and supported by reasonable judgements and estimates. The accounting policies have been consistently applied as described on pages 218-237, and Directors have received a written statement from the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer to this effect. In accordance with the internal control requirements of the Code and the ASX Principles, this written statement confirms that the declarations in the statement are founded on a sound system of risk management and internal controls, and that the system is operating effectively in all material respects in relation to financial reporting risks. Further information on Directors' responsibilities is included on page/uni00A0322.\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe Group maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in US Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Group's disclosure controls and procedures in relation to US Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded that the Group's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n## Management's report on internal control over financial/uni00A0reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. These controls, designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Group's financial reporting and the preparation and presentation of financial statements for external reporting purposes, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as defined on/uni00A0page 218.\n\nThe Group's internal controls over financial reporting include policies and procedures designed to ensure the maintenance of records that:\n\n- - accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets;\n- - provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary, enabling the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and that receipts and expenditures are made with the authorisation of management and Directors of each of the companies; and\n- - provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the Group's assets that could have a material effect on its financial/uni00A0statements.\n\nDue to inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance. Similarly, these controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements, whether caused by error or fraud, within each of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited.\n\nThere were no changes to internal controls over financial reporting during the relevant period that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited.\n\nManagement's evaluation of the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting was based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission. Following this evaluation, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Directors' declaration\n\nThe Directors' statement of responsibilities in relation to the Group's financial statements is set out on page 322.\n\n## Non-audit services and auditor independence\n\nDetails of the non-audit services and a statement of independence regarding the provision of non-audit services undertaken by our external auditor, including the amounts paid for non-audit services, are/uni00A0set out on page 154 of the Directors' report.\n\nA copy of the Auditor's Independence Declaration as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out on page/uni00A0342.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have satisfied themselves that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Additionally, the Directors have considered longer-term viability, as described in their statement on pages 115-116.\n\n## 2022 AGMs\n\nThe 2022 AGMs will be held on 8 April in London, UK and 5 May in Melbourne, Australia. Separate notices of the 2022 AGMs will be produced for the shareholders of each company.\n\n## Directors' approval statement\n\nThe Directors' report is delivered in accordance with a resolution of the/uni00A0Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Thompson\n\nChairman\n\n23 February 2022",

        "page_content": "## Compliance with governance codes and/uni00A0standards\n\n## Application of and compliance with governance codes and standards\n\nThis section sets out our compliance with the applicable governance codes and standards. As our shares are listed on both the Australian Securities Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, we set out how we have complied with the codes and standards of those bodies on the following pages:\n\n- - London Stock Exchange - UK Corporate Governance Code (2018/uni00A0version) (the UK Code), see pages 205-207.\n- - Australian Securities Exchange - ASX Corporate Governance Council's Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4 th edition) (the ASX Principles), see pages 208-210.\n\nIn addition, as explained below, as a foreign private issuer (FPI) with American Depository Receipts (ADRs) listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), we need to report any significant corporate governance differences from the NYSE listing standards (NYSE/uni00A0Standards) followed by US companies.\n\n## Statement of compliance with the Code and ASX Principles\n\nThroughout 2021 and as at the date of this report, the Group has applied the Principles of the UK Code and the ASX Principles. The UK Code is available at www.frc.org.uk, and the ASX Principles at www. asx.com/au. For the purposes of ASX Listing Rule 4.10.3 and the ASX Principles, pages 133-159 of this report form our 'Corporate Governance Statement'. This statement is current as at 23 February 2022, unless otherwise indicated, and has been approved by the Board. Corporate governance documents and policies referenced can be found at riotinto.com/invest/corporate-governance.\n\nWe have complied with all relevant provisions of the UK Code throughout 2021.\n\n## Difference from NYSE Standards\n\nWe have reviewed the NYSE Standards and consider that our practices are broadly consistent with them, with the following exceptions where the literal requirements of the NYSE Standards are not met due to differences in corporate governance between the US, UK and/uni00A0Australia:\n\n- - The NYSE Standards state that US companies must have a nominating/corporate governance committee which, in addition to identifying individuals qualified to become board members, develops and recommends to the board a set of corporate governance principles applicable to the company. Our Nominations Committee does not develop corporate governance principles for the Board's approval. The Board itself develops such principles.\n- - Under US securities law and the NYSE Standards, the company is required to have an audit committee that is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of external auditors. While our Audit Committee makes recommendations to the Board on these matters, and is subject to legal and regulatory requirements on oversight of audit tenders, the ultimate responsibility for the appointment and retention of the external auditors of Rio/uni00A0Tinto rests with the shareholders.\n- - Under US securities law and the NYSE Standards, an audit committee is required to establish procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and audit matters. The whistleblowing programme (myVoice) enables employees to raise any concerns confidentially or anonymously. The Board has responsibility to ensure that the programme is in place and to review the reports arising from its operations.\n\n## The UK Code\n\n## Board leadership and company purpose\n\n## A. Making the board effective\n\nOur Board provides effective and entrepreneurial leadership. It is collectively responsible for the stewardship and long-term success of the Group. There is a framework of prudent and effective controls that enable risk to be assessed and managed. The Sustainability section on pages 72-111 sets out how we assess our impact on wider society. See/uni00A0pages 143-144 for the key activities undertaken by the Board during the year and the factors that were considered when making decisions. In 2021, the Board undertook an internally facilitated effectiveness review and details of this are provided on page 146 of the Governance/uni00A0section.\n\n## B. The company's purpose, values and strategy and alignment with culture\n\nThrough our The Way We Work framework, the Board sets the company's purpose, values, and standards for the Group's employees. In 2021, the Board approved a new set of values, set out on pages 18-19. The Board is committed to acting in accordance with these values, championing and embedding these in the organisation. The/uni00A0Board also seeks to ensure that the culture of the company is aligned with these values and standards.\n\n## C. Company performance and risk management\n\nThe Board leads the development of long-term investment plans for the company. It aims to make good quality decisions at the right time, to achieve the company's objectives, in alignment with our purpose, values and strategy. The role of the Board in establishing and monitoring the internal control environment is set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 151-155. The way in which the company manages risk is set out on pages 112-130. For information on the delegation of business to management please refer to pages 136-137.\n\nThe formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board's decision, available at riotinto.com, covers areas including: setting the Group's purpose and strategic vision; monitoring performance of the delivery of the approved strategy; approving major investments, acquisitions and divestments; the oversight of risk and the setting of the Group's risk appetite; and reviewing the Group's governance framework.\n\n## D. Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Chairman undertakes regular engagement with our major shareholders, in addition to that carried out by the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and the investor relations team. The committee chairs also engage with their relevant stakeholders and details of this engagement is provided in each of the committee reports. We have mapped our key stakeholders and continually work to understand their views and we take account of our responsibilities to our stakeholders when making business decisions. We explain more about this in our section 172 (1) statement, set out on pages 140-142. We also discuss stakeholders in the Strategic report on pages 20-22 and in the Sustainability section.",

        "page_content": "In January 2021, the Board appointed Simon McKeon as the designated Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement. An/uni00A0overview of workforce engagement during 2021 is set out on page/uni00A0140.\n\nAt Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc's AGM on 9 April 2021, Resolution 21 ('Authority to purchase Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc shares') was passed with less than 80% of votes in favour and Shining Prospect (a subsidiary of the Aluminium Corporation of China ('Chinalco')) voted against. Chinalco has not sold any Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc shares and now has a holding of over 14% given its non-participation in Rio/uni00A0Tinto's significant share buy-back programmes over the last four years. This places Chinalco close to the 14.99% threshold agreed with the Australian Government at the time of Chinalco's original investment in 2008.\n\nFollowing the AGMs of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited, on 9 April 2021 and 6 May 2021 respectively, the advisory vote on Resolution 3 ('Approval of the Directors' Remuneration report: Implementation report') and Resolution 4 ('Approval of the Directors' Remuneration report') were not passed as ordinary resolutions. Page 163 of the Remuneration report set out the actions taken by the Remuneration Committee to engage with shareholders on this matter during 2021.\n\nResolution 5 ('Re-election of Dr Megan Clark AC') was passed with less than 80% of votes in favour. Rio/uni00A0Tinto acknowledges that the reduced vote for Dr Clark's re-election compared to previous years reflected the fact that, as Chair of the Sustainability Committee at the time that the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge were destroyed, Dr Clark shares accountability for the failings in the areas of communities and social performance that led to those events occurring. In light of the support provided by almost 75% of shareholders, Dr Clark and the Board carefully weighed the need for accountability for the events at Juukan Gorge against the significant contribution, experience and continuity that Dr Clark brings to the Board and the Group's relationship with Traditional Owners, and concluded that she should remain on the Board in order to provide stability at this important time for Rio/uni00A0Tinto. Dr/uni00A0Clark plays an active and important role on behalf of the Board in engaging with the Traditional Owners of the lands where the company operates in Western Australia, including attending engagements with/uni00A0stakeholders.\n\n## E. Our workforce policies and practices\n\nGroup workforce policies are approved by the Board. All the policies relating to our workforce take account of the global nature of our company. Our whistleblowing process is overseen by the Board and every member of the workforce has access to the whistleblower programme (myVoice) and details of this programme are on page 107.\n\n## Division of responsibilities\n\n## F. The role of the Chairman\n\nThe Chairman leads the Board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness. He was independent on the date of his appointment and we consider he remains independent for the purposes of the Code. This is also the case for the Chair-designate, Dominic Barton, who will be appointed with effect from 5 May 2022. The Chairman recognises the importance of creating a boardroom culture which encourages openness and debate and ensures constructive relations between executive and Non-Executive Directors.\n\nThe Chairman is responsible for: the management of the Board and its committees; Director performance; induction; training and development; succession planning; engagement with external stakeholders; and attendance by the Board at shareholder meetings.\n\nThe Chairman is supported by the Senior Independent Directors, the Group Company Secretary and the Chief Executive. In line with the UK Code the Senior Independent Director, Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc is responsible for acting as a sounding board for the Chairman and engages with shareholders to develop a balanced understanding of their interests and concerns. For further details, please see our Board Charter on riotinto.com, which sets out the role, responsibilities, structure, compositions and conduct of the Board, as well as the role of the Chairman, the Senior Independent Director, Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and the Senior Independent Director, Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited.\n\n## G. Composition of the board\n\nAs at the date of this report, the Board comprises 11 members: 8/uni00A0independent Non-Executive Directors, the Chairman, the Chief Executive, and the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAs detailed in the Nominations Committee report, we engaged Spencer Stuart to support the search for a new Chair and the Committee is satisfied that Spencer Stuart does not have any connections with the company or individual Directors that may impair their independence. The recruitment of Ben Wyatt as a Non-Executive Director was not supported by an external agency.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that it has the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence, and knowledge of the company to enable its members to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively, and that no individual or group can dominate the Board's decision making.\n\nThere is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executive leadership of our business. The Chief Executive is responsible for the day-to-day management of the business and, under a Group delegation of authority framework, delegates to other members of the Executive Committee.\n\n## H. Role of Non-Executive Directors\n\nWe list all of the Non-Executive Directors that we consider to be independent on pages 134-135 of this report. Over 50% of the Board (excluding the Chairman) are Non-Executive Directors. The NonExecutive Directors constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy. They are also responsible for scrutinising management performance and ensuring that financial information, risks and controls, and systems of risk management are robust. In order to enhance Board engagement in Australia, the role of Senior Independent Director Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited was established in 2021. Simon McKeon was appointed to this position and the terms of this appointment were agreed by the/uni00A0Board.\n\nThe Board held an internally facilitated Board evaluation this year and as part of this process, the Board met without the Chairman present and a full assessment of the Chairman's capability was carried out. Details of this review are on pages 146-147. Each Director has undertaken to allocate sufficient time to the Group in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively, and this is kept under review by the Nominations Committee. The Directors' other appointments are listed on pages 134-135.\n\n## I. Board processes and role of the Company Secretary\n\nThe governance framework on page 145 explains the governance structure of the Board and sets out the relationship with the Chief Executive. The roles and responsibilities of each committee are explained. The Board insights section provides some examples of the decision-making process of the Board and the steps it takes to function effectively, including how it considers stakeholders in this/uni00A0process.",

        "page_content": "The Group Company Secretary is the trusted interlocutor within the Board and its committees, and between senior leadership and the Non-Executive Directors. He is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on all governance matters. He supports the Chairman in ensuring that the information provided to the Board is of sufficient quality and appropriate detail in order for the Board to function effectively and efficiently. Composition, succession and/uni00A0evaluation\n\n## J. Appointments to the board\n\nThe Nominations Committee ensures a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors. It is also responsible for Board succession planning, regularly assessing the balance of skills, experience, diversity and capacity required to oversee the delivery of Rio/uni00A0Tinto's strategy. It reviews proposals for appointments to the Executive Committee, and monitors executive succession planning. This year the Nominations Committee oversaw the succession of the Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and details of this process are provided in the Nominations Committee report on pages 148-150.\n\nAll Non-Executive Directors are members of the Nominations Committee. The committee is chaired by the Chairman, apart from when the committee is dealing with the appointment of his or her successor. Only the Chairman and committee members have the right to attend the meetings of the Nominations Committee; attendance by all other individuals is by invitation only. The Nominations Committee report sets out the Board's approach to succession planning and how this supports the development of a diverse pipeline, at all levels. All/uni00A0Directors are subject to annual re-election at the AGMs.\n\nDetails of external search consultancies used for Board appointments can be found in the Nominations Committee report.\n\n## K. Skills, experience and knowledge of the board and its/uni00A0committees\n\nIn our succession planning, we aim to bring a diverse and complementary range of skills, knowledge and experience to the Board, so that we are equipped to navigate the operational, social, regulatory and geopolitical complexity in which our business operates. Achieving the right blend of skills and diversity to support effective decision making is a continuing process. Further details on tenure and experience of the Board are set out in the Nominations Committee report on page 149. The Board biographies set out the specific skills and experience which each Director brings to the Board (pages/uni00A0134-135).\n\n## L. Board evaluation\n\nA Board and committee effectiveness evaluation is carried out each year. The evaluation considers (but is not limited to): the balance of Board members' skills and experience; independence; diversity; the running of the Board; and Directors' knowledge of the company. Every third year, the Board evaluation is externally facilitated. An internally facilitated Board and committee evaluation was carried out in 2021. The terms of reference for this review and the outcomes are discussed on pages 146-147. An externally facilitated Board and committee evaluation will be carried out in 2022.\n\n## Audit, risk and internal control M. Internal and external audit\n\nThe Audit Committee monitors the independence and effectiveness of the Internal Audit function and external auditors. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing key judgments within the Group's financial statements and narrative reporting, with the aim of maintaining the integrity of the Group's financial reporting. For further detail, please refer to the Audit Committee report on pages 151-155.\n\nThe appointment of KPMG as external auditor for the 2021 financial year was approved by shareholders at our AGMs in 2021.\n\n## N. Fair, balanced and understandable assessment\n\nThe Board is responsible for the presentation of a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects, not only in the Annual Report. We have a robust process in place including through the Disclosure Committee, to ensure that this is the/uni00A0case.\n\n## O. Risk management and internal control framework\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for aligning our long-term strategic objectives with the risk appetite of the company, taking into account the principal and emerging risks faced by the company. Please refer to pages 112-130 for further details on our business planning cycle and risk management framework and how these support our longer-term viability statement. For further details on our approach to risk, please refer to the risk section on page 112.\n\n## Remuneration\n\n## P. Remuneration policies and practices\n\nThe Remuneration Committee supports the Board by setting our Remuneration Policy. Through long-term and short-term incentives, our Remuneration Policy is designed to help drive a performance culture which incentivises executives to deliver the Group's long-term strategy and create superior shareholder value over the short, medium and long term. The overarching aim is to ensure our remuneration structure and policies reward fairly and responsibly with a clear link to corporate and individual performance, and to the company's long-term strategy and values. We have worked to ensure that we have a clear policy that can be understood by shareholders and stakeholders.\n\n## Q. Procedure for developing remuneration policy\n\nWe have a formal and transparent procedure for developing our Remuneration Policy, and no Director is involved in deciding their own remuneration. Executive remuneration is set with regard to the wider workforce and through market benchmarking. For further detail, please/uni00A0refer to the Remuneration Committee report on pages 160-198. The Remuneration Committee is supported by remuneration consultant Deloitte. The Board received assurance from the Remuneration Committee and from Deloitte that Deloitte did not have any connections with Rio/uni00A0Tinto or the Board that would have impaired its independence. Please refer to page 172 of this Annual Report for further detail.\n\n## R. Exercising independent judgement\n\nThe Remuneration Committee comprises 6 Non-Executive Directors to ensure independent judgment with regard to remuneration outcomes. The Remuneration Committee considers remuneration on an annual basis and determines outcomes by assessing executive performance against performance criteria, details of which can be found in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 160-198 of this Annual Report. This states how our Remuneration Policy has been applied and sets out details of any adjustments made or discretions exercised.",

The principal role of the Board is to set the Group's strategy and to review its strategic direction regularly. The Board also has responsibility for corporate governance. A Board Charter setting out the role of the Board and management and matters reserved for the Board is available at riotinto.com.\n\nThe Board delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of the business to the Chief Executive and other members of the Executive Committee.

This year the Nominations Committee oversaw the succession of the Chairman and Chief Financial Officer and details of these processes are provided in the Nominations Committee report on pages 148-150.\n\nThe notice of annual general meeting provides all material information in Rio/uni00A0Tinto's possession relevant to decisions on election and re-election of Directors, including a statement from the Board that it considers all Directors continue to perform effectively and demonstrate appropriate levels of commitment. It also provides reasons why each Director is recommended for re-election, highlighting their relevant skills and experience.

The Nominations Committee reviews and approves this framework each year.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that all of its Non-Executive Directors are independent in character and judgment and are free from any relationships (material or otherwise) or circumstances that could create a conflict of interest.\n\nThe Chairman was considered independent upon his appointment and, in the Board's view, he continues to satisfy the tests for independence under the ASX Principles and the NYSE Standards.\n\nThe name, skills and experience of each Director, together with their terms in office, are shown in the biographical details on pages 134-135.\n\n## Recommendation 2.6\n\nOn joining Rio/uni00A0Tinto, all Directors receive a full, formal induction programme. It is delivered over a number of months, and tailored to their specific requirements, taking into account their prospective committee responsibilities. Details of the induction programme for the Chair-designate are set out on page 150 of the Annual Report.\n\nThe annual Board evaluation process identifies training and development needs for the Board and individual Directors.

In addition, the Group Company Secretary provides regular updates on corporate governance developments in the UK, Australia and the US.

Under IFRS, as defined in note 1, goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1998, which was eliminated directly against equity in the Group's UK GAAP financial statements, has not been reinstated. This was permitted under the rules governing the transition to IFRS set out in IFRS 1. The equivalent Australian Standard, AASB 1, does not provide for the netting of goodwill against equity. As a consequence, shareholders' funds under AAS include the residue of such goodwill, which amounted to US$377 million at 31 December 2021 (2020: US$374 million).\n\nSave for the exception described above, the Group's financial statements drawn up in accordance with IFRS are consistent with the requirements of AAS.\n\n## Outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial statements\n\n## The Rio Tinto Group\n\nThese are the financial statements of the Group formed through the merger of economic interests of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited (Merger), and presented by both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited as their consolidated financial statements in accordance with both UK and Australian legislation and regulations .\n\n## Merger terms\n\nOn 21 December 1995, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited entered into a dual listed companies (DLC) merger. Rio Tinto plc is incorporated in the UK and listed on the London and New York Stock Exchanges and Rio Tinto Limited is incorporated in Australia and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. The Merger was affected by contractual arrangements between the companies and amendments to Rio Tinto plc's Memorandum and Articles of Association and Rio Tinto Limited's Constitution.\n\nAs a result, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited and their respective groups operate together as a single economic enterprise, with neither assuming a dominant role. In particular, the arrangements:\n\n- - Confer upon the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited a common economic interest in both groups;\n- - Provide for common boards of directors and a unified management structure;\n- - Provide for equalised dividends and capital distributions; and\n- - Provide for the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited to take key decisions, including the election of directors, through an electoral procedure in which the public shareholders of the two companies in effect vote on a joint basis.\n\nThe Merger involved no change in the legal ownership of any assets of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor any change in the ownership of any existing shares or securities of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited, nor the issue of any shares, securities or payment by way of consideration, save for the issue by each company of one special voting share to a trustee company which facilitates the joint electoral procedure for public shareholders. During 2002, each of the parent companies issued a DLC Dividend Share to facilitate the efficient management of funds within the DLC structure.\n\n## Accounting standards\n\nThe financial statements have been drawn up in accordance with IFRS as defined in note 1. The Merger was accounted for as a merger under UK GAAP. As permitted under the rules governing the transition to IFRS, which are set out in IFRS 1, the Group did not restate business combinations that occurred before the transition date of 1 January 2004. As a result, the DLC Merger of economic interests described above continues to be accounted for as a merger under IFRS as defined in note 1.\n\nThe main consequence of adopting merger rather than acquisition accounting is that the balance sheet of the merged Group includes the assets and liabilities of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited at their carrying values prior to the Merger, subject to adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, rather than at their fair values at the date of the Merger. For accounting purposes Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are viewed as a single public parent company (with their respective public shareholders being the shareholders in that single company). As a result, the amounts attributable to both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited public shareholders are included in the amounts attributed to owners of Rio Tinto on the balance sheet, income statement and statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## Australian Corporations Act\n\nThe financial statements are drawn up in accordance with an order, under section 340 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on 16 July 2021. The main effect of the order is that the financial statements are prepared on the basis that Rio Tinto Limited, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities are treated as a single economic entity, and in accordance with the principles and requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards which have been endorsed by the United Kingdom as adopted by the European Union (EU) before 1 January 2021 and as adopted for use in the United Kingdom ('UK') thereafter under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and include a reconciliation from UK IFRS to the Australian equivalent of IFRS (see above).\n\nFor further details of the ASIC Class Order relief see page 321.",

Major products are aluminium, copper, diamonds, gold, industrial minerals (borates, titanium dioxide and salt) and iron ore. Activities span the world and are strongly represented in Australia and North America, with significant businesses also in Asia, Europe, Africa and South America.\n\nRio Tinto plc is incorporated in the UK and listed on the London and New York Stock Exchanges and Rio Tinto Limited is incorporated in Australia and listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Rio Tinto plc's registered office is at 6 St James's Square, London SW1Y 4AD, UK. Rio Tinto Limited's registered office is at Level 7, 360 Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria 3000, Australia.\n\nAs described in the 'Outline of dual listed companies structure and basis of financial statements' on page 217, for the purposes of preparing the IFRS compliant consolidated financial statements of the Rio Tinto Group, both the DLC companies, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, are viewed as a single economic entity, and the interests of shareholders of both companies are presented as the equity interests of shareholders in the Rio Tinto Group.\n\nThese financial statements consolidate the accounts of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited (together 'the Companies') and their respective subsidiaries (together 'the Group') and include the Group's share of joint arrangements and associates as explained in note 1(b) below. The Group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 were authorised for issue in accordance with a directors' resolution on 16 February 2022.\n\nNotes 32 to 35 provide more information on the Group's subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates and note 39 provides information on the Group's transactions with other related parties.\n\nThe 2021 Annual Report satisfies the obligations of Rio Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated accounts under Australian company law, as amended by an order issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 16 July 2021. The 2021 financial statements disclose on page 217 the effect of the adjustments to the Group's consolidated profit/(loss), consolidated total comprehensive income/(loss) and consolidated shareholders' funds as prepared under IFRS as defined below that would be required under the version of IFRS that is applicable in Australia, referred to as Australian Accounting Standards (AAS).\n\nThe US dollar is the presentation currency used in these financial statements, as it most reliably reflects the Group's global business performance.\n\n## Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe basis of preparation and the accounting policies used in preparing the Group's 2021 financial statements are set out below.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, applicable UK law, and applicable Australian law as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021 and also with:\n\n- -International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and interpretations issued from time to time by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) which are mandatory at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe above accounting standards and interpretations are collectively referred to as 'IFRS' in this report. The Group has not early adopted any amendments, standards or interpretations that have been issued but are not yet mandatory.\n\n## COVID-19 impact\n\nThe Group has demonstrated resilience in dealing with ongoing COVID-19 challenges with continued prioritisation of the safety of our people and communities. Rio Tinto continues to proactively manage COVID-19 impacts and prioritises work across critical projects, as challenges associated with interstate and international border access continue, impacting the availability and movement of people, most notably in Australia and Mongolia. Plans to mitigate labour shortages are in place.\n\nDespite this, we progressed a number of our projects, including the Pilbara replacement mines. Mining and operational readiness activities are progressing at the Gudai-Darri mine and the railway is operational. Production from the new greenfield mine at Gudai-Darri and the Robe Valley brownfield mine replacement project is delayed due to the tight labour market in Western Australia. First production from the main plant at Gudai-Darri is now expected in the second quarter of 2022, subject to the continuing impacts of COVID-19. The Oyu Tolgoi underground project in Mongolia was technically and operationally ready for undercut, which commenced in January 2022, despite continued COVID-19 constraints in Mongolia. The delay to the commissioning of shafts 3 and 4 is still expected to be approximately nine months based on known COVID-19 impacts to date, contributing to delays in first sustainable production expected in the first half of 2023.\n\nIn addition, Escondida's mined copper production was lower than 2020 mostly as a result of the prolonged impact of COVID-19. The Group continues to monitor government-imposed restrictions related to COVID-19, and any other potential COVID-19 related disruptions, such as shipment delays. Recognising the broad and complex impacts of the pandemic on our markets, operations and financial performance, we have chosen not to segregate COVID-19 related costs from our underlying performance metrics.",

        "page_content": "## Going concern\n\nManagement has prepared detailed cash flow forecasts for the next 12 months and has updated life-of-mine plan models with longer-term cash flow projections. These forecasts demonstrate that the Group has sufficient cash, other liquid resources and undrawn credit facilities to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due. As such, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the full-year financial information. Further detail on the going concern basis of accounting is included on page 204.\n\n## Climate change\n\nWe have put the net zero transition at the heart of our business strategy: combining investments in commodities that enable the energy transition with actions to decarbonise our operations and value chains. As a result of this, our strategy and approach to climate change are supported by strong governance, processes and capabilities. In 2021, we updated our Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets and now aim to reduce emissions by 15% in 2025, by 50% in 2030 (relative to our 2018 equity baseline) and to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. These targets are aligned with efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, which is aligned with the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. The goals of the Paris Agreement are set out in Article 2, which includes holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nWe frame the strategic context for the Group through the lens of three scenarios, developed by the Strategy and Economics teams, structured around our analysis of the interplay of three global forces: geopolitics, society and technology.\n\n- - In a geopolitics-led scenario, strong nationalistic tendencies hold back global action on climate change, carbon prices remain low (in the range US$0-30/t CO2e) and warming exceeds 3\u00b0C by 2100.\n- - In a society-led scenario, strong global co-ordination of climate policies, supported by high and rising carbon prices (reaching US$130/t CO2e in 2050), accelerates the energy transition and we believe achieves the goal of the Paris Agreement by limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0C by 2100.\n- - In a technology-led scenario, innovation boosts economic productivity and decarbonisation efforts; however, carbon prices remain modest (ranging US$10 to US$75/t CO2e by 2030) and action to limit emissions is insufficient, so warming exceeds 2\u00b0C by 2100.\n\nWe recognise that the pace of decarbonisation across the global economy is uncertain and that current climate policies in many countries are not yet aligned with stated ambitions. These policy uncertainties are captured in our scenario analysis, which in turn informs the central case carbon price assumptions. We continue to monitor alternative scenarios including ones that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C. For example, the IEA NZE50 assumes higher carbon prices and a much faster energy transition than our scenarios; they also require a higher level of co-ordination in climate policies across sectors and countries. The IEA's scenario also assumes stronger demand for commodities such as copper or battery minerals that are critical to the accelerated deployment of solar and wind renewables or electric vehicles.\n\n## Portfolio strategy\n\nOur scenarios above inform our portfolio strategy, the internal commodity price setting process and strongly influence our critical accounting judgements and estimates. Through our strategy process we test the resilience of our portfolio against each of these three scenarios and conclude that overall, our portfolio is expected to perform more strongly in scenarios with proactive climate action, particularly in relation to aluminium and copper. Our strategy to focus our growth capital expenditure on materials that enable the energy transition is informed by these scenarios. Our ambition is to increase our growth capital expenditure to up to US$3 billion per year in 2023 and 2024, developing new options and finding innovative ways of bringing projects on-stream faster. This includes investment in lithium production at Rincon and Jadar, copper at Oyu Tolgoi and Winu, as well as high-grade iron ore from Simandou.\n\n## Accounting judgements\n\nThe forecast commodity prices (including carbon prices) are informed by a blend of our three scenarios and are used pervasively in our financial processes from budgeting, forecasting, capital allocation and project evaluation to the determination of ore reserves. In turn, these prices are used to derive critical accounting estimates including as inputs to impairment testing, estimation of remaining economic life for units of production depreciation and discounting closure and rehabilitation provisions. As only one of our scenarios represents the Group's view of the goals of the Paris Agreement, and because of the policy uncertainties described above, our commodity price assumptions are not consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global transition to meet these goals.\n\nIn addition to prices, given the significant investment we are making to abate our carbon emissions, we have also considered the potential for asset obsolescence, with a particular focus on our Pilbara operations where we are prioritising investment in renewables to switch away from natural gas power generation, but no material changes to accounting estimates have been necessary. The closure date and cost of closure is also sensitive to climate assumptions but no material changes have been made in the year specific to climate change.\n\nThe Group has identified impairment triggers during the year for cashgenerating units in the aluminium and copper segments. The Group considers the long-term pricing outlook for aluminium and copper is positive as these metals are critical to the global transition to a lowcarbon future. The outlook for iron ore pricing is less certain and depends on the development of low-emissions steel technology. However, considering the high return on capital generated by our existing iron ore asset base, none of our three scenarios would give rise to an impairment today. When measuring the recoverable amount for these cash-generating units, a blend of the three strategic scenarios has been used to forecast the cash flows. As only one of the strategic scenarios represents the Group's view of the goals of the Paris Agreement, the impairment outcome cannot be described as Parisaligned. However, in these circumstances, we have also disclosed sensitivity information based on cash flows flexed for sales prices and carbon taxes in the society-led scenario, which has a well below 2\u00b0C outcome. These sensitivities indicate that higher recoverable amounts would have been determined if the accounting was aligned with the society-led scenario.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2021 financial statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\nUsing a carbon price to accelerate our mitigation action\n\nWe are committed to align our future capital expenditure with our 2025 and 2030 Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets. As noted above, we conclude that our targets are aligned with efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C and the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. To deliver our climate targets, the Group expects to make incremental capital investment of US$7.5 billion over the period to 2030 (approximately US$1.5 billion over the period 2022 to 2024). We also expect our incremental operating expenditure to support the Climate Action Plan to be in the order of US$200 million per year, including research and development initiatives.\n\nFor internal approval purposes, a notional carbon price of US$75/t CO2e is now used to drive improvements in energy efficiency across our assets, help to identify new abatement projects as well as incentivise and accelerate the delivery of capital investment in abatement projects and operational improvements. The US$75/t CO2e price is derived from our analysis of carbon mitigation options across our assets (summarised in our Marginal Abatement Cost Curve) - it is unrelated to the prices in our scenarios.\n\n## New standards issued\n\nThe Group's financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, except for the accounting requirements set out below, effective as at 1 January 2021, which did not have a significant impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nThe Group adopted Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16) at 1 January 2021. The amendments address the financial reporting impact from reform of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates (collectively 'IBOR reform'). The Group applied the Phase 2 amendments retrospectively. However, in accordance with the exceptions permitted in the Phase 2 amendments, it has elected not to restate comparatives for the prior periods to reflect the application of these amendments. Since the Group had no transactions for which the benchmark rate had been replaced with an alternative benchmark rate as at 31 December 2020, there is no impact on opening equity balances as a result of retrospective application.\n\nOn 5 March 2021 LIBOR's administrator, ICE Benchmarks Administration (IBA) and its supervisor, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), issued statements which provide the dates that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative. This will occur: immediately after 31 December 2021, for all GBP, Euro, CHF and JPY LIBOR settings, and for 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR settings; and immediately after 30 June 2023, for the remaining USD LIBOR settings. The Group has taken relevant Phase 2 practical reliefs from certain requirements in IFRS 9, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 relating to changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and hedge accounting.\n\nOur hedging arrangements impacted by the reform of US LIBOR are part of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Fallbacks Protocol, which provides a global standardised mechanism for replacement of the current benchmark. At 31 December 2021, the Group has interest rate risk exposure including US$6.1 billion nominal values of fixed-rate borrowings swapped to US dollar rates in fair value hedge relationships impacted by the reform, described further in note 29 A (b) (v).\n\nWe expect the application of the Phase 2 reliefs to result in continuation of the Group's pre-existing hedge accounting upon amendment of designated arrangements in response to the replacement of IBOR with new benchmarks (refer to note 1 q (iv)).\n\nIn addition, the Group has a number of arrangements which reference IBOR benchmarks and extend beyond 2021. These include third-party borrowings relating to the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance (refer to note 21), other secured loans, a number of intragroup balances and certain commercial contracts. Other arrangements, which currently reference IBOR benchmarks include shareholder loan facilities. Phase 2 amendments will require the Group to account for a change in the basis for determining the cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability measured at amortised cost, by updating their respective effective interest rates as required by IBOR reform. As a result of the Phase 2 relief the Group expects that no material gain or loss will arise from these updates (refer to note 1 q (ii)). The accessible revolving lines of credit have been replaced with a new facility, which now refers to the SOFR and SONIA rates (refer to note 29 A (b)). Most intragroup balances transitioned to alternative benchmarks by 31 December 2021.\n\n## Standards issued, but not yet effective\n\n## Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment', mandatory in 2022 and not yet endorsed by the UK)\n\nThe amendments prohibit the deduction, from the cost of major project construction work in progress, of proceeds (net of additional processing costs) from selling items before the related item of property, plant and equipment is available for use. Under the amendment such proceeds are recognised in the income statement together with the costs of producing those items. The amendments will result in higher reported revenue, operating costs, inventory and property plant and equipment balances (capital works in progress) relating to major development projects completed after 1 January 2020. IAS 2 'Inventories' will apply to the measurement of preproduction inventory and identifying the related cost may require significant estimation and judgment in the selection of an appropriate method for allocating development expenditure to such inventory. During 2021, the Group completed a review of the impact of these amendments and concluded that adjustments to Group retained earnings at 1 January 2020, and restatement of the 2020 and 2021 Group Income Statement and Balance Sheet upon adoption of the amendments in 2022 in respect of such projects are not material.\n\nOnerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'), mandatory in 2022 and not yet endorsed by the UK)\n\nThe amendments specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of fulfilling a contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. Under the amendment the cost of fulfilling a contract comprises all directly related costs, including both incremental amounts and an allocation of other directly related expenditure. The Group currently makes provision for onerous contracts when the assets dedicated to the contract are fully impaired or the contract becomes stranded as a result of a business decision (refer to note 1(i)). From 2022, the Group will record a provision if a contract is found to be loss-making on a stand-alone basis following allocation of all directly related costs as required by the amendments to IAS 37. As required by the transition arrangements, the Group will apply the amendments in its 2022 Financial Statements without restatement. During 2021, the Group completed a review of the impact of these amendments and concluded that adjustments to retained earnings at 1 January 2022 are not material.",

        "page_content": "## Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes', mandatory in 2023 and not yet endorsed by the UK)\n\nNarrow-scope amendments to IAS 12 introduce an exception to the initial recognition exemption for transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The most significant impact from implementing these amendments is expected to be from temporary differences related to the Group's provisions for close-down, restoration, environmental and lease obligations and corresponding capitalised closure costs and right-of-use assets.\n\nOur existing accounting policy states that 'where the recognition of an asset and liability from a single transaction gives rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences, Rio Tinto applies the Initial Recognition Exemption allowed by IAS 12, and consequently recognises neither a deferred tax asset nor a deferred tax liability in respect of these temporary differences'.\n\nUnder the amendment, deferred tax assets and liabilities will be required to be recognised in respect of such temporary differences. Upon transition in 2023, the Group anticipates material adjustments (prior to required offsetting within the same tax jurisdiction) as at 1 January 2021 to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities with the net difference recorded in reserves. Work is ongoing to quantify the impact, including appropriate offsets against existing deferred tax liabilities or assets in various jurisdictions. There will be no impact on tax cash flows or balance sheet tax recoverable or payable as a result of implementing these amendments and the unwind of the newly recognised deferred tax is not expected to materially impact annual profits and losses.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (mandatory in 2023 and not yet endorsed by the UK)\n\nThe standard provides consistent principles for all aspects of accounting for insurance contracts. The Group continues to evaluate the impact of this pronouncement and to monitor the evolving practice, particularly for potential impact areas related to reinsurance contracts with Equity Accounted Units and in-substance self-insurance arrangements.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' on classification of liabilities' (mandatory in 2024 and not yet endorsed by the UK)\n\nThese narrow-scope amendments to IAS 1 set out specific guidance for determining the classification of liabilities as current or non-current, based on whether an entity has a substantive right to payment deferral at the reporting date. The Group continues to evaluate the impact of this amendment, which has been tentatively deferred to no earlier than 1 January 2024.\n\n## Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to use judgment in applying accounting policies and in making critical accounting estimates.\n\nThese judgments and estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ materially from the amounts included in the financial statements. Areas of judgment in the application of accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are noted below and further information is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the financial statements.\n\nThese areas of judgment and estimation are discussed further in critical accounting policies and estimates on pages 233 to 237. The quantum of ore reserves and mineral resources impacts many of these areas and the basis of calculation is explained below. Information on less material judgments and sources of estimation uncertainty has been incorporated into the relevant accounting policy notes.\n\nAreas of judgment in the application of accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements in the current year are:\n\n- - Impairment of non-current assets - determination of cashgenerating units (CGUs) and assessment of indicators of impairment - note 1(e) and (i), critical policy (i), note 6, note 12 and note 13.\n- - Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations determining when a closure study plan and cost estimate is sufficiently advanced and reliable to form the basis for an update note 1(l) and critical policy (iii).\n- - Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets - recognition of deferred tax assets for loss making operations - critical policy (vi) and note 17.\n- - Uncertain tax positions - technical interpretation of tax law and evaluation of outcomes in the determination of whether multiple or binary scenarios are the appropriate basis for provision measurement - note 1(n), critical policy (v), note 9 and note 30.\n- - Estimation of asset lives - determination of the life of the orebody and mine reserves, including grade cut-off assumptions consistent with the internal prices described in the Climate Change section note 1(i) and critical policy (ii).\n- - Deferral of stripping costs - judgment on components/strip ratios and separate or integrated multiple pit mines - note 1(h) and critical policy (iv).\n\nOther areas of judgment impacting the financial statements are:\n\n- - Oyu Tolgoi funding balances - accounting for a transaction with a non-controlling owner, critical policy (xii).\n- - Provision for onerous contracts - determination of assets dedicated to a contract - note 1(i) and critical policy (vii).\n- - Identification of functional currencies - different companies may make different judgments based on similar facts - note 1(d) and critical policy (viii).\n- - Basis of consolidation - judgment as to when the Group has control, joint control or significant influence - critical policy (ix) and notes 32-35.\n- - Contingencies - assessing the probability of any loss and whether it is possible to quantify any loss - critical policy (x) and note 30.\n- - Exclusions from underlying earnings - judgment on items to be excluded on grounds of nature or size - critical policy (xi) and note 2.",

In particular, on 2 February 2022, Energy Resources of Australia released preliminary findings from its reforecast of the total undiscounted cost schedule for the Ranger rehabilitation project giving a revised range, including spend since 1 January  2019, of approximately A$1.6 billion to A$2.2 billion in nominal terms. Information available from this reforecast resulted in the Group recording an increase to the closure provision of US$510 million at 31 December 2021 based on a  central case within the given range. The central case is considered to represent Rio Tinto's best estimate of obligations at 31 December 2021, however Rio Tinto continues to perform a technical review over this reforecast and has advised Energy Resources of Australia that it is committed to working with the company to ensure that rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area is successfully achieved. We therefore expect to make further adjustments to the provision during 2022 as confidence levels in the studies improve.\n- - Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets - the forecasts used to support the recognition of deferred tax assets will be impacted by changes to forecast commodity prices and the closure uncertainties noted above.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe Group considers information to be material if correcting a misstatement, omission or obscuring could, in the light of surrounding circumstances, reasonably be expected to change the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the financial statements. The Group considers both quantitative and qualitative factors in determining whether information is material; the concept of materiality is therefore not driven purely by numerical values.\n\nWhen considering the potential materiality of information, management makes an initial quantitative assessment using thresholds based on estimates of profit before taxation; for the year ended 31 December 2021 the quantitative threshold was US$700 million (year ended 31 December 2020: US$550 million). However, other considerations can result in a determination that lower values are material or, occasionally, that higher values are immaterial. These considerations include whether a misstatement, omission or obscuring: masks a change or trend in key performance indicators; causes reported key metrics to change from a positive to negative values or vice-versa; affects compliance with regulatory requirements or other contractual requirements; could result in an increase to management's compensation; or might conceal an unlawful transaction.\n\nIn assessing materiality, management also applies judgment based on its understanding of the business and its internal and external financial statement users. The assessment will consider user expectations of numerical and narrative reporting. Sources used in making this assessment would include, for example: published analyst consensus measures, experience gained in formal and informal dialogue with users (including regulatory correspondence), and peer group benchmarking.\n\n## Ore reserves and mineral resources\n\nEstimates of ore reserves and, in some cases, mineral resources can impact: depreciation and amortisation rates; the carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment; deferred stripping costs; provisions for close-down and restoration costs; and the recovery of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined in accordance with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code (see note 1(j)).\n\nThe estimation of ore reserves and mineral resources requires judgment to interpret available geological data and subsequently to select an appropriate mining method and then to establish an extraction schedule. Estimation requires assumptions about future commodity prices and demand, exchange rates, production costs, transport costs, close-down and restoration costs, recovery rates and discount rates and, in some instances, the renewal of mining licences.\n\nThere are many uncertainties in the estimation process and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. New geological or economic data, or unforeseen operational issues, may change estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources.\n\nThe Group uses judgment as to when to include mineral resources in accounting estimates, for example, the use of mineral resources in the Group's depreciation policy is described in note 1(i) below and in the determination of the date of closure as described in note 1(l). The unaudited statement of ore reserves is included on page 354 and of mineral resources on page 366.\n\n## (a) Accounting convention\n\nThe financial information included in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021, and for the related comparative periods, has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain derivative contracts and financial assets, the impact of fair value hedge accounting on the hedged item and the accounting for post-employment assets and obligations. The Group's policy in respect of these items is set out in the notes below.\n\nAll financial statement values are rounded to the nearest million (US$m) unless otherwise stated.\n\nWhere applicable, comparatives have been adjusted to measure or present them on the same basis as current period figures.\n\n## (b) Basis of consolidation (notes 32-35)\n\nAll intragroup transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.\n\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the locally reported assets, liabilities, and results of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates to bring their accounting policies in line with those used by the Group.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by either of the companies. Control exists where either of the companies has: power over the entities, that is, existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entities (those that significantly affect the companies' returns); exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entities; and the ability to use its power to affect those returns. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.",

        "page_content": "## Joint arrangements\n\nA joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control such that decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement (those that significantly affect the companies' returns) require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The Group has two types of joint arrangements:\n\n## Joint operations (JO)\n\nA JO is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. This includes situations where the parties benefit from the joint activity through a share of the output, rather than by receiving a share of the results of trading. In relation to its interest in a JO, the Group recognises: its share of assets and liabilities; revenue from the sale of its share of the output and its share of any revenue generated from the sale of the output by the JO; and its share of expenses. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in proportion to the Group's interest in the JO. These amounts are recorded in the Group's financial statements on the appropriate lines.\n\n## Joint ventures (JV)\n\nA JV is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. JVs are accounted for using the equity accounting method.\n\n## Other unincorporated arrangements\n\nIn some cases, the Group participates in unincorporated arrangements and has rights to its share of the assets and obligations for its share of the liabilities of the arrangement rather than a right to a net return, but does not share joint control. In such cases, the Group recognises: its share of assets and liabilities; revenue from the sale of its share of the output and its share of any revenue generated from the sale of the output by the unincorporated arrangement; and its share of expenses. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in proportion to the Group's interest in the arrangement. These amounts are recorded in the Group's financial statements on the appropriate lines.\n\n## Associates\n\nAn associate is an entity that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement, over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is presumed to exist where there is neither control nor joint control and the Group has over 20% of the voting rights, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case. Significant influence can arise where the Group holds less than 20% of the voting rights if it has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions affecting the entity. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity accounting method.\n\nThe Group uses the term 'equity accounted units' (EAUs) to refer to associates and JVs collectively. Under the equity accounting method the investment is recorded initially at cost to the Group, including any goodwill on acquisition. In subsequent periods the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to reflect the Group's share of the EAUs' retained post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Long-term loans to EAUs that in substance form part of the Group's net investment (quasi equity loans) are financial assets but are included in the line 'Investments in equity accounted units' on the face of the balance sheet. When the Group's share of losses in an EAU equals or exceeds its interest in the EAU, including such long-term loans and any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations to continue to make payments on behalf of the EAU.\n\n## Acquisitions (note 36)\n\nUnder the 'acquisition' method of accounting for business combinations, the purchase consideration is allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed (the identifiable net assets) on the basis of their fair value at the date of acquisition, which is the date on which control is obtained.\n\nIn determining whether a particular set of activities is a business, an acquired arrangement has to have an input and substantive process which together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs.\n\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree, the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement and any equity interests issued by the Group. Costs related to the acquisition of a subsidiary are expensed as incurred.\n\nThe excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any shortfall is immediately recognised in the income statement.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the acquiree, that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity's net assets in the event of liquidation, are recognised by the Group in one of two ways with the choice being available on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. They can be measured at either the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets or at fair value. In some cases, non-controlling interests may be treated as equity options and valued on that basis. Goodwill (see note 1(e)) and amounts attributable to non-controlling interests will differ depending on the basis used.\n\nWhere the Group previously held a non-controlling interest in the acquiree, this is remeasured to fair value at the date control is obtained with any gain or loss recognised in the income statement. The cash cost of the share purchase that gives rise to control is included within 'investing activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\nWhere the Group increases its ownership interest in a subsidiary, the difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the share of net assets acquired is recorded in equity. The cash cost of such purchases is included within 'financing activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\nProvisional fair values allocated at a reporting date are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.\n\nThe results of businesses acquired during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control, joint control or significant influence is obtained.\n\n## Disposals (note 36)\n\nIndividual non-current assets or 'disposal groups' (that is, groups of assets and liabilities) to be disposed of by sale or otherwise in a single transaction are classified as 'held for sale' if the following criteria are met at the period end:\n\n- - The carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use; and\n- - The disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for such sales; and\n- - The sale is highly probable.",

The comparative balance sheet is not restated. Disposal groups acquired with a view to resale are held at the fair value determined at the acquisition date. For these assets acquired for resale no profits or losses are recognised between the acquisition date and the disposal date, unless there is a subsequent impairment.\n\nOn classification as held for sale, the assets are no longer depreciated and, if applicable, equity accounting ceases.\n\nIf control is lost, any interest in the entity retained by the Group is remeasured to its fair value and the change in carrying amount is recognised in the income statement. The retained interest may be subsequently accounted for as a joint venture, joint operation, associate or financial asset depending on the facts. Certain amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of the entity disposed of, or for which control, joint control or significant influence has ceased, may be recycled to the income statement. The cash proceeds of disposals are included within 'Investing activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\nChanges in the Group's interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for in equity. The cash proceeds of such disposals are included within 'Financing activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\n## (c) Sales revenue\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThe Group recognises sales revenue related to the transfer of promised goods or services when control of the goods or services passes to the customer. The amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration to which the Group is or expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nSales revenue is recognised on individual sales when control transfers to the customer. In most instances, control passes and sales revenue is recognised when the product is delivered to the vessel or vehicle on which it will be transported once loaded, the destination port or the customer's premises. There may be circumstances when judgment is required based on the five indicators of control below.\n\n- - The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership and has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good or service.\n- - The customer has a present obligation to pay in accordance with the terms of the sales contract. For shipments under the Incoterms Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF)/Carriage Paid to (CPT)/Cost and Freight (CFR) this is generally when the ship is loaded, at which time the obligation for payment is for both product and freight.\n- - The customer has accepted the asset. Sales revenue may be subject to adjustment if the product specification does not conform to the terms specified in the sales contract but this does not impact the passing of control. Assay and specification adjustments have been immaterial historically.\n- - The customer has legal title to the asset. The Group usually retains legal title until payment is received for credit risk purposes only.\n- - The customer has physical possession of the asset. This indicator may be less important as the customer may obtain control of an asset prior to obtaining physical possession, which may be the case for goods in transit.\n\nThe Group sells a significant proportion of its products on CFR or CIF Incoterms. This means that the Group is responsible (acts as principal) for providing shipping services and, in some instances, insurance after the date at which control of goods passes to the customer at the loading port.\n\nThe Group therefore has separate performance obligations for freight and insurance services that are provided solely to facilitate sale of the commodities it produces. Other Incoterms commonly used by the Group are Free on Board (FOB), where the Group has no responsibility for freight or insurance once control of the goods has passed at the loading port, and Delivered at Place (DAP), where control of the goods passes when the product is delivered to the agreed destination. For these Incoterms there is only one performance obligation, being for provision of product at the point where control passes.\n\nThe Group's products are sold to customers under contracts which vary in tenure and pricing mechanisms, including some volumes sold in the spot market. Pricing for iron ore is on a range of terms, the majority being either monthly or quarterly average pricing mechanisms, with a smaller proportion of iron ore volumes being sold on the spot market.\n\nWithin each sales contract, each unit of product shipped is a separate performance obligation. Revenue is generally recognised at the contracted price as this reflects the stand-alone selling price. Sales revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. Mining royalties payable are presented as an operating cost or, where they are in substance a profit-based tax, within taxation.\n\nSales of copper concentrate are stated net of the treatment and refining charges which will be required to convert it to an end product.\n\nCertain of the Group's products may be provisionally priced at the date revenue is recognised and a provisional invoice issued; however, substantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final prices in the results for the period. Provisionally priced receivables are subsequently measured at fair value through the income statement under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' as described in note (q). The final selling price for all provisionally priced products is based on the price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract. Final prices for copper concentrate are normally determined between 30-120 days after delivery to the customer. The change in value of the provisionally priced receivable is based on relevant forward market prices and is included in sales revenue; refer to note 3 on page 241 and note 29C(a) on page 271.\n\nRio Tinto has a number of long-term contracts to supply product to customers in future periods. Generally, revenues are recognised on an as invoiced basis; hence, the right to consideration from a customer corresponds directly with the entity's performance completed to date.\n\nA number of the Group's businesses provide volume discounts in certain circumstances. The impact of constraining such variable consideration under IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' was immaterial at both 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020.\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient in paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 and does not disclose information on the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied.",

        "page_content": "## Presentation and disclosures\n\nConsolidated sales revenue as reported in the income statement comprises sales to third parties. Certain of the Group's products may be provisionally priced at the date revenue is recognised. Sales revenue includes revenue from contracts with customers, which is accounted for under IFRS 15 and subsequent movements in provisionally priced receivables which are accounted for under IFRS 9. A breakdown of sales revenue between these two amounts is disclosed in the product analysis in note 3 and further detail on provisional pricing in note 3. Sales revenue includes revenue from movements in provisionally priced receivables, consistent with the treatment in prior periods.\n\nThe Group considers that the impact of economic factors on its sales revenue, particularly pricing and volumes, is best understood by reference to the disclosure of sales revenue by product group and sales destination in note 3. The analysis of provisional pricing adjustments by commodity in the product analysis in note 3 shows which products are subject to price volatility post the transfer of control. With the exception of Oyu Tolgoi, which sells copper concentrate to China, this price uncertainty is largely resolved at the period end.\n\nTypically, the Group has a right to payment before or at the point that control of the goods passes including a right, where applicable, to payment for provisionally priced products and unperformed freight and insurance services. Cash received before control passes is recognised as a contract liability. The amount of consideration does not contain a significant financing component as payment terms are less than one year.\n\nRevenues from the sale of significant by-products, such as gold, are included in sales revenue. Sundry revenue (e.g. sales of surplus power) incidental to the main revenue-generating activities of the operations is treated as a credit to operating costs.\n\nThe Group does not disclose sales revenue from freight and insurance services separately as it does not consider that this is necessary in order to understand the impact of economic factors on the Group; the Group's Chief Executive, the chief operating decision maker, as defined under IFRS 8 'Operating Segments', does not review information specifically relating to these sources of revenue in order to evaluate the performance of business segments and Group information on these sources of revenue is not provided externally.\n\nThe Group does provide information on freight revenue for the iron ore and bauxite businesses on pages 45 and 51 to help stakeholders understand FOB operating margins for those products.\n\nThird-party commodity swap arrangements principally for delivery and receipt of smelter-grade alumina are offset within operating costs.\n\n## (d) Currency translation\n\nThe functional currency for each entity in the Group, and for joint arrangements and associates, is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates. For many of these entities, this is the currency of the country in which they are located. Transactions denominated in other currencies are converted to the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at period-end exchange rates.\n\nThe Group's financial statements are presented in US dollars, as that presentation currency most reliably reflects the global business performance of the Group as a whole. On consolidation, income statement items for each entity are translated from the functional currency into US dollars at average rates of exchange, except for material one-off transactions, which are translated at the rate prevailing on the transaction date. Balance sheet items are translated into US dollars at period-end exchange rates.\n\nExchange differences arising on the translation of the net assets of entities with functional currencies other than the US dollar are recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. These translation differences are shown in the statement of comprehensive income, with the exception of translation adjustments relating to Rio Tinto Limited's share capital which are shown in the statement of changes in equity.\n\nWhere an intragroup balance is, in substance, part of the Group's net investment in an entity, exchange gains and losses on that balance are taken to the currency translation reserve.\n\nExcept as noted above, or in note 1(q) relating to derivative contracts, all other exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise.\n\n## (e) Goodwill and intangible assets (excluding exploration and evaluation expenditure) (notes 12 and 13)\n\nGoodwill is not amortised; it is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. Investments in EAUs, including any goodwill, are tested for impairment as a single asset when a trigger for impairment has been identified. The Group's impairment policy is explained in note 1(i).\n\nPurchased intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Finite-life intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use are not amortised; they are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in accordance with accounting policy note 1(i).\n\nThe Group considers that intangible assets have indefinite lives when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate cash flows for the Group. The factors considered in making this judgment include the existence of contractual rights for unlimited terms or evidence that renewal of the contractual rights without significant incremental cost can be expected for indefinite future periods in view of the Group's investment intentions. The life cycles of the products and processes that depend on the asset are also considered.\n\n## (f) Exploration and evaluation (note 13)\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure comprises costs that are directly attributable to:\n\n- - Researching and analysing existing exploration data;\n- - Conducting geological studies, exploratory drilling and sampling;\n- - Examining and testing extraction and treatment methods; and/or\n- - Compiling various studies (order of magnitude, pre-feasibility and feasibility).",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2021 financial statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\nExploration expenditure relates to the initial search for deposits with economic potential. Expenditure on exploration activity undertaken by the Group is not capitalised.\n\nEvaluation expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects (including smelter and refinery projects) that have been identified as having economic potential. Capitalisation of evaluation expenditure commences when there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will determine that a project is commercially viable, that is the project will provide a satisfactory return relative to its perceived risks, and therefore it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The Group's view is that a high degree of confidence is greater than 'more likely than not' (that is, greater than 50% certainty) and less than 'virtually certain' (that is, less than 90% certainty).\n\nAssessing whether there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that an evaluation project is commercially viable requires judgment and consideration of all relevant factors such as the nature and objective of the project; the project's current stage; project timeline; current estimates of the project's net present value, including sensitivity analyses for the key assumptions; and the main risks of the project. Development expenditure incurred prior to the decision to proceed is subject to the same criteria for capitalisation, being a high degree of confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that a project is commercially viable.\n\nIn some cases, undeveloped projects are regarded as successors to orebodies, smelters or refineries currently in production. Where this is the case, it is intended that these will be developed and go into production when the current source of ore is exhausted or when existing smelters or refineries are closed.\n\nOre reserves may be declared for an undeveloped mining project before its commercial viability has been fully determined. Evaluation costs may continue to be capitalised during the period between declaration of ore reserves and approval to mine as further work is undertaken in order to refine the development case to maximise the project's returns.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 6 'Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources', the criteria for the capitalisation of evaluation costs are applied consistently from period to period.\n\nIn the case of undeveloped mining projects which have arisen through acquisition, the allocation of the purchase price consideration may result in undeveloped properties being recognised at an earlier stage of project evaluation compared with projects arising from the Group's exploration and evaluation programme. Subsequent expenditure on acquired undeveloped projects is only capitalised if it meets the high degree of confidence threshold discussed above.\n\nThe carrying values of capitalised evaluation expenditure for undeveloped mining projects (projects for which the decision to mine has not yet been approved at the appropriate authorisation level within the Group) are reviewed at each reporting date for indicators of impairment in accordance with IFRS 6, and when indicators are identified are tested in accordance with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets'. Evaluation expenditure for non-mining projects is reviewed and tested under IAS 36.\n\nThe impairment review is based on a status report summarising the Group's intentions to recover value through development, sale or other partnering arrangements. If a project does not prove viable and is cancelled, all irrecoverable costs associated with the project net of any\n\npreviously recorded impairment provisions are charged to the income statement.\n\n## (g) Property, plant and equipment (note 14)\n\nOnce an undeveloped mining project has been determined as commercially viable and approval to mine has been given, expenditure other than that on land, buildings, plant, equipment and capital work in progress is capitalised under 'Mining properties and leases' together with any amount transferred from 'Exploration and evaluation'.\n\nCosts which are necessarily incurred whilst commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are capitalised. Development costs incurred after the commencement of production are capitalised to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future economic benefit. Interest on borrowings related to construction or development projects is capitalised, at the rate payable on project-specific debt if applicable or at the Group or subsidiary's cost of borrowing if not, until the point when substantially all the activities that are necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use are complete. It may be appropriate to use a subsidiary's cost of borrowing when the debt was negotiated based on the financing requirements of that subsidiary.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, as defined in IAS 16, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes, where applicable, the estimated close-down and restoration costs associated with the asset.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment includes right of use assets (note 14) arising from leasing arrangements, shown separately from owned and leasehold assets.\n\n## (h) Deferred stripping (note 14)\n\nIn open pit mining operations, overburden and other waste materials must be removed to access ore from which minerals can be extracted economically. The process of removing overburden and waste materials is referred to as stripping. During the development of a mine (or, in some instances, pit; see below), before production commences, stripping costs related to a component of an orebody are capitalised as part of the cost of construction of the mine (or pit) and are subsequently amortised over the life of the mine (or pit) on a units of production basis.\n\nWhere a mine operates several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning, initial stripping costs are accounted for separately by reference to the ore from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning, the second and subsequent pits are regarded as extensions of the first pit in accounting for stripping costs. In such cases, the initial stripping (i.e. overburden and other waste removal) of the second and subsequent pits is considered to be production phase stripping (see below).\n\nThe Group's judgment as to whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations depends on each mine's specific circumstances.\n\nThe following factors would point towards the initial stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:\n\n- - If mining of the second and subsequent pits is conducted consecutively following that of the first pit, rather than concurrently;\n- - If separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset;",

        "page_content": "- - If the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden removal and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit;\n- - If expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large; and\n- - If the pits extract ore from separate and distinct orebodies, rather than from a single orebody.\n\nIf the designs of the second and subsequent pits are significantly influenced by opportunities to optimise output from several pits combined, including the co-treatment or blending of the output from the pits, then this would point to treatment as an integrated operation for the purposes of accounting for initial stripping costs. The relative importance of each of the above factors is considered in each case.\n\nIn order for production phase stripping costs to qualify for capitalisation as a stripping activity asset, three criteria must be met:\n\n- - It must be probable that there will be an economic benefit in a future accounting period because the stripping activity has improved access to the orebody;\n- - It must be possible to identify the 'component' of the orebody for which access has been improved; and\n- - It must be possible to reliably measure the costs that relate to the stripping activity.\n\nA 'component' is a specific section of the orebody that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. It will typically be a subset of the larger orebody that is distinguished by a separate useful economic life (for example, a pushback).\n\nProduction phase stripping can give rise to two benefits: the extraction of ore in the current period and improved access to ore which will be extracted in future periods. When the cost of stripping which has a future benefit is not distinguishable from the cost of producing current inventories, the stripping cost is allocated to each of these activities based on a relevant production measure using a life-of-component strip ratio. The ratio divides the tonnage of waste mined for the component for the period either by the quantity of ore mined for the component or by the quantity of minerals contained in the ore mined for the component. In some operations, the quantity of ore is a more appropriate basis for allocating costs, particularly where there are significant by-products. Stripping costs for the component are deferred to the extent that the current period ratio exceeds the life of component ratio. The stripping activity asset is depreciated on a 'units of production' basis based on expected production of either ore or minerals contained in the ore over the life of the component unless another method is more appropriate.\n\nThe life-of-component ratios are based on the ore reserves of the mine (and for some mines, other mineral resources) and the annual mine plan; they are a function of the mine design and, therefore, changes to that design will generally result in changes to the ratios. Changes in other technical or economic parameters that impact the ore reserves (and for some mines, other mineral resources) may also have an impact on the life-of-component ratios even if they do not affect the mine design. Changes to the ratios are accounted for prospectively.\n\nIt may be the case that subsequent phases of stripping will access additional ore and that these subsequent phases are only possible after the first phase has taken place. Where applicable, the Group considers this on a mine-by-mine basis. Generally, the only ore attributed to the stripping activity asset for the purposes of calculating a life-of-component ratio, and for the purposes of amortisation, is the ore to be extracted from the originally identified component.\n\nDeferred stripping costs are included in 'Mining properties and leases' within 'Property, plant and equipment' or within 'Investments in equity accounted units', as appropriate. Amortisation of deferred stripping costs is included in 'Depreciation of property, plant and equipment' within 'Net operating costs' or in 'Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units', as appropriate.\n\n## (i) Depreciation and impairment (notes 13 and 14)\n\n## Depreciation of non-current assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine or smelter or refinery if that is shorter and there is no reasonable alternative use for the asset by the Group.\n\nThe useful lives of the major assets of a cash-generating unit are often dependent on the life of the orebody to which they relate. Where this is the case, the lives of mining properties, and their associated refineries, concentrators and other long-lived processing equipment are generally limited to the expected life of the orebody. The life of the orebody, in turn, is estimated on the basis of the life-of-mine plan. Where the major assets of a cash-generating unit are not dependent on the life of a related orebody, management applies judgment in estimating the remaining service potential of long-lived assets. Factors affecting the remaining service potential of smelters include, for example, smelter technology and electricity purchase contracts when power is not sourced from the companies, or in some cases from local governments permitting electricity generation from hydro-power stations.\n\nThe useful lives and residual values for material assets and categories of assets are reviewed annually and changes are reflected prospectively.\n\nDepreciation commences when an asset is available for use. The major categories of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a units of production and/or straight line basis as follows:\n\n## Units of production basis\n\nFor mining properties and leases and certain mining equipment, consumption of the economic benefits of the asset is linked to production. Except as noted below, these assets are depreciated on the units of production basis.\n\nIn applying the units of production method, depreciation is normally calculated based on production in the period as a percentage of total expected production in current and future periods based on ore reserves and, for some mines, other mineral resources. Other mineral resources may be included in the calculations of total expected production in limited circumstances where there are very large areas of contiguous mineralisation, for which the economic viability is not sensitive to likely variations in grade, as may be the case for certain iron ore, bauxite and industrial mineral deposits, and where there is a high degree of confidence that the other mineral resources can be extracted economically. This would be the case when the other mineral resources do not yet have the status of ore reserves merely because the necessary detailed evaluation work has not yet been performed and the responsible technical personnel agree that inclusion of a proportion of measured and indicated resources in the calculation of total expected production is appropriate based on historical reserve conversion rates.\n\nThe required level of confidence is unlikely to exist for minerals that are typically found in low-grade ore (as compared with the above), such as copper or gold. In these cases, specific areas of mineralisation have to be evaluated in detail before their economic status can be predicted with confidence.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2021 financial statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\nWhere measured and indicated resources are used in the calculation of depreciation for infrastructure, primarily rail and port, which will benefit current and future mines, then the measured and indicated resources may relate to mines which are currently in production or to mines where there is a high degree of confidence that they will be brought into production in the future. The quantum of mineral resources is determined taking into account future capital costs as required by the JORC code. The depreciation calculation, however, applies to current mines only and does not take into account future development costs for mines which are not yet in production. Measured and indicated resources are currently incorporated into depreciation calculations in the Group's Australian iron ore business.\n\n## Straight line basis\n\nAssets within operations for which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life shorter than the related mine are depreciated on a straight line basis.\n\n## Impairment charges/reversals of non-current assets\n\nImpairment charges and reversals are assessed at the level of cashgenerating units which, in accordance with IAS 36, are identified as the smallest identifiable asset or group of assets that generate cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets. Separate cash-generating units are identified where an active market exists for intermediate products, even if the majority of those products are further processed internally. Impairment of financial assets is evaluated in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nIn some cases, individual business units consist of several operations with independent cash-generating streams which constitute separate cash- generating units.\n\nGoodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the related business combination, and tested for impairment at the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. All goodwill, intangible assets that have an indefinite life and intangible assets that are not ready for use are tested annually for impairment as at 30 September, regardless of whether there has been an impairment trigger, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Right of use assets recognised under IFRS 16 'Leases' are included in the review. The Group conducts an internal review of the asset values annually as at 30 September which is used as a source of information to assess for indications of impairment or reversal of previously recognised impairment losses. External factors, such as changes in forecasted commodity prices, costs and other market factors as well as internal factors such as cancellation of a project or reduced project scope, are also monitored to assess for indications of impairment or reversal of previously recognised impairment losses. If any such indication exists then an impairment review is undertaken; the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use (being the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash-generating unit in its current condition) and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD).\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is measured by reference to FVLCD, this amount is further classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy for observable market data that is consistent with the unit of account for the cash-generating unit being tested. The Group considers that the best evidence of FVLCD is the value obtained from an active market or binding sale agreement and, in this case, the recoverable amount is classified in the fair value hierarchy as level 1. When FVLCD is based on quoted prices for equity instruments but adjusted to reflect factors such as a lack of liquidity in the market, the recoverable amount is classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. No cash-generating units are currently assessed for impairment by reference to a recoverable amount based on FVLCD classified as level 1 or level 2.\n\nWhere unobservable inputs are material to the measurement of the recoverable amount, FVLCD is based on the best information available to reflect the amount the Group could receive for the cash-generating unit in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This is often estimated using discounted cash flow techniques and is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nWhere the recoverable amount is assessed using FVLCD based on discounted cash flow techniques, the resulting estimates are based on detailed life-of-mine and/or long-term production plans. These may include anticipated expansions which are at the evaluation stage of study.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on management's best estimates of expected future revenues and costs, including the future cash costs of production, capital expenditure, and closure, restoration and environmental costs. For the purposes of determining FVLCD from a market participant's perspective, the cash flows incorporate management's price and cost assumptions in the short and medium term. In the longer term, operating margins are assumed to remain constant where appropriate, as it is considered unlikely that a market participant would prepare detailed forecasts over a longer term. The cash flow forecasts may include net cash flows expected to be realised from the extraction, processing and sale of material that does not currently qualify for inclusion in ore reserves. Such non-reserve material is only included when there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. This expectation is usually based on preliminary drilling and sampling of areas of mineralisation that are contiguous with existing ore reserves. Typically, the additional evaluation required to achieve reserves status for such material has not yet been done because this would involve incurring evaluation costs earlier than is required for the efficient planning and operation of the mine.\n\nAs noted above, cost levels incorporated in the cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on the current life-of-mine plan or longterm production plan for the cash-generating unit. This differs from value in use which requires future cash flows to be estimated for the asset in its current condition and therefore does not include future cash flows associated with improving or enhancing an asset's performance. Anticipated enhancements to assets may be included in FVLCD calculations and, therefore, generally result in a higher value.",

        "page_content": "Where the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is dependent on the life of its associated orebody, expected future cash flows reflect the current life of mine and/or long-term production plans, which are based on detailed research, analysis and iterative modelling to optimise the level of return from investment, output and sequence of extraction. The mine plan takes account of all relevant characteristics of the orebody, including waste-to-ore ratios, ore grades, haul distances, chemical and metallurgical properties of the ore impacting process recoveries and capacities of processing equipment that can be used. The life-of-mine plan and/or long-term production plans are, therefore, the basis for forecasting production output and production costs in each future year.\n\nForecast cash flows for ore reserve estimation for JORC purposes are generally based on Rio Tinto's commodity price forecasts, which assume short-term market prices will revert to the Group's assessment of the long-term price, generally over a period of three to five years. For most commodities, these forecast commodity prices are derived from a combination of analyses of the marginal costs of the producers and of the incentive price of these commodities. These assessments often differ from current price levels and are updated periodically. The Group does not believe that published medium- and long-term forward prices necessarily provide a good indication of future levels because they tend to be strongly influenced by spot prices. The price forecasts used for ore reserve estimation are generally consistent with those used for impairment testing unless management deems that in certain economic environments, a market participant would not assume Rio Tinto's view on prices, in which case in preparing FVLCD impairment calculations management estimates the assumptions that a market participant would be expected to use.\n\nForecast future cash flows of a cash-generating unit take into account the sales prices under existing sales contracts.\n\nThe discount rates applied to the future cash flow forecasts represent an estimate of the rate the market participant would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The Group's weighted average cost of capital is generally used as a starting point for determining the discount rates, with appropriate adjustments for the risk profile of the countries in which the individual cashgenerating units operate. For final feasibility studies and ore reserve estimation, internal hurdle rates, which are generally higher than the Group's weighted average cost of capital, are used. For developments funded with project finance, the debt component of the weighted average cost of capital may be calculated by reference to the specific interest rate of the project finance and anticipated leverage of the project.\n\nFor operations with a functional currency other than the US dollar, the impairment review is undertaken in the relevant functional currency. In estimating FVLCD, internal forecasts of exchange rates take into account spot exchange rates, historical data and external forecasts, and are kept constant in real terms after five years. The great majority of the Group's sales are based on prices denominated in US dollars. To the extent that the currencies of countries in which the Group produces commodities strengthen against the US dollar without an increase in commodity prices, cash flows and, therefore, net present values are reduced. Management considers that over the long term, there is a tendency for movements in commodity prices to compensate to some extent for movements in the value of the US dollar, particularly against the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, and vice versa. However, such compensating changes are not synchronised and do not fully offset each other. In estimating value in use, the present value of future cash flows in foreign currencies is translated at the spot exchange rate on the testing date.\n\nNon-current assets (excluding goodwill) that have suffered impairment are reviewed using the same basis for valuation as explained above whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment loss may no longer exist, or may have decreased. If appropriate, an impairment reversal will be recognised. The carrying amount of the cash-generating unit after reversal must be the lower of (a) the recoverable amount, as calculated above, and (b) the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the cashgenerating unit in prior periods.\n\nAn onerous contract is defined under IAS 37 as a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. Provision is made when the assets dedicated to the contract are fully impaired or the contract becomes stranded as a result of a business decision.\n\n## (j) Determination of ore reserve and mineral resource estimates\n\nThe Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by Competent Persons as defined in accordance with the JORC code.\n\nOre reserves and, for certain mines, other mineral resources, determined in this way are used in the calculation of depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges and for forecasting the timing of the payment of close-down and restoration costs and the recovery of deferred tax assets. The depreciation and impairment policy above notes instances in which mineral resources are taken into account for accounting purposes. In addition, value may be attributed to mineral resources in purchase price allocations undertaken for the purposes of business combination accounting.\n\n## (k) Leases (notes 14, 21, 22)\n\nIFRS 16 'Leases' applies to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. Certain leases are exempt from the standard, including leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources. The Group applies the scope exemptions in paragraphs 3(e) and 4 of IFRS 16 and does not apply IFRS 16 to leases of any assets which would otherwise fall within the scope of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets'.\n\nA significant proportion by value of the Group's lease arrangements relate to dry bulk vessels and office properties. Other leases include land and non-mining rights, warehouses, ports, equipment and vehicles. The majority of lease terms are negotiated through the Group's procurement function, although agreements contain a wide range of different terms and conditions.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2021 financial statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\nThe Group recognises all lease liabilities and corresponding right of use assets, with the exception of short-term (12 months or fewer) and low value leases, on the balance sheet. Lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of: fixed payments; variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate; amounts payable under residual value guarantees; and extension options expected to be exercised. Where a lease contains an extension option which the Group can exercise without negotiation, lease payments for the extension period are included in the liability if the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise the option. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities. Payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee, unless the interest rate implicit in the lease can be readily determined. For lease agreements relating to vessels, ports and properties, non-lease components are excluded from the projection of future lease payments and recorded separately within operating costs on a straight line basis. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The right of use asset arising from a lease arrangement at initial recognition reflects the lease liability, initial direct costs, lease payments made before the commencement date of the lease, and capitalised provision for dismantling and restoration, less any lease incentives.\n\nThe Group recognises depreciation of right of use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the income statement over the lease term. Repayments of lease liabilities are separated into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and interest portion (which the Group presents in operating activities) in the cash flow statement. Payments made before the commencement date are included within financing activities unless they in substance represent investing cash flows, for example where pre-commencement cash flows are significant relative to aggregate cash flows of the leasing arrangement.\n\n## (l) Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations (note 25)\n\nThe Group has provisions for close-down and restoration costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, the removal of residual materials and the remediation of disturbed areas for mines and certain refineries and smelters. These provisions are based on all regulatory requirements and any other commitments made to stakeholders.\n\nClosure provisions are not made for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the closure dates cannot be reliably estimated, instead a contingent liability is disclosed (refer to note 30). This applies primarily to certain Canadian smelters which have indefinite- lived water rights from local governments permitting electricity generation from hydro-power stations.\n\nClose-down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining or production, and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred in the years following closure of the mine, refinery or smelter. Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group's businesses estimate their costs using current restoration standards and techniques.\n\nClose-down and restoration costs are provided for in the accounting period when the obligation arising from the related disturbance occurs, based on the net present value of the estimated future costs of restoration to be incurred during the life of the operation and post closure. Where appropriate, the provision is estimated using probability weighting of the different remediation and closure scenarios. The obligation may occur during development or during the production phase of a facility.\n\nProvisions for close-down and restoration costs do not include any additional obligations which are expected to arise from future disturbance.\n\nThe costs are estimated on the basis of a closure plan, and are reviewed at each reporting period during the life of the operation to reflect known developments. The estimates are also subject to formal review, with appropriate external support, at regular intervals.\n\nThe initial close-down and restoration provision is capitalised within 'Property, plant and equipment'. Subsequent movements in the closedown and restoration provisions for ongoing operations, including those resulting from new disturbance related to expansions or other activities qualifying for capitalisation, updated cost estimates, changes to the estimated lives of operations, changes to the timing of closure activities and revisions to discount rates are also capitalised within 'Property, plant and equipment'. These costs are then depreciated over the lives of the assets to which they relate.\n\nChanges in closure provisions relating to closed operations are charged/credited to 'Net operating costs' in the income statement.\n\nWhere rehabilitation is conducted systematically over the life of the operation, rather than at the time of closure, provision is made for the estimated outstanding continuous rehabilitation work at each balance sheet date and the cost is charged to the income statement.\n\nIn determining the appropriate rate for discounting future cash flows for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations, we have considered recent years' market volatility and uncertainty together with the wide variety of timeframes to closure across our portfolio of assets. The Group discount rate is based on a long-term view of lowrisk market yields which includes a review of historic trends plus risks and opportunities for which future cash flows have not been adjusted, namely potential improvements in closure practices between the reporting date and the point at which rehabilitation spend takes place. The Group applies a single discount rate when measuring these liabilities since we expect to meet closure cash flows principally from US dollar revenues and financing, with activities co-ordinated by the Group's central closure team. The amortisation or 'unwinding' of the discount applied in establishing the provisions is charged to the income statement in each accounting period. The amortisation of the discount is shown within 'Finance items' in the income statement.\n\nIn some cases, Group companies make a contribution to trust funds in order to meet or reimburse future environmental and decommissioning costs. Amounts due for reimbursement from trust funds are not offset against the corresponding closure provision unless payments into the fund have the effect of passing the closure obligation to the trust.\n\nEnvironmental costs result from environmental damage that was not a necessary consequence of operations, and may include remediation, compensation and penalties. Provision is made for the estimated present value of such costs at the balance sheet date. These costs are charged to 'Net operating costs', except for the unwinding of the discount which is shown within 'Finance items'.\n\nRemediation procedures may commence soon after the time the disturbance, remediation process and estimated remediation costs become known, but can continue for many years depending on the nature of the disturbance and the remediation techniques used.",

        "page_content": "## (m) Inventories (note 16)\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, primarily on a weighted average cost basis. Third party production purchased for our own use that is ordinarily interchangeable in accordance with IAS 2 is valued on the same basis, jointly with our own production. Average costs are calculated by reference to the cost levels experienced in the relevant month together with those in opening inventory. The cost of raw materials and consumable stores is the purchase price. The cost of partly-processed and saleable products is generally the cost of production, including:\n\n- - Labour costs, materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore or the production of alumina and aluminium;\n- - The depreciation of mining properties and leases and of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore or the production of alumina and aluminium, copper and other refined products; and\n- - Production overheads.\n\nWork in progress includes ore stockpiles and other partly processed material. Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted and is available for further processing. If there is significant uncertainty as to if and/or when the stockpiled ore will be processed, the ore is expensed as mined. If the ore will not be processed within 12 months after the balance sheet date, it is included within non-current assets and net realisable value is calculated on a discounted cash flow basis. Quantities of stockpiled ore are assessed primarily through surveys and assays. Certain estimates, including expected metal recoveries, are calculated using available industry, engineering and scientific data, and are periodically reassessed taking into account technical analysis and historical performance.\n\n## (n) Taxation (note 9 and note 17)\n\nCurrent tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. It includes adjustments for tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, Rio Tinto establishes provisions based on either: the Group's judgment of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability weighted average approach.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated in accordance with IAS 12. The Group provides for deferred tax in respect of fair value adjustments on acquisitions including mining rights that, in general, are not eligible for income tax allowances. Provision for deferred tax is based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its income tax base (which may be nil). Even when there is no income tax base, the existence of a tax base for capital gains tax purposes is not usually taken into account in determining the deferred tax provision for the assets, unless they are classified as held for sale or it is determined for other reasons that the carrying amount is expected to be recovered primarily through disposal and not through use of the assets. Where the recognition of an asset and liability from a single transaction gives rise to equal and off-setting temporary differences, Rio Tinto applies the Initial Recognition Exemption allowed by IAS 12, and consequently recognises neither a deferred tax asset nor a deferred tax liability in respect of these temporary differences. Primarily this occurs with new lease arrangements and changes in closure cost estimates for assets in operation. Under the amendment to IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities will be required to be recognised in respect of such temporary differences (Refer to note 1 Standards issued, but not yet effective on page 221).\n\n## (o) Post-employment benefits (note 42)\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit plans which provide lump sums, pensions, medical benefits and life insurance to retirees. In accordance with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits', for post-employment defined benefit plans, the difference between the fair value of any plan assets and the present value of the plan obligations is recognised as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.\n\nWhere appropriate, the recognition of assets may be restricted to the present value of any amounts the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions. In determining the extent to which a refund will be available the Group considers whether any third party, such as a trustee or pension committee, has the power to enhance benefits or to wind up a pension plan without the Group's consent.\n\nThe most significant assumptions used in accounting for pension plans are the discount rate, the inflation rate and mortality rates. The discount rate is used to determine the net present value of the obligations, the interest cost on the obligations and the interest income on plan assets. The discount rate used is the yield on highquality corporate bonds with maturities and terms that match those of the post-employment obligations as closely as possible. Where there is no developed corporate bond market in a currency, the rate on government bonds is used. The inflation rate is used to project increases in future benefit payments for those plans that have benefits linked to inflation. The mortality rates are used to project the period over which benefits will be paid, which is then discounted to arrive at the net present value of the obligations.\n\nThe current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements are recognised in the income statement. The interest cost less interest income on assets held in the plans is also charged to the income statement. All amounts charged to the income statement in respect of these plans are included within 'Net operating costs' or in 'Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units', as appropriate.\n\nThe Group's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate. These are included within 'Net operating costs' or in 'Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units', as appropriate.\n\n## (p) Cash and cash equivalents (note 20)\n\nFor the purpose of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise: cash on hand, deposits held with banks, and short-term, highly liquid investments (mainly money market funds) that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown as current liabilities in the balance sheet.\n\nFurther detail on cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, is shown in note 20.\n\nFor the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are net of bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand.\n\n## (q) Financial instruments (note 29)\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or through profit or loss (FVPL)) and those to be held at amortised cost.",

The Group's policy with regard to financial risk management is set out in note 29. Generally, the Group does not acquire financial assets for the purpose of selling in the short term.\n\nThe Group's business model is primarily that of 'hold to collect' (where assets are held in order to collect contractual cash flows). When the Group enters into derivative contracts, these transactions are designed to reduce exposures relating to assets and liabilities, firm commitments or anticipated transactions.\n\n## (a) Financial assets held at amortised cost\n\nThis classification applies to debt instruments which are held under a hold to collect business model and which have cash flows that meet the solely payments of principal and interest ('SPPI') criteria.\n\nAt initial recognition, trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component are recognised at their transaction price. Other financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus related transaction costs; they are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any gain or loss on de-recognition or modification of a financial asset held at amortised cost is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (b) Financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)\n\nThis classification applies to the following financial assets:\n\n- - Debt instruments that are held under a business model where they are held for the collection of contractual cash flows and also for sale ('collect and sell') and which have cash flows that meet the SPPI criteria. An example would be where trade receivable invoices for certain customers were factored from time to time.\n- All movements in the fair value of these financial assets are taken through other comprehensive income, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue (including transaction costs by applying the effective interest method), gains or losses arising on de-recognition and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in the income statement. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative fair value gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the income statement.\n- - Equity investments where the Group has irrevocably elected to present fair value gains and losses on revaluation in other comprehensive income. The election can be made for each individual investment; however it is not applicable to equity investments held for trading.\n\nFair value gains or losses on revaluation of such equity investments, including any foreign exchange component, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When the equity investment is derecognised, there is no reclassification of fair value gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income to the income statement. Dividends are recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## (c) Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL)\n\nThis classification applies to the following financial assets. In all cases, transaction costs are immediately expensed to the income statement.\n\n- - Debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. The Group has a significant proportion of trade receivables with embedded derivatives for provisional pricing. These receivables are generally held to collect but do not meet the SPPI criteria and as a result must be held at FVPL. Subsequent fair value gains or losses are taken to the income statement. In addition, trade receivable invoices for certain customers which are routinely factored, in order to address credit risk and support value delivery through timelier realisation, are held at FVPL.\n- - Equity investments which are held for trading or where the FVOCI election has not been applied. All fair value gains or losses and related dividend income are recognised in the income statement.\n- - Derivatives which are not designated as a hedging instrument. All subsequent fair value gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (ii) Financial liabilities\n\nBorrowings and other financial liabilities (including trade payables but excluding derivative liabilities) are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe Group participates in supply chain finance arrangements whereby vendors may elect to receive early payment of their invoice from a third-party bank by factoring their receivable from Rio Tinto. These arrangements do not modify the terms of the original liability with respect to either counterparty terms, settlement date or amount due. Utilisation of the early settlement facility is voluntary and at the vendors' discretion on an invoice-by-invoice basis. Financial liabilities subject to supply chain finance therefore continue to be classified as trade payables. At 31 December 2021, trade payables included US$782 million (2020: US$551 million) subject to early settlement election by vendors.\n\nWhen the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial liability measured at amortised cost change as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, the Group updates the effective interest rate of the financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the reform (refer to page 220). A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:\n\n- - the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and\n- - the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.\n\nWhen changes are made to a financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group first updates the effective interest rate of the financial liability to reflect the change that is required by interest rate benchmark reform. After that, the Group applies the policies on accounting for modifications to the additional changes.",

The general approach incorporates a review for any significant increase in counterparty credit risk since inception. The ECL reviews include assumptions about the risk of default and expected loss rates. For trade receivables and receivables relating to net investment in finance leases, the assessment takes into account the use of credit enhancements, for example, letters of credit. Impairments for undrawn loan commitments are reflected as a provision.\n\n## (iv) Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group applies the hedge accounting requirements under IFRS 9 and its hedging activities are discussed in note 29 with movements on hedging reserves disclosed in note 28. Where applicable, the Group may defer the costs of hedging including currency basis spreads, forward points and the time value of options.\n\nPhase 1 amendments related to IBOR reform adopted in prior periods allowed temporary relief from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging arrangements directly impacted by the reform. Application of the temporary reliefs mean that IBOR reform does not result in termination of hedging relationships referencing an IBOR during the anticipated period of IBOR-related uncertainty. The principal relief which the Group has applied to its hedging portfolio is in the assumption that US LIBOR remains a separately identifiable component for the duration of the hedge; and the US LIBOR rates referenced by fixed-to-floating rate swaps in fair value hedge relationships do not change as the result of IBOR reform, preserving the economic relationship and allowing the related hedges to remain effective (refer to note 29 A (b) (v)). When the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the hedged item or hedging instrument changes as a result of IBOR reform and therefore there is no longer uncertainty arising about the cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument, the Group amends the hedge documentation of that hedging relationship to reflect the change(s) required by IBOR reform. These amendments in the formal hedge documentation do not constitute the discontinuation of the hedging relationship or the designation of a new hedging relationship, as prescribed by the reliefs of Phase 2 of the reform (refer to page 220).\n\n## (r) Share-based payment (note 41)\n\nThe fair value of the Group's share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with an offset to retained earnings for Rio Tinto plc plans and to other reserves for Rio Tinto Limited plans.\n\nThe Group uses fair values provided by independent actuaries calculated using either a lattice-based option valuation model or a Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe terms of each plan are considered at the balance sheet date to determine whether the plan should be accounted for as equity-settled or cash-settled. The Group does not operate any plans as cash-settled. However, the Performance Share Plan can, at the discretion of the directors, offer employees an equivalent amount in cash. This is not standard practice. In some jurisdictions, employees are granted cashsettled awards where equity-settled awards are prohibited by local laws and regulations. The value of these awards is immaterial.\n\nThe Group's equity-settled share plans are settled either by: the issuance of shares by the relevant parent company; the purchase of shares on market; or the use of shares held in treasury which were previously acquired as part of a share buy-back. If the cost of shares acquired to satisfy the plans differs from the expense charged, the difference is taken to retained earnings or other reserves, as appropriate.\n\n## (s) Share capital (notes 26 and 27)\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.\n\nWhere any Group company purchases the Group's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. If purchased Rio Tinto plc shares are cancelled, an amount equal to the nominal value of the cancelled share is credited to the capital redemption reserve.\n\n## (t) Segment reporting (notes 2 and 3)\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). The Group considers that Rio Tinto's Chief Executive is the CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.\n\n## Critical accounting policies and estimates\n\n(i) Determination of CGUs, assessment of indicators of impairment, review of asset carrying values, impairment charges and reversals and the recoverability of goodwill (notes\n\n## 6, 12 and 13)\n\nImpairment is assessed at the cash-generating unit (CGU) level. A CGU is the smallest identifiable asset or group of assets that generates independent cash inflows. Judgment is applied to identify the Group's CGUs, particularly when assets belong to integrated operations, and changes in CGUs could impact impairment charges and reversals. The most significant examples of this judgment are: in 2021, the continued grouping of Rio Tinto Fer et Titane in Quebec, Canada and QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) into a single CGU on the basis that they are vertically integrated operations with no active market for ilmenite; and in 2019, disaggregation of the Weipa bauxite mine and the downstream Gladstone alumina refineries (Yarwun and QAL) in Queensland, Australia into three separate CGUs on the basis of the ramp-up of the Amrun expansion at Weipa which increased bauxite exports such that the mine is now considered to generate largely independent cash inflows. Prior to 2019, the Weipa mine and Gladstone refineries were grouped into a single CGU. Management reviews these judgments on an annual basis as part of the annual internal review of asset values as described in note (i) above.\n\nExternal and internal factors are monitored for indicators of impairment and include an annual internal review of asset values as described in note (i) above. Judgment is required to determine whether the impact of adverse spot commodity price movements is significant and structural in nature. There were no material instances of this judgment resulting in an indicator of impairment as at 31 December 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2021 financial statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\nGenerally, discounted cash flow models are used to determine the recoverable amount of CGUs. In this case, significant judgment is required to determine the appropriate estimates and assumptions used and there is significant estimation uncertainty. In particular, for fair value less costs of disposal valuations, judgment is required to determine the estimates a market participant would use. The discounted cash flow model is most sensitive to the following estimates: the timing of project expansions; the cost to complete assets under construction; long-term commodity prices; production timing and recovery rates; exchange rates; operating costs; reserve and resource estimates; closure costs; discount rates; allocation of longterm contract revenues between CGUs; and, in some instances, the renewal of mining licences. Some of these variables are unique to an individual CGU. Future changes in these variables may differ from management's expectations and may materially alter the recoverable amounts of the CGUs.\n\nNote (i) above also describes the Group's methodology for estimating long-term commodity prices, exchange rates and discount rates for impairment testing purposes. Note 6 outlines the significant judgments, assumptions and sensitivities made for both measuring the impairments recorded and for determining whether reversal of part or all of a previous impairment was appropriate. Judgments, assumptions and sensitivities in relation to the testing of CGUs containing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are outlined in notes 12 and 13 respectively.\n\n## (ii) Estimation of asset lives\n\nIntangible assets are considered to have indefinite lives (and therefore no related depreciation or amortisation charge) if, in the Group's judgment, there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate cash flows. Factors that are considered in making this judgment include the existence of contractual rights for unlimited terms or evidence that renewal of the contractual rights without significant incremental costs can be expected for indefinite periods into the future in view of the Group's investment intentions. The most significant assessment of indefinite life applicable to intangible assets relates to contract based water rights in Canada acquired with Alcan, described further in note 13.\n\nThe useful lives of the major assets of a CGU are often dependent on the life of the orebody to which they relate. The life of the orebody will be determined on the basis of the life-of-mine plan which is based on the estimates of ore reserves as described on page 353.\n\nThe Group expects to spend an estimated US$7.5 billion between 2022 and 2030 on projects to lower carbon emissions from the Group's operations. This includes the replacement of diesel engines in heavy mobile equipment with electric power and investment in renewable power generating assets. The remaining useful economic life for fossil fuel powered assets is monitored closely for indicators of technological obsolescence, however in many instances the requirement for fossil fuel powered back-up means that early retirement of the assets is not practical (refer to note 14).\n\n## (iii) Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations (note 25)\n\nProvision is made for close-down, restoration and environmental costs when the obligation occurs, based on the net present value of estimated future costs required to satisfy the obligation. Management uses its judgment and experience to determine the potential scope of closure rehabilitation work required to meet the Group's legal, statutory and constructive obligations, and any other commitments made to stakeholders, and the options and techniques available to meet those obligations and estimate the associated costs and the likely timing of those costs. Significant judgment is also required to determine both the costs associated with that work and the other assumptions used to calculate the provision. External experts support the cost estimation process where appropriate but there remains significant estimation uncertainty.\n\nThe key judgment in applying this accounting policy is determining when an estimate is sufficiently reliable to make or adjust a closure provision.\n\nClosure provisions are not made for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the closure dates cannot be reliably estimated. This applies primarily to certain Canadian smelters which have indefinite-lived water rights or power agreements for renewable power sources with local governments.\n\nCost estimates are updated throughout the life of the operation; generally cost estimates must comply with the Group's Capital Project Framework once the operation is ten years from expected closure. This means, for example, that where an Order of Magnitude (OoM) study is required for closure it must be of the same standard as an OoM study for a new mine, smelter or refinery. As at 31 December 2021, there are 13 operations with remaining lives of under ten years before taking into account unapproved extensions. The largest reforecast currently underway is at Energy Resources of Australia; preliminary information available from this study resulted in an increase to closure liabilities for the Ranger Uranium mine of US$510 million at 31 December 2021.\n\nAdjustments are made to provisions when the range of possible outcomes becomes sufficiently narrow to permit reliable estimation. Depending on the materiality of the change, adjustments may require review and endorsement by the Group's Closure Steering Committee before the provision is updated.\n\nIn some cases, the closure study may indicate that monitoring and, potentially, remediation will be required indefinitely - for example ground water treatment. In these cases the underlying cash flows for the provision may be restricted to a period for which the costs can be reliably estimated, which on average is around 30 years. Where an alternative commercial arrangement to meet our obligations can be predicted with confidence, this period may be shorter.\n\nThe most significant assumptions and estimates used in calculating the provision are:\n\n- - Closure timeframes. The weighted average remaining lives of operations is shown in note 25. Some expenditure may be incurred before closure whilst the operation as a whole is in production.\n- - The length of any post-closure monitoring period. This will depend on the specific site requirements and the availability of alternative commercial arrangements; some expenditure can continue into perpetuity. The Rio Tinto Kennecott closure and environmental remediation provision includes an allowance for ongoing monitoring and remediation costs, including ground water treatment, of approximately US$0.6 billion.\n- - The probability weighting of possible closure scenarios. The most significant impact of probability weighting is at the Pilbara",

        "page_content": "operations (Iron Ore) relating to infrastructure and incorporates the expectation that some infrastructure will be retained by the relevant State authorities post closure. The assignment of probabilities to this scenario reduces the closure provision by US$1.2 billion.\n\n- - Appropriate sources on which to base the calculation of the discount rate. On 30 September 2020, management reviewed the rate used for discounting provisions and reduced the discount rate by 0.5% with no further changes required in 2021. The discount rate by nature is subjective and therefore sensitivities are shown in note 25 for how the provision balance, which at 31 December 2021 was US$14.5 billion, would change if discounted at alternative discount rates were applied.\n\nThere is significant estimation uncertainty in the calculation of the provision and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including:\n\n- - Changes to the relevant legal or local/national government requirements and any other commitments made to stakeholders;\n- - Review of remediation and relinquishment options;\n- - Additional remediation requirements identified during the rehabilitation;\n- - The emergence of new restoration techniques;\n- - Precipitation rates and climate change;\n- - Change in the expected closure date; and\n- - Change in the discount rate;\n\nExperience gained at other mine or production sites may also change expected methods or costs of closure, although elements of the restoration and rehabilitation of each site are relatively unique to a site. Generally, there is relatively limited restoration and rehabilitation activity and historical precedent elsewhere in the Group, or in the industry as a whole, against which to benchmark cost estimates.\n\nThe expected timing of expenditure can also change for other reasons, for example because of changes to expectations around ore reserves and mineral resources, production rates, renewal of operating licences or economic conditions.\n\nAs noted in note (l) above, changes in closure and restoration provisions for ongoing operations are usually capitalised and therefore will impact assets and liabilities but have no impact on profit or loss at the time the change is made. However, these changes will impact depreciation and the unwind of discount in future years. Changes in closure estimates at the Group's ongoing operations could result in a material adjustment to assets and liabilities in the next 12 months.\n\nChanges to closure cost estimates for closed operations, and changes to environmental cost estimates at any operation, would impact profit or loss; however, the Group does not consider that there is significant risk of a change in estimates for these liabilities causing a material adjustment to profit or loss in the next 12 months. Any new environmental incidents may require a material provision but cannot be predicted.\n\nProject specific risks are embedded within the cash flows which are based on a central case estimate of closure activities assuming that the obligation is fulfilled by the Group. These cash flows are then discounted using a discount rate specific to the class of obligations. The selection of appropriate sources on which to base the calculation of the discount rate requires judgment. The 1.5% real rate currently used by the Group is based on a number of inputs including observable historical yields on 30 year US Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), and consideration of findings by independent valuation experts.\n\n## (iv) Deferral of stripping costs (note 14)\n\nStripping of waste materials takes place throughout the production phase of a surface mine or pit. The identification of components within a mine and of the life of component strip ratios requires judgment and is dependent on an individual mine's design and the estimates inherent within that. Changes to that design may introduce new components and/or change the life of component strip ratios. Changes in other technical or economic parameters that impact ore reserves may also have an impact on the life of component strip ratios, even if they do not affect the mine's design. Changes to the life of component strip ratios are accounted for prospectively.\n\nThe Group's judgment as to whether multiple pit mines are considered separate or integrated operations determines whether initial stripping of a pit is deemed to be pre-production or production phase stripping and, therefore, the amortisation base for those costs. The analysis depends on each mine's specific circumstances and requires judgment: another mining company could make a different judgment even when the fact pattern appears to be similar.\n\n## (v) Uncertain tax positions\n\nThe Group operates across a large number of jurisdictions and is subject to periodic challenges by local tax authorities on a range of tax matters during the normal course of business, including transfer pricing, indirect taxes and transaction related issues.\n\nUncertain tax provisions include the related interest and penalties for all matters worldwide based on the Group's judgment of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability weighted average approach. The most significant judgments are in relation to transfer pricing matters. Whilst the potential outcomes are highly variable our current expectation is that there will be no material change to the amounts provided in the 12 months from 31 December 2021.\n\n## (vi) Recoverability of potential deferred tax assets (note 17)\n\nThe Group has tax losses and other deductible temporary differences, mainly in Australian, Canadian, US and Mongolian taxable entities, that have the potential to reduce tax payments in future years. Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that their recovery is probable, having regard to the availability of sufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity, the estimates of projected future taxable income of these taxable entities and after taking account of specific risk factors that are expected to affect the recovery of these assets including the risk of expiry of losses. Further information on deferred tax assets is given in note 17.\n\nIn addition to the risk of expiry of losses, the projections on which recovery of tax losses are based are subject to the same estimation uncertainty as noted in (i) above in relation to impairment. The key judgment in the application of this accounting policy is the recognition of deferred tax assets for losses where the operation is not currently profitable for tax purposes.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2021 financial statements\n\n## 1 Principal accounting policies continued\n\n## (vii) Provision for onerous contracts\n\nProvision for an onerous contract is made only when the assets dedicated to that contract are fully impaired or the contract becomes stranded as a result of a business decision. Judgment is required in determining which assets are considered dedicated to a contract when there is optionality as to how the contract obligations can be settled. Key estimates are the cash flows associated with the contract and the discount rate assumption. The Group completed the disposal of its remaining coking coal assets in 2018 and has retained the onerous provisions made in past periods for rail infrastructure 'take or pay' contracts which were considered stranded. As at 31 December 2021, the balance of the provision was US$172 million (2020: US$219 million). At 31 December 2021, the Group's investment in the Escondida Joint Venture included US$118 million share of provision relating to contractual payments under a power purchase agreement which became stranded in 2019 and was judged to be onerous upon early cancellation in favour of renewable energy sources.\n\n## (viii) Identification of functional currencies\n\nThe functional currency for each subsidiary, unincorporated arrangement, joint operation and equity accounted unit, is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. Determination of functional currency involves significant judgment and other companies may make different judgments based on similar facts. For many of Rio Tinto's businesses, their functional currency is the currency of the country in which they operate. The Group reconsiders the functional currency of its businesses if there is a change in the underlying transactions, events or conditions which determine their primary economic environment.\n\nThe determination of functional currency is a key judgment which affects the measurement of non-current assets included in the balance sheet and, as a consequence, the depreciation and amortisation of those assets included in the income statement. It also impacts exchange gains and losses included in the income statement and in equity. The Group applies judgment in determining whether settlement of certain intragroup loans is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future and therefore whether the associated exchange gains and losses can be taken to equity. During 2021, A$14 billion of intragroup loans continued to meet these criteria; associated exchange gains and losses are taken to equity.\n\n## (ix) Basis of consolidation (notes 32-35)\n\nJudgment is sometimes required to determine whether after considering all relevant factors, the Group has control, joint control or significant influence over an entity or arrangement. Significant influence includes situations of collective control (see note 35 (a)). Other companies may make different judgments regarding the same entity or arrangement. The most significant instance of such a judgment by the Group is in the determination that Escondida is a joint venture, based on the nature of significant commercial decisions, including capital expenditure, which require approval by both Rio Tinto and its partner BHP. In contrast our partner has assessed Rio Tinto's rights as protective and concluded that it controls Escondida through its rights to direct relevant activities. Adoption of the equivalent judgment by the Group would result in reclassification of Escondida from a joint venture to an associate, with no other financial reporting consequence since accounting under the equity method would remain in place.\n\n## (x) Contingencies (note 30)\n\nDisclosure is made of material contingent liabilities unless the possibility of any loss arising is considered remote based on the Group's judgment and legal advice. Contingent liabilities are quantified unless, in the Group's judgment, the amount cannot be reliably estimated.\n\nThe unit of account for claims is the matter taken as a whole and therefore when a provision has been recorded for the best estimate of the cost to settle the obligation there is no further contingent liability component. This means that when a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation from a single past event, a further contingent liability is not reported for the maximum potential exposure in excess of that already provided. We also consider the requirements of IAS 1 and provide disclosure when there is a significant risk the value of assets or liabilities could materially change within the next 12 months.\n\n## (xi) Exclusions from underlying earnings (note 2)\n\nAs set out in note 2 on page 239, certain items are excluded from net earnings/(loss) in arriving at underlying earnings in each period irrespective of materiality. In addition, there is a final judgmental category which includes, where applicable, other credits and charges that, individually or in aggregate if of a similar type, are of a nature or size to require exclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance. The specific items for the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019 to which exclusions apply are presented in note 2 on page 240.\n\nThe exclusion of closure estimates at Energy Resources of Australia and Gove Refinery were due to the magnitude of the individual updates and materiality when aggregated. This was the only application of the judgemental category in 2021.\n\n## (xii) Funding of Oyu Tolgoi\n\nAs described in note 32(l), Turquoise Hill, a 50.8% subsidiary of Rio Tinto, has funded common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi on behalf of Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC ('Erdenes'), a company controlled by the Mongolian government, which owns the 34% non-controlling interest in Oyu Tolgoi not owned by Turquoise Hill. Funded amounts earn interest at an annual effective rate of LIBOR plus 6.5% and are repayable via a pledge over Erdenes' share of future Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends; Erdenes also has the right to reduce the outstanding balance by making payments directly to Turquoise Hill.\n\nThese funding balances, including accrued interest, are expected to be recovered through the pledge over Erdenes' share of dividends from or sale by Erdenes of its interest in Oyu Tolgoi. The formal funding arrangement is with the non-controlling shareholder (Erdenes) in a partially owned subsidiary (Oyu Tolgoi). After considering these facts together with Erdenes' discretionary rights to repayment and the most probable method of eventual settlement, being the pledge over Erdenes dividends, we concluded that the funding balances and interest owing from Erdenes do not result in assets or income in the Group Financial Statements, representing instead a series of transactions with a non-controlling shareholder in a subsidiary. This results in an increase to the effective interest, in Oyu Tolgoi, attributable to owners of Rio Tinto while the funding balances and interest owing from Erdenes remain outstanding. Related amounts are therefore recorded as a reduction to the net carrying value of noncontrolling interests with a change in equity interest between Rio Tinto and non-controlling interests in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity for the Group's share of interest accrued on funding balances owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill in the period.",

As such these transactions, including the recording of interest within equity, do not result in any changes to Group cash flows, or separate presentation of cash inflows and outflows relating to common share investment in Oyu Tolgoi by either Turquoise Hill or Erdenes in the Group Cash Flow Statement\n\nOn 25 January 2022, the funding balances and interest owing from Erdenes were waived in full; refer to note 45.\n\n## (xiii) Pilbara Iron Arrangements\n\nThe arrangements described in note 33 (c) to the accounts permit each of the partners to the joint operation to request the other to construct assets on their tenure to increase the capacity of the rail and port infrastructure network. The requesting partner's (Asset User's) share of the capacity of the network will increase by the capacity of the newly constructed asset but, generally, that capacity may be provided from any of the network assets. The Asset User will pay an annual charge (Committed Use Charge - 'CUC') over a contractually specified period irrespective of usage of the network. The constructing partner (Asset Owner) has an ongoing obligation to make available capacity from those assets and to maintain the assets in good working order as required under relevant State Agreements and associated tenure.\n\nThe Group considered whether the CUC arrangements give rise to a lease between the Asset Owner and the Asset User. The conclusion that they do not is because there is no specified asset; rather the Asset User has a first priority right to the capacity in the CUC asset. This treatment was grandfathered on adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, following assessment under the preceding standards IAS 17 'Leases' and IFRIC 4 'Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease', with no change to the conclusion under IFRS 16 for subsequent expenditure subject to the existing CUC arrangements. Management considers that these arrangements are unique and has used judgment to apply the principles of IFRS to the accounting for the arrangements as described above. The obligation of the Asset Owner to make capacity available is fulfilled over time and not at a point in time. The CUC arrangement is therefore an executory contract as defined under IAS 37, whereby neither party has performed any of its obligations, or both parties have partially performed their obligations to an equal extent, and so the CUC payments are expensed as incurred. An alternative interpretation of the fact pattern could have resulted in a gross presentation in the Group's balance sheet with an asset and a corresponding liability to reflect the present value of the CUC payments. The Asset User is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, whereas the Asset Owner is a joint operation. This impact would be some US$1.4 billion (calculated on the basis of grossing up the tax written down value of the CUC assets). Other methods of calculating the gross up might give rise to different numbers.\n\n## (xiv) Estimation of obligations for post-employment costs (note 42)\n\nThe value of the Group's obligations for post-employment benefits is dependent on the amount of benefits that are expected to be paid out, discounted to the balance sheet date. The discount rate is a key assumption and is based upon the yields on high quality corporate bonds in the relevant currency which have durations consistent with the term of the obligations. The discount rate will vary from one period to another in line with movements in corporate bond yields, but at any given measurement date there is relatively little estimation uncertainty. This rate is also used to calculate the interest cost on obligations and interest income on plan assets.\n\nThe following key assumptions are used to calculate the estimated benefit: future pay increases to be received by members of final pay plans, the level of inflation (for those benefits that are subject to some form of inflation protection), current mortality rates and future improvements in mortality rates. The assumption regarding future inflation is based on market yields on inflation linked instruments, where possible, combined with consensus views. The Group reviews the actual mortality rates of retirees in its major pension plans on a regular basis and uses these rates to set its current mortality assumptions. It also uses its judgment with respect to allowances for future improvements in longevity having regard to standard improvement scales in each relevant country and after taking external actuarial advice.\n\nMost of the Group's defined benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants and the majority of the obligations relate to former employees. The carrying value of the Group's post-employment obligations is therefore less sensitive to assumptions about future salary increases than it is to assumptions regarding future inflation.\n\nDetails of the key assumptions, how they have moved since the previous balance sheet date and the sensitivity of the carrying value to changes in the assumptions are set out in note 42.",

Argyle Closure includes activity relating to the management and execution of the Argyle mine closure obligations and management of entities with interests in state and traditional owner agreements and licences. As a result of these changes, the Copper & Diamonds segment is renamed Copper and the Energy & Minerals segment is renamed Minerals from 2021. Other Operations, which also include our 100% interest in the Gove alumina refinery (in closure), Rio Tinto Marine, and the remaining legacy liabilities of Rio Tinto Coal Australia are separately shown from the above reportable segments as none of these operations met the quantitative thresholds to be reportable segments.\n\nThe financial information by business unit provided on pages 318 to 320 of these financial statements provides additional voluntary disclosure which the Group considers useful to the users of the financial statements.\n\n| Year ended 31 December 2021

Kitimat, Canada\n\nOn 3 December 2021, we announced completion of the newly-constructed wharf at Kitimat. Construction spend was incurred by LNG Canada and therefore a gain of US$336 million representing the estimated fair value of the cost of construction has been recorded and the carrying value of the Kitimat cash-generating unit (CGU) increased accordingly. Output from the smelter was reduced to 25% as a result of a workforce strike in mid-2021 and ramp-up to full capacity will extend through 2022. As a previously impaired CGU, and therefore carrying limited headroom, these factors were identified as conditions that could indicate that the uplifted carrying value may not be supportable and therefore the CGU was tested for impairment.\n\nThe recoverable amount for the Kitimat CGU has been calculated based on the IAS 36 'Impairment' fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) methodology by reference to the net present value of post-tax cash flows, expressed in real-terms and discounted at 6.6%. The recoverable amount of US$3,126 million is less than the carrying value of US$3,323 million resulting in a post-tax impairment charge of US$197 million, equivalent to US$269 million pre-tax. The overall adjustment to the carrying value of the property, plant and equipment at Kitimat from the gain on recognition of the wharf less the impairment charge is an increase of US$67 million.\n\nThe pricing data used to calculate net present value of cash flows is based on a blend of the three strategic pricing scenarios described in the climate change section of note 1. While keeping all other inputs constant, we have flexed the cash flows to reflect the carbon and commodity prices generated by the one scenario that we believe is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. The net present value of post-tax cash flows would have been US$58 million greater under this interpretation of Paris-aligned accounting (see note 1).\n\nTo illustrate the sensitivity of the recoverable amount, an increase in the discount rate by 50 basis points to 7.1% (post-tax real terms rate) would reduce the recoverable amount by US$180 million with all other valuation inputs remaining constant.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2021 financial statements\n\n## 6 Impairment charges net of reversals continued\n\n## Copper - Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia\n\nDevelopment of the Oyu Tolgoi underground progressed through 2021 at a slower pace than anticipated due to COVID-19 affecting staffing levels. Initiation of the caving process, known as the undercut, was expected to occur during 2021, however at 31 December 2021 the non-technical criteria for approval, including negotiations with the Government of Mongolia, remained ongoing and therefore this aspect of the construction was paused. On 30 December 2021 the Mongolian parliament approved Resolution 103 which indicated support for concessions offered by Rio Tinto during these negotiations, but introduced new funding constraints on the shareholders of Oyu Tolgoi LLC until first sustainable production. As a critical milestone in the development of the mine, we identified the delay to the undercut and consequential delay to production from the underground operations as being an impairment trigger and therefore assessed the recoverable amount of the project as at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the Oyu Tolgoi CGU has been prepared in accordance with the FVLCD methodology. It is based on forecast post-tax future cash flows over the life of mine of the open pit and underground reserves of Hugo North Lift 1 (HNL1) together with an estimate of future expansion potential to extract mineral resources from further underground developments and enlarged open pit. Mining of these mineral resources is subject to future investment decisions and comprises approximately 20% of the total value. These cash flows, expressed in real terms, have been discounted to present value using a project specific post-tax discount rate of 8%.\n\nThe development of HNL1 underground comprises three continuous sections. The initial development in 'Panel 0' is in the central section of the orebody with Panel 1 to the north and Panel 2 located to the south. Evaluation of mine plans for Panels 1 and 2 remain under study and are linked to the lateral development of project. To reflect the risk inherent in these aspects of the mine plan that are currently at the pre-feasibility study level of confidence, a risk adjustment factor of 10% has been applied to the net cash flows associated with years of the development of those sections of the underground mine.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the non-technical criteria for the undercut had not been satisfied and therefore, an adjustment to the underlying cash flows of the valuation model was made to weight the timing of the undercut between an immediate approval and the potential for a six-month delay.\n\nIn finalising the determination of a recoverable amount for the cash-generating unit, we considered the likely impact of elevated uncertainty on a market participant's perspective at the balance sheet date, in particular that arising from the incomplete status of negotiations and financing arrangements. Considerations included immediate funding requirements and the restrictions placed thereon in Resolution 103. To represent this uncertainty, a further judgmental reduction has been applied to the total net present value of cash flows from mining operations. After taking all of the above adjustments into account, the resulting recoverable amount almost equals the carrying value for the cash-generating unit of US$11.8 billion. Accordingly, management has determined that neither an impairment charge nor an impairment reversal is required.\n\nAs described in note 45, on 25 January 2022, Rio Tinto, Turquoise Hill Resources and the Government of Mongolia reached agreement to unanimously approve the commencement of underground operations. Through this agreement, the non-technical criteria for the undercut have been satisfied, including agreement over the pathway to funding the project to sustainable production. Underground mining operations have subsequently commenced. No hindsight has been applied in determining the appropriate valuation assumptions at 31 December 2021, however the timing and substance of the agreement reached was within the range of plausible outcomes considered in making this determination.\n\nThe pricing data used to calculate the net present value of cash flows is based on a blend of the three strategic pricing scenarios described in the climate change section of note 1. While keeping all other inputs constant, we have flexed the cash flows to reflect carbon and commodity prices under this one scenario that we believe is consistent with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. The net present value of post-tax cash flows would have been US$1.9 billion greater under this interpretation of Paris-aligned accounting (see note 1), assuming no changes to the ore mined (ie alternative economic grade cut-off is impractical to estimate, but higher prices could potentially result in more ore being mined and sold).\n\nTo further illustrate the sensitivity of the recoverable amount, an increase in the discount rate by 50 basis points to 8.5% (post-tax real terms rate) would reduce the recoverable amount by US$0.8 billion with all other valuation inputs remaining constant.\n\nThe funding of equity contributions to the project on behalf of Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi (Erdenes) by way of a carry account loan has been accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy in note 1 (xii). Additional information regarding these funding balances owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill and the impact on non-controlling interests is provided in note 32. On 25 January 2022, as part of a comprehensive package negotiated with the Government of Mongolia in order to approve commencement of underground operations, Turquoise Hill agreed to waive the full amount of funding balances and interest owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill. The waiver does not have an impact on the Group's assessment of impairment for either 2021 or 2022; refer to note 45.",

        "page_content": "## 2020 and 2019\n\n## Aluminium - Pacific Aluminium, Australia and New Zealand\n\nOn 9 July 2020, we announced the conclusion of the NZAS strategic review and gave Meridian Energy 14 months' notice for the termination of the power contract. As a result of the decision to wind-down operations an impairment trigger was identified. The net present value of post-tax cash flows over the remaining life for this CGU was negative and therefore the non-current assets of the smelter were fully impaired.\n\nHigh operating costs and challenging outlook for the aluminium industry also resulted in impairment triggers being identified at the Bell Bay aluminium smelter in Tasmania, Australia and at Boyne Smelter in Queensland, Australia at 30 June 2020. The forecast net present value of cash flows over the period to anticipated expiry in 2025 of a power contract with Hydro Tasmania was negative taking into account market conditions at the time. The property, plant and equipment of the Bell Bay smelter was therefore fully impaired. We determined the recoverable amount for our share of the Boyne Smelter CGU. which also includes the Gladstone Power Station. as US$273 million based on post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms and discounted at 6.6%. Accordingly our share of impairment after tax in the equity accounted unit was US$119 million (US$148 million pre-tax) related to the smelter and US$26 million (US$36 million pre-tax) related to the power station.\n\n## Aluminium - Sohar\n\nIn 2020, the challenging outlook for the Middle Eastern aluminium industry was identified as an impairment trigger at the Sohar aluminium smelter in Oman, an equity accounted unit of the Group.\n\nAt 30 September 2020, we determined the recoverable amount for our share of the Sohar CGU to be US$258 million based on post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms and discounted at 7.6%. Accordingly, our share of impairment after tax in the equity accounted unit was US$220 million.\n\n## Aluminium - ISAL smelter, Iceland\n\nOur announcement in February 2020 of a strategic review of the ISAL smelter in Iceland, combined with challenging market conditions, was identified as an impairment trigger at 30 June 2020. Subsequent restoration of smelter competitiveness resulting from improved power delivery terms represented an indicator of partial impairment reversal at 31 December 2020. We calculated a post-tax recoverable amount for the CGU of US$139 million at 31 December 2020 based on FVLCD, discounted using a post-tax rate of 6.6%. As a consequence, with full impairment of the CGU and a pre-tax impairment charge of US$204 million in the first half of 2020 followed by reversal of US$111 million to previously recorded pre-tax impairment in the second half of 2020, the full year results for the year ended 31 December 2020 included a net pre-tax impairment charge of US$93 million (2019: pre-tax impairment charge of US$109 million upon reclassification from assets held for sale).\n\n## Minerals (previously under Copper & Diamonds) - Diavik, Canada\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted global demand for diamonds, and in April 2020 our then joint venture partner in the Diavik 'Diamond Mine' filed for creditor protection and defaulted on cash calls. These circumstances were identified as an impairment trigger. The net present value of post-tax cash flows projected over the remaining life of the Diavik 'Diamond Mine' to 2025 did not support retaining any carrying value, resulting in the Group's 60% interest in plant and equipment and intangible assets of the CGU being fully impaired at 30 June 2020.\n\n## Copper (previously under Copper & Diamonds) - Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia\n\nOn 16 July 2019 we announced that the first sustainable production from the Oyu Tolgoi underground project could be delayed by 16 to 30 months compared with the original feasibility study guidance in 2016. We also announced that development capital spend for the project could increase materially. We identified these matters as an impairment trigger and prepared an assessment of the recoverable amount for the CGU at 30 June 2019 using a FVLCD model, as prescribed by IAS 36.\n\nAt 30 June 2019 we determined the post-tax recoverable amount to be US$8.3 billion using a real terms discount rate of 8.3%, this resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of US$2.2 billion (100% basis). The net adjustment to tax represented an increase to deferred tax assets of US$320 million for the temporary difference corresponding to the impairment and a decrease in deferred tax assets of US$359 million for tax losses that were expected to expire without utilisation.\n\nOn 16 December 2020 we confirmed completion of the Definitive Estimate detailing how Oyu Tolgoi underground would achieve sustainable production and selection of a preferred development option for the Oyu Tolgoi underground project. Development capital assumptions of US$6.75 billion and forecast sustainable production by October 2022 incorporated the impacts of COVID-19. This information was within the range of assumptions used to calculate the CGU's recoverable amount in the 2019 impairment test, and not indicative of an impairment loss in 2020.\n\n## Aluminium - Yarwun alumina refinery\n\nIn 2019, our annual impairment assessment of the Yarwun CGU resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of US$1,138 million to property, plant and equipment as a result of this CGU being assessed on a stand-alone basis for the first time and a 30% year-on-year reduction in the spot price of alumina to US$275/t at 31 December 2019.",

In arriving at FVLCD, a post-tax discount rate of 6.6% (2020: 6.6%) has been applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.

The water rights are expected to contribute to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of operations for the foreseeable future; accordingly, these rights are considered to have indefinite lives and are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. These water rights constitute the majority of the amounts in 'Contract based intangible assets'.\n- The remaining carrying value of the water rights of US$1,796 million as at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: US$1,798 million) relates wholly to the Quebec smelters cash-generating unit (CGU). The Quebec smelters CGU was tested for impairment by reference to FVLCD using discounted cash flows, which is in line with the policy set out in note 1(i). The recoverable amount of the Quebec smelters is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms have been estimated over the expected useful economic lives of the underlying smelting assets and discounted using a real post-tax discount rate of 6.6% (2020: 6.6%).\n\nThe recoverable amounts were determined to be significantly in excess of carrying value, and there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the remaining water rights to be impaired.\n\n- (c) Finite life intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate. Where amortisation is calculated on a straight line basis, the following useful lives have been determined:\n\nTrademarks, patented and non-patented technology:\n\n- - Trademarks: 14 to 20 years\n- - Patented and non-patented technology: ten to 20 years\n\nContract-based intangible assets:\n\n- - Power contracts/water rights: two to 45 years\n- - Other purchase and customer contracts: five to 15 years\n\n## Other intangible assets:\n\n- - Internally generated intangible assets and computer software: two to five years\n- - Other intangible assets: two to 20 years",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2021 financial statements\n\n## 14 Property, plant and equipment continued\n\n- (a) At 31 December 2021, the net book value of capitalised production phase stripping costs totalled US$2,432 million, with US$2,017 million within 'Property, plant and equipment' and a further US$415 million within 'Investments in equity accounted units' (2020: total of US$2,398 million, with US$2,019 million in 'Property, plant and equipment' and a further US$379 million within 'Investments in equity accounted units'). During the year, capitalisation of US$319 million was partly offset by depreciation of US$282 million (including amounts recorded within equity accounted units). Depreciation of deferred stripping costs in respect of subsidiaries of US$201 million (2020: US$145 million; 2019: US$139 million) is included within 'Depreciation for the year'.\n- (b) Adjustment on currency translation represents the impact of exchange differences arising on the translation of the assets of entities with functional currencies other than the US dollar, recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. The adjustment in 2021 arose from the weakening of the Australian dollar against the US dollar.\n- (c) Interest is capitalised at a rate based on the Group or relevant subsidiary's cost of borrowing or at the rate on project specific debt, where applicable. The Group's average borrowing rate used for capitalisation of interest is 3.40% (2020: 4.20%).\n- (d) Assets within operations for which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life shorter than the related mine are depreciated on a straight line basis as follows: Land and buildings:\n- - Land: not depreciated\n- - Buildings: five to 50 years\n\nPlant and equipment:\n\n- - Other plant and equipment: three to 50 years\n- - Power assets: refer to the table below\n- Capital work in progress: not depreciated\n- (e) During 2021, the impairment charge related to our Aluminium smelter at Kitimat, Canada. In 2020, impairment charges related to Pacific Aluminium smelters, the ISAL smelter in Iceland and our interest in the Diavik diamond mine (see note 6).\n- (f) 'Transfers and other movements' includes reclassifications between categories.\n- (g) Excludes assets held under capitalised lease arrangements. Non-current assets pledged as security represent amounts pledged as collateral against US$4,403 million (2020: US$4,518 million) of loans, which are included in note 21.\n\n## Useful economic lives of power generation assets\n\nThe group has committed to reducing scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 50% relative to our 2018 baseline by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions across our operations by 2050. Transitioning electricity from principally fossil fuel based power generating assets to principally renewables is critical to achieving that goal. The carrying value of power generating assets is set out in the table below. The weighted average remaining useful economic life of plant and equipment for fossil fuel based power generating assets is 14 years (2020:16 years). Given the technical limitations of intermittent renewable energy generation and energy storage systems, and our need for reliable baseload electricity, we expect our current generation assets will be required as an integral part of the total portfolio of generation assets for the foreseeable future. We are investing in research and development and evaluating new market options that can overcome these technical challenges. Should pathways for eliminating fossil fuel power generating assets be identified we may need to accelerate depreciation.\n\n|                | 2021                    | 2021                     | 2020                    | 2020                     |\n|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Net book value | Land and buildings US$m | Plant and equipment US$m | Land and buildings US$m | Plant and equipment US$m |\n| Fossil fuels   | 26                      | 952                      | 28                      | 1,048                    |\n| Renewables     | 195                     | 1,541                    | 202                     | 1,588                    |\n\n## Right-of-use assets - Leased\n\n|                                                             | Land and buildings US$m   | Plant and equipment US$m   | Total US$m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| Net book value                                              |                           |                            |              |\n| 31 December 2021                                            | 549                       | 585                        | 1,134        |\n| 31 December 2020                                            | 475                       | 400                        | 875          |\n| Additions for the year                                      |                           |                            |              |\n| 31 December 2021                                            | 135                       | 407                        | 542          |\n| 31 December 2020                                            | 30                        | 75                         | 105          |\n| Depreciation for the year (included within operating costs) |                           |                            |              |\n| 31 December 2021                                            | (81)                      | (251)                      | (332)        |\n| 31 December 2020                                            | (93)                      | (229)                      | (322)        |\n| Impairment charges (a)                                      |                           |                            |              |\n| 31 December 2021                                            | -                         | -                          | -            |\n| 31 December 2020                                            | (6)                       | (31)                       | (37)         |\n\n- (a) Impairment charges in 2020 relate to Pacific Aluminium smelters, the ISAL smelter in Iceland and our interest in the Diavik diamond mine (see note 6).\n\nThe leased assets of the Group comprise land and buildings (mainly office buildings) and plant and equipment, the majority of which are marine vessels. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions.

Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group's businesses estimate their respective costs based on current restoration standards, techniques and expected climate conditions.\n\nProvisions of US$14,542 million (2020: US$13,335 million) for close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations are based on risk-adjusted cash flows. The Group re-assessed the closure discount rate in the current year and continues to consider that real rate of 1.5%, applied prospectively since 30 September 2020, is the most appropriate rate to use. This assumption is based on the currency in which we plan to fund the closures and our expectation of long-term interest rate and exchange rate parity at the locations of our operations. Prior to 30 September 2020 and in recent years, the close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations were discounted at a real rate of 2.0%. To illustrate the sensitivity of the provision to discounting, if the discount rate at 31 December 2021 were decreased to 1.0% then the provision would be US$1.3 billion higher, of which approximately US$1.2 billion would be capitalised within 'Property, plant and equipment' at operating sites and US$0.1 billion would be charged to the income statement for non-operating and fully impaired sites. If the discount rate were increased to 3.0% then the provision would be US$2.8 billion lower, of which approximately US$2.5 billion would result in a decrease within 'Property, plant and equipment' at operating sites and US$0.3 billion would be credited to the income statement for non-operating and fully impaired sites.\n\n| Closure cost composition as at 31 December         | 2021  US$m   | 2020 US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Decommissioning, decontamination and demolition    | 3,343        | 3,131       |\n| Closure and rehabilitation earthworks  (a)         | 4,125        | 4,223       |\n| Long-term water management costs  (b)              | 967          | 966         |\n| Post closure monitoring and maintenance            | 1,676        | 1,318       |\n| Indirect costs, owners' costs and contingency  (c) | 4,431        | 3,697       |\n| Total                                              | 14,542       | 13,335      |\n\nThe underlying costs for closure have been estimated with varying degrees of accuracy based on a function of the age of the underlying asset and proximity to closure. For assets within ten years of closure, closure plans and cost estimates are supported by detailed studies which are refined as the closure date approaches. These closure studies consider climate change and plan for resilience to expected climate conditions with a particular focus on precipitation rates. For new developments, consideration of climate change and ultimate closure conditions are an important part of the approval process. For longer-lived assets, closure provisions are typically based on conceptual level studies that are refreshed at least every five years; these are evolving to incorporate greater consideration of forecast climate conditions at closure.\n\n| Geographic composition as at 31 December   | 2021  US$m   | 2020 US$m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Australia                                  | 7,605        | 7,076       |\n| USA                                        | 4,057        | 3,819       |\n| Canada                                     | 1,662        | 1,482       |\n| Rest of World                              | 1,218        | 958         |\n| Total                                      | 14,542       | 13,335      |\n\nThe geographic composition of the closure provision shows that our closure obligations are largely in countries with established levels of regulation in respect of mine and site closure.",

We do not seek to hedge this floating exposure and will re-float, where possible, any material price or rates that are fixed. Where this is impossible (or sub-optimal) any non-floating price risks are managed within defined market risk tolerances. Derivatives are used as and when required in order to manage our exposure in accordance with this underlying financial risk management principle.\n\nIn the paragraphs below, we summarise the risks that we are exposed to, and outline how our Treasury and Commercial teams manage these risks in accordance with agreed policies. These teams operate under a strong control environment, within approved limits. Our Board reviews and approves limits at least annually.\n\n## (i) Capital and liquidity risk\n\nOur overriding objective when managing capital and liquidity is to safeguard the business as a going concern. Capital is allocated in a consistent and disciplined manner, prioritising sustaining capital expenditure, followed by the ordinary dividend and then an iterative allocation between investing in compelling growth opportunities, maintaining balance sheet strength and delivering further returns to shareholders.\n\nOur Board and senior management regularly review the capital structure and liquidity of the Group. They take into account our strategic priorities, the economic and business conditions, and any identified investment opportunities, along with the expected returns to shareholders. We expect total cash returns to shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40-60% of underlying earnings in aggregate through the commodity cycle.\n\nWe consider various financial metrics when managing our risk, including net debt, gearing, the overall level of borrowings and their maturity profile, liquidity levels, total capital, future cash flows, underlying EBITDA and interest cover ratios.\n\nOur total capital as at 31 December was:\n\n| Total capital                                                              | Note   | 2021  US$m   | 2020 US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| Equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto (see Group balance sheet)       |        | 51,432       | 47,054      |\n| Equity attributable to non-controlling interests (see Group balance sheet) |        | 5,158        | 4,849       |\n| Net (cash)/debt                                                            | 23     | (1,576)      | 664         |\n| Total capital                                                              |        | 55,014       | 52,567      |\n\nOur net cash increased by US$2.2 billion to US$1.6 billion at 31 December 2021 from net debt of US$0.7 billion at 31 December 2020. This was driven by operating cash inflows, partially offset by capital expenditure and cash returns to shareholders during the year. At 31 December 2021 net gearing was (3)% (2020: 1%) and interest cover was 59 times (2020: 39 times).\n\nWe have access to various forms of financing including our US Shelf Programme, European Debt Issuance Programme, Commercial Paper and credit facilities. On 28 October 2021, we issued US$1.25 billion 30-year fixed rate SEC-registered bonds with a coupon of 2.75%. The proceeds of the new issuance were used to fund the early redemption and extinguishment of the company's US$1.20 billion 3.75% bonds due to mature in June 2025.\n\nOn 16 November 2021, Rio Tinto Finance plc and Rio Tinto Finance Limited completed the renewal of our US$7.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The facility is guaranteed by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited and has a five-year term, that now matures in November 2026. Other features include: two consecutive one-year extension options and a US$6.2 billion denominated same day access swing-line facility. The new facility replaced the US$7.5 billion dual tranche revolving credit facility dated 15 November 2013, last amended in November 2020. The facility remained undrawn throughout the year.\n\nOur credit ratings, as provided by Standard & Poor's and Moody's investor services, as at 31 December were:\n\n|                   | 2021          | 2020          |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Long-term rating  | A/A2          | A/A2          |\n| Short-term rating | A-1/P-1       | A-1/P-1       |\n| Outlook           | Stable/Stable | Stable/Stable |\n\nOur unified credit status is maintained through cross guarantees, which mean the contractual obligations of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are automatically guaranteed by the other.",

This will therefore not necessarily agree with the amounts disclosed as the carrying value.\n\n## Financial liability analysis\n\n| At 31 December 2021 (Outflows)/Inflows                | Within 1 year or on demand US$m   | Between 1 and 2 years US$m   | Between 2 and 3 years US$m   | Between 3 and 4 years US$m   | Between 4 and 5 years US$m   | After 5 years US$m   | Total US$m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|--------------|\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                  |                                   |                              |                              |                              |                              |                      |              |\n| Trade and other financial payables (a)                | (5,766)                           | (31)                         | (34)                         | (18)                         | (20)                         | (406)                | (6,275)      |\n| Expected lease liability payments                     | (361)                             | (266)                        | (174)                        | (133)                        | (93)                         | (704)                | (1,731)      |\n| Borrowings before swaps                               | (827)                             | (746)                        | (1,318)                      | (604)                        | (597)                        | (8,112)              | (12,204)     |\n| Expected future interest payments (a)                 | (511)                             | (486)                        | (460)                        | (439)                        | (414)                        | (3,485)              | (5,795)      |\n| Other financial liabilities                           | (20)                              | -

Agreements with derivative counterparties are based on the International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting agreements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting, but allow for the related amounts to be set-off in certain circumstances. During the year, there were no material amounts offset in the balance sheet.\n\n## (ii) Commodity price risk\n\nOur broad commodity base means our exposure to commodity prices is diversified. Our normal policy is to sell our products at prevailing market prices. Exceptions to this rule are subject to strict limits laid down by the Board, and to defined market risk tolerances and internal controls.\n\nWe sell our products to customers under contracts which vary in tenure and pricing mechanisms, including some volumes sold in the spot market. Sales revenue may be subject to adjustment if product specifications do not conform to the terms specified in a sales contract.\n\nPricing for iron ore is on a range of terms, the majority being either monthly or quarterly average pricing mechanisms. We sell a smaller proportion of iron ore volumes on the spot market.",

        "page_content": "We generally sell copper and aluminium under contracts which vary in tenure and pricing mechanisms, with some volumes sold in the spot market. The prices are determined by reference to prevailing market prices on terminal markets, such as the London Metal Exchange (LME) and the Commodities Exchange (COMEX) in New York. Prices fluctuate widely in response to changing levels of supply and demand but, in the long run, prices are related to the marginal cost of supply. Gold is also priced in an active market in which prices respond to daily changes in quantities offered and sought. Newly mined gold is only one source of supply; investment and disinvestment can be important elements of supply and demand.\n\nAt the date revenue is recognised, certain of our products are provisionally priced, based on the amount we expect to receive in the future. After initial recognition of revenue, we record any change in revenue relating to market prices separately in 'Other revenue' (refer to note 3). Substantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final prices at each reporting period. Final prices for copper concentrate, however, are normally determined between 30 and 180 days after delivery to our customer.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, we had 201 million pounds of copper sales, including share of equity accounted unit (31 December 2020: 261 million pounds), that were provisionally priced at US 436 cents per pound (2020: US 336 cents per pound). The final price of these sales will be determined during the first half of 2022. A 10% change in the price of copper realised on the provisionally priced sales, all other factors held constant, would increase or reduce net earnings by US$54 million (2020: US$58 million).\n\nFor some products, particularly aluminium, we are also exposed to fluctuations in power prices.\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nWe do not generally consider that using derivatives to fix commodity prices would provide a long-term benefit to our shareholders. However, for certain physical commodity transactions for which the price was fixed at the contract date, we enter into derivatives to achieve the prevailing market prices at the point of revenue recognition.\n\nTo mitigate our exposure to changes in the relationship between aluminium prices and power prices, we have a number of electricity purchase contracts which are directly linked to the daily official LME cash ask price for high grade aluminium ('LME price') and to the US Midwest Transaction Premium ('Midwest premium').\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, we apply hedge accounting to two embedded derivatives within our power contracts. The embedded derivatives (notional aluminium forward sales) have been designated as the hedging instrument. The forecasted aluminium sales, priced using the LME price and the Midwest premium, represent the hedged item.\n\nThe hedging ratio is 1:1, as the quantity of sales designated as being hedged matches the notional amount of the hedging instrument. The hedging instrument's notional amount, expressed in equivalent metric tonnes of aluminium, is derived from our expected electricity consumption under the power contracts as well as other relevant contract parameters.\n\nWhen we designate such embedded derivatives as the hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge, we recognise the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument in other comprehensive income, and it is accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve. The amount that is recognised in other comprehensive income is limited to the lesser of the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item, in absolute terms. On realisation of the hedges, realised amounts are reclassified from reserves to consolidated sales revenue in the income statement.\n\nWe recognise any ineffectiveness relating to the hedging relationship immediately in the income statement.\n\nSources of ineffectiveness include: differences in the timing of the cash flows between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, non-zero initial fair value of the hedging instrument, the existence of a cap on the Midwest premium in the hedging instrument and counterparty credit risk.\n\nWe held the following notional aluminium forward sales contracts embedded in the power contracts:\n\n| At 31 December 2021                    | Total   | Within 1 year   | Between 1  and 5 years   | Between 5  and 10 years   | After 10 years   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| Notional amount (in tonnes)            | 573,653 | 72,555          | 289,867                  | 211,231                   | -                |\n| Notional amount (in US$ millions)      | 1,377   | 162             | 683                      | 532                       | -                |\n| Average hedged rate (in US$ per tonne) | 2,401   | 2,234           | 2,355                    | 2,520                     | -                |\n| At 31 December 2020                    | Total   | Within 1 year   | Between 1  and 5 years   | Between 5  and 10 years   | After 10 years   |\n| Notional amount (in tonnes)            | 640,963 | 72,548          | 287,587                  | 280,828                   | -                |\n| Notional amount (in US$ millions)      | 1,522   | 159             | 663                      | 700                       | -                |\n| Average hedged rate (in US$ per tonne) | 2,375   | 2,189           | 2,305                    | 2,495                     | -                |",

The table below summarises the impact that changes in aluminium market prices have on aluminium forward and option contracts embedded in power supply agreements outstanding at 31 December 2021. Any change in price will result in an offsetting change in our future earnings.\n\n|                        | Change in market prices   | 2021  US$m   | 2020 US$m   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Effect on net earnings | +10 %                     | (78)         | (19)        |\n|                        | (10) %                    | 73           | 19          |\n| Effect on equity       | +10 %                     | (98)         | (98)        |\n| Effect on equity       | (10) %                    | 95           | 100         |\n\nWe exclude our 'own use contracts' from this sensitivity analysis as they are outside the scope of IFRS 9. Our business units continue to hold these types of contracts to satisfy their expected purchase, sale or usage requirements.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nWe are exposed to credit risk in our operating activities (primarily from customer trade receivables); and from our investing activities that primarily include government securities (primarily US Government), corporate and asset-backed securities, reverse re-purchase agreements, money market funds, and balances with banks and financial institutions. We are also exposed to credit risk arising from our interest rate and currency derivative contracts.\n\n## Credit risks related to receivables\n\nOur Commercial team manages customer credit risk subject to our established policy, procedures and controls. The team establishes credit limits for all of our customers. Where customers are rated by an independent credit rating agency, these ratings are used as a guide to set credit limits. Where there are no independent credit ratings available, we assess the credit quality of the customer through a credit rating model and assign appropriate credit limit. The Commercial team monitors outstanding customer receivables regularly and highlights any credit concerns to senior management. Receivables to high risk customers are often secured by letters of credit or other forms of credit enhancement.\n\nThe expected credit loss on our trade receivable portfolio is insignificant (see note 18).\n\n## Credit risk related to financial instruments and cash deposits\n\nOur Treasury team manages credit risk from our investing activities in accordance with a Board-approved credit risk framework which sets the risk appetite. Our Board reviews this annually. We make investments of surplus funds only with approved investment grade (BBB- and above) counterparties who have been assigned specific credit limits. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of credit risk and therefore mitigate the potential for financial loss through counterparty failure.",

The US dollar, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar are the most important currencies influencing our costs. In any particular year, currency fluctuations may have a significant impact on our financial results. A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies in which our costs are partly denominated has a positive effect on our underlying earnings. However, a strengthening of the US dollar reduces the value of non-US dollar denominated net assets, and therefore total equity.\n\nOur external borrowings and cash are mainly denominated in US dollars, either directly or through the use of derivatives, as we consider the US dollar the most appropriate currency for financing our operations.\n\nIn most cases our debt and other financial assets and liabilities, including intragroup balances, is held in the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. There are instances where these balances are held in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. This means we recognise exchange gains and losses in our income statement (except where they can be taken to equity) as these balances are translated into the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. Our income statement also includes exchange gains and losses arising on US dollar net debt and intragroup balances. On consolidation, these balances are retranslated to our US dollar presentation currency and there is a corresponding and offsetting exchange difference recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. There is no impact on total equity.\n\nThe table below summarises, by currency, our net cash/(debt), after taking into account relevant cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts:\n\n| Net cash/(debt) by currency   | Total borrowings excluding overdrafts US$m   | Lease  liabilities US$m   | Derivatives related to net debt US$m   | Cash and cash equivalents US$m   | Other investments US$m   | Net cash/ (debt) 2021 US$m   | Net cash/ (debt) 2020 US$m   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| US dollar                     | (11,707)                                     | (410)                     | (101)                                  | 12,018                           | 2,401                    | 2,201                        | (141)                        |\n| Australian dollar             | (282)                                        | (493)                     | -                                      | 276                              | -                        | (499)                        | (286)                        |\n| Canadian dollar               | (172)                                        | (192)                     | -                                      | 44                               | -                        | (320)                        | (333)                        |\n| South African rand            | -                                            | (3)                       | -                                      | 118                              | -                        | 115                          | 140                          |\n| Other                         | (5)                                          | (265)                     | -                                      | 349                              | -                        | 79                           | (44)                         |\n| Total                         | (12,166)                                     | (1,363)                   | (101)                                  | 12,805                           | 2,401                    | 1,576                        | (664)                        |\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nUnder normal market conditions, we do not consider that active currency hedging of transactions would provide long-term benefits to shareholders. We review our exposure on a regular basis and will undertake hedging if deemed appropriate. We may deem currency protection measures appropriate in specific commercial circumstances. Capital expenditures and other significant financial items such as acquisitions, disposals, tax and dividend cash flows may be economically hedged subject to strict limits laid down by the Board.

We deem 10% to be the annual exchange rate movement that is reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run) for any of our significant currencies and therefore an appropriate representation.\n\nWe calculate sensitivities in relation to the functional currencies of our individual entities. We translate the impact of these on net earnings and underlying earnings into US dollars at the exchange rates on which the sensitivities are based. The impact to net earnings associated with a 10% weakening of a particular currency, shown below, is broadly offset within equity through movements in the currency translation reserve and therefore generally has no impact on our net assets. The offsetting currency translation movement is not shown in the table below. The impact is expressed in terms of the effect on net earnings, underlying earnings, and equity, assuming that each exchange rate moves in isolation. The sensitivities are based on financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2021, where balances are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or joint operation, and exclude financial assets and liabilities held by equity accounted units. These balances will not remain constant throughout 2021, and therefore the following information should be used with care.\n\n## At 31 December 2021\n\nGains/(losses) associated with 10% strengthening of the US dollar\n\n| Currency exposure   |   Closing exchange rate US cents | Effect on net earnings US$m   | Of which amount impacting underlying earnings US$m   | Impact  directly on equity US$m   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Australian dollar   |                               73 | 379                           | (18)                                                 | (1,044)                           |\n| Canadian dollar     |                               78 | (111)                         | (3)                                                  | -                                 |\n\n## At 31 December 2020\n\nGains/(losses) associated with 10% strengthening of the US dollar\n\n| Currency exposure   |   Closing exchange rate US cents | Effect on net earnings US$m   | Of which amount impacting underlying earnings US$m   | Impact directly on equity US$m   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Australian dollar   |                               77 | 625                           | (11)                                                 | (1,105)                          |\n| Canadian dollar     |                               78 | (167)                         | 6                                                    | -                                |\n\n## (v) Interest rate risk\n\nOur interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating interest rates. The approach to floating rate borrowing is based upon; i) the lower cost of borrowing historically observed from maintaining a floating rate exposure and ii) the historical correlation between interest rates and commodity prices. In certain circumstances, we may elect to maintain a higher proportion of fixed-rate funding.\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nWe enter into interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate exposure from our fixed rate borrowings, and review these positions on a regular basis. The tenor of the interest rate swaps is sometimes shorter than the tenor of the bond which means, we remain exposed to long term fixed rate funding. In 2020 we entered into US$1.5 billion of interest rate swaps with a tenor of five years to hedge the Alcan bonds which had been historically held at fixed rates. In 2021, we issued a 30-year US$1.25 billion bond which was swapped to floating rates for a tenor of seven years. As interest rate swaps mature, new medium dated swaps are generally transacted to maintain this floating rate exposure. The economic characteristics of the interest rate swaps are shown in the table below.\n\nThe interest rates swaps transacted in 2020 and 2021, were designated into fair value hedge relationships with the respective tranches of debt. For the fair value movements, in relation to all of our fair value hedged items and instruments, refer to note 8.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, US$6.0 billion (2020: US$5.9 billion) US dollar notional fixed-rate US dollar borrowings continue to be swapped to floating US dollar rates and \u20ac417 million (2020: \u20ac417 million) euro notional fixed-rate borrowings continue to be fully swapped to floating US dollar interest rates at an effective exchange rate of 1.3105. These swaps are designated in fair value hedge relationships.\n\nSince 2012, we have also held cross-currency interest rate swaps to convert the principal and annual fixed interest coupons of the Rio Tinto Finance plc \u00a3500 million Sterling Bond to a US dollar notional with fixed US dollar annual interest coupons. We applied cash flow hedge accounting to this relationship to limit our US dollar cash flow exposure on the principal and interest payments. The hedge was fully effective in the 2021 and 2020 financial years as the notional amount, maturity, payment and reset dates match.",

These are included within 'Other financial assets' and 'Other financial liabilities' in the balance sheet.\n\nThe main sources of ineffectiveness of the fair value hedges include changes in the timing of the cash flows of the hedging instrument compared to the underlying hedged item, and changes in the credit risk of parties to the hedging relationships. Refer to note 8 for the changes in fair value of the bonds and the swaps as well as the ineffectiveness recognised in the period. Refer to note 1 'New standards Issued not yet effective' for the impacts of IBOR reform.\n\nTaking into account the interest and currency interest rate swaps, at 31 December 2021, US$11.6 billion (2020: US$11.7 billion) of our adjusted gross borrowings were at floating rates. This has resulted in a floating to fixed debt ratio of 85% floating to 15% fixed (2020: 86% floating to 14% fixed). Our weighted average debt maturity was approximately 11 years (2020: nine years) based on current interest rates and the carrying value of gross borrowings at the year end.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nBased on our floating rate financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2021, the effect on our net earnings of a 100 basis point increase in US dollar LIBOR or SOFR (where applicable) interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would be an income of US$13 million (2020: expense of US$7 million), reflecting the net cash position in 2021 compared to a net debt position in prior year. We have an exposure to interest rate volatility within shareholders' equity arising from fair value movements on derivatives in the cash flow hedge reserve. These derivatives have an underlying exposure to sterling and US dollars. With all factors remaining constant, and based on the composition of derivatives impacting the cash flow reserve at 31 December 2021, the sensitivity of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates in each of the currencies in isolation would impact equity, before tax, by a charge of US$55 million (2020: US$68 million charge) for sterling and a credit of US$65 million (2020: US$78 million credit) for US dollars. A 100 basis point decrease would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.",

We use different valuation inputs for the pre-and post-completion phases to reflect Rio Tinto's completion support guarantee during the pre-completion phase. To measure the fair value of the project finance pre-completion our valuation input includes market yield over the pre-completion period, the variability of which we consider a reasonable indicator of fair value movements on amounts outstanding under the project finance facility. Post-completion, we estimate the fair value with reference to the annual interest rate on each tranche of the facility, and after considering factors that could indicate a change in the credit assessment of Oyu Tolgoi LLC as a counterparty to project finance. These factors include in-country risk relating to the Oyu Tolgoi project, and the assumed date of transition from pre-completion to post-completion. These valuation inputs are considered to be level 3. Transition from pre-completion to post-completion is determined by a set of tests for both completion of physical infrastructure and the ability to extract and process ore of defined grades over a defined period.\n\nOur remaining borrowings have a fair value measured by discounting estimated cash flows with an applicable market quoted yield, and are categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## C (a) Valuation hierarchy\n\nThe tables below show the financial instruments by fair value measurement method in accordance with IFRS 13 at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020.\n\n|                                                                                   |      |            | Held at fair value   | Held at fair value   | Held at fair value   |                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2021                                                               | Note | Total US$m | Level 1 (a) US$m     | Level 2 (b) US$m     | Level 3 (c) US$m     | Held at  amortised  cost US$m |\n| Assets                                                                            |      |            |                      |                      |                      |                               |\n| Cash and cash equivalents (d)                                                     |      | 12,807     | 4,138                | -

In 2021 and 2020, changing the level 3 inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly, taking into account the expected remaining term of contracts. The fair value of our level 3 aluminium embedded derivatives is US$146 million at 31 December 2021 (2020: US$126 million).\n\nWe also have receivables, with a carrying value of US$136 million (2020: US$113 million), that relate to royalties arising from the sale of coal from our previously divested businesses. These are classified as 'Other investments', including loans within 'Other financial assets'. The fair values are determined using level 3 unobservable inputs. This royalty receivable includes US$53 million from forecast production beyond 2030. This has not been adjusted for potential changes in production rates that could occur due to climate change targets impacting the operator.\n\nThe main unobservable input is the long-term coal price used over the life of the royalty receivable. A 15% increase in the coal spot price would result in a US$63 million increase (2020: US$198 million increase) in the carrying value. A 15% decrease in the coal spot price would result in a US$53 million decrease (2020: US$46 million decrease) in the carrying value. We have used a 15% assumption to calculate our exposure as it represents the annual coal price movement that we deem to be reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run).\n\n## 30 Contingencies and commitments\n\n|                                                                                      | 2021  US$m   | 2020 US$m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Capital commitments excluding the Group's share of joint venture capital commitments |              |             |\n| Within 1 year                                                                        | 2,324        | 3,021       |\n| Between 1 and 3 years                                                                | 116          | 97          |\n| Between 3 and 5 years                                                                | 38           | -           |\n| After 5 years                                                                        | 73           | 34          |\n| Total                                                                                | 2,551        | 3,152       |\n| Group's share of joint venture capital commitments                                   |              |             |\n| Within 1 year                                                                        | 11           | 9           |\n| Between 1 and 3 years                                                                | -            | -           |\n| Total                                                                                | 11           | 9           |",

It does not include the estimated incremental capital expenditure relating to decarbonisation projects referred to in the climate section earlier. On a legally enforceable basis, capital commitments would be approximately US$1.1 billion (2020: US$1.5 billion) as many of the contracts relating to the Group's projects have various cancellation clauses.\n\n## Other Commitments\n\nOn 21 December 2021, the Group entered into a binding agreement to acquire the Rincon lithium project in Argentina for US$825 million. The transaction will be treated as an asset purchase. Completion, expected in 2022, is subject to regulatory approval in Australia.\n\n## Unrecognised commitments to contribute funding or resources to joint ventures\n\nWe have a commitment to purchase and market a portion (in excess of the Group's ownership interest) of the output of Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C., an aluminium smelter in which the Group is a joint venture partner. The Group immediately sells the purchased products to third parties.\n\nAlong with the other joint venture partners, we have commitments to provide emergency funding (ie funding required to preserve the life or assets of the company or to comply with applicable laws) if required by Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C., subject to approved thresholds.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, Minera Escondida Ltda held an undrawn shareholder line of credit for US$225 million (Rio Tinto share) (31 December 2020: US$225 million). The current facility will mature in September 2022.\n\n## Purchase obligations\n\nThe aggregate amount of future payment commitments under purchase obligations outstanding at 31 December was:\n\n|                       | 2021  US$m   | 2020 US$m   |\n|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Within 1 year         | 3,483        | 3,100       |\n| Between 1 and 2 years | 1,660        | 1,715       |\n| Between 2 and 3 years | 1,345        | 1,291       |\n| Between 3 and 4 years | 1,080        | 1,242       |\n| Between 4 and 5 years | 1,020        | 848         |\n| After 5 years         | 7,125        | 8,437       |\n| Total                 | 15,713       | 16,633      |\n\nPurchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding agreements to buy goods or services. They specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased or consumed; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.\n\nPurchase obligations for goods mainly relate to purchases of raw materials and consumables and purchase obligations for services mainly relate to charges for the use of infrastructure, commitments to purchase power and freight contracts. These goods and services are expected to be used in the business. To the extent that this changes, a provision for onerous obligations may be made as described in note 1- critical policy (vii).\n\nPurchases from joint arrangements or associates are included if the quantity purchased is in excess of our ownership interest in the entity. However, purchase obligations exclude contracted purchases of bauxite, alumina and aluminium from joint arrangements and associates and contracted purchases of alumina from third parties. This is because these purchases are made for commercial reasons and the Group is, overall, a net seller of these commodities.\n\nAs described above, we also have a commitment to buy and market a portion (in excess of our ownership interest) of the output of Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C.\n\n## Contingent liabilities (subsidiaries and joint operations)\n\n|                                                                             |   2021  US$m |   2020 US$m |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Contingent liabilities, Indemnities and other performance guarantees (a)(b) |          441 |         146 |\n\nThe Group has not established provisions for certain additional legal claims in cases where we have assessed that a payment is either not probable or cannot be reliably estimated. A number of Group companies are, and will likely continue to be, subject to various legal proceedings and investigations that arise from time to time. As a result, the Group may become subject to substantial liabilities that could affect our business, financial position and reputation. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgments may at times occur. The Group may incur, in the future, judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could lead to material cash outflows. We do not believe that any of these proceedings will have a materially adverse effect on our financial position.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2021 financial statements\n\n## 30 Contingencies and commitments continued\n\n## Contingent liabilities - not quantifiable\n\nThe current status of the following contingent liabilities means it is not practicable to provide a reliable estimate of possible financial exposure:\n\n## Litigation disputes\n\nIn October 2017, Rio Tinto announced that it had been notified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that the SEC had filed a complaint in relation to Rio Tinto's disclosures and timing of the impairment of Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM). The impairment was reflected in Rio Tinto's 2012 year-end accounts. The SEC alleges that Rio Tinto, a former chief executive, Tom Albanese, and a former chief financial officer, Guy Elliott, committed violations of the antifraud, reporting, books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities law by not accurately disclosing the value of RTCM and not impairing it when Rio Tinto published its 2011 year-end accounts in February 2012 or its 2012 interim results in August 2012. In June 2019, the trial court dismissed an associated US class action on behalf of securities holders. In August 2020, the appeals court partially overturned the court's dismissal and the case is with the trial court for further consideration.\n\nIn March 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) filed civil proceedings in the NSW District Registry of the Federal Court of Australia against Rio Tinto Limited, Albanese, and Elliott. On 1 May 2018, ASIC expanded its proceedings. ASIC alleges that Rio Tinto committed violations of the disclosure, accounting, and misleading or deceptive conduct provisions of the Corporations Act by making misleading or deceptive statements related to RTCM in its 2011 Annual Report and its 2012 interim financial statements, not complying with accounting standards in respect of its 2012 interim financial statements, and not disclosing an impairment of RTCM in its 2012 interim financial statements. ASIC further alleges Albanese and Elliott breached their duties as directors or officers, and failed to take all reasonable steps to comply with relevant accounting requirements.\n\nRio Tinto believes that the SEC case and the ASIC proceedings are unwarranted and will defend the allegations vigorously. Hence, no provisions have been recognised for these cases.\n\nRio Tinto continues to co-operate fully with relevant authorities in connection with their investigations in relation to contractual payments totalling US$10.5 million made to a consultant who had provided advisory services in 2011 on the Simandou project in Guinea. In August 2018, the court dismissed a related US class action commenced on behalf of securities holders. No provision has been recognised for this case.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the outcomes of these matters remained uncertain, but they could ultimately expose the Group to material financial cost. The Board is giving these matters its full and proper attention and a dedicated Board committee continues to monitor the progress of these matters, as appropriate.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group is in the process of modernising agreements with Traditional Owner groups as outlined in our response to the Juukan Gorge incident. We have provided for our best estimate of historical claims; however, the process is incomplete and it is possible that further claims could arise relating to past events.\n\nAs described in note 1(l), close-down and restoration provisions are not recognised for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the date of closure cannot be reliably estimated. This applies primarily to Canadian aluminium smelters which are not dependent upon a specific orebody and have access to indefinite-lived power from owned hydro-power stations with water rights permitted by local governments. In these instances a closure obligation may exist at the reporting date; however, due to the indefinite nature of asset lives it is not possible to arrive at a sufficiently reliable estimate for the purposes of recognising a provision. Close-down and restoration provisions are recognised at these operations for separately identifiable closure activities which can be reasonably estimated, such as the demolition and removal of fixed structures after a pre-determined period. Any contingent liability for these assets will crystallise into a closure provision if and when a decision is taken to cease operations.\n\n## Guarantees by parent companies\n\nRio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the following securities issued by the following 100% owned finance subsidiaries: US$4.4 billion (31 December 2020: US$4.4 billion) Rio Tinto Finance (USA) Limited and Rio Tinto Finance (USA) plc bonds with maturity dates up to 2051; and US$1.1 billion (31 December 2020: US$1.2 billion) on the European Debt Issuance Programme. In addition, Rio Tinto Finance plc and Rio Tinto Finance Limited have entered into facility arrangements for an aggregate amount of US$7.5 billion (31 December 2020: US$7.5 billion). The facilities are guaranteed by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nRio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders. At 31 December 2021, US$4.3 billion of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility (2020: US$4.3 billion). Oyu Tolgoi LLC is jointly owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the Government of Mongolia, and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (66%, of which Rio Tinto owns 51%). The project finance has been raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the completion of the underground mine according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility.\n\nThe Rio Tinto guarantee applies to the extent that Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd cannot satisfy Oyu Tolgoi LLC's project finance debt servicing obligations under its own guarantee to the lenders, called the sponsor debt service undertaking (DSU). Both the CSU and DSU contain a carve-out for certain political risk events.\n\n## Contingent assets\n\nThe Group has, from time to time, various insurance claims outstanding with reinsurers.",

Refer to note 44 for a list of related undertakings.\n\nThe Group's principal subsidiaries are mostly held by intermediate holding companies and not directly by Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n- (a) Robe River Mining Co Pty Ltd (which is 60% owned by the Group) holds a 30% interest in Robe River Iron Associates (Robe River). North Mining Ltd (which is wholly owned by the Group) holds a 35% interest in Robe River. Through these companies the Group recognises a 65% share of the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of Robe River, with a 12% non-controlling interest. The Group therefore has a 53% beneficial interest in Robe River.\n- (b) Alcan Alumina Ltda holds the Group's 10% interest in Cons\u00f3rcio De Alum\u00ednio Do Maranh\u00e3o, a joint operation in which the Group participates but is not a joint operator. The Group recognises its share of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to this arrangement.\n- (c) Iron Ore Company of Canada is incorporated in the US, but operates in Canada.",

The liabilities of the arrangements are in substance satisfied by cash flows received from the parties; this dependence indicates that the parties in effect have obligations for the liabilities. It is these facts and circumstances that give rise to the classification of these entities as joint operations.",

The transaction did not meet the definition of a business combination and therefore the incremental assets and liabilities were treated as an asset purchase. Prior to purchase the Group recognised its existing 60% share of assets, revenues and expenses, with liabilities recognised according to its contractual obligations, and a corresponding 40% receivable or contingent asset representing the co-owner's share where applicable. Receivables relating to the co-owner's share were derecognised and treated as part of the net purchase consideration on completion.\n\nOn 21 December 2021, the Group entered into a binding agreement to acquire the Rincon lithium project in Argentina for US$825 million. The Rincon lithium project does not meet the definition of a business as defined by IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' and the transaction will be treated as an asset purchase; completion is subject to regulatory approval in Australia.\n\n## Disposals\n\nWe have made no material disposals in 2021 or 2020.\n\nOn 16 July 2019 we disposed of our entire 68.62% interest in R\u00f6ssing Uranium to China National Uranium Corporation Limited for gross cash proceeds of US$6.5 million. After adjusting for cash held on R\u00f6ssing's balance sheet at the date of disposal and included in the sale, we reported a net cash outflow of US$118 million and recognised a loss on disposal of US$289 million. This includes cumulative currency translation losses of US$212 million recycled from the currency translation reserve on sale of the business.\n\n## 37 Directors' and key management remuneration\n\nAggregate remuneration, calculated in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006, of the directors of the parent companies was as follows:\n\n|                                                   | 2021 US$'000   | 2020 US$'000   | 2019 US$'000   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Emoluments                                        | 6,568          | 6,686          | 7,524          |\n| Long-term incentive plans                         | 1,587          | 8,974          | 4,748          |\n|                                                   | 8,155          | 15,660         | 12,272         |\n| Pension contributions: defined contribution plans | 9              | 29             | 42             |\n| Gains made on exercise of share options           | -              | -              | -              |\n\nThe Group defines key management personnel as the directors and certain members of the Executive Committee, as described on page 171. The Executive Committee comprises the executive directors, product group chief executive officers and Group executives.

The aggregate pension contribution to defined contribution plans was US$nil (2020: US$nil; 2019: US$nil).\n\nDuring 2021, no director (2020:nil; 2019:nil) accrued retirement benefits under defined benefit arrangements, and two directors (2020: two; 2019: two) accrued retirement benefits under defined contribution arrangements.\n\nEmoluments included in the table above have been translated from local currency at the average exchange rate for the year with the exception of bonus payments, which have been translated at the year-end rate.\n\nDetailed information concerning directors' remuneration, shareholdings and options is shown in the Remuneration Report, including tables 1 to 3, on pages 160 to 198.",

These awards are settled in equity.\n\n## Equity Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2018, shareholders approved the introduction of the Rio Tinto 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 'EIP'). From 2018, all long-term incentive awards have been granted under this umbrella plan which allows for awards in the form of Performance Share Awards (PSA), Management Share Awards (MSA) and Bonus Deferral Awards (BDA) to be granted.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2021 financial statements\n\n## 41 Share-based payments continued\n\n## Performance Share Awards (Performance Share Plans prior to 2018)\n\nParticipants are generally assigned shares in settlement of their PSA on vesting and therefore the awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions, including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting.\n\nFor the parts of awards with Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance conditions, the fair value of the awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking into account the TSR performance conditions. One third of the awards granted up to 2017 (inclusive) are subject to an earnings margin performance target relative to ten global mining comparators. As this is a non-market related performance condition, under IFRS 2, the fair value recognised is reviewed at each accounting date based on the directors' expectations for the proportion vesting. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2020: 5% per annum).\n\nFor grants made from 2018, the earnings margin performance target applying to the PSA was removed and instead all of the awards are subject to the TSR performance conditions set out in the Remuneration Report.\n\n## Management Share Awards (Management Share Plans prior to 2018)\n\nThe vesting of these awards is dependent on service conditions being met; no performance conditions apply. In general, the awards will be settled in equity, including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting and therefore the awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.\n\nThe fair value of each award on the day of grant is equal to the share price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 7% per annum of outstanding awards (2020: 7% per annum).\n\n## Bonus Deferral Awards (Bonus Deferral Plans prior to 2018)\n\nBonus Deferral Awards (BDA) provide for the mandatory deferral of 50% of the bonuses for executive directors and Executive Committee members and 25% of the bonuses for other executives.\n\nThe vesting of these awards is dependent only on service conditions being met. In general, the awards will be settled in equity including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting and therefore the awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions. The fair value of each award on the day of grant is equal to the share price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 3% per annum of outstanding awards (2020: 3% per annum).\n\n## Global Employee Share Plans\n\nThe Global Employee Share Plans were introduced in 2012 and re-approved by shareholders in 2021. Under these Plans, the companies provide a matching share award for each investment share purchased by a participant. The vesting of these matching awards is dependent on service conditions being met and the continued holding of investment shares by the participant until vesting. These awards are settled in equity including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting. The fair value of each matching share on the day of grant is equal to the share price on the date of purchase less a deduction of 15% for estimated cancellations (caused by employees electing to withdraw their investment shares before vesting of their matching shares). Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2020: 5% per annum).\n\nThe Management Share Awards, Performance Share Awards, Bonus Deferral Awards, Equity Incentive Plan, Global Employee Share Plans and UK Share Plan together represent 100% (2020: 100%) of the total IFRS 2 charge for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited plans in 2021.\n\n## Performance Share Awards (granted under either the Performance Share Plans or the Equity Incentive Plans)\n\nRio Tinto plc awards\n\nRio Tinto Limited awards\n\n|                                | 2021 number   |   Weighted average fair value at grant date 2021 \u00a3 | 2020 number   |   Weighted average fair value at grant date 2020 \u00a3 | 2021 number   |   Weighted average fair value at grant date 2021 A$ | 2020 number   |   Weighted average fair value at grant date 2020 A$ |\n|--------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Unvested awards at 1 January   | 3,778,041     |                                              21.01 | 3,803,394     |                                              22.2  | 1,391,373     |                                               44.4  | 1,636,517     |                                               45.11 |\n| Awarded                        | 676,296       |                                              29.63 | 716,111       |                                              13.55 | 217,178       |                                               60.67 | 198,863       |                                               33.56 |\n| Forfeited                      | (474,878)     |                                              20.85 | (136,030)     |                                              21.13 | (59,291)      |                                               46.42 | (178,921)     |                                               46.37 |\n| Failed performance conditions  | (189,799)     |                                              19.43 | (145,661)     |                                              16.64 | (89,448)      |                                               44.07 | (63,852)      |                                               33.38 |\n| Vested                         | (413,588)     |                                               9.48 | (459,773)     |                                              20.55 | (183,118)     |                                               20.96 | (201,234)     |                                               41.21 |\n| Unvested awards at 31 December | 3,376,072     |                                              24.26 | 3,778,041     |                                              21.01 | 1,276,694     |                                               50.46 | 1,391,373     |                                               44.4  |",

This in turn will depend on the level of future pay increases, the level of inflation (for those benefits that are subject to some  form of inflation protection) and how long individuals live.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Volatility in asset values        | The Group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in pension plans to meet future benefit payments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Uncertainty in cash funding       | Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the Group being required to provide higher levels of cash  funding, although changes in the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years. In some countries control  over the rate of cash funding or over the investment policy for pension assets might rest to some extent with a trustee body or  other body that is not under the Group's direct control. In addition the Group is also exposed to adverse changes in pension |\n\nFor these reasons the Group has a policy of moving away from defined benefit pension provisions and towards defined contribution arrangements instead. The defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are closed to new entrants in almost all countries. For unionised employees, some plans remain open.\n\nThe Group does not usually participate in multi-employer plans in which the risks are shared with other companies using those plans. The Group's participation in such plans is immaterial and consequently no detailed disclosures are provided in this note.\n\n## Pension plans\n\nThe majority of the Group's defined benefit pension obligations are in Canada, the UK, the US and Switzerland.\n\nIn Canada the benefits for salaried staff are generally linked to final average pay and the plans are generally closed to new entrants. Benefits for bargaining employees are reviewed in negotiation with unions and are typically linked either to final average pay or to a flat monetary amount per year of service. New employees join arrangements which are defined contribution from the Group's perspective, with any required additional funding being provided by employees. The plans are subject to the regulatory requirements that apply to Canadian pension plans in the relevant provinces and territories (predominantly Quebec). Pension Committees are responsible for ensuring that the plans operate in a manner that is compliant with the relevant regulations. The Pension Committees generally have a number of members appointed by the sponsor and a number appointed by the plan participants. In some cases, there is also an independent Committee member.\n\nThe defined benefit sections of the UK arrangements are linked to final pay. New employees are admitted to defined contribution sections. The plans are subject to the regulatory requirements that apply to UK pension plans. Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the plans operate in a manner that is compliant with UK regulations. The trustee board governing the main UK plans has a number of directors appointed by the sponsor, a number appointed by the plan participants and an independent trustee director.\n\nA number of defined benefit pension plans are sponsored by the US entities. Benefits for salaried staff are generally linked to final average pay. Benefits for bargaining employees are reviewed in negotiation with unions and are typically a flat monetary amount per year of service. New employees are admitted to defined contribution plans. A Benefits Governance Committee is responsible for ensuring that the plans are compliant with US regulations. Members of that Committee are appointed by the sponsor.\n\nThe Swiss plan provides benefits linked to final average pay. The Swiss plan is overseen by a foundation board which is responsible for ensuring that the plan complies with Swiss regulations. Foundation board members are appointed by the plan sponsor, by employees and by retirees.\n\nIn Australia, the main arrangements are principally defined contribution in nature but there are sections providing defined benefits linked to final pay, typically paid in lump sum form. These arrangements are managed by an independent financial institution. Rio Tinto may nominate candidates to be considered for appointment to the governing board, as may other employers. One third of the board positions are nominated by employers, with the remaining positions being filled by independent directors and directors nominated by participants.\n\nThe Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit plans, which are included in the figures below.\n\n## Post-retirement healthcare plans\n\nCertain subsidiaries of the Group, mainly in the US and Canada, provide health and life insurance benefits to retired employees and in some cases to their beneficiaries and covered dependants. Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain age and service criteria. These arrangements are generally unfunded, and are included in the figures below.\n\n## Plan assets\n\nThe assets of the pension plans are invested predominantly in a diversified range of equities, bonds and property. Consequently, the funding level of the pension plans is affected by movements in the level of equity markets and also by movements in interest rates. The Group monitors its exposure to changes in interest rates and equity markets and also measures its balance sheet pension risk using a value at risk approach. These measures are considered when deciding whether significant changes in investment strategy are required. Investment strategy reviews are conducted on a periodic basis for the main pension plans to determine the optimal investment mix bearing in mind the Group's tolerance for risk, the risk tolerance of the local sponsor companies and the views of the Pension Committees and trustee boards who are legally responsible for the investments of the plans. The assets of the pension plans may also be invested in Qualifying Insurance Policies which provide a stream of payments to match the benefits being paid out by the plans, thereby removing investment, inflation and longevity risks.",

These managers may invest in the Group's securities subject to limits imposed by the relevant fiduciary committees and local legislation. The approximate total holding of Group securities within the plans is US$2 million (2020: US$4 million).\n\nThe holdings of quoted equities are invested either in pooled funds or segregated accounts held in the name of the relevant pension funds. These equity portfolios are well diversified in terms of the geographic distribution and market sectors.\n\nThe holdings of government bonds are generally invested in the debt of the country in which a pension plan is situated. Corporate and other quoted bonds are usually of investment grade. Private debt is mainly held in the North American and UK pension funds and is invested in North American and European companies.\n\nThe property funds are invested in a diversified range of properties.\n\nThe holdings of cash & other are predominantly cash and short-term money market instruments.\n\nInvestments in private equity, private debt and property are less liquid than the other investment classes listed above and therefore the Group's investment in those asset classes is restricted to a level that does not endanger the liquidity of the pension plans.\n\nQualifying insurance policies are held with insurance companies that are regulated by the relevant local authorities. The value of those policies is calculated by the local actuaries using assumptions consistent with those adopted for valuing the insured obligations.\n\nThe Group makes limited use of futures, repurchase agreements and other instruments to manage the interest rate risk in some of its plans. Fund managers may also use derivatives to hedge currency movements within their portfolios and, in the case of bond managers, to take positions that could be taken using direct holdings of bonds but more efficiently.\n\n## Maturity of defined benefit obligations\n\nAn approximate analysis of the maturity of the obligations is given in the table below:\n\n|                                                         | Pension benefits   | Other benefits   | 2021 Total   | 2020 Total   | 2019 Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Proportion relating to current employees                | 20 %               | 17 %             | 20 %         | 21 %         | 20 %         |\n| Proportion relating to former employees not yet retired | 12 %               | 0   %            | 11 %         | 11 %         | 12 %         |\n| Proportion relating to retirees                         | 68 %               | 83 %             | 69 %         | 68 %         | 68 %         |\n| Total                                                   | 100 %              | 100 %            | 100 %        | 100 %        | 100 %        |\n| Average duration of obligations (years)                 | 13.8               | 13.1             | 13.8         | 14.3         | 14.4         |",

In the UK and Switzerland the minimum level is negotiated with the local trustee or foundation in accordance with the funding guidance issued by the local regulators. In deciding whether to provide funding above the minimum level the Group takes into account other possible uses of cash within the Group, the tax situation of the local sponsoring entity and any strategic advantage that the Group might obtain by accelerating contributions. The Group does not generally pre-fund post-retirement healthcare arrangements.\n\n|                                             |   Pension benefits US$m |   Other benefits US$m |   2021 Total US$m |   2020 Total US$m |   2019 Total US$m |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Contributions to defined benefit plans      |                     425 |                    39 |               464 |               201 |               257 |\n| Contributions to defined contribution plans |                     309 |                     2 |               311 |               261 |               235 |\n| Total                                       |                     734 |                    41 |               775 |               462 |               492 |\n\nThe level of surplus in the Rio Tinto Pension Fund in the UK is such that it may be used to pay for the employer contributions to the defined contribution section of that Fund, in accordance with the funding arrangements agreed with the Trustee of that Fund. Consequently, the cash paid to defined contribution plans is lower than the defined contribution service cost by US$4 million. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans are kept under regular review and actual contributions will be determined in line with the Group's wider financing strategy, taking into account relevant minimum funding requirements. In 2021 additional cash of US$294 million was paid in order to settle pension obligations in France. This amount was paid to an external insurer, along with the transfer of existing pension assets in order to transfer the obligations to that insurer. As contributions to many plans are reviewed on at least an annual basis, the contributions for 2022 and subsequent years cannot be determined precisely in advance. Most of the Group's largest pension funds are fully funded on their local funding basis and do not require long-term funding commitments at present. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans for 2022 are estimated to be around US$180 million but may be higher or lower than this depending on the evolution of financial markets and voluntary funding decisions taken by the Group. Contributions for subsequent years are expected to be at similar levels. Healthcare plans are generally unfunded and contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments net of participant contributions. The Group's contributions in 2022 are expected to be similar to the amounts paid in 2021.\n\n## Movements in the net defined benefit liability\n\nA summary of the movement in the net defined benefit liability is shown in the first table below.

In determining the extent to which the asset ceiling has an effect, the Group considers the funding legislation in each country and the rules specific to each pension plan. The calculation takes into account any minimum funding requirements that may be applicable to the plan, whether any reduction in future Group contributions is available, and whether a refund of surplus may be available. In considering whether any refund of surplus is available the Group considers the powers of trustee boards and similar bodies to augment benefits or wind up a plan. Where such powers are unilateral, the Group does not consider a refund to be available at the end of the life of a plan. Where the plan rules and legislation both permit the employer to take a refund of surplus, the asset ceiling may have no effect, although it may be the case that a refund will only be available many years in the future.\n\n## Main assumptions (rates per annum)\n\nThe main assumptions for the valuations of the plans under IAS 19 are set out below. Where there are multiple plans in a country the rates below are weighted-average figures .\n\n|                              | Canada   | UK   | US   | Switzerland   |\n|------------------------------|----------|------|------|---------------|\n| At 31 December 2021          |          |      |      |               |\n| Discount rate                | 2.9%     | 1.9% | 2.8% | 0.3%          |\n| Inflation (a)                | 1.9%     | 3.4% | 2.4% | 0.9%          |\n| Rate of increase in pensions | 0.3%     | 2.9% | -%   | 1.8%          |\n| Rate of increase in salaries | 3.1%     | 4.2% | 3.9% | 1.9%          |\n| At 31 December 2020          |          |      |      |               |\n| Discount rate                | 2.5%     | 1.2% | 2.2% | 0.1%          |\n| Inflation (a)                | 1.6%     | 2.9% | 2.1% | 0.9%          |\n| Rate of increase in pensions | 0.1%     | 2.5% | -%   | 0.5%          |\n| Rate of increase in salaries | 2.8%     | 3.6% | 3.6% | 1.9%          |\n\nThe main financial assumptions used for the healthcare plans, which are predominantly in the US and Canada, were: discount rate: 3.1% (2020: 2.5%); medical trend rate: 6.3% reducing to 4.7% by the year 2031 broadly on a straight line basis (2020: 6.3%, reducing to 4.6% by the year 2031); claims costs based on individual company experience.\n\nFor both the pension and healthcare arrangements the post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in longevity. The mortality tables used imply that a man aged 60 at the balance sheet date has a weighted average expected future lifetime of 27 years (2020: 27 years) and that a man aged 60 in 2041 would have a weighted average expected future lifetime of 28 years (2020: 28 years). The mortality tables are generally based upon the latest standard tables published in each country, adjusted appropriately to reflect the actual mortality experience of the plan participants where credible data is available. No adjustment has been made for the potential future impact of the Covid-19 pandemic; this will be kept under review.\n\n## Sensitivity\n\nThe values reported for the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions used for projecting future benefit payments and discounting those payments. In order to estimate the sensitivity of the obligations to changes in assumptions, we calculate what the obligations would be if we were to make changes to each of the key assumptions in isolation. The difference between this figure and the figure calculated using our stated assumptions is an indication of the sensitivity to changes in each assumption. The results of this sensitivity analysis are summarised in the table below. Note that this approach is valid for small changes in the assumptions but will be less accurate for larger changes in the assumptions. The sensitivity to inflation includes the impact on pension increases, which are generally linked to inflation where they are granted.",

The waiver took effect on 25 January 2022. Rio Tinto and Turquoise Hill have also agreed a plan to deliver the funding required until sustainable underground production is reached.\n\nPrior to the waiver agreement, the funding balances owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill were expected to be repaid via a pledge over Erdenes' share of future Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. For this reason, and because the arrangement is between Turquoise Hill and Erdenes rather than with Oyu Tolgoi LLC itself, both the principal and interest are treated as transactions with owners acting in their capacity as owners. Consequently, at 31 December 2021, related amounts are recorded as a reduction in the share of equity attributable to non-controlling interests, resulting in an increase to the effective interest in Oyu Tolgoi attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. Refer to note 1 (xii) on page 236 and note 32 (k) on page 277.\n\nFunding balances owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill are not classified as loan receivables in the Group Balance Sheet, and there is no interest income shown in the Group Income Statement. Accumulation of interest on the funding balances increases the share of retained earnings attributable to Rio Tinto as it is accrued.\n\nWaiving the funding balances owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill increases Erdenes' economic share arising through entitlement to cash flows from future dividends of Oyu Tolgoi. In the 2022 Group results, there will be no Income Statement charge for loan forgiveness or write-off as a result of the waiver, and net assets and liabilities for Oyu Tolgoi included in the Group Balance sheet remained unchanged. There is no exchange of cash or other financial assets between parties and there will be no change to the underlying free cash flows of the Oyu Tolgoi operations and development project. The waiver does not have an impact on the Group's assessment of impairment indicators for either 2021 or 2022, since it relates to the project shareholders' funding arrangements rather than the economic capability of the Cash Generating Unit itself, refer to note 6. A reallocation of the net asset value allocation between the owners of Oyu Tolgoi will be recorded in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity for 2022 reporting periods by reducing equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto and increasing equity attributable to non-controlling interests:\n\n|                                                      | Retained  earnings US$m   |   Non- controlling  interests US$m |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Change in equity interest held by Rio Tinto          | (490)                     |                                490 |\n| Equity issued to owners of non-controlling interests | (711)                     |                                711 |\n\nThere were no other significant events after the balance sheet date requiring disclosure.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nNotes to the Rio Tinto plc Financial\n\n## Statements Notes to the Rio Tinto plc Financial Statements\n\n## A Principal accounting policies\n\n## a. Basis of preparation\n\nThe Rio Tinto plc company financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ('FRS 101'). The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Further information is disclosed on page 219 within note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. The following exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied:\n\n- - Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, 'Share-based Payment' (details of the number and weighted average exercise prices of share options and how the fair value of goods and services received was determined).\n- - Paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities).\n- - IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'.\n- - Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', comparative information requirements in respect of Paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1.\n- - The following paragraphs of IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements':\n- - 10 (d) (statement of cash flows);\n- - 16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);\n- - 38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements);\n- - 38B-D (additional comparative information);\n- - 111 (cash flow statement information); and\n- - 134-136 (capital management disclosures).\n- - IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows'.\n- - Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 'Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors' (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued and is not yet effective).\n- - Paragraph 17 of IAS 24 'Related party disclosures' (key management compensation).\n- - The requirements of IAS 24, 'Related party disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group.\n\n## b.Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make assumptions, judgments and estimates and to use judgment in applying accounting policies and making critical accounting estimates. These judgments, estimates and assumptions are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ materially from the amounts included in the financial statements.\n\nThe key area of judgment that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is the review for impairment of investment carrying values.\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. The unit of account being the equity of the subsidiary taken as a whole, which may comprise interests in multiple cash-generating units.\n\nIf any such indication exists, Rio Tinto plc makes an assessment of the recoverable amount. If the asset is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss will be recorded and the asset written down based on the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## c. Currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates (the functional currency). The financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency. Transactions denominated in other currencies, including the issue of shares, are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nExchange rates used are consistent with the rates used by the Group as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements (note 40).\n\n## d.Investments\n\nInvestments in Group companies are valued at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.",

        "page_content": "Financial statements\n\nNotes to the Rio Tinto plc Financial\n\nStatements\n\n## e.Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantees are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation.\n\n## f. Share-based payments\n\nThe Company operates a number of share-based payment plans for Group employees, the details of which are included in the consolidated financial statements (note 41). The fair value of the Company's share plans is recognised as an addition to the cost of the investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work over the expected vesting period, with a corresponding entry to retained earnings. Payments received from the Company's subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments are recognised as a reduction in the cost of the investment. The Company uses fair values provided by independent actuaries calculated using either a lattice-based option valuation model or a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market-based vesting conditions attached to the award.\n\nNon-market based vesting conditions (eg relative EBIT margin performance targets) are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued. No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.\n\n## g.Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## h.Treasury shares\n\nThe consideration paid for shares repurchased by the Company and held as treasury shares is recognised as a reduction in shareholders' funds through retained earnings.",

In addition, these entities also jointly guarantee the Group's undrawn credit facility which was US$7.5 billion at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: US$7.5 billion). Rio Tinto plc has provided guarantees in respect of certain derivative contracts that are in a liability position of US$273 million at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: US$141 million).\n\nRio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders. At 31 December 2021, US$4.3 billion of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility (31 December 2020: US$4.3 billion). Oyu Tolgoi LLC is owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the Government of Mongolia, and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (66%, of which Rio Tinto owns 51%). The project finance has been raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the completion of the underground mine according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility.\n\nThe Rio Tinto guarantee applies to the extent that Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd cannot satisfy Oyu Tolgoi LLC's project finance debt servicing obligations under its own guarantee to the lenders, called the sponsor debt service undertaking (DSU). Both the CSU and DSU contain a carve-out for certain political risk events.\n\nDuring 2021, fees of US$108 million (2020: US$108 million) were received from Oyu Tolgoi LLC and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd as consideration for the provision of the CSU.\n\nRio Tinto plc has provided a number of guarantees in relation to various pension funds. Subject to certain conditions, Rio Tinto plc would pay any contributions due from Group companies participating in these funds in the event that the companies fail to meet their contribution requirements. The guarantees were not called upon in 2021. The aggregate of company contributions to these plans in 2021 was US$8 million (2020: US$10 million).\n\nOther guarantees issued by Rio Tinto plc in relation to Rio Tinto Group entities as at 31 December 2021 amount to US$426 million (31 December 2020: US$388 million). Included within this balance is US$35 million (31 December 2020: US$35 million) in relation to non-wholly owned subsidiaries.\n\nPursuant to the DLC Merger, both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited issued deed poll guarantees by which each company guaranteed contractual obligations incurred by the other or guaranteed by the other.\n\nThe liability recognised for financial guarantees is US$156 million (31 December 2020: US$223 million) presented in 'Other financial liabilities' in the balance sheet.\n\n## H Contingent liabilities\n\nDetails of contingent liabilities are included in note 30 to the Group financial statements.\n\n## I Auditor's remuneration\n\nAmounts receivable by the Company's auditor and its associates in respect of services to the Company and its associates, have not been disclosed as the information is required instead to be disclosed on a consolidated basis in the consolidated financial statements .\n\n## J Events after the balance sheet date\n\nThere were no significant events after the balance sheet date requiring disclosure.",

The main impacts are as follows: Simandou has moved from the previous Energy & Minerals product group to the Copper product group; Uranium has moved from the previous Energy & Minerals product group to Other Operations; Diamonds has moved from the previous Copper & Diamonds product group to the Minerals product group; the Minerals product group retains the Argyle residual operations and from 1 January 2021, Argyle closure has moved to Other Operations. Argyle Residual operations includes activity relating to the sale of remaining diamond inventory and property held. Argyle closure includes activity relating to the management and execution of the Argyle mine closure obligations and management of entities with interests in state and traditional owner agreements and licences. As a result of these changes, the Copper & Diamonds segment is renamed Copper and the Energy & Minerals segment is renamed Minerals from 2021.\n\nThe disclosures in this note include certain alternative performance measures (APMs). For more information on the APMs used by the Group, including definitions and calculations, please refer to pages 343 to 347.\n\n- (a) Gross product sales include the sales revenue of equity accounted units on a proportionately consolidated basis (after adjusting for sales to subsidiaries) in addition to consolidated sales. Consolidated sales revenue includes subsidiary sales to equity accounted units, which are not included in gross product sales.\n- (b) Underlying EBITDA of subsidiaries, joint operations and the Group's share relating to equity accounted units represents profit before: tax, net finance items, depreciation and amortisation charged to the income statement in the period. Underlying EBITDA excludes the EBITDA impact of the same items that are excluded from underlying earnings.\n- (c) Underlying earnings represent net earnings attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto, adjusted to exclude items which do not reflect the underlying performance of the Group's operations. Business unit earnings are stated before finance items, but after the amortisation of discount related to provisions. Earnings attributed to business units do not include amounts that are excluded in arriving at underlying earnings.\n- (d) Pilbara represents the Group's 100% holding in Hamersley, 50% holding in Hope Downs Joint Venture and 65% holding in Robe River Iron Associates. The Group's net beneficial interest in Robe River Iron Associates is 53%, as 30% is held through a 60% owned subsidiary and 35% is held through a 100% owned subsidiary.\n- (e) Gross product sales, Underlying EBITDA, Net Earnings and Operating assets within Evaluation projects/other include activities relating to the shipment and blending of Pilbara and Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) iron ore inventories held at portside in China and sold to domestic customers. Transactions between Pilbara and our portside trading business are eliminated through the Iron Ore 'intra-segment' line and transactions between IOC and the portside trading business are eliminated through 'intersegment transactions'.\n\n- (f) Our interest in Oyu Tolgoi is held indirectly through our 50.8% investment in Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (TRQ), where TRQ's principal asset is its 66% investment in Oyu Tolgoi LLC, which owns the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine.\n- (g) Simfer Jersey Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey, in which the Group has a 53% interest, has an 85% interest in Simfer S.A., the company that manages the Simandou project in Guinea. The Group therefore has a 45.05% indirect interest in Simfer S.A. These entities are consolidated as subsidiaries and together referred to as the Simandou iron ore project.\n- (h) Includes our interests in Rio Tinto Fer et Titane (100%), QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM, 80%) and Richards Bay Minerals (attributable interest of 74%).\n- (i) Includes our interests in Argyle (100%) residual operations which relates to the sale of remaining inventory and Diavik. Until 18 November we recognised our 60% share of assets, revenue and expenses relating to the Diavik joint venture. Liabilities were recognised according to Diavik Diamond Mine Inc's contractual obligations at 100%, with a corresponding 40% receivable or contingent asset representing the co-owner's share where applicable. Post acquisition, we now consolidate (100%) of the Diavik Diamond Mine. From 1 June 2021, management responsibility for rehabilitation of the Argyle site moved from Minerals to Rio Tinto Closure (RTC), hence, Argyle closure is reported in Other operations effective from 1 January 2021. Refer to (j) below.\n- (j) Other operations include our 100% interest in the Gove alumina refinery (under rehabilitation), Rio Tinto Marine, and the remaining legacy liabilities of Rio Tinto Coal Australia. These include provisions for onerous contracts, in relation to rail infrastructure capacity, partly offset by financial assets and receivables relating to contingent royalties and disposal proceeds. From 1 January 2021, Uranium moved from Minerals to Other operations. From 1 January 2021, Argyle closure is reported as part of Other Operations.\n- (k) Mark-to-market movements on commodity derivatives entered into with the commercial objective of achieving spot pricing for the underlying transaction at the date of settlement have been reclassified from Central costs and are now included in Central pensions, share based payments, insurance & derivatives, in order to provide a better understanding of Central costs. The impact of this change on the reported comparatives is insignificant, and therefore the comparatives have not been restated.\n- (l) Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and purchases less sales of other intangible assets. The details provided include 100% of subsidiaries' capital expenditure and Rio Tinto's share of the capital expenditure of joint operations and equity accounted units.\n- (m) Operating assets of the Group represents equity attributable to Rio Tinto adding back net cash/(debt). Operating assets of subsidiaries, joint operations and the Group's share relating to equity accounted units are comprised of net assets excluding net cash/(debt) and post-retirement assets and liabilities, net of tax. Operating assets are stated after the deduction of non-controlling interests, these are calculated by reference to the net assets of the relevant companies (i.e. inclusive of such companies' debt and amounts due to or from Rio Tinto Group companies).",

The order essentially continues the relief that has applied to Rio Tinto Limited since the formation of the Group's dual listed companies (DLC) structure in 1995. The order applies to Rio Tinto Limited's financial reporting obligations for the financial years up to and including 31 December 2023.\n\nIn essence, instead of being required under the Corporations Act to prepare consolidated financial statements covering only itself and its controlled entities, the order allows Rio Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated financial statements in which it, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities are treated as a single economic entity. In addition, those consolidated financial statements are to be prepared:\n\n- -in accordance with the principles and requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom (UK IFRS) rather than the Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) (except for one limited instance in the case of any concise report), and in accordance with UK financial reporting obligations generally;\n- - on the basis that the transitional provisions of International Financial Reporting Standard 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, should be applied using the combined financial statements previously prepared for Rio Tinto Limited, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United Kingdom, under which the DLC Merger between Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc was accounted for using 'merger', rather than 'acquisition', accounting (reflecting that neither Rio Tinto Limited nor Rio Tinto plc was acquired by, or is controlled by, the other; and meaning that the existing carrying amounts, rather than fair values, of assets and liabilities at the time of the DLC Merger were used to measure those assets and liabilities at formation);\n- - on the basis that Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc are a single company (with their respective shareholders being the shareholders in that single company); and\n- - with a reconciliation, from UK IFRS to AAS, of the following amounts: consolidated loss/profit for the financial year, total consolidated comprehensive loss/income for the financial year and total consolidated equity at the end of the financial year (see page 217).\n\nThose consolidated financial statements must also be audited in relation to their compliance with relevant Australian and UK requirements. Rio Tinto Limited must also prepare a Directors' Report which satisfies the content requirements of the Corporations Act (applied on the basis that for these purposes the consolidated entity is the Group, and the consolidated financial statements cover the Group). This includes a Remuneration Report (see pages 168 to 198) prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act.\n\nRio Tinto Limited is also required to comply generally with the lodgement and distribution requirements of the Corporations Act (including timing requirements) in relation to those consolidated financial statements (including any concise financial statements), the Auditors' report and the Directors' Report. The Corporations Act also requires that a non-binding resolution to adopt the Remuneration Report be voted on by shareholders at Rio Tinto Limited's annual general meeting.\n\nRio Tinto Limited is not required to prepare separate consolidated financial statements solely for it and its controlled entities. Rio Tinto Limited is also not required to prepare and lodge parent entity financial statements for itself in respect of each relevant financial year.\n\nRio Tinto Limited must, however, in accordance with the Corporations Act include in the consolidated financial statements for the Group, as a note, various parent entity information regarding Rio Tinto Limited (including in relation to assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity, profit and loss, income, guarantees, contingent liabilities, and contractual commitments) prepared in accordance with AAS (see page 291).",

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDITS (CONTINUED)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe performed our risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group's components are likely to include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, including the type of procedures to be performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from our component auditors around the world. We scoped:\n\n- \u00b7 Four components, Pilbara Iron Ore, Aluminium Atlantic operations, Oyu Tolgoi and Rio Tinto Treasury UK as individually financially significant components which were subject to full scope audits by component auditors;\n- \u00b7 Four further components subject to full scope audits by component auditors;\n- \u00b7 Three components subject to 'audit of specific account balance' which are associated with a significant risk in relation to provision for closedown, restoration, and environmental obligations;\n- \u00b7 One component subject to 'audit of specific account balance' which is associated with a significant risk in relation to uncertain tax positions; and\n- \u00b7 Nine further components subject to 'audits of specific account balance' to ensure sufficient audit coverage.\n\nCertain Group sales and purchase transactions that originate in various countries are processed in Singapore and Delhi where we have also established audit teams to perform testing on behalf of our component teams.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\n## What we mean\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the current year financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on:\n\n- \uf0a7 the overall audit strategy;\n- \uf0a7 the allocation of resources in the audit; and\n- \uf0a7 directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nWe include below the key audit matters (unchanged from 2020), in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at the audit opinions above, together with our principal audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed in the context of, and our results are based on procedures undertaken for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinions thereon, and consequently are incidental to those opinions, and we do not provide separate opinions on these matters.\n\n## 3.1    Evaluation of impairment assessments of property, plant and equipment in specific cash generating units ('CGU')\n\n## Financial statement elements\n\n## Our results\n\n## Cash generating units ('CGU'):\n\n- -Oyu  Tolgoi  copper-gold  mine  ('Oyu  Tolgoi')  (Carrying value: US$11.8billion); and\n- -Kitimat  aluminium  smelter  ('Kitimat')  (Carrying  value: US$3,323m)\n\n## Description of the key audit matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nThe  Group  has  determined  that  there  were  indicators  of impairments  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  in  the  Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat CGUs, which led to the Group estimating recoverable  amounts  of  the  CGUs  (based  on  fair  value  less costs  of  disposal  methodology)  and  comparing  them  to  the respective carrying amounts. The Group concluded that the Kitimat  CGU  was  impaired  by  US$269m  and  that  the  Oyu Tolgoi  CGU  did  not  require  impairment  or  reversal  of impairment.\n\nThe  determination  of  recoverable  amounts  of  the  CGUs required the Group to exercise judgment and estimation in arriving at key assumptions. These key assumptions included forecast commodity prices and discount rates.\n\nSpecifically,  in  relation  to  the  Oyu  Tolgoi  CGU,  other  key assumptions  used  by  the  Group  included  the  timing  and volume  of  the  forecast  production  from  the  underground project and the adjustments applied to the future cash flows to reflect development and other project risks.\n\nOther key assumptions for the Kitimat CGU used by the Group included the timing and volume of forecast production and shipment.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n## Control operation\n\nEvaluating  the  design  and  testing  the  operating  effectiveness  of  certain  internal controls of the Group related to the impairment process for determination of the recoverable  amounts  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  for  the  Oyu  Tolgoi  and Kitimat CGUs.\n\n## Tests of detail\n\nWe performed the following procedures to challenge the Group while evaluating the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts:\n\n- \u00b7 involved our own valuation professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted us in assessing:\n- o the discount rates, by comparing assumptions used to calculate the discount rate to a range of internal and external sources; and\n- o the  forecast  commodity  prices,  by  comparing  them  to  market consensus forecasts.\n\n## Specifically, for the Oyu Tolgoi CGU we,\n\n- \u00b7 assessed the scope, competency and objectivity of the Group's internal experts who prepared the life of mine plans (which details the timing and production volumes) utilised in the Group's impairment assessment, and analysed against our knowledge of the operation and industry; and\n- \u00b7 made inquiries with senior finance and operational personnel within the Group and used our audit knowledge to corroborate and challenge:\n- o the Group's assumptions on timing and volume of production from the underground project; and\n- o the adjustments applied to the cash flows to reflect development and other project risks.\n\nFY21: Acceptable (FY20: In the prior year, the aforementioned cash generating units were evaluated for indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of property, plant and equipment with acceptable results).",

KEY AUDIT MATTERS (CONTINUED)\n\n## 3.1    Evaluation of impairment assessments of property, plant and equipment in specific cash generating units ('CGU') (continued)\n\n## Description of the key audit matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nWe have identified the Group's impairment assessments of property, plant and equipment in the Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat CGUs as a key audit matter. This was due to the complex  auditor  judgment  relating  to  the  facts  and circumstances  of  each  of  the  Group's  impairment assessments,  the  level  of  specialised  skills  needed  to evaluate certain  key  assumptions noted above and the increased risk of error due to the size of the CGUs.\n\nThe  effect  of  these  matters  is  that,  as  part  of  our  risk assessment,  we  determined  that  the  key  assumptions used  by  the  Group  have  a  high  degree  of  estimation uncertainty  with  a  wide  potential  range of  reasonable outcomes.\n\nRefer  to  notes  1(i)  and  6,  and  the  Audit  Committee's views set out on page 153.\n\n## Communications with Rio Tinto's Audit Committee\n\nWe discussed with and reported to the Audit Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Indicators of impairment noted for Kitimat CGU which included production challenges due to the labour strike and subsequent restart to operations.\n- \u00b7 Indicators  of  impairment  noted  for  the  Oyu  Tolgoi  CGU  which  included  political  and  stakeholder  challenges  including  risks  around  funding, complexities  associated  with  the  underground  development  and  delay  in  the  undercut  and  thereby  the  timing  of  the  production  from  the underground project.\n- \u00b7 Involvement of our valuation professionals assisting in assessing the discount rates and commodity pricing.\n- \u00b7 How the Group considered the impacts of climate change within the impairment tests.\n\nBased on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we found the Group's determination of the recoverable amount and the related impairment charge booked for the Kitimat CGU and the related disclosures in the financial statements comply with the accounting requirements and are acceptable.\n\n## 3.2    Evaluation of certain provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations ('closure provisions')\n\n## Financial statement elements\n\n## Our results\n\nCarrying value of closure provisions:\n\nAs at 31 December  2021  -  US$14,542m  (2020: US$13,335m)\n\nFY21: Acceptable (FY20: Acceptable)\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included (continued):\n\n## Tests of detail (continued)\n\nSpecifically, for the Kitimat CGU we,\n\n- \u00b7 compared  the  Group's  historical  forecast  production  and  shipment  volumes  to actual volumes to assess the Group's ability to accurately forecast; and\n- \u00b7 assessed the consistency of the Group's forecast production volumes and timing thereof with the planned ramp up schedule and corroborated this through inquiry of the operational personnel.\n\nAdditionally, we performed the following procedure for both the CGUs:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating  the  compliance  of  the  impairment  assessments  to  the  relevant accounting  standards,  checking  their  mathematical  accuracy  and  agreeing  the carrying value of the CGUs to the Group's accounting records.\n\n## Impact of climate change\n\nWe involved our sustainability specialists to assist in understanding the Group's approach to incorporating the impacts of climate change into its pricing process and in comparing carbon pricing assumptions to publicly available information.\n\n## Assessing disclosures\n\nWe assessed the related disclosures in notes 1 and 6, including sensitivity disclosures, for compliance with the relevant accounting requirements and against the results of our work.",

KEY AUDIT MATTERS (CONTINUED)\n\n## 3.2    Evaluation of certain provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations ('closure provisions') (continued)\n\n## Description of the key audit matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nThe  Group  incurs  legal  and  constructive  obligations  for close-down  and  restoration  activities  which  include  the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, the removal of  residual  materials  and  the  remediation  of  disturbed areas  for  mines  and  certain  refineries  and  smelters. Generally,  there  is  relatively  limited  activity  within  the Group  or  broader  industry  of  completing  large  scale restoration and rehabilitation projects, and elements of restoration  and  rehabilitation  of  each  site  are  relatively unique to the site. As such, there are limited comparable historical precedents  against  which  to  benchmark estimates  of  future  costs,  which  increases  estimation uncertainty.\n\nA significant proportion of the Group's assets have long remaining  lives,  which  also  increases  the  estimation uncertainty relating to the rehabilitation activities required  and  the  timing  and  amount  of  the  associated future cash flows. Because of this, the effect of the time value of money is material.\n\nClose-down, restoration and environmental remediation activities  are  governed  by  a  combination  of  legislative requirements,  the  Group's  policies,  and  commitments made to stakeholders. These vary across location, product and operation.\n\nThe Group has disclosed that the determination of when an estimate associated with close-down, restoration and environmental obligations is sufficiently reliable to update is an area of judgment that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\nThe  evaluation  of  closure  provisions  for  certain  sites within Rio Tinto Iron ore ('Pilbara'), Gove refinery ('Gove') and Energy Resources of Australia ('ERA')  is a key audit matter  due  to  the  amount  of  the  provision  and  the judgment  and  specialised  skills  involved  in  our  audit testing of certain key assumptions used by the Group to determine the provision including:\n\n- \u00b7 the future close-down  and  restoration  costs including costs associated to post-closure monitoring ('closure costs');\n- \u00b7 the life of the operation and the nature and timing of closure and rehabilitation activities; and\n- \u00b7 the discount rate.\n\nRefer to notes 1(l) and 25, and the Audit Committee's views set out on page 153.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n## Control operation\n\nEvaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over  the  Group's  process  to  estimate  provisions  for  close-down,  restoration  and environmental obligations over the Group's selection of key assumptions to be used.\n\n## Tests of detail\n\nWe performed the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluated  the  scope,  competency  and  objectivity  of  the  Group's  experts,  both internal  and/or  external  to  the  Group,  who  produce  the  cost  estimates  by examining  the  work  they  were  involved  to  perform,  their  professional qualifications and experience; and\n- \u00b7 inspected the most recent closure studies and other technical material prepared by the Group relating to changes in the closure provision to assess the nature and scope of work planned to be undertaken. This included assumptions relating to the life  of  the  operation  and  the  nature  and  timing  of  closure  and  rehabilitation activities and expectation.\n\nFor certain closure provisions within Pilbara and Gove, we:\n\n- \u00b7 compared historical forecast cost assumptions to actual costs to assess the Group's ability to accurately forecast; and\n- \u00b7 compared  the  nature,  timing  and  the  estimated  closure  costs  included  in  the studies with those used in the calculation of the provision.\n\nAdditionally, for the closure provisions within ERA and Gove, we assessed updates to the provision for changes to previous estimates or the correction of prior period errors, and against our knowledge.\n\nFor operations that the Group determined did not require a change in key assumptions during  the  year,  we  considered  the  consistency  of  the  Group's  conclusion  with  our understanding  of  the  obligations  associated  with  that  operation  and  its  closure remediation plan.\n\n## Our closure and valuation expertise\n\nWe involved our own valuations professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the discount rate applied by the Group to calculate the net present value of these provisions. We compared it to external data including yields on long-term government bonds and external market research.\n\nWe  involved  our  own  environmental  professionals  for  Pilbara,  Gove  and  ERA  with specialised  skills  and  knowledge  who  assisted  us  in  assessing  certain  assumptions regarding the forecast closure costs of closure activities based on their experience and familiarity  with  applicable  legislative  requirements  and  industry  practice  and  the Group's closure commitments.\n\n## Assessing disclosures\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the appropriateness of the related disclosures in notes 1 and 25 of the  financial  statements  including  the  Group's  disclosure  of  the  key  source  of estimation  uncertainty  surrounding  the  preliminary  closure  studies  on  ERA's Ranger  Uranium  mine  against  the  results  of  our  work  and  the  accounting requirements.",

The  Group  maintains  material  provisions  for uncertain tax positions.\n\nWe  focused  our  work  on  the  Group's  uncertain  tax positions  associated  to    disputes  with  the  Australian Taxation  Office  (ATO)  related  to  transfer  pricing  and related  issues  and  with  the  Mongolian  Tax  Authority regarding transaction related issues.\n\nAs part of our risk assessment, we determined that these uncertain tax positions have a high degree of estimation uncertainty with a wide range of potential outcomes. The evaluation of these provisions for uncertain tax positions is  a  key  audit  matter  due  to  the  judgment,  estimation uncertainty  and  specialised  skills  involved  in  auditing these provisions for uncertain tax positions.\n\nRefer  to  notes  1(n)  and  9,  and  the  Audit  Committee's views set out on page 153.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n## Control operation\n\nEvaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related  to  the  tax  process,  including  controls  over  the  assessment  of  provisions  for uncertain tax positions.\n\n## Our taxation expertise\n\nWe involved our  own tax professionals with specialised  skills  and  knowledge  of  the application of legislation by the relevant tax authorities, knowledge of tax audits and relevant  compliance  programmes.  They  assisted  us  in  challenging  the  Group's assessment  of  uncertain  tax  positions  including  assumptions  applied  and  estimates made associated to its disputes with the Australian Taxation Office and Mongolian Tax Authority, which included:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing the implications of results of historical tax audits, and outcomes from comparable situations for the positions taken by the Group; and\n- \u00b7 inspecting internally and externally prepared documentation, including correspondence with tax authorities, transfer pricing documentation and third party tax advice received by the Group, to evaluate the Group's current disputes and uncertain tax positions.\n\n## Assessing disclosures\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the Group's tax disclosures in notes 1(n) and 9 of the financial statements against the accounting requirements and the results of our work.",

THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR AUDIT\n\nIn planning our audit, we considered the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements, based on our knowledge of the Group's operations and their stated strategy with respect to climate change.\n\n## The context of climate change for the Group\n\nUnlike  some  other  major  resources  companies,  the  Group  does  not  mine  or  extract  hydrocarbons  such  as  coal,  natural  gas,  or  oil  but  it  does  emit greenhouse gases directly from energy used in its mining operations, the processing of metals and minerals, and the transportation of its products. Some of the Group's products are used in energy and carbon intensive industries including steel and aluminium production. Other of the Group's products, such as copper, are expected to continue to be important in the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nAs explained in note 1 of the Group's financial statements, in October 2021 the Group announced updated targets to reduce scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions relative to its 2018 baseline by 15% in 2025, by 50% in 2030 and to achieve net zero emissions across its operations by 2050. The Group has disclosed its expectation  to  make  incremental  capital  expenditure  of  US$7.5  billion  associated  with  key  decarbonisation  projects  to  achieve  this  target  by  2030, particularly to enable a move to renewable power, to electrify processing and to run electric mobile fleets.\n\nFY21: Acceptable (FY20: Acceptable)",

THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON OUR AUDIT (CONTINUED)\n\n## The Group's assessment of accounting consequences\n\nIFRS requires the Group's financial reporting to be based, amongst other things, on the Group's best estimate of assumptions that are reasonable and supportable as at the date of reporting. Those assumptions may not align with the ways in which the global economy, society and government  policies will need to change to meet the targets to limit global warming to 1.5 o c which is aligned with the stretch goal of the 2015 COP 21 Paris Agreement.\n\nThe Group has set carbon emission targets and estimated the incremental capital  and operational expenditure required to deliver those targets. The Group has considered the potential for asset obsolescence or shorter economic lives of its existing property, plant and equipment, particularly with respect to carbon intensive assets such as coal fired power stations and aluminium smelters, but has not yet made any material changes to accounting estimates as a result.\n\nThe Group discloses judgments and estimates which are potentially impacted by climate change, including internal commodity pricing estimates and forecast carbon taxes, which are pervasively used in various financial processes of the Group. These processes include, but are not restricted to, impairment assessments for certain CGUs.\n\nThe Group has provided more detail on how they have considered climate change in their financial reporting in note 1 of the Group's financial statements. This year the Group has also provided additional disclosures to illustrate the impact of commodity and carbon prices on the net present value of certain CGUs that were subject to impairment tests in the year under a scenario which aligns to the Group's interpretation of 'Paris Aligned'. More detail on these disclosures can be found in note 6 of the Group's financial statements.\n\n## Our audit response\n\n## Risk assessment procedures\n\nAs part of our risk assessment procedures, we made enquiries, with the assistance of our sustainability specialists, of key members of management. Our enquiries focussed on understanding the Group's climate related strategy and identifying those areas where climate change could have a potential material impact on the financial statements.\n\nWe challenged management's assessment that its stated climate change strategy did not result in any impairment trigger or reassessment of useful economic lives on carbon intensive assets in these financial statements, taking into account the remaining life of relevant assets, and headroom on CGUs that could be most impacted by climate change.\n\nWe did not identify the impact of climate risk as a separate Key Audit Matter in our audit given the nature of the Group's operations and knowledge gained of its impact on critical accounting estimates and judgements during our risk assessment procedures and testing.\n\n## Audit procedures in relation to Key Audit Matters\n\nWe did not consider the impact of climate change to be significant to our audit response for the Key Audit Matters relating to closure provisions or uncertain tax matters, but have performed procedures to address the impact of climate change on our Key Audit Matter relating to the evaluation of impairment assessments of property, plant and equipment in certain CGUs, as set out in section 3 of this report. Within that section of our audit report, we explain how we involved our sustainability specialists to compare carbon pricing assumptions in the impairment assessments to publicly available information for certain CGUs in arriving at our audit conclusions.\n\n## Other audit procedures\n\nDuring the course of our audit, we carried out the following additional audit procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 we considered the Group's processes around climate change related disclosures in the Annual Report and read the disclosures in the Strategic Report and Directors' Report and considered its consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge;\n- \u00b7 we assessed the appropriateness of climate-related financial disclosures, including TCFD recommended disclosures; and\n- \u00b7 we assessed the consistency between the Group's estimate of the capital expenditure planned for decarbonisation of US$7.5 billion with the cash flows used in its going concern and viability assessments.\n\nThe audit procedures were performed principally by the group engagement team with the support of our sustainability specialists.",

GOING CONCERN, VIABILITY AND PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (KPMG UK ONLY)\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the UK parent company or the Group or to cease their operations, and they have concluded that the UK parent company's and the Group's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\n## Going concern\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nWe used  our  knowledge  of  the  Group,  its  industry,  and  the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks we consider as most relevant to the level of the Group's financial resources over this period relate to levels of demand and commodity pricing.\n\nWe  critically  assessed  the  assumptions  in  the  Directors' downside scenarios relevant to liquidity and covenant metrics, in  particular  in  relation  to  revenue  growth  by  comparing  to historical  trends  and  assessing  whether  downside  scenarios applied take into account reasonably possible downsides. The extent of our work was influenced by the level of liquidity.\n\nWe assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\nWe consider that  the  Directors'  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  in  the preparation  of  the  Group's  and  UK  parent  company's  financial  statements  is appropriate.\n\nWe have not identified, and concur with the Directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or UK parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period.\n\nWe have  nothing  material  to  add  or  draw  attention  to  in  relation  to  the  Directors' statement in note 1 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and UK parent company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in note 1 to be acceptable.\n\nThe  related  statement  under  the  UK  Listing  Rules  set  out  on  page  199  is  materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgments that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the UK parent company will continue in operation.\n\n## Disclosures on emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nWe are  required  to  perform  procedures  to  identify  whether there  is  a  material  inconsistency  between  the  Directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## Our reporting\n\nBased on the knowledge we acquired during our financial statement audit, we have nothing further to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 the Directors' confirmation within the viability statement that they have carried out  a  robust  assessment  of  the  emerging  and  principal  risks  facing  the  Group, including  those  that  would  threaten  its  business  model,  future  performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 the  Principal  Risks  and  Uncertainties  disclosures  describing  these  risks  and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 the Directors' explanation in the viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects  of  the  Group,  over  what  period  they  have  done  so  and  why  they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and  meet  its  liabilities  as  they  fall  due  over  the  period  of  their  assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nUnder the UK Listing Rules we are also required to review the Viability Statement set out on  page  115.  Based  on  the  above  procedures,  we  have  concluded  that  the  above disclosures  are  materially  consistent  with  the  financial  statements  and  our  audit knowledge.",

KPMG UK'S REPORTING ON OUR ABILITY TO DETECT IRREGULARITIES, AND OUR RESPONSE\n\nFraud - Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatements due to fraud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure by the Directors and other management to commit, or provide an opportunity to commit, fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 Enquiries  of  the  Directors,  other  management,  internal  audit  and  the  Audit  Committee,  including  obtaining  and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Group's policies and procedures relating to:\n- -internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud;\n- -detecting and responding to the risks of fraud; and\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 Enquiries  of  the  Directors,  other  management,  internal  audit  and  the  Audit  Committee  as  to  whether  they  had knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 Reading Board and Audit Committee minutes;\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for Directors and other management, including the flexed and unflexed underlying earnings and STIP free cash flow target ranges for executive remuneration; and\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 Discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any  potential  indicators  of  fraud.  The  engagement  team  includes  audit  partners  and  staff  who  have  extensive experience of working with companies in the mining sector, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved our own forensic specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group, who advised the engagement team of fraud schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries and participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the group audit team to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the group level and requests to component audit teams to report to the group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement of the Group financial statements.\n\nAs required by UK auditing standards we addressed the risk of management override of controls and the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition. In particular we considered the risk that revenue is recorded in the wrong period, specifically overstated and the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries, and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgments.\n\nFraud risk assessment\n\nRisk communications\n\nFraud risks",

KPMG UK'S REPORTING ON OUR ABILITY TO DETECT IRREGULARITIES, AND OUR RESPONSE  (CONTINUED)\n\nLaws and regulations - Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations (continued)\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or harm to the Group's license to operate.\n\nWe identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect:\n\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 anti-bribery, fraud and corruption;\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 health and safety legislation;\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 employment and social security legislation;\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 environmental protection legislation; and\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 competition legislation.\n\nAuditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of law or regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, our audit will not detect that breach.\n\nFor the contingent liabilities disclosed in note 30 we assessed disclosures against our understanding from legal confirmations received from external counsel. For the uncertain tax positions referred to in note 1 we performed procedures as detailed in our key audit matter (page 329).\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by UK auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\n## 7. OUR DETERMINATION OF MATERIALITY\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## What we mean by materiality\n\nThis is the amount representing the total magnitude of misstatements that we expect to influence the economic decisions of the users of these financial statements.\n\nBasis for determining materiality and judgments applied\n\nOur assessment of overall group materiality was US$700m (2020: US$550m). This was derived from the level of profit before tax excluding certain identified items which could significantly distort results in any one particular year. We consider profit before tax, excluding certain identified items, is a key indicator of performance, the basis for earnings, and therefore the primary focus of a reasonable investor. We have checked analyst consensus data and other investor commentary for signals of alternate significant influencers of economic decisions.  No revisions to our calculation methodology resulted therefrom.\n\nThe certain identified item excluded in FY21 was:\n\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 net pre-tax impairments US$269m charge (2020: US$1,243m charge)\n\nMateriality of US$700m (2020: US$550m) was determined by applying a percentage  to the profit before tax, excluding certain identified items US$31,102m (2020: US$16,634m).\n\nMateriality for the Rio Tinto plc company financial statements as a whole was set at US$500m (2020: US$340m), determined with reference to a benchmark of the UK parent company's total assets of which it represents 0.9% (2020: 0.8%).\n\nMost significant indirect law/regulation areas\n\n## US$700m\n\n(2020: US$550m)\n\nMateriality for the financial statements as a whole",

OUR DETERMINATION OF MATERIALITY (CONTINUED)\n\n## What we mean by performance materiality\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to performance materiality, to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances might add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nBasis for determining performance materiality and judgments applied\n\nWe have considered performance materiality at a level of 75% (2020: 65%) of materiality for the Rio Tinto Group financial statements as a whole, and for the Rio Tinto plc company financial statements to be appropriate, having taken account of:\n\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 The level of audit differences (adjusted and unadjusted) identified during our previous audit; and\n- \u00b7 \u00b7 Our view of the strength and robustness of the control environment, including the tone at the top and culture of Rio Tinto's organisation as well as control deficiencies identified in previous audits.\n\nThe level of performance materiality we considered appropriate was lower in FY 20 primarily as it was our first year of audit. Performance materiality for the Rio Tinto plc company financial statements, was set at US$375m (2020: US$221m).\n\n| US$35m   (2020: US$25m)   | What we mean by Audit misstatement posting threshold  This is the amount below which identified misstatements are clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may become  aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures, for  example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud.   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| US$35m   (2020: US$25m)   | This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Rio Tinto's Audit Committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| US$35m   (2020: US$25m)   | Basis for determining the audit misstatement reporting threshold and judgments applied  We set our audit misstatement posting at 5% of our materiality, rounded down to US$35m (2020: US$25m).

THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT\n\n## What we mean\n\nHow we determined the procedures to be performed across the Group:\n\nWe performed risk assessment and planning procedures and scoped in:\n\n- \u00b7 Four components, Pilbara Iron Ore, Aluminium Atlantic operations, Oyu Tolgoi and Rio Tinto Treasury UK as individually financially significant components which were subject to full scope audits by component auditors;\n- \u00b7 Four further components subject to full scope audits by component auditors;\n- \u00b7 Three components subject to 'audit of specific account balance' which are associated with a significant risk in relation to provision for closedown, restoration, and environmental obligations;\n- \u00b7 One component subject to 'audit of specific account balance' which is associated with a significant risk in relation to uncertain tax positions; and\n- \u00b7 Nine further components subject to 'audits of specific account balance' to ensure sufficient audit coverage.\n\n|                                                                | Range of component  materialities  FY21   |   Number of components   (reflecting FY21 reporting structure)  FY21 FY20 |   Number of components   (reflecting FY21 reporting structure)  FY21 FY20 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Full  scope  audits  for  group  audit  purposes               | US$70m - US$375m                          |                                                                         8 |                                                                         8 |\n| Audits  of  'specific  account  balance'  for  group reporting | US$54m - US$150m                          |                                                                        13 |                                                                        12 |\n| Total                                                          |                                           |                                                                        21 |                                                                        20 |\n\nWe have also performed audit procedures centrally across the Group, beyond the component scope set out above, in the following areas:\n\n- \uf0a7 Testing of IT systems and configurations;\n- \uf0a7 Consolidation of the financial information;\n- \uf0a7 Climate considerations and impact on the financial statements;\n- \uf0a7 Evaluating the Group's uncertain tax position on DLC Dividend financing;\n- \uf0a7 Identifying journal entries with a defined high-risk criteria; and\n- \uf0a7 Pensions.\n\nCoverage % on the Group financial statements\n\n|                                                               | Total Group revenue   | Group profit before  tax   | Total Group assets   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|\n| Full  scope  audits  for  group  audit  purposes              | 77% (2020: 68%)       | 70% (2020: 59%)            | 64% (2020: 57%)      |\n| Audits  of  'specific  account  balance'  for group reporting | 19% (2020: 23%)       | 19% (2020: 27%)            | 23% (2020: 32%)      |\n| Out-of-scope                                                  | 04% (2020: 09%)       | 11% (2020: 14%)            | 13% (2020: 11%)      |\n\nNone of the out-of-scope entities individually represented more than 2% (2020: 4%) of any of total Group revenue, total profits and losses making up Group profit before taxation or Group assets. The work on 20 of the 21 in-scope components (2020: 19 of the 20 components, reflecting FY 21 reporting structure) was performed by KPMG member firms. The audit of the UK parent company, Rio Tinto plc company financial statements was performed by the group audit team.\n\n## Approach on controls\n\nFor  the  audit  of  the  Group  financial  statements,  we  were  able  to  rely  upon  the  Group's  internal  controls  over  financial reporting in several areas of our audit, where our controls testing supported this approach, which enabled us to reduce the scope of our substantive audit work; in the other areas the scope of the audit work performed was fully substantive. For the audit of the Rio Tinto plc company financial statements, the scope of the audit work performed was fully substantive as we did not place reliance upon Rio Tinto plc's internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n## Group scope",

THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT (CONTINUED)\n\n## What we mean\n\nThe extent of the Group audit team's involvement in component audits.\n\nAs part of determining the scope and preparing our audit plan and strategy, the group audit team held various meetings with our component auditors in UK, Australia, Canada, South Africa, Singapore and Chile to discuss key audit risks and obtain input from component teams.\n\nThe group audit team additionally held workshops for all the components whereby the component auditors and the group audit team's discussions included the significant risks, close calls and fraud risk factors.\n\nThe group audit team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from US$54m to US$375m, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the components.\n\nIt was not practicable in the current environment, due to the coronavirus pandemic and on-going restrictions on movement of people across borders, to travel and physically visit many sites. However, the group audit team was able to visit some sites:\n\n|               | 2021                           | 2020                                |\n|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Sites visited | \u00b7\u00b7 Pilbara                     | \u00b7 \u00b7 Pilbara                         |\n| Sites visited | \u00b7 \u00b7 Perth (Southern Hemisphere | \u00b7\u00b7 Oyu Tolgoi (Virtual)             |\n| Sites visited | Hub)                           | \u00b7\u00b7 Perth (Southern Hemisphere  Hub) |\n\nAside  from  the  site  visits  mentioned  above,  frequent  video  conference  calls  were  held  throughout  the  audit  with  the component auditors. During these video conference calls we inspected the component team's key work papers related to significant  risks  and  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  conclusions  and  consistencies  between  reported findings and work performed.\n\n## 9.

RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n## Directors' responsibilities for the financial statements\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 322 of the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial  statements,  including  being  satisfied  that  they  give  a  true  and  fair  view  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  financial  reporting  frameworks; implementing such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group, Rio Tinto plc's and Rio Tinto Limited's ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities, or error, and to issue our opinions in an auditor's report.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) and ASAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of KPMG UK's responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. A further description of KPMG  Australia's  responsibilities  for  the  audit  of  the  Financial  Statements  is  located  at  the  Auditing  and  Assurance  Standards  Board  website  at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1\\_2020.pdf.

APMs are presented in order to give further insight into the underlying business performance of the Group's operations.\n\nAPMs are not consistently defined and calculated by all companies, including those in the Group's industry.

Production figures are sometimes more precise than the rounded numbers shown, hence small differences may result from calculation of Rio/uni00A0Tinto share of production.\n\n- (a) Rio/uni00A0Tinto percentage share, shown above, is as at the end of 2021. The footnotes below include all ownership changes over the three years.\n- (b) Jonqui\u00e8re's (Vaudreuil's) production shows smelter grade alumina only and excludes hydrate produced and used for specialty alumina.\n- (c) Rio/uni00A0Tinto has a 22.95% shareholding in the Sangaredi mine but benefits from 45.0% of production.\n- (d) Borate quantities are expressed as B2O3.\n- (e) Rio/uni00A0Tinto owns a 33.52% indirect interest in Oyu Tolgoi through its 50.79% interest in Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd.\n- (f)  The Argyle diamonds mine closed on 3 November 2020. Production is reported up to that date.\n- (g) On 17 November 2021, Rio/uni00A0Tinto's ownership interest in Diavik increased from 60% to 100%. Production is reported including this change from 1 November 2021.\n- (h) Includes 100% of production from Paraburdoo, Mt Tom Price, Marandoo, Yandicoogina, Brockman, Nammuldi, Silvergrass and the Eastern Range mines. Whilst Rio/uni00A0Tinto owns 54% of the Eastern Range mine, under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Hamersley Iron manages the operation and is obliged to purchase all mine production from the joint venture and therefore all of the production is included in Rio/uni00A0Tinto's share of production.\n- (i)  Rio/uni00A0Tinto's ownership interest in Channar mine increased from 60% to 100%, following conclusion of its joint venture with Sinosteel Corporation upon reaching planned 290 million tonnes production on 22 October 2020. Production is reported at 100% from this date onward. Historic data is unchanged.\n- (j)  Quantities comprise 100% of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Fer et Titane and Rio/uni00A0Tinto's 74% share of Richards Bay Minerals' production. Ilmenite mined in Madagascar is being processed in Canada.\n- (k) ERA report drummed U3O8. ERA ceased processing operations on 8 January 2021, as required by the Ranger Authority. In February 2020, our interest in Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) increased from 68.4% to 86.3% as a result of new ERA shares issued to Rio/uni00A0Tinto under the Entitlement Offer and Underwriting Agreement to raise funds for the rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area. Production is reported including this change from 1 March 2020.\n- (l)  R\u00f6ssing report drummed U3O8. On 16 July 2019, Rio/uni00A0Tinto completed the sale of its entire interest in the R\u00f6ssing uranium mine in Namibia to China National Uranium Corporation Limited.",

        "page_content": "## Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves for Rio/uni00A0Tinto managed operations are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2012 (the JORC Code) as required by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Rio/uni00A0Tinto also files an annual report on Form 20-F (Form 20-F) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and prepares for the Form 20-F the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (Regulation S-K). Some variations may occur between the reporting in accordance with the JORC Code and Regulation S-K.\n\nA Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade (or quality), and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. Estimates of such material are based largely on geological information with only preliminary consideration of mining, economic and other factors. While in the judgment of the Competent Person there are realistic expectations that all or part of the Mineral Resources will eventually become Proved or Probable Ore Reserves, there is no guarantee that this will occur as the result depends on further technical and economic studies and prevailing economic conditions in the future.\n\nAn Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted. It is defined by studies at Pre-Feasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate, with the application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction can reasonably be/uni00A0justified.\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto's Mineral Resources are reported as additional (exclusive) to the reported Ore Reserves.\n\nFor Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve reporting, the JORC Code envisages the use of reasonable investment assumptions to test the economic viability of the Ore Reserves and the reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction for the Mineral Resources. To/uni00A0achieve this, Rio/uni00A0Tinto uses internally generated projected long-term commodity prices.\n\nRegulation S-K requires the use of a justifiable commodity price to test the economic viability of the Mineral Reserves and the reasonable prospects of economic extraction for the Mineral Resources, and prices used in calculating the estimates must be disclosed. As a result of the commercial sensitivity of Rio/uni00A0Tinto's long-term commodity prices, Rio/uni00A0Tinto uses commercially available consensus pricing or historical pricing for SEC reporting. For this reason and others, some Mineral Reserves reported to the SEC in the Form 20-F may differ from those Ore Reserves reported below.\n\nMineral Resource and Ore Reserve information in the tables below is based on information compiled by Competent Persons (as defined by the JORC Code), most of whom are full time employees of Rio/uni00A0Tinto or related companies. Each has had a minimum of five years' relevant experience and is a member of a recognised professional body whose members are bound by a professional code of ethics; being members of The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (the AusIMM), Australian Institute of Geoscientists (AIG) or recognised professional organisations (RPOs). Each Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this Annual Report of information they have provided in the form and context in which it appears. Competent Persons responsible for the estimates are listed on pages 378-379, by operation, along with their professional affiliation, employer, and accountability for Mineral Resources and/or Ore Reserves.\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves from externally managed operations, in which Rio/uni00A0Tinto holds a minority share, are reported as received from the managing entity and in accordance with the JORC code.\n\nFigures from our managed operations are the responsibility of the managing directors of the business units and estimates are carried out by the Competent Persons.\n\nThe Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve figures in the following tables are as of 31 December 2021. Summary data for year end 2020 are shown for comparison. Metric units are used throughout. The figures used to calculate Rio/uni00A0Tinto's Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are more precise than the rounded numbers shown in the tables, hence small differences might result if the calculations are repeated using the tabulated figures.\n\nDuring 2021, Rio/uni00A0Tinto carried out a periodic review of its Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve reporting including a review of the materiality of various deleterious elements and the level of breakdown provided for each operation or project. As a result of this review, the following changes have been implemented for 2021 annual reporting:\n\n- - Iron Ore - Pilbara operations: Silica, alumina, phosphorous and loss on ignition (LOI) are now reported for the Pilbara operations. Previously, deleterious elements were not considered material for Pilbara operations due to the integrated nature and blending practices. As such, providing these details at the deposit level had the potential to mislead as ore from individual deposits is blended to create a saleable product. With the changing market conditions, Rio/uni00A0Tinto considers that these deleterious elements are becoming more relevant to pricing outcomes and is implementing this revised reporting to provide additional transparency. As the information may still be misleading at a deposit level due to the integration and blending practices, Rio/uni00A0Tinto has moved to reporting the Pilbara as a single integrated property, with breakdown by type of mineralisation, inclusive of deleterious elements. The/uni00A0tonnages attributable to each joint venture are included in the narrative to ensure visibility of this/uni00A0breakdown.\n- - Iron Ore - Simandou: Reporting of silica, alumina, phosphorous and LOI has been implemented to align with the Pilbara operations reporting.\n- - Iron Ore - Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC): Reporting of silica, alumina and phosphorous has been implemented where possible to align with the Pilbara operations reporting. However, Ore Reserves are reported as saleable product (pellets and concentrate) and no meaningful relationship has been established between the product and feed grades of alumina and phosphorus, so these grades cannot be reported for Ore Reserves. Saleable product is produced to meet silica grade specifications, so the Ore Reserve silica grade is the targeted silica grade for the currently anticipated long-term product mix. LOI is not determined for resource drilling samples, so no estimate of LOI is available for Ore Reserves or Mineral Resources.\n- - Bauxite: Total silica is now reported for all Rio/uni00A0Tinto Aluminium operations. In the past, this was not considered material as the majority of the bauxite sales were part of an integrated business. Over time, more bauxite has been sold externally and hence silica reporting is now considered to be more material. This is also better aligned with current industry practice.\n\nWith the change in reporting practices outlined above, Rio/uni00A0Tinto has also redesigned the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve tables to report all variables by operation and project rather than the previous practice of reporting each economic variable separately. The 2020 Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve numbers are also shown in the revised format for ease of reconciliation.\n\nJORC Table 1 reports for new or materially upgraded significant deposits are released to the market; they are also available at riotinto. com. JORC Table 1, SEC Technical Report Summaries and NI 43-101 technical reports generated by non-managed units or joint venture partners are referenced within the reporting footnotes with the location and initial reporting date identified.",

Mill recoveries are therefore not shown.\n- (c) Australian iron ore Reserve tonnes are reported on a dry weight basis.\n- (d) The updated assessment of Reserves reflects measures Rio/uni00A0Tinto has put in place following the events in the Juukan Gorge on 24 May 2020. These measures are intended to protect a number of sites, and to mitigate impacts to sites where there are existing heritage approvals authorising mining impacts, or a decision has been made not to seek regulatory approval to conduct mining activities, given the heritage considerations identified by Traditional Owners. As a result, in 2021, Rio/uni00A0Tinto has removed 46 Mt from Reserves, primarily from Gudai-Darri. Rio/uni00A0Tinto's approach to cultural heritage management generally will continue to evolve in response to changes in agreements with Traditional Owners, further engagement with Traditional Owners and changing heritage legislation. Any material changes to Reserves resulting from further refinement of Rio/uni00A0Tinto's approach will be disclosed at the appropriate time.\n- (e) Brockman Ore Reserve tonnes decreased following mining depletion and updated pit designs. Reserves of Brockman ore are 96.4% Rio/uni00A0Tinto owned, 0.7% Eastern Ranges Joint Venture and 3% Hope Downs Joint Venture (based on allocated tonnages).\n- (f) Joint venture discussions with China Baowu Group covering the Western Range Project (Brockman Ore) are continuing.\n- (g) Marra Mamba Ore Reserve tonnes decreased following mining depletion, updated geological models and pit designs. Reserves of Marra Mamba Ore are 82.3% Rio/uni00A0Tinto owned, with/uni00A06.6% being Hope Downs Joint Venture and 11.1% being Robe Joint Venture (based on allocated tonnages).\n- (h) Pisolite Ore Reserve tonnes decreased following mining depletion and an updated geological model. Reserves of Pisolite Ore are 81.3% Rio/uni00A0Tinto owned, with the remaining 18.7% being Robe River Joint Venture (based on allocated tonnages).\n- (i) Reserves at Iron Ore Company of Canada are reported as marketable product (57% pellets and 43% concentrate for sale) at a natural moisture content of 2%. The marketable product is derived from mined material comprising 696 million dry tonnes at 38.6% iron, 36.6% silica, 0.18% alumina, 0.023% phosphorus (Proved) and 448 million dry tonnes at 37.9% iron, 36.8% silica, 0.22% alumina, 0.024% phosphorus (Probable) using process recovery factors derived from current IOC concentrating and pellet operations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This includes an annual review of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves at a Group level, as well as a review of findings and progress from the Group Internal Audit programme.\n\n## Ore Reserves Steering Committee\n\nThe Ore Reserves Steering Committee (ORSC), chaired by the Chief Technical Officer, Development & Technology, meets at least quarterly. The ORSC comprises senior representatives across our technical, financial, governance and business groups and oversees the appointment of Competent Persons nominated by the business units, reviews Exploration Results, Mineral Resource or Ore Reserve data prior to public reporting and oversees the development of the Group Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve standards and guidance.\n\n## Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence\n\nThe Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence contains a dedicated Orebody Knowledge Technical Assurance team. Orebody Knowledge Technical Assurance, in conjunction with the ORSC, is the guardian and author of Group Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve standards and guidance and is responsible for the governance and compilation of Group Mineral Resource, Ore Reserve and reconciliation reporting. The/uni00A0Technical Assurance team also monitors the external reporting environment, facilitates internal audits, and monitors actions with Group Internal Audit.\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nMineral Resource and Ore Reserve internal audits are conducted by independent external consulting personnel in a programme managed by Group Internal Audit with the assistance of the Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence and the ORSC. Material findings are reported outside of the product group reporting line to the Audit Committee, and all reports and action plans are reviewed by the ORSC for alignment to internal and external reporting standards. During 2021, due to COVID restrictions, two internal Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve audits were completed remotely.",

        "page_content": "## Geoscientific information management and assurance\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto employs industry standard drilling, sampling, assaying and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) practices supported by formally documented procedures.\n\nDiamond core and reverse circulation are the primary drilling methods employed, with other methods such as sonic and air core utilised if appropriate for the style of deposit. Drill hole locations are typically confirmed by high-precision differential Global Positioning System (GPS) and down-hole trace positioning is primarily achieved by gyroscopic survey.\n\nDrill sample recovery is typically recorded, and all geological data is collected by qualified geoscientific professionals. Geological logging consistency is secured via formal logging procedures and training, reference materials, application of geological code libraries and digital logging directly to the geological database.\n\nOn-site or commercial laboratories provide appropriate analytical (assaying) techniques according to the commodity and style of deposit. Reliability of assay data is maintained via QA/QC procedures which monitor assay accuracy and precision through the analysis of blanks, sample duplicates and matrix matched certified reference materials.\n\nThe Rio/uni00A0Tinto standard for geoscientific information management is the industry-leading acQuire/.notdef system and strict QA/QC criteria is employed to ensure only high-quality assay data is uploaded to a project's database.\n\n## Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve risk management\n\nRisks to t's Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are managed through comprehensive risk assessments undertaken in support of the annual reporting cycle. Risks are identified and managed by verifying controls, determining and undertaking suitable actions to remove or reduce the risk, conducting reviews and maintaining compliance with standards and procedures. Risks are managed through a commercial risk management solution.\n\nAt the end of each reporting cycle, analysis of the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve risks across all business units is undertaken to ensure both consistency of reporting and to determine if any Group-wide risks to the various processes exist.",

In gathering evidence for our conclusions, our assurance procedures comprised:\n\n- \uf0a7 enquiries with relevant Rio Tinto personnel to understand and evaluate the design and implementation of the key systems, processes and internal controls relevant to the Assured Sustainability Information and GHG Emissions data;\n- \uf0a7 analytical procedures over the Assured Sustainability Information and GHG Emissions data;\n- \uf0a7 risk analysis to validate the completeness of Rio Tinto's materiality assessment;\n- \uf0a7 substantively tested performance data within the Assured Sustainability Information, on a sample basis at corporate and operational level, which included testing a selection of six operations including Oyu Tolgoi Operations, Oyu Tolgoi Underground Project, Tom Price and Marandoo, Boyne Smelters Limited, Quebec Operations (Grande Baie and Laterriere), and Rio Tinto Fer et Titane;\n- \uf0a7 substantively tested the GHG Emissions data, on a sample basis at corporate and operational level, which included testing a selection of eleven operations including Boyne Smelters Limited, Quebec Operations (Grande Baie, Laterriere, AP40, Avida, AP60 and Strathcona), Gladstone Power Station, Queensland Alumina Limited, Tomago, Yarwun, Bell Bay, Kitimat and Kemano, New Zealand Aluminium Smelters, Escondida, and Richards Bay Minerals;\n- \uf0a7 evaluated the design and effectiveness of controls implemented by the Rio Tinto Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Services reporting function over the Assured Sustainability Information and GHG Emissions data;\n- \uf0a7 assessed Rio Tinto's incorporation of the requirements of the ICMM 10 Principles for sustainable development, and the mandatory requirements set out in the ICMM Position Statements, into its own policies, strategies and standards; and\n- \uf0a7 reviewed the Rio Tinto Annual Report 2021, the Rio Tinto Strategic Report 2021 and the Rio Tinto Sustainability Fact Book 2021 in its entirety to ensure they are consistent with our overall knowledge of Rio Tinto.\n\nIn accordance with the Standards we have:\n\n- \uf0a7 used our professional judgement to plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance that we are not aware of any material misstatements in the Assured Sustainability Information, whether due to fraud or error;\n- \uf0a7 used our professional judgement to plan and perform the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance that we are not aware of any material misstatements in the GHG Emissions data, whether due to fraud or error;\n- \uf0a7 considered relevant internal controls when designing our assurance procedures, however we do not express a conclusion on their effectiveness; and\n- \uf0a7 ensured that the engagement team possess the appropriate knowledge, skills and professional competencies.\n\n## How the Standard Defines Reasonable Assurance, Limited Assurance and Material Misstatement\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that it will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\n\nMisstatements, including omissions, are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence relevant decisions of the Directors of Rio Tinto.\n\n## Use of this Assurance Report\n\nThis report has been prepared for the Directors of Rio Tinto for the purpose of providing an assurance conclusion on the Assured Sustainability Information and GHG Emissions data and may not be suitable for another purpose. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report, to any person other than the Directors of Rio Tinto, or for any other purpose than that for which it was prepared.\n\n\u00a92022 KPMG, an Australian partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International  Limited,  a  private  English  company  limited  by  guarantee.

These expressions are used for convenience, since both companies, and other companies in which they directly or indirectly own investments, are separate and distinct legal entities. Likewise, the words 'we', 'us', 'our' and 'ourselves' are used in some places to refer to the companies of the Rio/uni00A0Tinto Group in general. These expressions are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying any particular company or companies. We usually omit 'Limited', 'plc', 'Pty', 'Inc.', 'Limitada', 'L.L.C.', 'A.S.' or 'SA' from Group company names, except to distinguish between Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited. Financial data in US dollars ($) is derived from, and should be read in conjunction with, the 2021 financial statements. In general, where we have provided financial data in pounds sterling (\u00a3) and Australian dollars (A$), it has been translated from the consolidated financial statements, and is provided solely for convenience; exceptions arise where data has been extracted directly from source records. Certain key information has been provided in US dollars, pounds sterling and Australian dollars in the 2021 financial statements.\n\n## History\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto plc was incorporated on 30 March 1962 (then called The Rio/uni00A0Tinto-Zinc Corporation Limited (RTZ)) and was formed by the merger of The Rio/uni00A0Tinto Company Limited and The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited. The Rio/uni00A0Tinto Company was incorporated in 1873 to reopen ancient copper workings in Spain. The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited began operations in the early twentieth century as part of the Australian mining industry. Based at Broken Hill in New South Wales, it began mining silver, lead and zinc deposits and later expanded into lead and zinc smelting.\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto Limited was incorporated on 17 December 1959 (then called The Rio/uni00A0Tinto Mining Company of Australia Pty Limited). In 1962 the Australian interests of The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited and The Rio/uni00A0Tinto Company Limited were merged to form Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited, a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia. In 1980, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited changed its name to CRA Limited.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1995, both RTZ and CRA discovered important mineral deposits, developed major mining projects and grew through/uni00A0acquisition.\n\nRTZ and CRA began operating in 1995 through a dual listed companies structure. In 1997, RTZ became Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and CRA became Rio/uni00A0Tinto/uni00A0Limited.\n\n## Dual listed companies structure\n\nIn 1995, Rio/uni00A0Tinto shareholders approved the terms of the dual listed companies' merger (the DLC structure). The aim was to put shareholders of both companies in substantially the same position they would be in if they held shares in a single entity owning all assets of both companies.\n\nFollowing the approval of the DLC structure, both companies entered into a DLC Merger Sharing Agreement (the Sharing Agreement). As part of this both companies agreed to be managed in a unified way, to share the same Board of Directors, and to put in place arrangements to provide shareholders of both companies with a common economic interest in the DLC structure.\n\nTo achieve this third objective, the Sharing Agreement fixed the ratio of dividend, voting and capital distribution rights attached to each Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc share and each Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited share at an Equalisation Ratio of 1:1. This has remained unchanged ever since, although the Sharing Agreement makes clear this can be revised in special circumstances, for example where certain modifications are made to the share capital of one company (such as rights issues, bonus issues, share splits and share consolidations) but not to the other.\n\nOutside the circumstances specified in the Sharing Agreement, the Equalisation Ratio can only be altered with the approval of shareholders under the class rights action approval procedure, described in the Voting arrangements section below. Any adjustments must be confirmed by the Group's external auditors.\n\nConsistent with the DLC structure, the directors of both companies aim to act in the best interests of Rio/uni00A0Tinto as a whole. The class rights action approval procedure exists to deal with instances where there may be a conflict of interest between the shareholders of the two/uni00A0companies.\n\nTo ensure that the Boards of both companies are identical, resolutions to appoint or remove directors must be put to shareholders of both companies as Joint Decisions, described in the Voting arrangements section below. The Articles of Association of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited make clear that a person can only be a director of one company if he or she is also a director of the other. This/uni00A0means that if a person were removed as a director of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc, he or she would also cease to be a director of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited.\n\nOne consequence of the DLC merger is that Rio/uni00A0Tinto is subject to a wide range of laws, rules and regulatory reviews across multiple jurisdictions. Where these rules differ, Rio/uni00A0Tinto will comply with the requirements in each jurisdiction at a minimum.",

        "page_content": "## Dividend arrangements\n\nThe Sharing Agreement ensures that dividends paid on Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited shares are equalised on a net cash basis without taking into account any associated tax credits. Dividends are determined in US dollars (with the exception of ADR holders, paid in sterling and Australian dollars) and both companies are required to announce and pay dividends and other distributions at the same time or as close to this as possible.\n\nThe payment of dividends between companies and their subsidiaries, including the payment of dividends on the DLC dividend shares, provides the Group with flexibility to manage internal funds and distributable reserves to enable the payment of equalised dividend or equalised capital/uni00A0distributions.\n\nIf the payment of an equalised dividend would contravene the law applicable to one of the companies, they can depart from the Equalisation Ratio. In that situation, the relevant company must put aside reserves for payment on the relevant shares at a later date.\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto shareholders have no direct rights to enforce the dividend equalisation provisions of the Sharing Agreement.\n\n## Voting arrangements\n\nIn principle, the Sharing Agreement enables the shareholders of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited to vote as a joint electorate on any matters that affect them in similar ways. These are referred to as Joint Decisions, and include the creation of new classes of share capital, the appointment or removal of directors and auditors, and the receiving of annual financial statements. All shareholder resolutions that include Joint Decisions are voted on a poll.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement also protects shareholders of both companies by requiring joint approval for decisions that do not affect the shareholders of both companies equally. These are known as class rights actions, and are voted on a poll. For example, fundamental elements of the DLC structure cannot be changed unless approved separately by the shareholders of both companies.\n\nExceptions to these principles can arise in situations such as where legislation requires the separate approval of a decision by the appropriate majority of shareholders in one company, and where approval of the matter by shareholders of the other company is not/uni00A0required.\n\nWhere a matter has been expressly categorised as either a Joint Decision or a class rights action, the directors cannot change that categorisation. If a matter falls within both categories, it is treated as a class rights action. In addition, if an issue is not expressly listed in either category, directors can decide how it should be put to shareholders for/uni00A0approval.\n\nTo support joint voting arrangements, both companies have entered into shareholder voting agreements, where a Special Voting Share is issued to a special purpose company (SVC) and held in trust for shareholders by a common trustee. Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc (RTP) has issued its Special Voting Share (RTP Special Voting Share) to Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited (RTL) Shareholder SVC, while Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited has issued its Special Voting Share (RTL Special Voting Share) to RTP Shareholder SVC. The/uni00A0total number of votes cast on Joint Decisions by the shareholders of one company are decided at a parallel meeting of the other company. The exact role of these SVCs is described below.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, certain shareholders can be excluded from voting at their respective company's general meetings. For example, they may have acquired shares in the other company in excess of a given threshold without making an offer for all the shares in the other company. In this situation, votes cast by these excluded shareholders are disregarded.\n\nFollowing the companies' general meetings, the overall results of the voting are announced to relevant stock exchanges and the media, and published at riotinto.com.\n\nAt a Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc shareholders' meeting during which a Joint Decision is considered, each Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc share carries one vote. The holder of the Special Voting Share has one vote for each vote cast by the public shareholders of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited in their parallel meeting. The holder of the Special Voting Share must vote in accordance with the votes cast by public shareholders for and against the equivalent resolution at the parallel Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited shareholders' meeting. The holders of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited ordinary shares do not hold voting shares in Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc by virtue of their holding in Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited, and cannot enforce the voting arrangements relating to the Special Voting Share.\n\nSimilarly, at a Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited shareholders' meeting during which a Joint Decision is considered, each Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited share carries one vote and the holder of its Special Voting Share will have one vote for each vote cast by the public shareholders of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc in their parallel meeting. The holder of the Special Voting Share must vote in accordance with the votes cast for and against the equivalent resolution at the parallel Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc shareholders' meeting. The holders of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc ordinary shares do not hold any voting shares in Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited by virtue of their holding in Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc, and cannot enforce the voting arrangements relating to the Special Voting Share.\n\n## Capital distribution arrangements\n\nIf either company goes into liquidation, the Sharing Agreement ensures a valuation is made of the surplus assets of both companies. If the surplus assets available for distribution by one company on each of the shares held by its shareholders exceed the surplus assets available for distribution by the other company on each of the shares held by its shareholders, then an equalising payment must be made - to the extent permitted by applicable law - such that the amount available for distribution on each share held by shareholders of both companies reflects the Equalisation Ratio.\n\nThe aim is to ensure the shareholders of both companies have equivalent entitlements to the assets of the combined Group on a per share basis, taking account of the equalisation ratio.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement does not grant any enforceable rights to the shareholders of either company upon liquidation of either company.",

        "page_content": "## Limitations on ownership of shares and merger/uni00A0obligations\n\nThe laws and regulations of the UK and Australia impose restrictions and obligations on persons who control interests in publicly listed companies in excess of defined thresholds. These can include an obligation to make a public offer for all outstanding issued shares of the relevant company. The threshold applicable to Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc under UK law and regulations is 30% and to Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited under Australian law and regulations is 20% on both a standalone and a Joint Decision basis.\n\nAs part of the DLC merger, the Articles of Association of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited were amended with the aim of extending these laws and regulations to the combined enterprise. This amendment also ensures that a person cannot exercise control over one company without having made offers to the public shareholders of both companies.\n\nThis guarantees the equal treatment of both sets of shareholders, and that the two companies are considered as a single economic entity. The/uni00A0Articles of Association of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited impose restrictions on any person who controls, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the votes on a Joint Decision. If,/uni00A0however, such a person has an interest in either Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited or Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc only, then the restrictions only apply if they control, directly or indirectly, 30% or more of the votes at that company's general meetings.\n\nIf one of these thresholds is exceeded, the person cannot attend or vote at general meetings of the relevant company, cannot receive dividends or other distributions from the relevant company, and may be divested of their interest by the directors of the relevant company (subject to certain limited exceptions and notification by the relevant company). These restrictions continue to apply until that person has either made a public offer for all the publicly held shares of the other company, has reduced their controlling interest below the thresholds specified, or has acquired through a permitted means at least 50% of the publicly held shares of each company.\n\nThis arrangement ensures that offers for the publicly held shares of both companies would be required to avoid the restrictions set out above, even if the interests which breach the thresholds are held in just one of the companies. The directors do not have the discretion to exempt a person from the operation of these rules.\n\nUnder the Sharing Agreement, the companies agree to co-operate to enforce the above restrictions contained in their Articles of Association and Constitution.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nIn 1995, each company entered into a deed poll guarantee in favour of creditors of the other company. In addition, each company guaranteed the contractual obligations of the other and the obligations of other persons guaranteed by the other company, subject to certain limited exceptions.\n\nBeneficiaries under deed poll guarantees can make demands on the relevant guarantor without first having recourse to the company or persons whose obligations are being guaranteed. The obligations of the guarantor under each deed poll guarantee expire upon termination of the Sharing Agreement and under other limited circumstances, but only in respect of obligations arising after such termination and, in the case of other limited circumstances, the publication and expiry of due/uni00A0notice.\n\n## Markets\n\n## Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc\n\nThe principal market for Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc shares is the London Stock Exchange, with shares trading through the Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service (SETS) system.\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto plc American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nFurther details relating to Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc ADRs are available in Rio/uni00A0Tinto's Annual Report on Form 20-F.\n\n## Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto Limited shares are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\n\nThe ASX is the principal trading market for Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited shares. The ASX is a national stock exchange with an automated trading system.",

        "page_content": "## Material contracts\n\n## Articles of Association, Constitution, and DLC Sharing Agreement\n\nAs explained on page 410, under the terms of the DLC structure shareholders of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited entered into certain contractual arrangements designed to place the shareholders of both companies in substantially the same position as if they held shares in a single entity which owned all the assets of both companies. As far as is permitted by the UK Companies Act 2006, the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and ASX Listing Rules, this principle is reflected in the Articles of Association of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and in the Constitution of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited. The/uni00A0following summaries describe the material rights of shareholders of both Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited.\n\n## Objects\n\nAt the 2009 AGMs, shareholders of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited approved amendments to their Articles of Association and Constitution whereby the object clauses were removed to allow the companies to have the widest possible scope of activities.\n\n## Directors' interests\n\nUnder Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc's Articles of Association, a director may not vote in respect of any proposal in which he or she, or any other person connected with him or her, has any interest, other than by virtue of his or her interests in shares or debentures or other securities of, in or through the company, except in certain circumstances, including in respect of resolutions:\n\n- - Indemnifying him or her or a third party in respect of obligations incurred by the director on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the company, or in respect of obligations of the company, for which the director has assumed responsibility under an indemnity, security or guarantee.\n- - Relating to an offer of securities in which he or she may be interested as a holder of securities or as an underwriter.\n- - Concerning another body corporate in which the director is beneficially interested in less than 1% of the issued shares of any class of shares of such a body corporate.\n- - Relating to an employee benefit in which the director will share equally with other employees.\n- - Relating to liability insurance that the company is empowered to purchase for the benefit of directors of the company in respect of actions undertaken as directors (or officers) of the company.\n- - Concerning the giving of indemnities in favour of directors or the funding of expenditure by directors to defend criminal, civil or regulatory proceedings or actions against a director.\n\nUnder Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited's Constitution, a director may be present at a meeting of the Board while a matter in which the director has a material personal interest is being considered and may vote in respect of that matter, except where a director is constrained by Australian law.\n\nThe directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the companies to borrow money, to charge any property or business of the companies or all, or any, of their uncalled capital, and to issue debentures or give any other security for a debt, liability or obligation of the companies or of any other person. The directors shall restrict the borrowings of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc to the limitation that the aggregate amount of all monies borrowed by the company and its subsidiaries shall not exceed an amount equal to 1\u00bd times the companies' share capital plus aggregate reserves unless sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of the company.\n\nDirectors are not required to hold any shares of either company by way of qualification. The Remuneration Report on pages 160-198 provides information on shareholding policies relating to executive and Non-Executive Directors. Please refer to the Directors' Report for information on the appointment of directors.\n\n## Rights attaching to shares\n\nUnder UK law, dividends on shares may only be paid out of profits available for distribution, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and by the relevant law. Shareholders are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the directors. Directors may also pay interim dividends to shareholders as justified by the financial position of the Group.\n\nUnder the Australian Corporations Act 2001, dividends on shares may only be paid if the company's assets exceed its liabilities immediately before the dividend is declared, the excess is sufficient for the payment of the dividend, the payment is fair and reasonable to the company's shareholders as a whole, and the payment does not materially prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors. Any Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend was declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and returned to the company. Any Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited dividend unclaimed may be invested or otherwise used by the Board for the benefit of the company until claimed or otherwise disposed of according to Australian law. Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited is governed by the State of Victoria's unclaimed monies legislation, which requires the company to pay to the state revenue office any unclaimed dividend payments of A$20 or more that on 1 March each year have remained unclaimed for over 12 months.",

        "page_content": "## Voting\n\nVoting at any general meeting of shareholders on a resolution on which the holder of the Special Voting Share is entitled to vote shall be decided by a poll, and any other resolution shall be decided by a show of hands unless a poll has been duly demanded. On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy (or other duly authorised representative) and is entitled to vote, has one vote regardless of the number of shares held. The holder of the Special Voting Share is not entitled to vote in a show of hands. On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy (or other duly authorised representative) and is entitled to vote, has one vote for every ordinary share for which he or she is the holder. In the case of Joint Decisions, the holder of the Special Voting Share has one vote for each vote cast in respect of the publicly held shares of the other company.\n\nA poll may be demanded by any of the following:\n\n- - The chairman of the meeting.\n- - At least five shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution.\n- - Any shareholder(s) representing in the aggregate not less than one tenth (Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc) or one 20 th (Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited) of the total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution.\n- - Any shareholder(s) holding Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc shares conferring a right to vote at the meeting on which there have been paid-up sums in the aggregate equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right.\n- - The holder of the Special Voting Share of either company.\n\nA proxy form gives the proxy the authority to demand a poll, or to join others in demanding one.\n\nThe necessary quorum for a Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc general meeting is three members present (in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative) and entitled to vote. For a Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited general meeting it is two members present (in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative).\n\nMatters are transacted at general meetings by the proposing and passing of resolutions as:\n\n- - Ordinary resolutions (for example the election of directors), which require the affirmative vote of a majority of persons voting at a meeting for which there is a quorum.\n- - Special resolutions (for example amending the Articles of Association of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc or the Constitution of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited), which require the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement further classifies resolutions as Joint Decisions and class rights actions as explained on page 410.\n\nAnnual general meetings must be convened with 21 days' written notice for Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc and with 28 days' notice for Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited. In/uni00A0accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc AGM in 2021, other meetings of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc may be convened with 14 days' written notice for the passing of a special resolution, and with 14 days' notice for any other resolution, depending on the nature of the business to be transacted. All meetings of Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited require 28 days' notice. In calculating the period of notice, any time taken to deliver the notice and the day of the meeting itself are not included. The notice must specify the nature of the business to be transacted.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\nIf, at any time, the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to each class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the relevant legislation, the written consent of holders of three-quarters in value of the shares of that class, or upon the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such meeting, all of the provisions of the Articles of Association and Constitution relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum for Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc should be two or more persons who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class.\n\n## Rights upon a winding-up\n\nExcept as the shareholders have agreed or may otherwise agree, upon a winding-up, the balance of assets available for distribution after the payment of all creditors (including certain preferential creditors, whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors) and subject to any special rights attaching to any class of shares, is to be distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according to the amounts paid-up on the shares held by them. This distribution should generally be made in cash. A liquidator may, however, upon the adoption of a special resolution of the shareholders, divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the assets in specie or kind.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement describes the distribution of assets of each of the companies in the event of a liquidation, as explained on page 410.\n\n## Facility agreement\n\nDetails of the Group's $7.5 billion multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities are set out in note 29 to the 2021 financial statements.\n\n## Exchange controls and foreign investment Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc\n\nThere are no UK foreign exchange controls or other restrictions on the import or export of capital by, or on the payment of dividends to, non-resident holders of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc shares, or that materially affect the conduct of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc's operations. It should be noted, however, that various sanctions, laws, regulations or conventions may restrict the import or export of capital by, or the payment of dividends to, non-resident holders of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc shares. There are no restrictions under Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc's Articles of Association or under UK law that specifically limit the right of non-resident owners to hold or vote Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc shares. However, certain of the provisions of the Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the Takeovers Act) described below also apply to the acquisition by non-Australian persons of interests in securities of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc.",

        "page_content": "## Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited\n\nUnder current Australian legislation, Australia does not impose general exchange or foreign currency controls. Subject to some specific requirements and restrictions, Australian and foreign currency may be freely brought into and sent out of Australia. There are requirements to report cash transfers in or out of Australia of A$10,000 or more. There is a prohibition on (or in some cases the specific prior approval of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or Minister for Foreign Affairs must be obtained for) certain payments or other dealings connected with countries or parties identified with terrorism, or to whom United Nations or autonomous Australian sanctions apply. Sanction, anti-money laundering and counterterrorism laws may restrict or prohibit payments, transactions and dealings or require reporting of certain transactions.\n\nRio/uni00A0Tinto Limited may be required to deduct withholding tax from foreign remittances of dividends, to the extent that they are unfranked, and from payments of interest.\n\nAcquisitions of interests in shares, and certain other equity instruments in Australian companies by non-Australian ('foreign') persons are subject to review and approval by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia under the Takeovers Act.\n\nIn broad terms, the Takeovers Act applies to acquisitions of interests in securities in an Australian entity by a foreign person where, as a result, a single foreign person (and any associate) would control 20% or more of the voting power or potential voting power in the entity. The potential voting power in an entity is determined having regard to the voting shares in the entity that would be issued if all rights (whether or not presently exercisable) in the entity were exercised.\n\nThe Takeovers Act also applies to direct investments by foreign government investors, in certain circumstances regardless of the size of the investment. Persons who are proposing relevant acquisitions or transactions may be required to provide notice to the Treasurer before proceeding with the acquisition or transaction.\n\nThe Treasurer has the power to order divestment in cases where relevant acquisitions or transactions have already occurred, including where prior notice to the Treasurer was not required. The Takeovers Act does not affect the rights of owners whose interests are held in compliance with the legislation.\n\n## Limitations on voting and shareholding\n\nExcept for the provisions of the Takeovers Act, there are no limitations imposed by law, Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc's Articles of Association or Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited's Constitution, on the rights of non-residents or foreigners to hold the Group's ordinary shares or ADRs, or to vote that would not apply generally to all shareholders.\n\n## Directors\n\n## Appointment and removal of directors\n\nThe appointment and replacement of directors is governed by Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc's Articles of Association and Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited's Constitution, relevant UK and Australian legislation, and the UK Corporate Governance Code. The/uni00A0Board may appoint a director either to fill a casual vacancy or as an/uni00A0addition to the Board, so long as the total number of directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in these constitutional documents. An/uni00A0appointed director must retire and seek election to office at the next AGM of each company. In addition to any powers of removal conferred by the UK Companies Act 2006 and the Australian Corporations Act 2001, the company may by ordinary resolution remove any director before the expiry of his or her period of office and may, subject to these constitutional documents, by ordinary resolution appoint another person who is willing to act as a director in their place. In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors are required to stand for re-election at each AGM.\n\n## Directors' powers\n\nThe Board manages the business of Rio/uni00A0Tinto under the powers set out in these constitutional documents.

All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report, including, without limitation, those regarding Rio/uni00A0Tinto's financial position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including development plans and objectives relating to Rio/uni00A0Tinto's products, production forecasts and reserve and resource positions), are forward-looking statements. The words 'intend', 'aim', 'project', 'anticipate', 'estimate', 'plan', 'believes', 'expects', 'may', 'should', 'will', 'target', 'set to' or similar expressions, commonly identify such forward-looking statements.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Rio/uni00A0Tinto, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Rio/uni00A0Tinto's present and future business strategies and the environment in which Rio/uni00A0Tinto will operate in the future. Among the important factors that could cause Rio/uni00A0Tinto's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: an inability to live up to Rio/uni00A0Tinto's values and any resultant damage to its reputation; the impacts of geopolitics on trade and investment; the impacts of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon future; an inability to successfully execute and/or realise value from acquisitions and divestments; the level of new ore resources, including the results of exploration programmes and/or acquisitions; disruption to strategic partnerships that play a material role in delivering growth, production, cash or market positioning; damage to Rio/uni00A0Tinto's relationships with communities and governments; an inability to attract and retain requisite skilled people; declines in commodity prices and adverse exchange rate movements; an inability to raise sufficient funds for capital investment; inadequate estimates of ore resources and reserves; delays or overruns of large and complex projects; changes in tax regulation; safety incidents or major hazard events; cyber breaches; physical impacts from climate change; the impacts of water scarcity; natural disasters; an inability to successfully manage the closure, reclamation and rehabilitation of sites; the impacts of civil unrest; the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; breaches of Rio/uni00A0Tinto's policies, standard and procedures, laws or regulations; trade tensions between the world's major economies; increasing societal and investor expectations, in particular with regard to environmental, social and governance considerations; the impacts of technological advancements; and such other risks identified in Rio/uni00A0Tinto's most recent Annual Report and Accounts in Australia and the United Kingdom and the most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC or Form 6-Ks furnished to, or filed with, the SEC. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report. Rio/uni00A0Tinto expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and the Listing Rules of the Australian Securities Exchange) to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Rio/uni00A0Tinto's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nNothing in this report should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Rio/uni00A0Tinto plc or Rio/uni00A0Tinto Limited will necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.",
