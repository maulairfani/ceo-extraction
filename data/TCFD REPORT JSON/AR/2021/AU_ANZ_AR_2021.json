        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe bank has navigated a year of historic health and economic challenges while also supporting our customers and the community.\n\nAs we reflect on the events of 2021, I don't think many of us would have imagined enduring months of further lockdowns this year in Melbourne, Sydney and, most recently, Auckland.\n\nWhile it has been an incredibly difficult period for many, the future does look much brighter as we adjust to the new phase of living with the virus. Impressive vaccination rates provide hope and if we've taken anything from previous lockdowns, it has been the resilience of our people and our customers.\n\nFrom a bank perspective, we delivered a solid financial outcome. Our full-year statutory profit was up 72% to $6.16 billion. While improving economic conditions meant we were able to release some of the credit reserves we put in place for expected losses, the result also demonstrates the benefits of a diverse portfolio.\n\nPrudent risk management over many years has resulted in much lower than anticipated loss rates, capital buffers remain at an historically high-level with a CET1 of 12.3%, while earnings have returned to near where they were pre-COVID-19 and Total Shareholder Returns have substantially improved.\n\nThe overall improved performance of the business has been reflected in our decision to restore dividends close to what they were before the pandemic struck and to lead the industry in returning capital to shareholders.\n\nIn fact, on a pro-forma basis we will have approximately $6 billion of capital above 'unquestionably strong' and will continue to consider the best use of any surplus capital.\n\nHighlights this year have included New Zealand having a strong year and Institutional providing good returns for shareholders.\n\nHowever, we did face challenges and although revenue in our Australia Retail & Commercial business in Australia increased, elevated demand for home loans impacted our ability to process applications in a timely manner which resulted in a loss of market share. There was also a delay with one of our key digital transformation products.\n\nThe Board has exercised its discretion to reduce the variable remuneration as a percentage of target for relevant executives and we are confident the systematic actions being taken by management will address these issues.\n\n## THE BANK WE ARE BUILDING\n\nA joint-venture announced with European-based global payments leader Worldline to provide the most advanced payments technology and merchant services in Australia is the latest example of our simplification program. While we still have some non-core assets, namely our minority investments in Asian banks, the Board and management team are now focused primarily on growing our core franchise.\n\nRapid change and disruption of traditional banking business models are the new normal. At ANZ we are taking advantage of these changes with the 'Bank We Are Building' transformation.\n\nWe will continue to focus on driving simplification and efficiency in our core business while also making significant investments in our digital platforms and advanced analytics capability so we can offer compelling products and services to our customers.\n\nInvestments will also focus on new pivotal partnerships in the emerging digital ecosystems our customers are increasingly using. Our Chief Executive Officer Shayne Elliott discusses this work in more detail in his update.\n\nWe are also acutely aware of the leadership role we play in relation to climate change. While the rapid decarbonisation of the global economy will be a significant business opportunity, there are financial risks associated with lending to customers impacted by climate change. We are committed to play our part in the path to net zero by 2050 and will work with customers to assist them with their transition.\n\n## SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES\n\nCOVID-19 has reinforced the importance of community and I'm proud of the way ANZ has supported those in need through the pandemic.\n\nThe early days rightly prioritised supporting those who had been most impacted by various lockdowns through loan deferrals. These deferrals provided tens of thousands of customers with the critical time required to manage their cashflow through this difficult period.\n\nThere was less demand for customer deferrals this year, however equally important has been our support of the Government loan guarantee programs in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWe also utilised our long experience with financial education to set up a program to specifically help Pacific islanders, arriving in Australia to fill labour shortages, better understand how to manage their money.\n\nANZ of course has large operations in some of the countries hardest hit by COVID-19. India, for example, a country in which we have a deep history, was devastated by its Delta outbreak this year.\n\nWhile we worked hard to support our staff in India, we also donated $1 million to World Vision's India COVID-19 appeal as well as setting aside a further $1 million to match customer and staff donations.\n\nWe have also taken action to ensure our people across our network are supported. Despite almost two years of remote working, our people remain highly engaged and we were pleased to be awarded the Number 1 position in the Australian Financial Review's 'Best Place to Work' awards within our sector.\n\n## BOARD RENEWAL\n\nFirstly, I'd like to acknowledge our former Chairman David Gonski. David retired from the ANZ Board in October last year having made an enormous contribution to our bank during his seven years as Chair. He helped build an organisation with a strong focus on governance, accountability, culture and better customer outcomes. There is no doubt ANZ is in much better shape as a result of his stewardship and on behalf of all shareholders, I thank David for his leadership.\n\nPaula Dwyer will retire from the Board following our Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 16 December 2021. Paula is one of Australia's most respected non-executive directors and we have been incredibly fortunate to have her serve on our Board for the past nine years, particularly in her role as Chair of the Audit Committee. From a personal perspective, I feel privileged to have been able to serve with her and on behalf of all shareholders thank Paula for her dedicated service to our company and wish her well with her future endeavours.\n\nWe are very fortunate to be welcoming Christine O'Reilly to the Board. Christine is an outstanding company director and she will make a significant contribution on behalf of all shareholders. While Christine formally joins the Board on 1 November 2021, she will stand for election as a Director at our AGM .\n\nFinally, as a relatively new Chairman of ANZ, I would like to thank our shareholders for their support through the year. I also acknowledge the hard work and dedication of the 40,000 professionals working at ANZ. The pandemic has meant it has been another challenging year but our team has again stepped up for our customers and shareholders.\n\nPaul D O'Sullivan |  Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## CEO's message\n\nIt has been another significant year in the transformation of ANZ, particularly when considering the impacts COVID-19 is having on our customers and colleagues.\n\nAs we approach the final months of the year, I'm sure we all hoped the pandemic would be largely behind us. It isn't but there are positive signs of a more optimistic 2022.\n\nIt was five years ago we outlined our vision for the future. A future that would see traditional banking models under significant pressure from a range of new competitors.\n\nCustomers want the same experience in banking they can get from online shopping or travel - convenient, safe, always on. At the same time, society expects more from us. Investors and regulators are rightly more sensitive to banks operating in an ethical, environmentally sustainable and transparent manner. Politicians are also holding the industry to greater account.\n\nThe pace of change has been faster than anticipated. Fortunately, we had already made significant progress in readying the organisation for the next phase of our evolution.\n\nWe're now a much simpler and lower risk bank. We focus on the customers for whom we can add value and we've delivered on what we said we would. We are clear on who we bank and how we will drive value for customers and shareholders.\n\nAs the Chairman mentions in his update, we've delivered a solid result this year with highlights being the strong performance in New Zealand and Institutional.\n\n## This leads to the next chapter of the bank we are building.\n\nIt is our purpose - to shape a world where people and communities thrive which directly underpins our strategy of improving the financial wellbeing and sustainability of our customers.\n\nFor the last couple of years we have been working on a program we've internally referred to as 'ANZx'. This is not just a set of new products, rather it's improving the digital capability, the digital 'mindset' if you like, of our entire organisation.\n\nThe first phase of this will be the launch soon of a new proposition we are calling ANZ Plus. Initially focused on savings and deposits, ANZ Plus has been in pilot for a few months and has been specifically designed to help people manage their money better.\n\nBut ANZ Plus is just the very first step in what will be a multi-year roll out of what will eventually become the cornerstone of how our retail and small business customers bank with us in the future.\n\nIt's a growth-oriented strategy - taking the best technology and fintech mindset and applying it to our already strong brand and customer base.\n\nAbove all, it will be a radically different approach focused on growing the financial wellbeing of our customers and we will continue to update shareholders on our progress through the year.\n\nTo help prepare for this new world we also separated our ventures and incubator business, formerly known as ANZi, into a stand-alone entity. This small but important change will accelerate our growth and deliver new digital solutions for our customers.\n\nNow known as 1835i, this independent venture business will operate more like a start-up. We will invest where we see a path to acquire more customers, deepen relationships with existing customers or co-develop new propositions we couldn't develop on our own. ANZ will, of course, continue to fund 1835i's investments and oversee its governance.\n\nAn example of how digital solutions can rapidly improve our operations was the launch this year of ANZ GoBiz. This allows customers to plug their accounting software straight into our systems so we can understand their financials almost instantly and approve working capital loans much faster. We have also digitised processes in the back-end.\n\nIt works with all the major accounting software packages - Xero, MYOB and QuickBooks - covering about 70% of all small businesses in Australia and effectively reduces the time it takes to get the money in the hands of small businesses from 30 to 2 days.\n\nWe are also preparing for one of the mega-trends of the global economy - the rapid transformation of how we produce, distribute and consume energy.\n\nThis is one of the most exciting opportunities for ANZ and we are well-placed to shape and support the required economic transition. In fact, this is a major business opportunity and one in which we already have made significant gains.\n\nKey areas of interest for us include supporting the electrification of the transport supply chain, commercialisation of hydrogen, financing energy efficient buildings and assisting our customers to establish and develop their own transition plans. As well as being a signatory to the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, these are significant areas of commercial opportunity that will underpin ANZ's business for many years to come.\n\nAs we look to our strengths, one of the highlights this year has been the progress we have made in improving the diversity of our workforce. In fact, this year saw the fastest improvement in the representation of Women in Leadership which increased to 35.3%. This is in addition to my executive team which has 40% women and our Board which has 38%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe know there is more to be done which is also why we signed up to Hesta's 40:40 initiative and I was proud we were the only bank among the first ten signatories.\n\nOur progress in building a talented and diverse team has meant some of our most senior women, in particular our former Deputy CEO Alexis George and former CFO Michelle Jablko, have been selected for high-profile and challenging roles outside of the organisation.\n\nWhile this could easily be seen as a negative, I'm incredibly proud we are seen as an organisation that provides people with the opportunities they deserve. It also means we are able to broaden the experience of other executives on the team and, in the case of the CFO, appoint Farhan Faruqui to the role.\n\nFarhan is a deeply experienced global banker who played a crucial role in the re-shaping of ANZ's Institutional and International business and he will make just as important a contribution as our next CFO.\n\nFinally, while this is a period of significant disruption, I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver for all of our stakeholders. We have never been financially stronger, we are investing for growth and we have the team with the mindset and agility to deliver.\n\nI would like to acknowledge our terrific team across the world who have done an outstanding job for their customers, our shareholders and the community. It has been a difficult year for everyone but I continue to be impressed with their resilience and hard work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShayne Elliott |  Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 70 years\n\nas ANZ\n\n## This is a milestone year for us as it marks a major anniversary since the start of the 'modern' ANZ.\n\nIt was in October 1951, 70 years ago, The Bank of Australasia joined with Union Bank of Australia and became ANZ Bank. This was a significant incarnation of a/one.superiorbank whose antecedents stretched back to Cornwall Bank, formed in Launceston in then Van Diemen's Land in 1828.\n\nIn 1963 the bank was the first to 'computerise' and in 1970 merged with the English, Scottish and Australian Bank (ES&A) to become Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited - in what was at the time the largest merger in Australian banking history.\n\nWhile much has changed during this time, we are still the most international of the Australian banks and I'm proud we've retained a culture so focused on our customers, no/one.superiormatter their size or where they are in the world.",

We seek to identify those issues with the most potential to impact our ability to operate successfully and create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nWe use the assessment to inform our strategy, public ESG targets and external reporting.\n\nThis year we obtained stakeholder views on a broad range of ESG issues.\n\nOverall, climate change emerged as the highest priority issue with stakeholders noting both the social and environmental impacts and the influence ANZ can have by deploying capital to finance the transition to a net zero carbon economy. Stakeholders highlighted the risks associated with our current exposure to high emitting sectors, but also emphasised the opportunities associated with the strong growth in sustainable finance.\n\nFairness and ethical conduct continued to be seen as critical to everything we do and key to our social license to operate. Financial wellbeing was viewed as 'core business' and our efforts in this area can improve customer experience and positively impact the broader community. Finally, innovation and technology were seen as essential to supporting customer experience in today's digital world.\n\n## INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF ESG IN BUSINESS STRATEGY\n\nThe bank's response to COVID-19 was well regarded by external stakeholders participating in the assessment, with several commenting there is a continuing role for banks to support customers who find themselves in longer-term financial difficulty. COVID-19 was seen as accelerating the importance of ESG - with a heightened expectation that banks incorporate ESG considerations in their business strategy.\n\n'Every decision made now should be integrating these ESG risks and taking advantage of ESG-related opportunities.'\n\nExternal stakeholder\n\nClimate change: managing the business risks and opportunities associated with climate change. Includes the role we play in supporting our customers to transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nFairness and ethical conduct: a strong corporate culture, known for ethics, values, fairness and transparency. Simple and understandable products and communications (i.e. product disclosure, including bank fees and charges) and appropriate hardship/collections policies.\n\nFinancial wellbeing: promoting and enabling access to safe and affordable products and services, particularly for lower-income and vulnerable consumers. Work with cross-sector partners to help customers, employees and the broader community meet current financial commitments and needs, and improve their financial resilience.\n\nCustomer experience: delivering value and improved customer experience through appropriate financial products and services for all customers, small business and personal.\n\nInnovation and technology: keeping pace with digital innovation to ensure we are offering our customers reliable and convenient products and services in a rapidly changing market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInsights from the assessment were presented to our executive Ethics and Responsible Business Committee and Board Ethics, Environment, Social and Governance Committee and helped to inform the development of our public ESG targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur material ESG issues are 'mapped' to the bank's Key Material Risks on pages 54-55.\n\nThe full list of our material ESG issues, as well as the key steps in the materiality assessment process, are discussed in our 2021 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/annualreport.\n\nDetailed information on other ways in which we have engaged with stakeholders is also included in the 2021 ESG Supplement.",

In particular, we are focusing our efforts on:\n\nFinancial wellbeing - improving the financial wellbeing of our people, customers and the community by helping them make the most of their money throughout their lives\n\nEnvironmental sustainability - supporting household, business and financial practices that improve environmental sustainability\n\nHousing - improving the availability of suitable and affordable housing options for all Australians and New Zealanders\n\nFundamental to our approach is a commitment to fair and responsible banking - keeping pace with the expectations of our customers, employees and the community, behaving fairly and responsibly and maintaining high standards of conduct.\n\nIntegrating ESG and purpose into our strategy has created an opportunity for us to better serve our customers and generate long-term shareholder value.\n\n## Supporting sustainable development\n\nWe are committed to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and believe that business has an important role to play in their achievement. Our 2022 ESG targets support 12 of the 17 SDGs.\n\nIn 2019 we became a founding signatory to the UN Principles for Responsible Banking. Under the Principles we are required to set at least two targets that address our most significant (potential) positive and negative impacts, aligned with the SDGs and the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Further information on our progress towards implementing the Principles, including targets we have set, is in our 2021 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/annualreport.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Technology, Services & Operations and Group Centre -\n\ncomprised of functions that support our business including Risk, Finance, Communications and Public Affairs, Internal Audit and Talent & Culture.\n\n## OUR PURPOSE AND VALUES\n\n## Our purpose is to shape a world where people and communities thrive.\n\nLaunched five years ago, our purpose explains 'why' we exist, guides the decisions we make each day and drives everything we do.\n\nOur values are the foundation of 'how' we work - living our values every day enables us to deliver on our strategy and purpose, strengthen stakeholder relationships and earn the community's trust.

Whether those customers are buying homes, growing small businesses or, in the case of large businesses, trading internationally across our network, we want to help them to succeed.\n\n## SUPPORTING CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nIn Australia, our approach to assisting customers financially impacted by the pandemic has been guided by our 'Statement of/uni00A0Intent' (available at anz.com ), which we developed with key stakeholders. The Statement outlines the support measures available and our commitment to work with customers on a solution that is respectful, fair and appropriate. It is underpinned by four key principles:\n\nProtect\n\nwhat matters\n\nAdapt\n\nto the changing environment with stakeholders\n\nEngage\n\nPrepare\n\nfor the future\n\nFinancial relief measures and ongoing hardship support has been provided for home loan and business customers affected by continuing lockdowns (particularly in New South Wales and Victoria), or those still recovering from earlier lockdowns.\n\nAll retail and commercial customer applications for hardship assistance are managed by our Customer Connect team. Relief measures have been offered after assessing each customer's individual needs and the suitability of hardship assistance.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, we have significantly increased investment in our hardship capabilities. In 2020 we mobilised employees across our branch network and operational teams to meet demand from customers seeking assistance. This cross-skilling of teams has resulted in greater flexibility across our workforce, meaning we can better match capacity to demand as hardship applications fluctuate in response to lockdowns. We have also established hardship teams in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland (in addition to our existing team in Victoria) to enhance local support for our customers and bankers. In addition, we have made it easier for customers to access support, creating a digital hardship portal that allows customers to submit their details (including financial information) online to the Customer Connect team.\n\nIn New Zealand, support measures were reintroduced to help business customers through COVID-19 disruptions in late August. Short-term relief measures included waiving fees for contactless debit cards, access to temporary overdrafts and removing fees for loan restructuring.\n\n## WE HAVE OFFERED A RANGE OF SUPPORT MEASURES FOR CUSTOMERS IMPACTED BY COVID-19 LOCKDOWNS\n\n## Home owners\n\n- \u00b7 Pausing loan repayments (deferrals)\n- \u00b7 Reducing repayments to the minimum repayment amount\n- \u00b7 Accessing redraw and/or offset balance\n- \u00b7 Changing repayments to interest only\n- \u00b7 Refinancing and consolidating any other debts\n- \u00b7 Applying for financial assistance.\n\n## Business loans\n\n- \u00b7 Pausing loan repayments (deferrals)\n- \u00b7 Providing access to new loans and government support schemes\n- \u00b7 Temporary increases in overdraft facilities for 12 months\n- \u00b7 Additional support for Asset Finance, Commercial Cards, Trade and Merchants products.\n\n## HIGHLIGHT\n\nIn partnership with a specialist wellbeing organisation, Benestar, we have introduced a customer support program providing free and confidential counselling to Australian based customers experiencing distress - whether it be as a result of domestic violence, mental health difficulties, bereavement or a range of other factors. The program includes up to five free counselling sessions with clinicians specialising in psychological support. If a customer requires ongoing support they may be referred to relevant community services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on support available to customers experiencing financial hardship or vulnerability is in our 2021 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/annualreport.",

More than 2.1 million customers are actively using ANZ Internet Banking and Internet Banking for Business. New registrations for Internet Banking for Business are up 20% compared to last year, and business transactions have increased by 11%, indicating our business customers are also increasingly moving towards digital self-service.\n\nWe have added features to the ANZ App to enhance our customers' financial wellbeing. For example:\n\n- \u00b7 New customers can now join ANZ and open their first savings account through the App. More than 68,000 savings accounts have been opened since the feature was launched in October 2020, representing almost 50% of all new Progress Saver accounts opened.\n- \u00b7 We have enhanced the 'Save for a Goal' feature, introducing two new 'nudges' to kick start customers' savings goals, informing them when they're falling behind their goal target and providing ideas for how to get back on track. Customers have now set up over 500,000 savings goals in the App.\n- \u00b7 Customers can apply a gambling block to prevent gambling transactions on an eligible credit card.\n- \u00b7 Customers with an ANZ Smart Choice Super account can search and consolidate their super by using the updated Australian Taxation Office SuperMatch service in the App.\n\nGuy 'Ted' Salmond\n\n|  95 years old\n\nIn New Zealand , almost 1.6 million customers are now using our digital self-service channels, goMoney App and Internet Banking, with over 97,000 new registrations in 2021. This year, more than 72,800 accounts have been opened using Internet Banking or goMoney. In the past three months digital sales represented 49% of/uni00A0all new accounts opened.\n\nNew features added to the goMoney App include:\n\n- \u00b7 Eligible new customers can join ANZ via the goMoney App, with the majority also able to complete the identity and credit check process within the App.\n- \u00b7 The ability to decrease credit card limits, helping customers take control of their spending and manage their credit card. A total of 12,287 decreases have been completed this year, for a total limit value of NZ$39.2 million.\n- \u00b7 Payments requiring more than one authoriser can now be created and authorised in Internet Banking and goMoney, without the need to visit a branch or contact us. Since the feature was enabled, 128,485 payments have been authorised. This was a key part of helping our customers with their banking while we removed cheques as a payment method. We also ran customer education campaigns, focused particularly on supporting vulnerable customers. At the end of May 2021, ANZ became the first major New Zealand bank to remove cheques as a payment method.\n\nSelf-service banking sits within the context of a broader societal shift - in the way people shop, interact with services - and even interact with each other.\n\nWe want to support customers of all ages and abilities to bank digitally with confidence and will seek to ensure our apps continue to incorporate the latest adaptive and assistive technologies of the major smartphone platforms.\n\nIn July 2020, we established a new Retail Customer Care team in Australia to contact all customers older than 65 years, as well as frequent branch users impacted by branch closures. Since then we have contacted 105,000 customers to discuss alternative ways to bank and the self-service options available.\n\n## DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION - THE KEY TO BUILDING A BETTER BANK\n\nA key element of our strategy is the delivery of a digital transformation that will help us build a substantially better bank one that provides tools, support and insights customers need to improve their financial wellbeing.\n\nWe are investing heavily in this transformation, prioritising digital products; improved use of data and analytics; innovative strategic partnerships; a refreshed brand proposition; and human-centred design.\n\n## Our Australian business\n\nOur transformation goals are focused on the delivery of:\n\n- \u00b7 A small number of purpose-led propositions that people love to use\n- \u00b7 A mobile-first human supported distribution model\n- \u00b7 A simplified, high integrity, highly automated digital platform\n- \u00b7 A customer-centric culture and leading workplace.\n\nRetail customers in Australia will soon see change delivered through our new and different ANZ Plus customer proposition.\n\nOne of the first things our customers will see is a new digital banking proposition to help people to manage their money better by spending less, saving more and creating healthy money habits.\n\nANZ Plus includes, among other things, an intelligent mobile banking app, two new bank accounts, and access to coaches - all designed to help our customers improve their financial wellbeing over time.\n\nWe are simplifying what we do, reducing the number of systems we operate, cutting the length of customer terms and conditions, and using the right tools and technology to build a quality, automated, digital experience.\n\n## Our Institutional business\n\nIn our Institutional business, the digital transformation is focused on making it simple and easy for our customers to do business with us by providing them with a digitally connected experience.\n\nAn example is the work we have done to build a business that allows our customers to integrate their systems with ours to automate payments and reconciliations processes. Receivables data has increased by 37% since 2019, helping more customers auto-reconcile their incoming payments, enabling funds to be deployed as quickly as possible.\n\nAnother example is our platform and payments work to help our customers provide payments to their customers and employees. Payments through our digital channels has grown by 30% since 2019, powering transactions for our customers, as well as customers of other banks where we process payments on their behalf.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Earlier this year we launched our new digital lending platform for small businesses, ANZ GoBiz.\n\nUsing agile ways of working, we established cross-functional delivery 'squads' comprised of frontline bankers, technology architects, experience designers, data engineers, credit risk and assurance experts. Collaborating remotely, the team devised a way to integrate external financial data to provide the instant lending decisions our business customers were seeking. A process that previously took more than 30 days to complete now takes around two days, with loan applications made via a smart phone receiving conditional approval within minutes.\n\nThis year, there was a 27% uptake of women in leadership roles participating in the one-day Business Growth CEO Clinics.\n\nOne of these women was Maria Konecsny, who co-founded Gew\u00fcrzhaus, a specialist Australian spice retailer, with her sister Eva.\n\nPassionate about creating a workplace and a business that challenges 'business as usual', Maria uses care and creativity to responsibly address sustainability at Gew\u00fcrzhaus.\n\nOn her success, Maria says it was about doing things for the right reasons from the start - 'no compromise on quality, no compromise on deeply engaging with our customers.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are assisting our Institutional customers through our market-leading New Payments Platform (NPP)/one.superior offering.

The sustainability-linked bond commits Wesfarmers to key sustainability targets.\n\nAs part of the transaction, Wesfarmers has committed to obtain all of the electricity volume requirements for its Bunnings, Kmart Group and Officeworks retail businesses from renewable sources by the end of 2025. The company has also committed to limit the average emissions intensity of its ammonium nitrate production plant to 0.25 tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO/two.denominatore) per tonne produced by the end of 2025.\n\nIn May 2021, ANZ Bank New Zealand partnered with Kathmandu Holdings Limited to establish a syndicated $100 million Sustainability-Linked Loan (SLL) facility, the largest syndicated SLL in the New Zealand market to date.\n\nIn 2021 we saw record growth, completing 81 transactions, in/uni00A0comparison to 39 transactions in 2020. These transactions, comprising capital markets distribution and balance sheet lending, totalled $10.5 billion compared to $6.5 billion in 2020. This business contributes materially to ANZ's $50 billion sustainable solutions/uni00A0target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on sustainable finance is in our 2021 ESG Supplement available at  anz.com/annualreport .\n\nKathmandu's SLL will be measured against a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, B Corp certification, and improving the transparency, wellbeing and labour conditions for workers in its supply chain.\n\nKathmandu Holdings Group CFO Chris Kinraid commented: 'Sustainability is in our DNA and is a core foundation of the Group, linking our financial arrangements to our sustainability goals made perfect sense. It reinforces to our shareholders and stakeholders that we are committed to sustainability across all aspects of our Group'.\n\nANZ worked with both Wesfarmers and Kathmandu to structure their deals in line with market best practice, ensuring targets set were ambitious and material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs Kilter Rural CEO Cullen Gunn explains, 'We focus on improving Australian farmland and delivering returns while doing it. We work with investors - mainly based in urban centres - and deliver resources into under-capitalised rural regions.'\n\nBy 2050 it is estimated 50% more people will need to be fed, globally. Cullen believes to achieve this, the world's current agricultural footprint must be stabilised and more food needs to be/one.superiorproduced through the regeneration of existing, often degraded, farmland.\n\nANZ is supporting investment opportunities that achieve commercial, environmental and social outcomes and is providing around $5 million of working capital for Kilter Rural's Australian Farmlands Fund (KAFF).\n\nEstablished in 2018, the KAFF has a mandate to invest in a portfolio of irrigated farmland and water entitlements within the southern Murray-Darling Basin.\n\nUp to 30% of farmland will be actively reforested for biodiversity protection and climate change mitigation outcomes. It/one.superioraims to build long-term investor value through improving the condition of natural capital and earning payments for carbon sequestration.\n\nTo date, the fund has raised $44 million and purchased five farms in/one.superiorNorthern Victoria which were under-utilised and considered unproductive in terms of financial and environmental outcomes.\n\n'Australia is in a really good position to do this. We are regenerating already highly modified, under-utilised farmland and remediating it for agricultural and conservation purposes,' Gunn says.",

Current deferrals make up only ~1% of the total deferrals provided up to 31 January 2021.\n\nThis year in Australia we increased our home loan balance by $3 billion to $278 billion to help our customers buy and own a home.\n\nOur home loan balance in New Zealand grew NZ$10 billion this year to NZ$94 billion to help our customers buy and own a home.\n\n## CASE STUDY\n\n## Providing affordable accommodation for essential workers\n\nAustralia has among the highest levels of home ownership in the world, but is also ranked in the top 10 for the highest levels of unaffordability for home purchase and rental. The availability of suitable and affordable housing is an issue for many in the community, particularly as house prices have risen sharply in the past 12 months.\n\nMany key workers in essential industries such as health, education, emergency services and law enforcement are directly impacted. Due to a lack of affordable housing in Australian metropolitan areas, many key workers are unable to pay market rents close to their place of work, on top of their general living expenses.\n\nThe difficulty of finding affordable housing close to their workplaces means that many key workers have to relocate or travel long distances to get to work. A long\n\nWe are committed to improving the availability of suitable and affordable housing options for all Australians and New Zealanders, and have targets to:\n\n- \u00b7 Fund and facilitate $10 billion of investment by 2030 to deliver more affordable, accessible and sustainable homes to buy and rent in Australia and New Zealand\n- \u00b7 Support more customers into healthier homes with our Health Home Loan Package and Interest-free insulation loans in New Zealand.\n\nOur work spans many sub-sectors of the market, including affordable housing, specialist disability accommodation, aged care and homelessness. Key initiatives delivered include:\n\n- \u00b7 Joint arranger of all five bond issuances for the Commonwealth's National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (NHFIC) over the last three years totaling approximately $2 billion. The capital raised allows NHFIC to provide low cost, long-term loans to registered community housing providers to support the provision of more social and affordable housing.\n- \u00b7 Lead commercial financier of over $226 million in committed facilities in the Specialist Disability Accommodation sector.\n- \u00b7 Lead financier to the Land Lease Community sector, designed to deliver affordable seniors housing.\n- \u00b7 Advocating for institutional investment in long-term rental housing through the backing of a range of 'build-to-hold' and 'build-to-rent' projects.\n\ncommute is expensive and can also impact the ability of these workers to participate in family and community life.\n\nTo increase the availability of affordable rental housing for key workers, we have supported both Aware Super and their community housing provider partners. This support includes the provision of a $90 million funding facility to assist in financing Aware Super's portfolio of key worker affordable housing. We intend to increase our funding in this area as the portfolio grows.\n\nThe portfolio currently consists of around 235 units across New South Wales and Victoria - a combination of completed projects and developments still under construction. Once developed, these properties will be rented at a 20% discount off market rent to key workers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information about housing is in our 2021 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/annualreport.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA\n\nustralia suff\n\ners fr\n\nom a chr\n\nonic lack of housing\n\nI\n\nt is estimat\n\ned ther\n\ne is an immediat\n\ne need f\n\nor at least 10,000 ne\n\nw\n\nwill allo\n\nw f\n\nor the expansion of homes acr\n\noss Ne\n\nw S\n\nouth\n\nW\n\nales\n\n,\n\nI\n\nn 2021 w\n\ne pr\n\no\n\nvided a $100 million loan t\n\no a por\n\ntf\n\nolio of SD\n\nA, t\n\no\n\nsuppor\n\nt M\n\nacquar\n\nie A\n\nssett M\n\nanagement and Summer Housing\n\n.\n\nT\n\nhis loan is underst\n\nood t\n\no be the lar\n\ngest SD\n\nA deal t\n\no dat\n\ne\n\n, and\n\nappr\n\no\n\nximat\n\nely 650 A\n\nustralians - ar\n\nound 6.5% of r\n\nequir\n\ned SD\n\nA places\n\n.\n\nin\n\nv\n\nestment ensur\n\nes the de\n\nv\n\nelopment of ne\n\nw SD\n\nA homes f\n\nor\n\nhousing in the SD\n\nA sec\n\nt\n\nor\n\n.\n\nW\n\ne ar\n\ne the lar\n\ngest commer\n\ncial financer\n\nsupply f\n\nor people with disabilit\n\ny\n\n.\n\nSpecialist Disabilit\n\ny A\n\nccommodation (SD\n\nA) places in A\n\nustralia, with\n\nan associat\n\ned cost of o\n\nv\n\ner $10 billion.\n\nT\n\nhis in\n\nv\n\nestment is necessar\n\ny\n\nt\n\no pr\n\no\n\nvide suitable alt\n\ner\n\nnativ\n\ne accommodation f\n\nor y\n\nounger people\n\nin aged car\n\ne and others with unmet needs\n\n.\n\nANZ is committ\n\ned t\n\no g\n\nr\n\no\n\nwing the pipeline of ne\n\nw pur\n\npose\n\n-built\n\nof SD\n\nA, in\n\nv\n\nesting o\n\nv\n\ner $226 million in committ\n\ned facilities\n\n.\n\nT\n\nhis\n\nT\n\no fur\n\nther incr\n\nease the supply of housing f\n\nor people with\n\ndisabilit\n\ny\n\n, w\n\ne ar\n\ne also w\n\nor\n\nk\n\ning with SD\n\nA pr\n\no\n\nviders and our\n\nexisting pr\n\noper\n\nt\n\ny clients t\n\no facilitat\n\ne the inclusion of SD\n\nA in\n\nfutur\n\ne pr\n\noper\n\nt\n\ny de\n\nv\n\nelopments\n\n.\n\nT\n\nhese initiativ\n\nes will go some wa\n\ny t\n\no easing the acut\n\ne shor\n\ntage\n\nof A\n\nustralian pur\n\npose\n\n-built housing f\n\nor people with disabilit\n\ny\n\nneeds and will allo\n\nw r\n\nesidents t\n\no achie\n\nv\n\ne as much independence\n\nas possible\n\n.\n\nOur SD\n\nA financing contr\n\nibut\n\nes t\n\no our tar\n\nget t\n\no fund and facilitat\n\ne\n\n$10 billion of in\n\nv\n\nestment in aff\n\nor\n\ndable\n\n, accessible and sustainable\n\nhousing b\n\ny 2030.\n\nQueensland\n\n,\n\nV\n\nic\n\nt\n\nor\n\nia and\n\nW\n\nest\n\ner\n\nn A\n\nustralia.\n\nT\n\nhe transac\n\ntion is\n\nstruc\n\ntur\n\ned t\n\no allo\n\nw f\n\nor ne\n\nw SD\n\nA pr\n\no\n\nviders t\n\no be added as the\n\npipeline of homes incr\n\nease\n\n.",

Our most recent update (as at 9/uni00A0September 2021) is available at anz.com .\n\n- \u00b7 41 of the Royal Commission's 76 recommendations are assessed as directly applicable to ANZ. Of these, we have completed actions relevant to 11 recommendations, including the four directed at banks for direct implementation. Work relevant to 13 recommendations is underway. The remaining 17 recommendations require actions by government, regulators or the ABA before we take any further steps.\n- \u00b7 We also made 16 commitments in February 2019, taking action to respond to a number of Commissioner Hayne's recommendations and comments. These commitments were made to improve the treatment of retail customers, small businesses and farmers in Australia.\n- - We have completed 12 of our 16 commitments. This year we completed the requirements of the Financial Sector Reform Act 2021 in relation to ongoing fee arrangements (commitment/uni00A016).\n- - Of the four remaining commitments, three are dependent on reforms to the Banking Executive Accountability Regime that will be effected through the Financial Accountability Regime, and one relates to our ongoing work on culture.\n\nMany of the recommendations in the Royal Commission's final report require legislative change. We continue to engage constructively with government, regulators and industry as they respond to these.\n\n## LINKS TO 2021 GROUP PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK\n\nWe have continued to demonstrate our commitment to improve the financial wellbeing of our customers. Sound progress has been made to deliver great outcomes across key segments, however after a strong first half, we experienced material challenges processing home loan application volumes in Australia. This has resulted in our customers experiencing\n\nlonger than expected wait times for loan approval decisions and increased volumes in our assessment backlog. While we were able to tactically manage and improve the situation, strengthening our policy and processes in this area remains a high priority focus.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee section 4.5.3 of the Remuneration Report for more details.\n\n## Our APRA Risk Governance Self-Assessment Plan\n\nOur Risk Governance Oversight Committee (formerly the Royal Commission and Self-Assessment Oversight Group) monitors progress with our Risk Governance Self-Assessment (RGSA) Plan. The Committee is chaired by our Chief Risk Officer and provides regular progress updates to the Executive Committee and the Board.\n\nWe have made significant progress across the five focus areas in our RGSA Plan: Culture; Governance and Accountability; Management of Operational Risk; Remediation; and Simplification. For example, we have:\n\n- \u00b7 Built a strong, purpose-led culture (see page 29)\n- \u00b7 Ensured accountabilities are clear and applied consequences where there are failings, in line with our strengthened Accountability and Consequence Framework (introduced in 2019)\n- \u00b7 Matured our approach to risk culture and risk management (see page 29)\n- \u00b7 Remediated customer accounts (see below)\n- \u00b7 Simplified our business, products and processes\n\nOur RGSA Plan is well progressed, with clear accountability for and commitment to the remaining actions.\n\nIt is important to us that all of these actions deliver better outcomes for our customers, our shareholders and the community, and the changes we have made will endure.\n\n## Customer remediation\n\nAs discussed above, we are working hard to rebuild trust by identifying our mistakes, fixing them and providing fair, consistent and timely remediation to our customers when we fail to get it right. Across the Group we have close to 830 people focused on the execution of customer remediation/one.superior, both within and outside dedicated remediation teams.

The team has almost 125 people dedicated to remediation matters. As at 30 September 2021, the team has remediated over 52,000/three.superior cases for inappropriate advice and fees for no service in total and made payments of $183.3 million. This includes the remediation matters which are being completed for the ex-ANZ-owned aligned dealer groups (RI Advice, Financial Services Partners, and Millennium 3) now owned by IOOF. ANZ acts as the agent for IOOF to complete the remediation.\n\nThe Group's customer remediation activities are regularly reviewed by the Board. Directors are provided an overview of the status of remediation matters; regulator engagement; repayments and provisioning; and reviews underway to identify new matters.\n\n## Managing customer complaints\n\nWe seek to resolve complaints with empathy and fairness and are committed to listening to, and learning from, customer feedback so that we can improve our products and services and deliver better customer outcomes.\n\n## NET PROMOTER SCORE\n\n## AUSTRALIA\n\n## NEW ZEALAND\n\n## Retail: scored -4.3, ranked 4th/four.superior\n\n(down from -1.3, ranked 3rd at end of 2020)\n\nCommercial: scored -19.0, ranked 4th/five.superior (down from -17.1, ranked 4th at end of 2020)\n\nInstitutional: scored 36, ranked 2nd/six.superior (up from 33, ranked 1st in 2020)\n\nRetail: scored 28.4, ranked 4th/seven.superior\n\n(up from 27.3, ranked 4th at end of 2020)\n\nDuring the year we have enhanced our complaints handling capabilities in Australia, delivering a new complaints recording and management program to around 11,000 customer facing staff who service our Retail and Commercial customers.

NPS enables us to gauge whether we are meeting customer needs and expectations and how we are performing relative to peers. It is measured by asking customers how likely they are to recommend ANZ (on a 0-10 scale) and is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors (those who give a score of 0-6) from the percentage of promoters (those who give a 9 or 10).\n\nWhile our NPS has improved for our retail customers in New Zealand, it has decreased for our Retail and Commercial customers in Australia and our commercial and agricultural customers in New Zealand. We have failed to improve our performance relative to our peers. Our Institutional NPS has increased in both Australia and New Zealand compared to prior years.

Until then, we remain flexible to help our customers navigate the uncertainty.\n\nOur Retail customers are increasing their use of digital and mobile banking options. Home loan activity within the economy is particularly strong. Our Retail customers are working on their financial wellbeing by saving more, reducing debt and reviewing their home loans. Our Commercial customers are tackling the uncertainty by innovating, adapting and reviewing their financial commitments. As we head into 2022, we face considerable challenges including a low-growth and interest rate environment and margin pressures.\n\n## STRATEGY AND FOCUS\n\nWe are delivering on our strategy, in line with our purpose by supporting business owners and home owners in uncertain times, as we prepare for a digitally-enabled future. Since 2019, home loan application volumes have doubled, particularly in the refinance market with customers moving to fixed rates, resulting in pressure on our application turnaround times. We have made progress on improving turnaround times for our customers and are increasing our focus on opportunities to automate and simplify.\n\nFor our business owners, we have identified the need to modernise our platforms and processes to meet customer expectations for efficient and digital service. We have commenced building the foundations through delivering new digital propositions, including our Online Business Lending platform, ANZ GoBiz. We continue to explore innovative ways to support our business owners.\n\nIn preparation for a digital-enabled future, we have been progressively reshaping our branch network and supporting simpler customer requests digitally. This is a key part of the bank's transformation agenda.\n\n## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CASH CONTINUING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n| Cash          | FY21   |       | Growth (%)                 |                    | FY21   |         |\n|---------------|--------|-------|----------------------------|--------------------|--------|---------|\n| profit ($m)   | FY20   | 3,617 | Net Loans &  Advances ($b) | FY20               |        | 341,233 |\n|               |        | 2,337 | 55 %                       |                    |        |         |\n|               |        |       |                            |                    |        | 339,381 |\n| Return on     | FY21   |       | Growth (%)                 | Customer           | FY21   |         |\n| Avg.

We/uni00A0have also invested in staff training and a new complaints management system to ensure we are delivering on customer promises and continuously improving our products and services.\n\nLooking ahead, our vision is to be the partner of choice for home owners and business owners and to improve their financial wellbeing. To do this we will focus on a small number of purposeled propositions that serve our customers through a digital-first, human-supported model. As we improve efficiency and reliability, disciplined cost and margin management will remain a key focus.\n\n## PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS\n\nOn balance, we have delivered a solid performance across a diverse business while navigating some strong headwinds.\n\nCash profit increased 55% year on year, with growth in both lending and customer deposits, a good margin performance and continued cost discipline. While home loan revenue growth was in the low double digits, second half volumes were impacted by a competitive refinancing market, customers paying down their loans faster and processing issues. We have been working on a range of operational and policy changes and those actions are already having a positive impact on processing times.\n\nCustomer deposits were up ~$18billion in the year, with Retail, and Commercial and Private Bank deposits growing 6% and 10% respectively. Many customers are moving their money from term deposits to at-call so they have greater flexibility.\n\nCommercial lending remained broadly flat year-on-year in an environment of economic uncertainty and lower levels of business confidence. Despite the weaker demand, lending was up 1% in our business banking segment in the second half.\n\nApplications for ANZ GoBiz have averaged 2,900 per-month since launching in May 2021, providing real-time conditional approval through an online platform, including new-to-bank customers.\n\n## OUR DIVISIONS\n\n## Institutional\n\nThis year our global banking network, insights and expertise supported companies needing to move goods and capital around the region. We continued to deliver for both shareholders and clients, deepening relationships with our high-quality customer base and delivering strong returns, while building and supporting a market-leading team.\n\nMark Whelan |  Group Executive Institutional\n\n## OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nMarket conditions normalised in 2021, as companies re-established and re-configured supply chains following periods of significant interruption in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Customers were initially more focused on repaying facilities, which reduced demand for credit. As customers adapted to changing market conditions they sought opportunities to grow their businesses, including through mergers and acquisitions. This led to in an increase in activity for our Corporate Finance and Corporate Advisory services across the network (particularly in Australia), and a 4% increase in revenue.\n\nAs expected, income from our Markets businesses steadied to $2 billion in 2021 as the market volatility experienced in 2020 normalised, and liquidity increased. Record low interest rates continued to constrict margins for our Payments and Cash Management products.\n\n## STRATEGY AND FOCUS\n\nOver the past five years the Institutional business has transformed. We have scaled back the number of customers we support, and simplified our business significantly to ensure a better experience for both our people and our customers. These changes positioned the business well for the challenges and opportunities created by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been able to respond quickly to shifts in customer demand and have proven to be more resilient through the cycle.\n\nWe have stronger customer relationships, improved margins and risk management, disciplined growth, focused cost management and a return on equity above the cost of capital. Our network across 32 markets continued to differentiate us from domestic competitors and drove significant activity and volumes in our home markets. It also provided diversification for our customers at times when supply chains faced challenges.\n\n## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE CASH CONTINUING\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur ongoing investment in digital platforms helped drive efficiencies and improve customer experience. Payments volumes grew by 24% while in cyber security, we have continued to reduce fraud for our customers, down year-on-year by 17%.\n\n## PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS\n\nA focus on execution, responsible growth and risk management saw Institutional again deliver $1.9 billion in profit at returns above the cost of capital despite the challenging environment. The division's focus on productivity contributed to another year of cost reduction, with costs falling by 4% in 2021. The division has now reduced costs for 11 consecutive half-year periods.\n\nNet loans and advances were flat with improved momentum in the second half of the year (half-on-half growth 7%), while customer deposits grew by 7%. Credit charges were negative for the year reflecting the continued strength in the credit quality of the book.\n\nANZ maintained its position as the #1 Institutional bank in Australia and New Zealand for relationship quality, as measured by a survey of Corporate and Institutional customers by Peter Lee and Associates, for the sixth year in a row. Customers called out ANZ's support for customers through the pandemic, rating the bank #1 for COVID-19 support.\n\nSimilarly, ANZ Institutional was again named #1 for Relationship Quality in Asia, and a top five Corporate Bank for overall market penetration in Asia by Greenwich.\n\nPeter Lee also ranked ANZ as clear market leader in ESG and Sustainable Finance. Globally, ANZ participated in $119 billion of Sustainable Finance deals, up from $4 billion five years ago. Our bankers are assisting businesses in their transition to a low carbon economy and helping directly link their funding costs to sustainable business goals.",

This stems from our recognition that an organisation's success is dependent on the success of the communities they are part of.\n\nAntonia Watson |  Chief Executive Officer New Zealand\n\n## OPERATING ENVIRONMENT\n\nNew Zealand experienced a strong rebound in economic activity following the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns. Household and business confidence surveys recovered quickly and investment had picked up prior to the August 2021 outbreak. However, the environment remains uncertain.\n\nThe Government's income support measures have kept workers employed and most businesses afloat. Provided that Aotearoa does not see continued outbreaks, the labour market should continue to tighten. Record house price inflation following the 2020 lockdown has caused concern about affordability, especially for first home buyers, although this inflation has now slowed. Consistent with a slowing global recovery, commodity prices may have reached their cyclical peak, which could weigh on export returns.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of New Zealand has projected rate increases over the next two years but this outlook could change. Uncertainty will linger as long as the threat of future lockdowns remain.\n\n## STRATEGY AND FOCUS\n\nIn line with our simplification strategy we have implemented our new customer referral model. This aims to match customers' personal and business banking needs with the most appropriate banking specialist to meet their needs. We reintroduced targeted support measures to help customers through the COVID-19 lockdowns, including waiving fees for contactless debit cards and access to temporary overdrafts.\n\nTo help bring balance to the housing market and help New Zealanders into homes, we voluntarily increased the deposit required from residential property investors to 40%, lowered the deposit required for people to buy small apartments and introduced a discount to the floating rate on new builds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe commenced the wind up of the Bonus Bonds Scheme by contacting customers to pay out refunds and reserves payments.\n\nWe continued to engage industry frameworks to support the transition to net zero, including being a founding sponsor of Toit\u016b Tahua, the Centre for Sustainable Finance, and playing a critical role in developing the Sustainable Agriculture Finance Initiative. On sustainable finance, this year we acted as a lead manager on 13 green, social or sustainable (GSS) bond transactions and one Sustainability Linked Loan totalling over NZ$5 billion.\n\nOur proportion of women in leadership increased to 37% and we appointed our first Te Kaitohu Rautaki M\u0101ori (Head of Te Ao M\u0101ori Strategy).\n\n## PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS\n\nWe saw strong revenue momentum and lower credit impairment charges driven by a credit impairment release, reflecting an improved economic outlook. Net loans and advances grew 7% driven by strong home lending growth of 10%, reflecting the market's historically low interest rates and supply constraints. Unsurprisingly, we have seen subdued customer deposit growth of 4% in this low rate environment.\n\nWe have maintained a leading position in core banking products with ~30% share of mortgages, ~33% share of household deposits (August 2021) and ~21% share of KiwiSaver (June 2021).\n\nOur focus on improving customer experiences has seen strong migration to our digital channels, with a reduction in over-thecounter transactions and contact centre calls.\n\nOur Staff Foundation distributed over NZ$1.2 million in donations to 103 charities across New Zealand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Cash profit  (NZDm)      | FY21   |       | Growth (%) 49   | Net Loans &  Advances   | 134,537   |\n|--------------------------|--------|-------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------|\n| Cash profit  (NZDm)      | FY21   | 1,079 | Growth (%) 49   | Net Loans &  Advances   | 125,981   |\n| Return on  Avg.

In moving to our new ways of working we have been conscious of how we can continue to build and maintain ANZ's culture while giving our people the opportunity to work flexibly and continue doing their best work.\n\nWe now have many flexible working modes: workplace first, where employees perform their work from an ANZ workplace most or all of/uni00A0the time; blended, where employees spend some time in the week in an ANZ workplace; and remote first, where employees perform their work remotely, occasionally visiting an ANZ workplace. The vast majority of our employees' roles , now and in the future, fit within the blended mode.\n\nComing together in our ANZ workplaces plays an important role in how we learn and grow and helps employees who are new to ANZ to build their networks and develop an understanding of our culture. Enabling the majority of our people to work in a blended way gives them the best of both worlds: the opportunity to structure their working life in a way that provides greater flexibility to work from home, and to be in the office for the critical, and often intangible, benefits of developing our culture, building social networks and learning from - and mentoring - colleagues.\n\n## CULTURE\n\nWe continue to develop and embed a culture focused on delivering great customer outcomes, making things simpler and 'always learning'. This work is underpinned by our purpose and values.\n\nThis year, we finalised the design of a new culture and behaviour framework. Developed with input from across the Group, the framework complements our values, building on and respecting our past, while orienting us towards the future. To deliver our purpose and strategy, we need to: create opportunities by bringing in the best ideas from inside and outside ANZ to create long-term value for our customers and the bank; deliver what matters by executing well on the things that matter most; and succeed together by engaging the right people, listening to and challenging each other. As we head into the new financial year, we will start to see this come to life, with a focus on ensuring it is real and relevant to our people and reinforced through our learning programs, people processes and systems.\n\nWe have made considerable progress in promoting the importance, understanding and awareness of our risk culture. Our target risk culture is founded on embedding those risk behaviours and practices aligned to the five principles of: living the purpose; risk management accountability; risk management execution; risk management effectiveness; and proactive risk management. Plans and actions are in place to further embed risk culture maturity. These include the insights from our first risk culture survey. Refer to page 51 for further detail on the risk culture survey undertaken this year.\n\n## CULTURE REVIEWS AND ASSESSMENTS\n\nOur Talent and Culture team delivers data-led insights - qualitative and quantitative - that are actionable and help drive sustainable cultural change. Multiple listening tools such as surveys, focus groups and interviews enable the business to respond to employee feedback on our culture.\n\nOur Enterprise Steering Culture Group (ESCG), chaired by the CEO and whose membership includes other members of the Executive Committee, comes together twice a year to discuss key cultural themes, strengths and areas for improvement. This year, the ESCG has reinforced our ongoing commitment to employee wellbeing and listening, as well as our learning strategy - prioritising the reskilling and upskilling of employees in critical capabilities required for a digital future, and building an 'always learning' culture. They oversaw a significant jump in our speak up culture scores which were a key area of focus.\n\nOur Internal Audit (IA) culture team provides independent assessments of our current organisational culture. The assessments are designed to: inform Board and management by providing insights as to how organisational culture is enabling the bank's purpose and strategy; support the Board in meeting community and regulatory expectations (e.g. the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Prudential Standard CPS 220); identify and focus on cultural root causes of issues; and strengthen the bank's overall approach to strategic delivery and risk management.\n\nOnce an assessment is complete, a report on cultural themes, including underlying issues and related impacts, is provided to the business. The business then develops an action plan in response to any identified cultural challenges. The plan is monitored and an actions effectiveness or reassessment is completed to determine how effective it has been in shifting towards the desired culture.\n\nIn 2021, IA completed 19 culture reviews, of which nine were reassessments. The reassessments have highlighted leadership accountability as key to building a better bank and creating a culture that will deliver what matters for our customers, employees and shareholders.\n\n## HIGHLIGHT\n\nIn 2018 a culture review identified a business area within the bank experiencing issues with inconsistent leadership, resulting in a reluctance amongst team members to work effectively together, raise issues and challenge constructively.\n\nFollowing the assessment, the leadership team developed an action plan focused on improving leadership capabilities and engagement through focusing on aligning as a leadership team and initiatives to embed desired leadership behaviours (e.g. using the leadership 180 survey tool that gathers feedback on how well a leader is demonstrating our values and leadership behaviours) supported by development plans; and/uni00A0implementing engagement plans to listen, provide transparency and connect with staff.\n\nOur reassessment of the business revealed a 25% increase in staff's perception of leadership and a 26% increase in their comfort to raise concerns and challenge constructively.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSEQUENCE FRAMEWORK\n\nThroughout 2021, we continued to strengthen  ANZ's Accountability and Consequence Framework (A&CF). The Enterprise Accountability Group (EAG), chaired by the CEO, supports the Board in monitoring the implementation and ongoing effectiveness of ANZ's A&CF, being cognisant of its impact on the culture of ANZ. The EAG reviews the most material risk, conduct and audit events, accountability and the application of consequences, where appropriate. See section 6 of the Remuneration Report for more details.\n\n## CHANGES TO REMUNERATION\n\nThe introduction of a new remuneration standard by APRA has driven a review of how we reward our executives. The new regulatory standard does not come into effect until 1 January 2023, however a range of changes are being considered for implementation in 2022, subject to Board approval. These changes are designed not only to meet both the letter and spirit of APRA's new prudential standard, but also to maintain our strong focus on performance and risk management, and to attract, motivate and retain the best talent.\n\nWe have implemented the recommendations from Stephen Sedgwick's 'Retail Banking Remuneration Review' (noting the industry wide recommendations are ongoing). This review was focused on strengthening the alignment of retail bank incentives, sales practices and good customer outcomes. Mr Sedgwick completed his final review of the implementation of the recommendations, with a report submitted to the Australian Banking Association in June 2021. The report determined that significant progress has been made across the industry to align to the 2017 recommendations, with substantial investment in a customer-centric culture, policies and practices evident across the majority of banks. We continue to review our processes to ensure ongoing adherence to the Sedgwick recommendations.\n\n## LINKS TO 2021 GROUP PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur consistently strong management of people and culture was again a highlight and reflects multiple years of purposeful investment in building the right leadership behaviours and enhancing our culture frameworks. Staff engagement survey results remained strong, and following a global trend which saw employer scores spike in 2020, ANZ's 2021 results expectedly returned to a steady positive trend. The wellbeing of our people continued to be a priority, with all staff supported to complete mental health awareness training. Embedding of our reward and performance framework continued, with a focus on continuous performance management capabilities, employee recognition, and reward arrangements for high performers in critical talent populations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee section 4.5.3 of the Remuneration Report for more details.\n\n## EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\nIn August, our overall engagement result was 81% . While this result is down five percentage points from April 2020, it remains higher than pre-pandemic levels (77% in 2019).\n\n## 82% of employees said they felt supported in managing their psychological wellbeing.\n\n## WELLBEING\n\nThe health and wellbeing of our people remains a priority with the management of COVID-19 and the impacts on our employees, contractors and visitors continuing throughout the year.\n\nTargeted wellbeing and safety support has been provided to employees and local leadership teams in different locations. For example, due to the surge in COVID-19 cases in India, enhanced support was provided to our employees including: access to personal health insurance top-ups; unlimited free tele-consultation medical services for employees and up to four family members; assistance to access medical care; assistance with hospitalisation where required; and provision of specific medical equipment at home or in hospital.\n\nWe have formalised a Chief Medical Officer arrangement, providing access to specialist medical advice and ongoing guidance in managing the COVID-19 pandemic and other medical or health challenges as they arise. We have developed a COVID-19 vaccination position statement, supporting the rollout of vaccines as an important step in the global response to COVID-19. We encourage all employees who are medically eligible for COVID-19 vaccines to be vaccinated where it is locally available and approved by regulatory authorities. During the most recent outbreak in New South Wales, we offered a vaccination program to employees and their households located in Local Government Areas with high case numbers. This has since been extended to all of Greater Sydney and Wollongong. We have provided a total of 315 vaccinations as part of the program, 70% of which were family members of employees.\n\nSpecial paid leave has also been made available to employees who may require time away from work due to COVID-19 impacts. This may include recovery from COVID-19, isolation requirements and caring responsibilities.\n\nWe recognise the impact of restricted movement and lockdowns on mental wellbeing and are focused on empowering our employees and leaders to support others and recognise the signs of psychological distress in themselves. To support our employees and leaders in their understanding of and confidence in responding to mental health issues, a digital mental health awareness program has been mandated for all employees. To date over 46,600 individuals have completed this training. We have implemented Mental Health First Aid training for our people in the United Kingdom and have commenced the rollout of this program in New Zealand. We have also piloted a Mental Health First Aid training course in Australia, with planning for further rollout underway.\n\nWe continue to provide our employees with access to digital wellbeing resources, developed in partnership with external specialists, including psychologists and physiotherapists, to help them develop strategies to maintain mental, social and physical health.\n\nWith many employees working remotely more frequently, we provided funding for ergonomic equipment to enable employees to be set up for optimal safety and productivity. Since the onset of the pandemic, over 14,700 employees have accessed this funding. Further specialist support is provided to employees requiring tailored ergonomic assistance or other workplace adjustments to maintain their wellbeing.\n\n## DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION\n\nWe believe our diverse workforce and inclusive culture will improve the quality of decision making and drive innovation, making us a better bank for our customers and helping us to shape a world where people and communities thrive.\n\nThe representation of Women in Leadership increased this year to 35.3% (up from 33.4% as at September 2020), exceeding our target of 34.4% by the end of 2021. Our progress is monitored monthly by the CEO and the Group Execution and Performance Committee.\n\nWe are focused on growing female talent by providing female employees with the critical skills and experiences required to move into senior roles, delivering a number of women in leadership training programs throughout the year.\n\nWith the departure of Alexis George and Michelle Jablko, our Key Management Personnel has dropped from 50% to 33.3%, below our target to maintain at least 40% women as Key Management Personnel. Importantly, however, women hold key line roles on our Executive Committee and the portfolio of Kathryn van der Merwe, our Group Executive Talent & Culture, has been expanded to include responsibility for our Service Centres, a critical part of our network and service offering. We are also proud to have a strong alumni of successful executive women in significant roles outside ANZ.\n\nOur numerous employee networks continue to play an important role in building a strong sense of community and belonging by advocating for and supporting the diverse communities they represent. Particularly as the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, the voice of our networks has ensured we are taking an inclusive approach to supporting our people.\n\nWe have continued to develop capability across our recruitment communities to create inclusive and accessible recruitment processes for women, people with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, M\u0101ori and Pasifika people, people from different cultural and religious backgrounds, and people from the LGBTIQ+ community. Our Diversity and Inclusion Policy is available at anz.com/corporategovernance .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe representation of Women in Leadership increased this year to 35.3% (up from 33.4% as at September 2020), exceeding our target of 34.4% by the end of 2021.\n\n## NEW DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION STRATEGY\n\nThis year we finalised our new Diversity and Inclusion Strategy. It was co-created with employees from all levels and geographies, including representatives from our employee networks, and has been endorsed by ANZ's Executive Committee and the Human Resources Committee of the Board.\n\nWe now have a vision for diversity and inclusion that is unique and relevant to ANZ, aligning with our purpose and business strategy, and the expectations of our customers, suppliers and community.\n\n## We have established the following five strategic priorities:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCreate an inclusive culture and improve the experience of our employees who represent all dimensions of diversity\n\n- 2 Build the confidence and capability of people leaders to lead diverse and inclusive teams\n- 3 Improve the diversity of our leadership population\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4 Strengthen and empower our employee networks\n- 5 Improve accountability and governance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThere are many dimensions of diversity, and all are important at ANZ. Therefore, the focus on creating an inclusive culture is our most critical strategic priority.\n\nOur strategy will assist us to make decisions about where we will focus our effort and resources to maximise impact.",

This analysis informs employee development and recruitment programs, ensuring we continue to develop the capabilities aligned to our strategy.\n\nThis year we launched our PeopleHub program, designed to replace legacy human resources systems with 'smarter', more integrated technology, supporting new functionality and improved processes across the Group.\n\nThe program will strengthen our ability to 'future-proof' our workforce, by providing greater visibility of the current state of our workforce and identifying potential skills shortages and gaps.\n\nData and engineering continued to be an area of focus in 2021. COVID-19 has exacerbated the scarcity of critical technology talent, with job vacancies at historically high levels creating talent competition across our major geographies.\n\nWe have refined our attraction, engagement and recruitment strategies. For each of our key geographies, we have dedicated teams focused on talent marketing and proactive sourcing of top candidates in our strategic demand areas of data and engineering. We are working harder to contact candidates via non-traditional methods, for example approaching a candidate through their blog or other social media. While first engagement is taking longer, our time to offer has only slightly increased. In 2021, we recruited over 5,100 technology candidates, a 92% increase from 2020.\n\nCulture and Service Centres. 'We believe that strong partnerships like this are key to building the capability we need for the future.'\n\n'Employees who come to us from other roles bring professional skills and experiential diversity which can help us think differently about solutions for our customers and staff. They are also more likely to have the skills that position them for a faster career trajectory than people who are just starting out in their careers.'\n\nWe also launched an initiative encouraging mature aged workers to email their resumes directly to our Chief Executive Officer, Shayne Elliott, to be considered for roles in ANZ. We received close to 500 applications and have placed successful candidates in our Legal, Talent and Culture and Australia Retail and Commercial teams.\n\n'What we found is that a lot of people, particularly women who were older and for whatever reason had moved out of the workforce, somehow felt they weren't worthy or capable of coming back', said Shayne Elliott. 'So we've got a program to bring people back to the workforce and it has been enormously successful.'\n\nIn addition to hiring new talent, we continue to build the engineering capability of our existing workforce by implementing targeted learning initiatives designed to develop both deep technical skills and core 'soft skills'. Our #TechLearningAcademy and engineering career hubs enable our engineers to identify their strengths and growth opportunities and provide self-guided learning on priority capabilities. Sixteen hours of dedicated learning time has now been scheduled for everyone in Technology.\n\nWe rolled out PluralSight, an online education provider, to more than 1,620 people in Technology, providing our people with opportunities to build valuable new technology skills such as cloud/uni00A0computing, software development, cyber security and machine/uni00A0learning.\n\nIn India, we have continued the rollout of our Digital Transformation Academy, providing our people with a self-directed learning platform to upskill in the latest digital transformation tools. The program covers topics on emergent technologies like robotic process automation, machine learning, artificial intelligence and blockchain. To date, over 2,100 of our people have completed the program.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on employee learning and development and our approach to diversity and inclusion is in our 2021 ESG Supplement, available at anz.com/annualreport.",

FJ$60,000 was also committed to grassroots organisations across Fiji to support communities impacted by COVID-19.\n\n## RECONCILIATION ACTION PLAN\n\nAfter two years of reflection, development and consultation, we will commence our second Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in October 2021, our fifth RAP as an organisation. Through our RAP we will partner with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to create meaningful opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and businesses by:\n\n- \u00b7 Improving financial wellbeing\n- \u00b7 Providing employment and facilitating career progression\n- \u00b7 Building the capacity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait businesses\n- \u00b7 Improving understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures within our organisation.\n\nCredit: Marcus Lee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have set a target to achieve the 17 actions set out in our RAP by the end of 2024, elevating accountability for delivery to our Executive Committee. We have also implemented an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employee reference group we will consult with on any matters that impact them as ANZ employees to ensure we are listening to the voices of First Nations employees.\n\n1. Our Volunteer Leave Policy, that applies to permanent, regular and fixed-term employees, provides for at least one day of paid volunteer leave each year. 2.

International transfer fees were waived for funds sent from Australia and New Zealand to the Pacific to support communities impacted by COVID-19.\n\n## OUR FINANCIAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS\n\nBeyond providing core banking services, we can play a key role in the community by leading thinking about the 'drivers' of financial wellbeing and applying insights from our research to our financial education programs, Saver Plus and MoneyMinded. These programs involve close collaboration with partners from the community and government sectors.\n\nMore than 841,900 people have been reached through these programs since 2002/three.superior.\n\nSaver Plus: our matched savings and financial education program, developed in partnership with the Brotherhood of St Laurence. Participants open an ANZ savings account, set a savings goal and make deposits regularly over 10 months while also attending MoneyMinded financial education sessions. On reaching their goal, savings are matched by ANZ dollar for dollar, up to $500, which must be spent on education.\n\n## COMMUNITY STORY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMoneyMinded: supports adults with low levels of financial literacy and those on lower incomes build their financial skills, knowledge and confidence. The program is delivered by community organisations in Australia and New Zealand, and a mix of community organisations and ANZ employees in 15 markets across Asia and the Pacific region.\n\nMoneyBusiness: developed in partnership with the Australian Government in 2005, following our research which showed that financial exclusion was a significant problem for First Nations people, particularly those living in remote communities. Program materials have been developed in consultation with local First Nations communities and community workers, ensuring the information is culturally appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Further information about our community investment and financial education programs is in our 2021 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/annualreport.\n\nOur MoneyMinded financial education program - designed to help adults build budgeting, saving and money skills has been helping Pacific workers during their mandatory two-week quarantine period in Australia.\n\nThe Australian agriculture industry, particularly the fresh produce sector, relies on seasonal interstate and overseas labour.\n\nHowever, the availability of workers has been heavily impacted by COVID-19, with lockdowns and border closures making it difficult for backpacker and overseas work programs to operate.\n\nMany Australian farmers have therefore been left with unharvested crops and wasted produce.\n\nThe Australian Government's 'Pacific Labour Scheme' has helped fill regional and rural labour shortages, connecting Australian businesses with workers from nine Pacific Islands and Timor-Leste to help farmers harvest crops.\n\nArriving from the Pacific, workers are required to complete 14 days of mandatory quarantine when they arrive in Australia, before they can start work assisting farmers to harvest crops.\n\nANZ has provided MoneyMinded training and resources to Powerpac, an approved provider of the Federal Government's Pacific Labour Scheme. Powerpac is delivering MoneyMinded to arriving workers during their quarantine period.\n\nAround 240 people have been through the first delivery of MoneyMinded, with hundreds more expected over coming months.\n\n3.

Sharon was able to run classes in the evening which allowed her participants to manage other commitments during the day.\n\n## CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC POLICY\n\nWe seek to contribute constructively to public policy formation and understand the perspectives of our community's elected representatives, policymakers and regulators. We contribute to policy formation on business, economic, social and environmental issues affecting our customers and shareholders.\n\nWe are also a member of a number of industry associations that contribute to public policy debate and formation.\n\n## In 2021, our key membership payments included:\n\n## Australian Banking Association $3,055,932\n\nBusiness Council of Australia $93,500\n\nNew Zealand Bankers' Association NZ $746,796\n\nBusiness New Zealand NZ $46,460\n\n## LINKS TO 2021 GROUP PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK\n\n2021 has continued to be a challenging year for many. Our focus on our purpose and values, combined with strong governance and leadership, has enabled us to continue to help support the communities in which we live and work during the COVID-19 pandemic. ANZ ranked #1 overall amongst major domestic peers\n\nWhile virtual program delivery has benefited many, it has also highlighted the digital divide, with a number of people reporting a lack of internet access or access to a suitable device, or the confidence to use a digital medium, as a barrier to participation.\n\nWe are working with our community partners and facilitators to find ways to adapt our programs post COVID-19, without unintentionally excluding those who cannot easily access online modules and virtual sessions.\n\nMoneyMinded |  participant\n\nPayment to the New Zealand Bankers' Association includes our annual fee as well as expenditure related to the trial of regional banking hubs, contribution to an industry partnership with a nationwide financial capability charity, the establishment of an industry whistle-blower scheme run by the Banking Ombudsman, and industry initiatives in response to COVID-19 and regulatory issues.\n\nWe understand our stakeholders are interested in the position we take on issues such as banking accessibility, problem gambling and climate change, and our membership of industry associations that develop policies and undertake advocacy on these issues.\n\nWe have begun a process of periodically reviewing our membership of key associations and will publicly disclose outcomes and any material change to our position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin the RepTrak\u2122 corporate reputation survey and ANZ was again the leading Australian bank as measured by the 2020 Dow Jones Sustainability Index, ranked in the 97 th percentile globally in the banking sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee section 4.5.3 of the Remuneration Report for more details.\n\n## Improving our approach to human rights\n\nThis year we have significantly upgraded our Human Rights Statement (Statement) and developed a new Grievance Mechanism (Mechanism) for people whose human rights may have been impacted by our large business lending customers.\n\nWe committed to these two actions in the 2020 Statement of the Parties setting out the resolution of a complaint brought against ANZ by Inclusive Development International and Equitable Cambodia concerning a loan made to Phnom Penh Sugar in 2014. Agreement was reached with the assistance of the Australian National Contact Point.\n\nOur Statement and Mechanism have been informed by an external multi-stakeholder working group including civil society organisations, academics, business representatives and customers. Their involvement did not infer endorsement of the outcomes of this review or other work carried out by ANZ.\n\n## The Statement outlines our respect for international human rights standards and includes:\n\n- \u00b7 No tolerance for retaliation against individuals or communities\n- \u00b7 Reference to climate change and associated human rights impacts\n- \u00b7 Support for an open civic space and human rights defenders\n- \u00b7 Scenarios where domestic laws conflict with international human rights standards\n- \u00b7 Our process when a customer's human rights practices are inconsistent with our expectations.\n\nInternational standards we respect include the International Labour Organisation Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the International Bill of Human Rights and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).\n\nThe UNGPs are the global standard for preventing and addressing the risk of adverse human rights impacts linked to business activities. They incorporate three pillars, including governments' duty to protect human rights and the responsibility of businesses to respect human rights.\n\nOur Statement is aligned with the UNGP second pillar, including support and respect for human rights of our employees, customers and communities. We expect the same from everyone who works for or with us, including business customers, suppliers and partners.\n\nThe UNGP third pillar refers to the need for victims of businessrelated abuses to have access to remedy. We support access to remedy through our new Grievance Mechanism and participation in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) National Contact Point (NCP) remediation processes./one.superior\n\nOur new Mechanism will help encourage responsible business conduct, including by our large business lending customers. In establishing this Mechanism, we sought to provide a framework through which:\n\n- \u00b7 Efforts can be made to resolve complaints by affected communities about adverse human rights impacts associated with ANZ customers; and\n- \u00b7 Feedback and recommendations aimed at strengthening our due diligence processes can be provided.\n\nThe Mechanism is designed to be informal and flexible, and we are committed to handling complaints in a way that builds confidence in its effectiveness. As this is new we understand the need to promote its availability, and will use any complaints submitted as an opportunity for learning and reflection.\n\nImplementation of the new Statement and Mechanism will continue in 2022 through our governance, policies, staff training and disclosures.\n\nEngagement will again be sought with external stakeholders in reviews of the Mechanism in 2023 and the Statement in 2024. We will also report on complaints submitted to the Mechanism.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Statement and the Grievance Mechanism are available at anz.com.\n\nInformation on our approach to modern slavery is in our 2021 ESG Supplement available at anz.com/annualreport.\n\n1.

We support an orderly transition that recognises and responds to social impacts. This aligns with our purpose to shape a world in which people and communities thrive.\n\nOur climate change statement outlines our approach and commitments in support of a global transition to net zero. We are reviewing our position. Our updated position will be released prior to our Annual General Meeting, together with our 2021 Climate-related Financial Disclosures (our fifth report using the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)), available at anz.com/annualreport .\n\n## CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT\n\nWe have engaged with 100 of our largest emitting business customers, supporting them to establish and, where appropriate, strengthen existing transition plans.\n\nCustomers have valued our engagement on this topic, and our perspectives. A number of customers outside of the 100 have sought to engage with us, seeking clarity on our expectations, or requesting suggestions to improve their approach.\n\nFollowing initial engagement, customer transition plans were grouped into levels of maturity - advanced, developing/ intermediate, underdeveloped/starting out, and no public plans.\n\nWithin each industry our customers have different starting points. Since this initial assessment, nine customers have sufficiently improved their governance, strategies and targets or disclosures, leading to an improved ranking. Many other customers have also clearly demonstrated improvement since their initial assessment. For example, we observed a rise in the intention to develop 'Paris aligned' or 'science-based' targets or report under the TCFD framework, and a similar rise in interest in engaging with ANZ on this topic.\n\nWhile we consider this to be good progress, we understand there is still much to be done. That is why we have committed to continue supporting these larger emitting customers to implement and, where appropriate, strengthen their low carbon transition plans and enhance their efforts to protect biodiversity, by end 2024.

A focus area is Together to zero emissions underpinned by new targets to accelerate climate action and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as its ambition to deliver net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and its target to have the entire Coles Group powered by 100% renewable electricity by the end of FY25.\n\nHaving banked Coles since its demerger from Wesfarmers in 2018, we are supporting the retailer's ambition to minimise its environmental footprint and mitigate the environmental and social impacts of climate change.\n\nIn late August 2021, ANZ worked as a Joint Sustainability Coordinator on Coles' $1.3bn sustainability-linked loans, the first within the supermarket sector in Australia and the largest in the local market.\n\nColes replaced $1.3bn of its existing bank debt facilities with sustainability-linked loans to draw a direct link between its sustainability performance and its cost of capital, providing transparency and accountability as it works to achieve its sustainability targets.\n\nCommenting on the deal, Coles Chief Financial Officer, Leah Weckert, said:\n\n'Coles believes that sustainable businesses are better businesses, and our Sustainability-Linked Loans reflect our commitment to working with all our stakeholders to make positive changes.\n\n'The SLL incentive structure is linked to our progress against company-wide sustainability goals, with delivery of those goals delivering improved cost of capital, therefore being an effective tool to drive sustainability throughout our business.'\n\n## /uni00A0/one.superior/fi/two.superior/two.denominator/fi/uni00A0/three.superior/fi\u016b\u0101\u0101/two.superior/uni00A0/four.superior/two.superior/five.superior/six.superior\u016b/two.superior/five.superior/eight.superior\u0101/nine.superior/two.superior/zero.superior/uni00A0/fiGLYPH<17>\u016b/two.superior/uni00A0/four.superior/two.superiorGLYPH<17>GLYPH<16>GLYPH<15>GLYPH<14>/eight.superior/five.superior\u016bGLYPH<13>/fi\u016bGLYPH<16>/eight.superior/five.superior\u016bGLYPH<12>/two.superior/zero.superiorGLYPH<15>/four.superior/eight.superior/four.superiorGLYPH<17>GLYPH<15>/eight.superiorGLYPH<16>/two.superiorGLYPH<12>GLYPH<15>\u0101GLYPH<17>GLYPH<16>/uni00A0\u0101/one.superior/fi\u016b\u0101\n\n| Our progress to date                                                                                                                                                                                 | Focus areas -

During the year, Directors participated in three specific Board strategy sessions, using internal and external experts to provide different points of view. The sessions included assessing the external operating, technological, economic and competitive environment and/uni00A0challenging ANZ's long-term response and plans.\n\nThe Board regularly discussed and revisited ANZ's strategic and growth priorities, including adjusting the Board agenda to ensure appropriate, distinct and continuous focus on growth matters at each Board meeting.\n\nAs a key part of this, the Board regularly discussed and provided oversight with respect to ANZ's approach to the long-term transformation of its Australian business, including technology and digital-related matters. The Board received 'deep dives' into the design of the technology to best meet customer needs, and the Board, utilising the breadth of focus of its Committees received numerous reports overseeing key aspects of the transformation, including testing and implementation.\n\nAn additional important focus of the Board during the year was succession planning and development focus in respect of ANZ's most senior executives, and in respect of its own composition.\n\nmatt\n\ners consider\n\ned b\n\ny the B\n\noar\n\nd and its C\n\nommitt\n\nees dur\n\ning\n\nt\n\no pr\n\no\n\nvide stak\n\neholders with an insight int\n\no some of the k\n\ne\n\ny\n\na\n\nn\n\nd\n\no\n\nv\n\ne\n\nr\n\ns\n\ni\n\ng\n\nh\n\nt\n\nac\n\ntivities each y\n\near\n\n.\n\nT\n\nhe t\n\nopics belo\n\nw ar\n\ne illustrativ\n\ne\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe Board and its Committees continued to play an active role in providing oversight of the impact of, and ANZ's response to, the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The relief measures in place to support our customers, including customer take up, delivery and ongoing communications.\n- \u00b7 The impact of COVID-19 on the economy, domestic and international, considering both the immediate and longer-term impacts.\n- \u00b7 The impact of the pandemic on our people, and the different geographic responses undertaken in the jurisdictions in which we operate. This included consideration of vaccination trends, the future of the workplace and actions required to protect and support our people operating remotely.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk, regulation and reputation\n\nThe Board and its Committees also continued to oversee the important work carried out by management to progress ANZ's risk governance roadmap. Management provided regular reports on progress, as well as ANZ's approach to improving and/uni00A0simplifying organisational and risk culture.\n\nAs part of this, the Board approved ANZ's approach to risk culture and what ANZ's target risk culture is, with the Risk Committee providing ongoing oversight of work to achieve/uni00A0that, with the Human Resources Committee and Board continuing to focus on and discuss Management's actions to strengthen and simplify ANZ's broader organisational culture.\n\nThe Board also met with ANZ's key Australian regulators during the course of the year with the purpose of maintaining constructive and two-way dialogue.\n\nAs a key aspect of ensuring the correct focus on ANZ's strategy and growth, the Board regularly discussed second and third line's assessment of the risks associated with the implementation of ANZ's strategic transformation agenda.\n\nThe Board and its Committees continued to review ANZ's approach and performance in relation to compliance as well as reviewing ANZ's preparedness for regulatory change, including in relation to breach reporting, design and distribution obligations and responsible lending laws. It also received regular education and briefing materials on key areas such as anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, competition law, whistleblowing and cyber security.\n\nThe Board also discussed and reviewed the current status of embedding ANZ's purpose throughout the business, reflecting on progress since its introduction five years ago.\n\nThe Board considered and discussed 'how we bank' with an ethical and Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) lens, including ESG focus areas, customers experiencing vulnerability, product suitability, accessibility and diversity and our COVID-19 Statement of Intent. The Board also considered 'who we bank', through industry sector and country specific reviews, human rights policy and modern slavery and climate change policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial/Operational\n\nWhile the Board and its Committees have had a strong focus on the long-term future of the Group, the Board (and its Committees) maintains an equally strong focus on the current performance of the Group, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewing, challenging and ultimately endorsing ANZ's operating and strategic plans, both annual and longer-term, including in relation to ANZ's investment and business as usual cost ambitions.\n- \u00b7 Regularly discussing merger and acquisitions matters.\n- \u00b7 Providing oversight of key capital management matters, including the approval of the issue of Capital Notes 6 and ANZ's on-market share buyback.\n- \u00b7 Developing and implementing standardised Business Performance Templates for discussion at each Board meeting with the Group Executives leading each of ANZ's major businesses.",

Simon is committed to the promotion and practice of good corporate governance, and regularly presents on/uni00A0governance issues.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued to impact our operating environment. Our Risk Management Framework has underpinned our response during this challenging time and has enabled us to maintain sound risk management practices.\n\nOver the last year we have continued to invest in our Risk Management Framework, processes and systems, strengthening our ability to respond to changes in existing risks, and to deal with new risks as they arise in our increasingly complex external environment, including those discussed below.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nWe have maintained a range of support measures to assist employees and customers, and to deliver safe and secure operations throughout the pandemic. The Risk function has helped with the transition of staff to remote working, or conversely, their return to the office. We are continuing to assess the implications of 'living with COVID', which is still evolving. The Risk function has also partnered with our divisions to protect the bank through the management of credit risk associated with customer COVID-19 support, as well as industry deep dives and portfolio reviews.\n\nWe recognise the mental health and wellbeing risks associated with staff fatigue after almost two years of COVID-induced change. We are working together with our Talent & Culture team to ensure appropriate supports are in place. For further detail on how we have supported our people see page 30.\n\n## RISK CULTURE\n\nWe strive for a risk culture where our employees demonstrate the right risk behaviours, have clear risk roles and responsibilities and are enabled by effective policies and processes. This year we conducted an internal Risk Culture survey for the first time. The survey gathered the perceptions of target risk behaviours from more than 24,000 employees. We have undertaken a lot of work over the past three years to encourage a strong 'speak up' and risk culture and,\n\n## LINKS TO 2021 GROUP PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK\n\nOur already strong risk management framework enabled ANZ to continually manage the evolving risks presented by COVID-19. Clear progress continues to be made on risk culture maturity, evidenced in employee engagement scores including 'My business leaders demonstrate personal accountability for managing risk and sound risk behaviours' (87%) and 'I can raise issues and concerns in ANZ without fear of reprisals or negative consequences' (80%), exceeding the record highs reached in 2020.\n\nThese results are the product of sustained efforts over several years to encourage a speak up and risk culture where people feel they can challenge each other respectfully. Sound progress has been made in addressing the findings of the Risk Governance Self-Assessment and on key regulatory/non-financial risk projects. However, a $500 million APRA capital overlay remains in place pending confirmation of an improvement in operational risk management across the bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee section 4.5.3 of the Remuneration Report for more details.\n\npleasingly, responses to the survey confirmed our people believe they can speak up and challenge each other respectfully if they see unethical behaviour, with over 80% of staff expressing a very positive sentiment for ANZ's risk culture.\n\nRisk culture (as a critical component of our organisational culture) remains an important focus. We have refined our risk culture principles and defined our target risk culture. A framework for assessing each risk culture principle is embedded across the organisation and incorporates desired risk behaviours and business and risk outcomes. Risk culture maturity is assessed at an organisational level, as well as divisional and functional levels, with risk culture plans in place to address identified gaps. Risk culture goals have been set to monitor progress and drive sustainable change towards our aspirational culture.\n\nA priority this year has been transforming behaviours through formal mechanisms (including systems, structures, policies, procedures and processes) as we seek to ensure leaders demonstrate accountability for managing risk within a 'speak up' environment, with clear consequence management processes. Guided by our purpose, our behaviours help us to bring our values to life and to execute our strategy. To further strengthen and evolve our risk culture, this year the Enterprise Accountability Group (see page 30) recognised over 40 individuals as role modelling outstanding risk behaviours for their work to manage and mitigate the organisation's risks and their continuous improvement of our risk culture. The recognition provided included personalised messages from the CEO, the opportunity to meet with the Board and ExCo and having their achievements profiled on our intranet and in internal newsletters .\n\n## CONDUCT RISK\n\nProviding our products and services in a manner that delivers fair customer outcomes and promotes market integrity is integral to our strategy. This year Conduct Risk was elevated as a key material risk for the bank, highlighting its importance in our Risk Management Framework. In addition to key initiatives to strengthen our Conduct Risk management approach, our Code of Conduct was enhanced to provide clear guidance to our people. For example, there is guidance relating to some of the ethical considerations employees may encounter in daily decision-making, when dealing with customers and/or undertaking market activities - we expect our people to consider not only whether 'can we' do something, but also 'should we'?\n\n<!-- image -->",

This year, to further enhance non-financial risk management, we have adopted a new taxonomy into our Operational and Compliance Risk Framework. Our Compliance and Operational Risk Strategy provides a comprehensive, proactive and well-planned approach to improving our management of non-financial risk by driving transformation across our processes, policies, systems and people, guided by our purpose and contributing to the bank's strategic priority to improve the financial wellbeing of our customers.\n\nLast year we reviewed our Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) metrics to ensure appropriate coverage of our non-financial risks. The review concluded earlier this year, with the Board Risk Committee approving a collection of over 36 metrics and indicators. This is an increase from 12 prior to the review, and demonstrates the growing importance of non-financial factors in helping inform decisions within our Risk function.\n\nWe have developed and launched a new tool that streamlines how we capture and report against the RAS metrics, reducing the time it takes from weeks to days. In addition, we developed a purpose-built dashboard to support the proactive management of our risk appetite using trend analysis technology.\n\nThese changes have provided our Board Risk Committee and management with greater visibility and control over our nonfinancial risk appetite.\n\n## FINANCIAL CRIME\n\nWe continue to improve our financial crime risk management program. We have invested significantly in enhancing data analytics capability for the bank, creating a central Financial Crime Data Hub and Intelligence ecosystem that uses a range of analytical tools, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Network and link analysis capability - using these tools we can better detect syndicated crimes and demonstrate a 'big picture' view of criminal activity\n- \u00b7 Dynamic algorithms - using agile monitoring and detection solutions, we can detect changes in customer behaviours, which can assist AUSTRAC and police investigations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on financial crime is available in our 2021 ESG Supplement at anz.com/annualreport.\n\n## EMERGING RISKS\n\nTwo risks that continue to evolve and that we are paying particular attention to are:\n\nCyber security risk: We take the security of our bank, our customers and our customers' information very seriously. Cyber security threats continue to be significant and our approach to mitigating cyber security risk involves a range of controls relying on people, technology and process. We are continually testing our defences internally and through independent third parties. We have a very sophisticated cyber security protection capability and have invested heavily in a range of recognised industry practices and technologies, processes and defences. In addition, we are cooperating with our counterparts, governments and associated\n\nentities around the world to protect against cyber security threats, which have increased since COVID-19 and the consequent shift to digital banking and remote working.\n\nWe are now blocking around 16 million malicious emails a month compared to about four million pre-COVID-19 in October 2019.\n\n## CYBER SCAMMERS ON THE RISE\n\nThere has been a significant increase in 'business email compromise' (BEC), with cyber scammers targeting transactions and payment systems by intercepting business correspondence.\n\nMany of these compromised emails appear to represent existing suppliers, customers and professional advisors such as accountants or lawyers, and request changes to account or payment details.\n\nA publication released by the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) shows total losses for the 2020-21 financial year were approximately $81million, an increase of nearly 15% from the previous financial year. Average loss per successful BEC transaction also increased by 54%.\n\nTo assist our customers to protect their businesses against these types of scams, we encourage them to take a number of steps including making an organisational PACT/one.superior to protect their virtual valuables. In addition, we are educating our customers on data protection and privacy through focused campaigns, threat intelligence newsletters and cyber security business guide books.\n\nClimate change risk: The financial risks associated with climate change remain a key focus. We have set a public ESG target to develop an enhanced risk management framework that anticipates potential climate-related impacts, and associated regulatory requirements, by the end of 2022. To help deliver on this target, a number of work streams have been established, including regulatory monitoring and carbon metrics. A new Climate Advisory and Coordination Forum, which is Chaired by the Group Executive, Institutional and includes the Group Chief Risk Officer, has also overseen the development of an updated climate change statement that will be released prior to our Annual General Meeting.\n\nWe are continuing to work with our customers to better understand how they are transitioning to a low carbon future. We have now engaged with 100 of our largest emitting business customers to encourage and support them to develop their low carbon transition plans. The majority of the 100 customers recognise climate change risk and have started their transition plan 'journey'. Some customers have advanced plans towards net zero by 2050. We are using what we learn from this customer engagement to inform how we manage the risks in higher emitting customer portfolios.\n\nWe are participating in APRA's Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA), which examines the material exposures and financial risks that banks, the financial system and economy may face due to climate risks. APRA's CVA comprises two stress tests, counterparty assessment and data assessment. APRA intends to disclose the outcomes of the CVA in 2022, which may also be used to inform future supervisory guidance.\n\n## /one.superior/five.superior/four.superior/three.superior/four.superior/six.superior/two.superior/uni00A0/three.superior/seven.superior/eight.superior/nine.superior/eight.superior/fiGLYPH<20>/seven.superiorGLYPH<20>/nine.superiorGLYPH<19>/three.superiorGLYPH<18>/four.superior/eight.superior/seven.superiorGLYPH<20>GLYPH<17>/one.superior/four.superior/uni00A0\n\nT\n\nhe B\n\noar\n\nd is ultimat\n\nely r\n\nesponsible f\n\nor establishing and o\n\nv\n\nerseeing\n\nthe Gr\n\noup\n\n'\n\ns R\n\nisk M\n\nanagement F\n\nrame\n\nw\n\nor\n\nk (RMF) which is suppor\n\nt\n\ned\n\nb\n\ny the Gr\n\noup\n\n'\n\ns under\n\nlying syst\n\nems\n\n, struc\n\ntur\n\nes\n\n, policies\n\n, pr\n\nocedur\n\nes\n\n,\n\npr\n\nocesses and people\n\n.\n\nT\n\nhe B\n\noar\n\nd has delegat\n\ned author\n\nit\n\ny t\n\no the\n\nB\n\noar\n\nd R\n\nisk C\n\nommitt\n\nee (BR\n\nC\n\n) t\n\no de\n\nv\n\nelop and monit\n\nor compliance\n\nwith the Gr\n\noup\n\n'\n\ns r\n\nisk management policies\n\n.\n\nT\n\nhe C\n\nommitt\n\nee r\n\nepor\n\nts\n\n\u00b7\n\nT\n\nhe R\n\nisk M\n\nanagement Stat\n\nement (RMS), which descr\n\nibes the\n\noup\n\n'\n\nappr\n\n- oach f or manag ing r isks ar ising fr om the Gr s pur pose and and1then either controls or mitigates mater ial r isks.\n\nthe Gr\n\noup identifies\n\n, measur\n\nes\n\n, e\n\nvaluat\n\nes\n\n, monit\n\nors\n\n, r\n\nepor\n\nts\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n## /one.superior/five.superior/one.superior/four.superior/three.superior/six.superior/two.superior/uni00A0/one.superior/seven.superior/four.superior/eight.superior/nine.superior/nine.superior/two.superior/six.superior/six.superior/one.superior/one.superior\n\nANZ'\n\ns most senior ex\n\necutiv\n\nes meet\n\nr\n\negular\n\nly t\n\no the B\n\noar\n\nd on its ac\n\ntivities\n\n.\n\nT\n\nhe k\n\ne\n\ny pillars of the Gr\n\noup\n\n'\n\ns\n\nRMF include:\n\nr\n\negular\n\nly t\n\no discuss per\n\nf\n\nor\n\nmance\n\nstandar\n\nds and pr\n\nocedur\n\nes\n\n.

This approach, along with related analysis,  identifies the range of possible outcomes, that can be  expected over a given period of time, and establishes  the likelihood of those outcomes and allocates an  appropriate amount of capital to support these activities. |              |\n| Operational   Risk | The risk of loss and/or non-compliance with  laws resulting from inadequate or failed internal  processes, people and/or systems, or from  external events. This definition includes legal  risk, and the risk of reputation loss, or damage  arising from inadequate or failed internal  processes, people and systems, but excludes  strategic risk.                                                                                                   | The Group's foundational operational risk policy is   the Operational Risk Approach. The Operational Risk  Approach and its supporting requirements includes  management and measurement of operational risks  and compliance with laws, regulations, industry  standards, codes and principles of good governance,  and internal policies and procedure.

A possible source of loss might arise  from the pursuit of an unsuccessful business  plan. For example, Strategic risk might arise  from making poor strategic business decisions,  from the sub-standard execution of decisions,  from inadequate resource allocation, or from   a failure to respond well to changes in the  business environment. | Strategic risks are discussed and managed through   our annual strategic planning process, managed by   the Executive Committee and approved by the Board.  Where the strategy leads to an increase in other Key  Material Risks (e.g. Credit Risk, Market Risk, Operational  Risk) the risk management strategies associated with  these risks form the primary controls.                                                                                                                                                                                 |              |\n| Technology   Risk  | The risk of loss and/or non-compliance   with laws from inadequate or failed internal  processes, people or systems that deliver  Technology assets and services to customers  and staff.

The increase of 1 bps was driven by deposit margin management across all divisions, favourable wholesale funding costs, and a reduction in lower margin Markets average interest earning assets as a result of lower reverse repurchase agreements. This was partially offset by growth in lower yielding liquid assets and the impact of low interest rates on earnings on capital and replicating deposits. Average interest earning assets increased $0.8 billion driven by higher central bank balances, higher liquid assets, and home lending growth across the New Zealand and Australia Retail and Commercial divisions. This was partially offset by a decrease in Institutional lending, lower reverse repurchase agreements and the impact of foreign currency translation movements.\n\nOther operating income decreased $417 million (-11%) driven by a decrease of $754 million in Markets other operating income following normalisation of financial market conditions and the impact of surplus system liquidity, a decrease in share of associates' profit of $331 million, a loss of $251 million associated with the disposal of ANZ Share Investing, and a decrease in net fee and commission income driven by lower volumed related fees due to the impact of COVID-19. This was partially offset by the impairment of Asian associates of $815 million in the prior year and favourable adjustments to loans measured at fair value.\n\nOperating expenses decreased $332 million (-4%) driven by an accelerated software amortisation charges of $197 million, goodwill impairment of $77 million and lease-related items of $50 million all in the prior year, lower restructuring expenses of $34 million and productivity benefits, partially offset by higher investment spend and a litigation settlement of $69 million.\n\nCredit impairment charges decreased $3,305 million driven by a decrease in the collectively assessed credit impairment charges reflecting an improved economic outlook together with improvements in portfolio mix, and a decrease in individually assessed credit impairment charges.\n\n58           ANZ 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n\nOUR PERFORMANCE\n\n(continued)\n\n## LARGE/NOTABLE ITEMS INCLUDED IN CASH PROFIT FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\n\nWithin continuing cash profit, the Group recognised a number of large/notable items.

Collectively assessed credit impairment provision increased substantially in the prior year driven by the forward-looking impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Improvement in the economic outlook together with improvements in portfolio mix resulted in collectively assessed credit impairment provision releases in the current year.\n\n## INDIVIDUALLY ASSESSED CREDIT IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ($m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe individually assessed credit impairment charge decreased by $765 million (-75%). The decrease in the Australia Retail and Commercial division was driven by lower impairments as the underlying flows remained subdued due to the impact of various COVID-19 support initiatives. The decrease in the Institutional division was driven by a number of impairments in the prior year.

The decrease in the Australia Retail and Commercial division was driven by the repayment of a single name restructured exposure and decreases in the retail portfolio as underlying delinquency flows remained subdued due to the impact of various COVID-19 support initiatives. The decrease in the New Zealand division was driven by upgrade of a large Agri customer and a number of Agri asset sales. The increase in the Institutional division was driven by impairments of a small number of well secured single name exposures.\n\n## TOTAL ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES ($m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe collectively assessed allowance for expected credit losses decreased $813 million (-16%) driven by a reduction of $448 million from the improving economic outlook partially offset by changes to scenario weightings and an allowance for model uncertainty due to the continuing pandemic and reductions in government support programs, a reduction of $282 million due to lower lending volumes and changes in portfolio composition, and a reduction of $153 million attributable to changes in credit risk. This was partially offset by an increase of $60 million in management adjustments and an increase of $10 million from foreign currency translation movements.\n\nThe individually assessed allowance for expected credit losses decreased $204 million (-23%) due to the impact of COVID-19 support initiatives.",

Net interest margin decreased driven by unfavourable lending mix from stronger growth in lower margin fixed rate home loans, deposit margin compression and lower earnings on capital. This was mostly offset by deposit and asset repricing benefits, favourable funding deposit mix due to strong deposit growth, and lower funding costs. Other operating income decreased driven by the loss associated with the disposal of ANZ Share Investing and lower credit card and international transaction volumes due to COVID-19 impacts. Operating expenses decreased driven by productivity benefits, lower restructuring expenses, and lease-related items and accelerated amortisation in the prior year. This was partially offset by higher investment spend and customer remediation. Credit impairment charges decreased driven by a collectively assessed credit impairment release reflecting an improved economic outlook, and lower individually assessed credit impairment charge as the underlying flows remained subdued due to the impact of various COVID-19 support initiatives.\n\n## Institutional\n\nLending volumes increased in Corporate Finance and Transaction Banking, partially offset by a decrease in Markets. Customer deposits increased in Transaction Banking and Markets. Net interest margin ex-Markets increased driven by improved lending margins. Other operating income decreased driven by lower Markets revenue following normalisation of financial market conditions and the impact of surplus system liquidity, partially offset by lower customer remediation. Other operating expenses decreased driven by productivity benefits and accelerated amortisation in the prior year, partially offset by a litigation settlement and higher restructuring expenses. Credit impairment charges decreased driven by a collectively assessed credit impairment release reflecting an improved economic outlook, and lower individually assessed credit impairment charges in Transaction Banking.\n\n## New Zealand\n\nLending volumes increased driven by home loan growth. Net interest margin increased driven by favourable deposit mix, lower funding costs and deposit repricing benefits, partially offset by headwinds from lower home loan margins due to competition, unfavourable lending mix with growth weighted to fixed rate home loans, and lower income post UDC sale completion in the prior year. Operating expenses decreased driven by lower customer remediation and restructuring expenses, lower expenses post UDC sale completion, realisation of productivity benefits, and goodwill impairment and accelerated software amortisation in the prior year. This was partially offset by higher personnel costs and investment spend. Credit impairment charges decreased driven by collectively assessed credit impairment release reflecting an improved economic outlook, and lower individually assessed credit impairment charge due lower transitions to impairment and the write-back of a large Agri customer.\n\n## Pacific\n\nOperating income decreased driven by the full year impact of Commercial portfolio repricing and reduced card fees due to border closures. Operating expenses were lower largely due to a goodwill write-off in the prior year. Credit impairment charges decreased driven by lower collectively assessed credit impairment charges.\n\n## TSO and Group Centre\n\nThe 2021 financial year included the losses from the Group's share of AmBank 1MDB settlement and goodwill impairment. The 2020 financial year included the impairment of the Asian associates and a loss on sale of UDC.\n\nOUR PERFORMANCE\n\n(continued)",

This was partially offset by decreases in deposits from banks and repurchase agreements ($10.0 billion).\n\nDebt issuances decreased $18.6 billion (-16%) driven by lower senior debt issuances which were partially replaced by the further drawdown of the TFF, classified in Deposits and other borrowings.\n\n68           ANZ 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n\nOUR PERFORMANCE\n\n(continued)\n\n## Funding\n\n|                          | 2021  $b   | 2020  $b   |\n|--------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Customer liabilities     | 601.7      | 561.3      |\n| Wholesale funding        | 274.3      | 277.5      |\n| Shareholders' equity     | 63.7       | 61.3       |\n| Total funding            | 939.7      | 900.1      |\n| Net Stable Funding Ratio | 124%       | 124%       |\n\nThe Group targets a diversified funding base, avoiding undue concentration by investor type, maturity, market source and currency.\n\nNet Stable Funding Ratio remained above the regulatory minimum of 100% throughout this period.\n\n$10.7 billion of term wholesale debt with a remaining term greater than one year as at 30 September 2021 was issued during the year. In addition, the Group drew down $8.1 billion of supplementary TFF funding in Australia.\n\n## RBA Term Funding Facility\n\nAs an additional source of funding, in March 2020, the RBA announced a term funding facility (TFF) for the banking system to support lending to Australian businesses. The TFF is a three-year secured funding facility to Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) at a fixed rate of 0.25%. APRA has determined that the TFF qualifies for inclusion in determining the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). ADIs can obtain initial funding of up to 3% of their existing credit outstanding to Australian households and businesses, and have access to additional funding if they increase lending to business, especially to small and medium-sized businesses. As at 30 September 2021, ANZ had drawn $20.1 billion under the RBA's TFF. The TFF closed to drawdowns on 30 June 2021.\n\n## RBNZ Funding for Lending Programme and Term Lending Facility\n\n- \uf0b7 Between May 2020 and July 2021, the RBNZ made funds available under a term lending facility (TLF) to promote lending to businesses. The TLF is a three to five-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a fixed rate of 0.25%.\n- \uf0b7 In November 2020, the RBNZ announced a funding for lending programme (FLP) which aimed to lower the cost of borrowing for New Zealand businesses and households. The FLP is a three-year secured funding facility for NZ banks at a floating rate of the New Zealand Official Cash Rate (OCR). New Zealand Banks can obtain initial funding of up to 4% of their lending to New Zealand resident households, non-financial businesses and non-profit institutions serving households as at 31 October 2020 (eligible loans). An additional allocation of up to 2% of eligible loans is available, subject to certain conditions. The additional allocation is available until 6 December 2022, and the initial allocation is available until 6 June 2022.\n\nAs at 30 September 2021, ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited had drawn $0.3 billion under the TLF and $0.9 billion under the FLP.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nAverage\n\n|                                   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total liquid assets ($b)  1       | 225.9  | 213.9  |\n| Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)  1 | 137%   | 139%   |\n\nThe Group holds a portfolio of high quality unencumbered liquid assets in order to protect the Group's liquidity position in a severely stressed environment, as well as to meet regulatory requirements. High Quality Liquid Assets comprise three categories, with the definitions consistent with Basel 3 LCR:\n\n- \uf0b7 Highest-quality liquid assets (HQLA1): cash, highest credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\n- \uf0b7 High-quality liquid assets (HQLA2): high credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities, high quality corporate debt securities and high quality covered bonds eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\n- \uf0b7 Alternative liquid assets (ALA): assets qualifying as collateral for the Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) and other eligible securities listed by the RBNZ.\n\nThe Group monitors and manages the size and composition of its liquid assets portfolio on an ongoing basis in line with regulatory requirements and the risk appetite set by the Board.\n\nCOVID-19 has impacted the normal operations of financial markets including funding markets, however the actions of governments globally and central banks including the RBA, RBNZ and the US Federal Reserve have provided significant liquidity support to the system and financial markets generally. ANZ's liquidity measures have remained above the regulatory minimum of 100% throughout this period.",

This represents a dividend payout ratio of 64.9% of cash profit from continuing operations.\n\nThe proposed 2021 final dividend of 72 cents per share will be fully franked for Australian taxation purposes, and carry New Zealand imputation credits of NZD 8 cents per ordinary share. It will be paid on 16 December 2021 to owners of ordinary shares at the close of business on 9 November 2021 (record date).\n\nANZ has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) and a Bonus Option Plan (BOP) that will operate in respect of the proposed 2021 final dividend.

In Australia borders have been disrupted, while Sydney and Melbourne have endured lengthy lockdowns. The situation is similar in New Zealand.\n\nWe have managed the impacts across our 33 geographies, including our major operations centres in India and the Philippines.\n\nDespite the difficult trading conditions, the bank delivered a solid result for shareholders that reflects the strength of our diversified portfolio.\n\nWe led the industry with our productivity and simplification initiatives and we are now in a strong position to take advantage of/uni00A0future opportunities.\n\nWe are rapidly building the capabilities we need for the digital world. This year alone we've recruited more than 3,000 engineering and data experts, many of whom are from the world's leading technology companies.\n\nFrom a risk perspective, our strong frameworks enabled our sound response to COVID-19 and business continuity was maintained through the year with no major operational challenges associated with the pandemic.\n\nWe also progressed the delivery of our regulatory commitments, including implementing recommendations arising from the Royal Commission, our APRA self-assessment and the implementation of BS11 in New Zealand.\n\nDespite the 12% increase in home loan revenue, there was a loss of market share in the Australian mortgage business as a result of home loan processing challenges, and a delivery delay with one of our digital transformative products. These issues are being addressed by management.\n\nIn assessing ANZ's performance the Board determined that management had exceeded or met most objectives, while also acknowledging that there have been challenges and performance was below expectations in a few key areas.\n\nAll these matters have been taken into account in assessing the Group's performance, Shayne's performance and the performance of the executive team for 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2021 VARIABLE REMUNERATION OUTCOMES\n\nAs a Board we believe we have struck the right balance in rewarding our executives for good performance while taking account of shortcomings; balancing this year's results with the significant work done to prepare the bank for long term success.\n\nShayne has role modelled ANZ's values and is a respected leader among staff as well as externally. The Board's view is that these attributes are very important to the success of ANZ and values them highly.\n\nWhile Shayne met most of his objectives, the Board determined, with Shayne's support, that the appropriate 2021 Annual Variable Remuneration (AVR) outcome was 53% of his maximum opportunity.\n\nLong Term Variable Remuneration (LTVR) of $3.5 million is also proposed. This reinforces Shayne's focus on achieving longer term strategic objectives and creating long-term value for all stakeholders. This allocation remains subject to shareholder approval at the 2021 Annual General Meeting and performance hurdles being met.\n\nFor Disclosed Executives, the Board determined their 2021 Variable Remuneration (VR) outcomes at an average outcome of 60% of maximum opportunity. This reflects the assessment of 'meeting most but not all expectations' within the Group Performance Framework.\n\n43.3% of the performance rights granted in 2017 to the CEO and Disclosed Executives (excluding the Chief Risk Officer) vested when their performance was tested in November 2020 against their performance hurdles. The remaining 56.7% of rights lapsed and executives received no value from this proportion of the awards.\n\n## FIXED REMUNERATION\n\nYou may recall the Board decided last year there would be no fixed remuneration increases for our CEO and our Disclosed Executives.\n\nFollowing the resignation of the Deputy CEO, the role was not replaced, with its BEAR accountabilities transitioned to a number of other executives. This resulted in materially expanded roles for three Disclosed Executives (Gerard Florian, Kathryn van der Merwe, and Mark Whelan) and their fixed remuneration was reviewed and adjusted accordingly.\n\n## CONTENTS\n\n1.

If the changes are approved by the Board, we will ensure they are clearly communicated to our stakeholders including disclosure in the 2022 Remuneration Report.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I invite you to consider our Remuneration Report which will be presented to shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIlana Atlas, AO | Chair - Human Resources Committee",

OVERVIEW OF ANZ'S REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK\n\n## 3.1 REMUNERATION FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW\n\nThe structure of our remuneration framework is aligned with our Reward Principles and has been designed to support ANZ's purpose and strategy.

The Board sets (and reviews annually) the CEO and Disclosed Executives' fixed remuneration based on financial ser vices market relativities reflecting their responsibilities, per formance, , experience and location.\n\nqualifications\n\nVariable remuneration (at risk) The CEO and Disclosed Executives are eligible to receive variable remuneration under the ANZ Incentive Plan (ANZIP), our variable remuneration plan.\n\n## IS\n\n## Annual Variable Remuneration (AVR)\n\n- \u00b7 Rewards the achievement of Group, and individual outcomes over a 12-month period\n- \u00b7 Determination: ANZ Group Performance Framework, individual strategic objectives, ANZ values 2 and risk/compliance assessments, and Board discretion\n- \u00b7 Maximum opportunity: 150% of fixed remuneration\n- \u00b7 Delivery: 50% cash and 50% as ANZ shares deferred over four years, subject to malus 3\n\nL\n\n## ong Term Variable Remuneration (LT VR)\n\n- \u00b7 Reinforces the CEO's focus on achieving longer term strategic objectives and creating long-term value for all stakeholders\n- \u00b7 Face value at full vesting: 140% of fixed remuneration\n- \u00b7 Delivery: Performance rights deferred for four years subject to performance hurdles and malus\n- \u00b7 Performance hurdles: Relative total shareholder return (TSR) (75%), absolute TSR (25%)\n\n## 4. 2021 OUTCOMES\n\nVariable remuneration at ANZ is genuinely at risk and can range from zero to maximum opportunity. Annual performance objectives are set at the Group and also at the Divisional/individual level at the start of each year. They are designed to be stretching yet achievable. The HR Committee and the Board make variable remuneration outcome decisions for the CEO and Disclosed Executives following lengthy and detailed discussions and assessment, supported by comprehensive analysis of performance from a number of sources. Where expectations are met, variable remuneration is likely to be awarded around target opportunity. Where performance is below expectations, awards will be less (potentially down to zero), and where above expectations, awards will be more (potentially up to maximum opportunity).\n\nRemuneration outcomes have been presented in the following three ways:\n\n- i. Year-on-Year Remuneration Awarded (see section 4.1): Reflects actual remuneration awarded in respect of the relevant financial year. As non-cash components are subject to future vesting outcomes, the awarded value may be higher or lower than the future realised value.\n- ii. Actual Remuneration Received (see section 4.2): Reflects the actual remuneration received in 2021. Received amounts include cash and the value of prior equity awards which vested in 2021.\n- iii. Statutory Remuneration (see section 9.1): Reflects remuneration in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards which includes fixed remuneration and the amortised accounting value of variable remuneration (not the actual awarded or received value in respect of the relevant financial year).\n\n## 4.1 YEAR-ON-YEAR REMUNERATION AWARDED\n\nThese tables show a year-on-year comparison of remuneration awarded to the CEO and Disclosed Executives for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 performance periods. Remuneration awarded includes any cash payments (e.g. fixed remuneration and cash variable remuneration) and the value of deferred shares and performance rights awarded for the year but which have not yet vested (i.e. the value was not received during the year).\n\n2021 remuneration outcomes reflect both the overall performance of the Group and the variability in the performance of each individual/ Division. In particular, the outcomes for the CEO, the Group Executive, Australia Retail and Commercial Banking, and Group Executive, Digital and Australia Transformation, have been most impacted by the Australian mortgage business loan processing challenges and delivery delays in a key area of our digital transformation agenda.\n\nVariable remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives are higher in 2021 compared to 2020. In 2020, the Board used its discretion and applied a 50% reduction to the 2020 variable remuneration outcomes (AVR for the CEO), having regard to the impact of COVID-19 on the business, shareholders, as well as the broader community. If we compare 2021 to 2020 without the 50% COVID-19 reduction, the CEO's total remuneration would be lower.\n\n## CEO\n\nThe 2021 LTVR shown below has not yet been awarded to the CEO, approval will be sought from shareholders at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## YEAR-ON-YEAR REMUNERATION AWARDED IN THE RELEVANT FINANCIAL YEAR - CEO:\n\nThe awarded value may be higher or lower than future realised value\n\nBoard discretion is applied when determining CEO and Disclosed Executive performance and remuneration outcomes, and also before any scheduled release of previously deferred remuneration (see section 5.3). All deferred variable remuneration is subject to malus adjustment.\n\n| Assessing behaviours based on ANZ's  values and risk/compliance standards  (including the Banking Executive  Accountability Regime (BEAR))   | Determining variable  remuneration outcomes,  with risk as a key input at  a pool and individual level   | Determining  accountability and  applying consequences  where appropriate Weighting remuneration  toward the longer-term  with a significant  proportion at risk   | Prohibiting   the hedging   of unvested  equity                                            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| WHILE SUPPORTING THE ALIGNMENT OF EXECUTIVES AND SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH:                                                                       | WHILE SUPPORTING THE ALIGNMENT OF EXECUTIVES AND SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH:                                   | WHILE SUPPORTING THE ALIGNMENT OF EXECUTIVES AND SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH:                                                                                             | WHILE SUPPORTING THE ALIGNMENT OF EXECUTIVES AND SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH:                     |\n| Substantial shareholding  requirements                                                                                                       | Significant variable  remuneration deferral  in ANZ equity                                               | Use of relative and  absolute TSR hurdles Consideration of cash profit  and economic profit in  determining the ANZIP  variable remuneration pool                  | Consideration of the  shareholder experience  in respect of the share  price and dividends |\n\n## WHILE GOVERNED BY:\n\nThe Human Resources (HR) Committee and the Board determining fixed remuneration and the variable remuneration outcomes for the CEO and each Disclosed Executive.

This was due to their roles expanding in May 2021 as they took on additional BEAR accountabilities, previously held by the Deputy CEO, following the Board's decision to not replace that role post Alexis George's resignation.\n- \u00b7 The change in Antonia Watson's fixed remuneration from 2020 to 2021 reflects the impact of exchange rate conversions, noting that her fixed remuneration is paid in NZD and converted to AUD for disclosure purposes.\n- \u00b7 The average VR outcome for Disclosed Executives is 90% of target (60% of maximum opportunity), reflecting the overall Group performance assessment of 'met most but not all expectations' (see section 4.5.3). Outcomes as a percentage of maximum range from 46% to 66%, with the variability at the lower end of the range largely due to the impact of the home loan processing issues in the Australian mortgage business and the challenges and complexities experienced in progressing some aspects of the digital agenda at pace.\n\n## IS UND EIREPEUBYSOE M\n\n## Variable Remuneration ( VR)\n\n- \u00b7 Rewarded under a single VR framework, with the appropriate mix of short and long term rewards (including performance hurdles) deferred over the short, medium and longer term\n- \u00b7 Determination: ANZ Group Performance Framework, Divisional Performance Frameworks, ANZ values and risk/compliance assessments, and Board discretion\n- \u00b7 Maximum opportunity: 402% of fixed remuneration 5\n- \u00b7 Delivery: 25% cash, 25% as ANZ shares deferred over four years subject to malus, and 50% as performance rights deferred for four years subject to performance hurdles and malus\n- \u00b7 Performance hurdles: Relative TSR (75%), absolute TSR (25%)",

The year-on-year change primarily reflects the 50% reduction to Disclosed Executives' VR outcomes in 2020 having regard to the impact of COVID-19. The differential has also been impacted by the increases to fixed remuneration applied to three executives following the transition of Deputy CEO accountabilities.\n- \u00b7 For both Mark Hand and Antonia Watson, 2021 and 2020 remuneration awarded is not directly comparable with 2019, as they were Disclosed Executives for only part of the 2019 financial year. Antonia Watson's 2020 remuneration awarded reflects her permanent appointment to the Group Executive and CEO, NZ role.\n- \u00b7 Shane Buggle's 2021 remuneration awarded reflects the period he acted as the CFO.\n- \u00b7 Variable remuneration continues to differ both year-on-year and between different executives demonstrating the at risk nature of this element of remuneration and the variability in Group and individual performance year-on-year. See section 4.4 for details.\n\n## YEAR-ON-YEAR REMUNERATION AWARDED IN THE RELEVANT FINANCIAL YEAR - DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES: The awarded value may be higher or lower than future realised value\n\n|

The lapsed/forfeited values relate to 56.7% of the performance rights we awarded in November/December 2017 which lapsed in November/December 2020 due to the performance hurdles not being met, and for A George and M Jablko forfeiture on resignation of unvested deferred remuneration. 3.

The future realised value for the CEO may be higher or lower than the awarded value based on the vesting share price for awarded equity (including the percentage of equity that vests or is forfeited).\n- \u00b7 Actual remuneration received in 2021 reflects the impact of prior equity awards that vested in 2021. For example, the performance rights awarded value in 2017 was $4.2 million, but the received value that vested to the CEO in 2021 was $1.45 million.\n\n## 2021 CEO REMUNERATION AWARDED (POTENTIAL VALUE NOT REALISED VALUE) AND ACTUAL REMUNERATION RECEIVED ($m) REMUNERATION MIX - CEO\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also needs to consider the experience and expectations of a range of stakeholders (including shareholders, customers, employees, community and regulators).\n- \u00b7 Attract, motivate and keep great people: In determining remuneration outcomes, the Board acknowledged the importance of balancing performance with being market competitive to ensure retention of key talent - particularly in a tight talent market.\n- \u00b7 Focus on how things are achieved as much as what is achieved: The Board has ensured that appropriate consideration and weight was given to performance against a balanced scorecard of objectives (which includes a risk modifier), a risk standards assessment (capturing financial and non-financial risks), and how that performance was achieved (i.e. in accordance with our values and purpose).\n- \u00b7 Be fair and simple to understand: Variable remuneration should be fair and consistent through the cycle and have regard to external influences outside of management's control.\n\n## 4.4 VARIABLE REMUNERATION - DETAIL\n\n## 4.4.1 CEO performance, AVR and LTVR\n\n## Performance\n\nWith regard to AVR, the CEO is assessed 50% on the ANZ Group Performance Framework and 50% on achievement of individual strategic objectives aligned to ANZ's strategy. Both the Group Performance Framework and individual strategic objectives are agreed by the Board at the start of the financial year and are stretching.\n\n## WEIGHTING OF FINANCIAL METRICS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AVR\n\nFinancial metrics have a 35% weighting in the Group Performance Framework and therefore notionally have a 17.5% weighting in the CEO's AVR. However, the CEO's AVR is not formulaic - outcomes are moderated by the Risk element of the Group Performance Framework and the Board's judgement on the appropriate AVR considering all aspects of performance.\n\n## LTVR\n\n100% of the LTVR hurdles are based on TSR (both relative and absolute).\n\nAt the end of the financial year, ANZ's performance is assessed against the Group Performance Framework, and the CEO's performance is assessed against his individual strategic objectives, the ANZ values (behaviours), delivery of the BEAR obligations and ANZ's risk and compliance standards. In conducting the CEO's performance assessment, the HR Committee seeks input from the Chairman, CRO (on risk management), CFO (on financial performance), GE T&C (on talent and culture matters) and Group General Manager Internal Audit (GGM IA) (on internal audit matters). Material risk, audit and conduct events that have either occurred or come to light in the year are also considered together with input from both the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board.\n\n## The Board has assessed the CEO's 2021 performance as follows:\n\n| Group Performance Framework     | Met most but not all  expectations   (see section 4.5.3)         |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Individual strategic objectives | Met most but not all  expectations (see Board  assessment below) |\n| ANZ values                      | Above expectations                                               |\n| Risk/compliance assessment      | Met expectations                                                 |\n| Overall                         | Met most but not all  expectations                               |\n\nThe Board has considered the CEO's performance in determining the appropriate AVR outcome for 2021. The Board determined, with the CEO's support, that an AVR outcome of 53% of maximum opportunity was appropriate.\n\n## 2021 CEO INDIVIDUAL STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES\n\n- \u00b7 Lead and role model the culture and accountability required to transform ANZ\n- \u00b7 Enhance the reputation of ANZ\n- \u00b7 Drive the strategic direction of the organisation, focused on building long term sustainable growth and improving ROE relative to industry peers\n- \u00b7 Deliver our digital transformation aspiration to materially enhance our customer proposition and build a platform for creating value\n- \u00b7 Focus on operational excellence and resilience, including remediation and system stability, to ensure ANZ has a robust and reliable platform to support long-term growth\n- \u00b7 Show material progress on productivity initiatives to improve customer and staff experience while driving run the bank operating costs towards a materially reduced run rate\n- \u00b7 Continue to build ExCo effectiveness and CEO succession\n\n## 4.3 AP3LLILLCITOP.NPFI N.

One outcome being a further reduction in run the bank costs, with productivity initiatives allowing for a higher level of investment spend. This was an area of continued out-performance in 2021. Other financial highlights include a strengthened balance sheet, strong capital management, improved ROE, and a declining long run credit loss rate, despite the challenging environment.\n\nDespite the positive outcomes and business momentum as we enter 2022, there was a loss of market share in the Australian mortgage business as a result of home loan processing challenges, and a delay in being 'market ready' in respect of one of our transformative digital products (noting that these matters impacted both the assessment of Group Performance as well as the Board's assessment of the CEO's performance).\n\nThe executive team performed well in a challenging environment, demonstrating a coordinated and effective response to employees, customers and regulators in a timely manner. Executive development continues with expanded portfolios for three executives as a result of the resignation of Alexis George (former Deputy CEO), and the recent appointment of Farhan Faruqui (Group Executive, International) to the position of CFO following Michelle ablko's (previous CFO) resignation.\n\nJ\n\n- \u00b7 Strengthening our future as a digital bank by progressing work around our digital agenda\n- \u00b7 Further cementing customer financial wellbeing at the heart of our business - including strong support to customers in need\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Managing risk well with an improved control environment, driving reviews of key risk areas and ensuring Board visibility of material risks, and strong progress against all regulatory obligations\n- \u00b7 Improving systems and infrastructure performance, resulting in reduced system outages and customer errors\n- \u00b7 The finalisation of a four-year Diversity & Inclusion Strategy and action plans to build the foundations for long-term sustainable improvement in gender diversity.

Glassdoor is a website where employees and former employees anonymously review companies and their management.\n\n## AVR and LTVR\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the HR Committee makes a recommendation to the Board for their approval in respect of the CEO's AVR outcome.\n\nThe CEO's AVR will vary up or down year-on-year, it is not guaranteed, and may range from zero to a maximum opportunity.\n\nThe Board exercised their discretion and determined that an AVR outcome of $2 million (53% of maximum opportunity) was appropriate for 2021 having regard to both the performance of the CEO (50% weighting) and also the overall performance of the Group (50% weighting).\n\nThe CEO's proposed LTVR of $3.5 million (performance rights face value at full vesting) ($3.5 million in 2020) is subject to shareholder approval at the 2021 AGM.\n\n## 2021 AVR Awarded\n\nThis table shows the AVR awarded to the CEO for the year ending 30 September 2021.\n\n## 2021 AVR AWARDED - CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| CEO                        | Maximum opportunity         |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| S Elliott 1 AVR $2,000,000 | 53%  of max                 |\n|                            | $1,000,000  deferred shares |\n\n+\n\nLTVR $3,500,000 performance rights face value at full vesting (subject to shareholder approval at the 2021 AGM)\n\n=\n\nTotal variable remuneration $5,500,000\n\nThe CEO has successfully led ANZ through a challenging year, progressing our key initiatives whilst also responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHe personally role models the ANZ values and is a respected leader among staff and also externally, as evidenced by the number of senior executives across Australia seeking to interact with the CEO on a range of matters - particularly our culture and purpose. The CEO's continued focus on culture, building leaders, and supporting leaders through change has resulted in another year of high engagement (despite the challenging environment), and the achievement of the #1 position as employer of choice (relative to peers) in GlassdoorGLYPH<31>.\n\nHe continues to engage deeply with regulators and government, and proactively manages our external reputation.\n\nThe CEO continued to focus on delivering against strategy and our purpose, while ensuring disciplined execution and appropriate risk management.

It also differs to his statutory remuneration which reflects the accounting expense value for 2021. Awarded remuneration shown below includes the face value of the performance rights at both threshold (50%) and full (100%) vesting.\n\nShayne Elliott's 2020 remuneration outcome was impacted by the Board exercising its discretion to apply a 50% reduction to his AVR (having regard to the impact of COVID-19 on the business, shareholders and broader community), resulting in higher remuneration outcomes (awarded, received and statutory) in 2021. The remuneration received difference between 2021 and 2020 has also been positively impacted by the 43.3% LTVR vesting outcome in 2021 compared to 0% in 2020.\n\n## SUMMARY OF TOTAL REMUNERATION - CEO\n\n## Total Remuneration\n\n|      | Awarded             | Awarded        |                          |                           |\n|------|---------------------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n|      | Threshold vesting $ | Full vesting $ | Received /one.superior $ | Statutory /two.superior $ |\n| 2021 | 6,250,000           | 8,000,000      | 5,752,821                | 5,473,399                 |\n| 2020 | 5,500,000           | 7,250,000      | 3,722,362                | 5,225,308                 |\n| 2019 | 5,700,000           | 7,800,000      | 4,093,464                | 5,181,339                 |\n\n1.

The respective weighting varies based on role focus:\n\n- \u00b7 50% weighting: CFO, GE T&C, and GE Technology\n- \u00b7 25% weighting: CRO, GE Digital & Australia Transformation, GE Australia Retail & Commercial Banking, GE & CEO NZ, GE Institutional\n\nSimilar to the Group Performance Framework, the Divisional Performance Frameworks include the key elements of Financial Discipline and Operational Resilience, Customer, and People and\n\nCulture, with Risk acting as a modifier/two.superior. The weighting of each element varies to reflect the responsibilities of each individual's role. The Financial Discipline and Operational Resilience element weightings range from 20% to 50%.\n\nThe HR Committee seeks input from the CEO, and independent reports from Risk, Finance, Talent and Culture, and Internal Audit, and also reviews material risk, audit and conduct events, and seeks input from both the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board.\n\nThe HR Committee reviews and recommends to the Board for approval the overall performance outcomes for each Disclosed Executive.\n\n## VR\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the CEO and HR Committee determine VR recommendations for each Disclosed Executive, which are ultimately approved by the Board/three.superior. VR should and does vary yearon-year in line with performance - it is not guaranteed and may be adjusted up or down ranging from zero to a maximum opportunity.\n\nAs highlighted in section 4, performance against objectives impacts variable remuneration outcomes (e.g. where expectations are met, variable remuneration is likely to be awarded around target opportunity).\n\n1. Performance arrangements for the CRO are addressed additionally by the Risk Committee. Performance arrangements for the Group Executive and CEO, NZ are determined and approved by the ANZ NZ HR Committee/ANZ NZ Board in consultation with and endorsed by the HR Committee/Board, consistent with their respective regulatory obligations. 2. Except for the CRO who has a percentage weighting assigned to Risk measures. 3. Remuneration arrangements for the Group Executive and CEO, NZ are determined and approved by the ANZ NZ Board in consultation with and endorsed by the Board, consistent with their respective regulatory obligations.\n\nThe degree of variance in individual VR outcomes reflect the weighting of the Group component (i.e. roles with 50% Group weighting will generally have less differentiation), and relative performance of the different areas/individuals, ensuring appropriate alignment between performance and reward. The outcomes demonstrate the at risk nature of VR, and that outcomes vary across the Disclosed Executives and also from year to year. The average 2021 VR for Disclosed Executives is 60% of maximum opportunity (ranging from 46% to 66%).\n\n## 2021 VR Awarded\n\nThis table shows the combined VR awarded to Disclosed Executives for the year ending 30 September 2021.\n\n## 2021 VR AWARDED - DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES 1\n\n## CURRENT DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| S Buggle VR $1,876,000                | = = $462,000   | +          | + $952,000 $462,000   | 66%  of max   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| M Carnegie VR $2,311,500              | = $569,250     | + $569,250 | + $1,173,000          | 48%  of max   |\n| K Corbally/two.superior VR $1,860,000 | = $613,800     | +          | + $613,800            | 63%  of max   |\n| G Florian VR $2,747,000               | = $676,500     | + $676,500 | + $1,394,000          | 63%  of max   |\n| M Hand VR $2,211,000                  | = $544,500     | +          | + $1,122,000 $544,500 | 46%  of max   |\n| K van der Merwe VR $2,412,000         | = $594,000     | + $594,000 | + $1,224,000          | 66%  of max   |\n| A Watson VR $2,790,316                | = $687,167     | + $687,167 | + $1,415,981          | 64%  of max   |\n| M Whelan VR $3,289,700                | = $810,150     | +          | + $1,669,400 $810,150 | 64%  of max   |\n\n## Deferred shares or deferred share rights Performance rights face value at full vesting/three.superior Cash\n\n1. 2021 VR not awarded to former Disclosed Executives A George and M Jablko. 2.

See section 5.2.3a for details of the SFS comparator group.\n\n## 4.5 ANZIP VARIABLE REMUNERATION POOL AND GROUP PERFORMANCE\n\n## 4.5.1 ANZIP variable remuneration\n\nThe ANZ Incentive Plan (ANZIP) is the variable remuneration plan operating across ANZ. The variable remuneration award each year, for around 80% of employees, is based on the overall performance of the Group (rather than individual performance) subject to individuals meeting minimum standards of performance and behaviour.\n\nWith the exception of the CEO, individual variable remuneration outcomes for all other employees including Disclosed Executives are funded under ANZIP. The Board decides the CEO's variable remuneration outcomes separately to help mitigate potential conflicts of interest. See section 8.1.3.\n\nAt the end of each financial year, the HR Committee makes a recommendation to the Board for their approval on the size of the ANZIP variable remuneration pool for that year. The Board exercise their judgement to determine the appropriate pool size - it is not a formulaic outcome.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn assessment of financial performance, in particular cash profit and economic profit informed the pool range. The Board then considered a/uni00A0range of factors in determining a fair and reasonable ANZIP pool. These included:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group Performance Framework assessment (see 4.5.3).\n- \u00b7 The quality of earnings and operating environment.\n- \u00b7 The shareholder experience during 2021 (e.g. share price growth and dividend comparison with prior periods).\n- \u00b7 Our Reward Principles (e.g. attracting, motivating and keeping great people).\n\n## 4.5.2 ANZ Group Performance Framework\n\nThe ANZ Group Performance Framework is approved by the Board at the start of each year. The key objective of our Group Performance Framework is to enable aligned focus across the organisation on delivering the critical outcomes that matter most in delivering on our strategy. It plays a key role to:\n\n- \u00b7 message internally what matters most;\n- \u00b7 reinforce the importance of sound management in addition to risk, customer, people and financial outcomes; and\n- \u00b7 inform focus of effort, prioritisation and decision-making across ANZ.\n\nThe significant economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to require rapid responses and reprioritisation of resources to ensure we are protecting our people, customers, shareholders and ANZ. In the face of these changes, we have regularly tested our business strategy and Group Performance Framework, and resolved they remain relevant to improving the financial wellbeing of our customers and creating long-term sustainable value for all of our stakeholders.\n\n## 4.5.3 Assessment against the Group Performance Framework for 2021\n\nM\n\net most but not\n\nB\n\nelo\n\nw\n\nAbo\n\nv\n\ne\n\nM\n\net\n\nM\n\net most but not\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nall expec\n\ntations\n\nexpec\n\ntations\n\nexpec\n\ntations\n\nexpec\n\ntations\n\nall expec\n\ntations\n\nAs managing risk appropriately is fundamental to the way ANZ operates, Risk forms an integral part of the assessment, directly impacting the overall Group Performance Framework outcome (a modifier ranging from 0% to 110% of the Group Performance assessment).\n\nOverall, ANZ's performance met or exceeded most expectations when considering the objectives we set ourselves, but missed in a few key areas. In an uncertain and volatile environment, the bank performed well, delivering with purpose against the vast majority of our objectives, while recognising there are areas where continued focus is required to improve. These areas primarily relate to home lending momentum in Australia, the pace of delivery for one of our more complex projects focused on digital innovation, and non-financial risk outcomes.\n\nThe below table outlines ANZ's performance objectives in 2021 and provides a summary of outcomes for each of the key performance categories to inform the overall assessment for 2021. Performance against expectations is evaluated for each category using a holistic assessment of progress and outcomes delivered in line with our Group strategic priorities and annual focus areas. A range of objective indicators and subjective factors are considered including management input on work undertaken, evidence of outcomes realised and lessons learned, and with consideration given to the operating, regulatory and competitive environment.",

the financial wellbeing of our customers, which remains  central to our business strategy. Sound progress has been made to deliver great outcomes across key segments, however  after a strong first half, we experienced material challenges processing home loan application volumes in Australia. This has  resulted in our customers experiencing longer than expected wait times for loan approval decisions and increased volumes  in our assessment backlog. While we were able to tactically manage and improve the situation, strengthening our policy  and processes in this area remains a high priority focus. Given the Australian Home Portfolio is a significant proportion of the  group balance sheet, under performance in this area has significantly impacted the performance assessment. In Australia, our Financial Wellbeing activities achieved 1.34 million visits to our Financial Wellbeing Hub on  anz.com.au since launch and a 7% uplift in consideration during the major 'Financial Wellbeing Challenge' campaign over the 2021  Australian Open. We also launched a 'gambling block' on the ANZ mobile app, a new Cashrewards program for customers  to earn cashback payments on everyday spending and additional support for customers with persistent credit card debt. |                                         |                                         |                                         |\n| Our GoBiz product was launched for business owners, creating the ability for customers to apply for loans in 20 minutes,  while a new joint venture was established with Worldline for merchant services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                         |                                         |                                         |\n| In New Zealand, we launched a new Financial Wellbeing platform 'We Do How'.

The Group uses cash profit 1 as a measure of performance for the Group's ongoing business activities, as this provides a basis to assess Group and Divisional performance against earlier periods and against peer institutions. Although cash profit is not audited, the external auditor has informed the Audit Committee that recurring adjustments have been determined on a consistent basis across each period presented.\n\nStatutory profit has increased 72% compared to the prior financial year, while cash profit from continuing operations has increased 65%. This improvement was driven primarily by a credit provision release of $567 million (compared to a $2.7 billion pre-tax charge in the prior financial year) as a result of an improved economic outlook.\n\nDuring 2021 the Group commenced a $1.5 billion share buy-back to return surplus capital to its shareholders, which up to 30 September 2021 has resulted in the Group returning $654 million of capital to shareholders via the acquisition of 23 million shares on market. See 'Note 23 Shareholders' Equity' of the Annual Report.\n\nThe table below provides ANZ's financial performance, including cash profit, over the last five years.\n\n|                                                                                     | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Statutory profit ($m)                                                               | 6,406  | 6,400  | 5,953  | 3,577  | 6,162  |\n| Cash profit ($m, unaudited)                                                         | 6,938  | 5,805  | 6,161  | 3,660  | 6,181  |\n| Cash profit - Continuing operations ($m, unaudited)                                 | 6,809  | 6,487  | 6,470  | 3,758  | 6,198  |\n| Cash profit before provisions - Continuing operations ($m, unaudited)               | 10,849 | 9,966  | 9,958  | 8,369  | 8,396  |\n| Cash ROE (%) - Continuing operations (unaudited)                                    | 11.7   | 11.0   | 10.9   | 6.2    | 9.9    |\n| Cash EPS - Continuing operations (unaudited)                                        | 232.7  | 223.4  | 227.6  | 132.7  | 218.3  |\n| Share price at 30 September ($) (On 1 October 2016, opening share price was $27.63) | 29.60  | 28.18  | 28.52  | 17.22  | 28.15  |\n| Total dividend (cents per share)                                                    | 160    | 160    | 160    | 60     | 142    |\n| Total shareholder return (12 month %)                                               | 13.1   | 0.6    | 9.2    | (36.9) | 70.7   |\n\n1.

The outcomes for performance rights granted in November/December 2017 and tested in November 2020 are detailed in section 4.4.3.\n\n## 5. 2021 EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION STRUCTURE AND DELIVERY\n\nThere are two core components of remuneration at ANZ - fixed remuneration and at risk variable remuneration.\n\nIn structuring remuneration, the Board aims to find the right balance between fixed and variable remuneration (at risk), the way it is delivered (cash versus deferred remuneration) and appropriate time frames (the short, medium and long-term).\n\nThe Board sets (and reviews annually) the CEO and Disclosed Executives' fixed remuneration based on financial services market relativities and reflecting their responsibilities, performance, qualifications and experience.\n\nThe way variable remuneration operates differs somewhat between the CEO and Disclosed Executives. Namely:\n\n- \u00b7 The CEO's variable remuneration is comprised of AVR and LTVR (subject to shareholder approval), which provides consistency with external market practice, and LTVR reinforces his focus on achieving longer term strategic objectives and long-term stakeholder value creation.\n- \u00b7 Disclosed Executives are subject to one combined VR plan (i.e. a mix of short and also long term rewards with performance hurdles) deferred over the short, medium and longer term.\n\nVariable remuneration seeks to differentiate for performance and is designed to focus our CEO and Disclosed Executives on stretching performance objectives supporting our business strategy, risk management and the delivery of long-term stakeholder value.\n\nBy deferring a significant portion of variable remuneration (74% of maximum opportunity for the CEO, 75% for Disclosed Executives and 67% for the CRO), we seek to ensure alignment with shareholder interests to deliver on ANZ's strategic objectives and ensure a focus on long-term value creation. Deferred variable remuneration has significant retention elements, and most importantly, can be adjusted downwards, including to zero, allowing the Board to hold executives accountable, individually or collectively, for the longer term impacts of their decisions and actions.\n\nBoard discretion is applied when determining all CEO and Disclosed Executive variable remuneration outcomes, and also before any scheduled release of previously deferred remuneration (i.e. consider malus or further deferral). See section 5.3.\n\n## 5.1 REMUNERATION MIX (PERFORMANCE RIGHTS AT FULL VESTING)\n\nWe structure the CEO and Disclosed Executives' remuneration as follows:\n\n## REMUNERATION MIX - CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMinimum\n\n=  Fixed remuneration ($2.5 million)\n\nTarget\n\n=  Fixed remuneration + target AVR (100% of /fixed remuneration) + LTVR (140% of /fixed remuneration)\n\nMaximum =  Fixed remuneration + maximum AVR (150% of /fixed remuneration) + LTVR (140% of /fixed remuneration)\n\n## REMUNERATION MIX - DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES 1\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## CRO\n\nTo preserve the independence of the role and to minimise any conflicts of interest in carrying out the risk control function across the organisation, the CRO's remuneration arrangements differ to other Disclosed Executives.\n\nThe remuneration mix is 27% fixed remuneration and 73% VR at maximum opportunity. The VR target opportunity is 180% of fixed remuneration and VR maximum opportunity is 270% of fixed remuneration. VR is delivered as 33% cash, 33% deferred shares and 34% deferred share rights (instead of performance rights).\n\n## 5.2 VARIABLE REMUNERATION DELIVERY\n\nVariable remuneration for the CEO and the Disclosed Executives (excluding the CRO) is delivered partly in cash, shares deferred over four years, and performance rights deferred for four years. The performance rights are also subject to performance hurdles which determine whether they vest in four years' time.\n\n60% of variable remuneration (AVR plus LTVR) for the CEO, 53% of VR for Disclosed Executives (other than the CRO), and 41% of VR for the CRO will be deferred for at least four years (from the date the Board approved the variable remuneration in October (and the date shareholders approve the CEO's LTVR)), noting that this complies with the BEAR minimum deferral requirement of 60% for the CEO and 40% for Disclosed Executives.\n\nBefore any scheduled release of deferred shares/deferred share rights/performance rights, the Board considers whether any malus/ downward adjustment of previously deferred remuneration (or further deferral of vesting) should be made for the CEO and Disclosed Executives.

Variable remuneration outcomes were approved by the ANZBGL Board on 15 October 2021, and in addition for A Watson by the ANZ NZ Board on 19 October 2021. The CEO's performance rights are subject to shareholder approval at the 2021 AGM. 2. Deferred shares for the CRO vest as follows: 30% at the end of years 1 and 2, and 20% at the end of years 3 and 4. 3. Deferred share rights for the CRO.\n\n## 5.2.1 Cash - CEO (AVR) and Disclosed Executives (VR)\n\nThe cash component of variable remuneration is paid to executives at the end of the annual Performance and Remuneration Review (December 2021).\n\n## 5.2.2 Deferred shares - CEO (AVR) and Disclosed Executives (VR)\n\nDeferred shares are ordinary shares, deferred over one to four years. By deferring part of an executives' remuneration over time (and it remaining subject to malus), we enable a substantial amount of their remuneration to be directly linked to delivering long-term shareholder value. We grant deferred shares in respect of performance for the 1 October to 30 September financial year in late November each year.\n\nWe calculate the number of deferred shares to be granted based on the VWAP of the shares traded on the ASX in the five trading days leading up to and including the date of grant. For disclosure and expensing purposes, we use the one day VWAP at the date of grant to determine the fair value.\n\nIn some cases, we may grant deferred share rights to executives instead of deferred shares. Each deferred share right entitles the holder to one ordinary share.\n\n## 5.2.3a Performance rights - CEO (LTVR) and Disclosed Executives (VR) excluding the CRO\n\nA performance right is a right to acquire one ordinary ANZ share at nil cost - as long as time and performance hurdles are met. The future value of performance rights may range from zero to an indeterminate value. The value depends on our performance against the hurdles and on the share price at the time of exercise.\n\nThe performance rights have a four-year performance period (and remain subject to malus up to the vesting date). For the 2021 grant, the performance period is from 22 November 2021 to 21 November 2025. A four-year performance period provides sufficient time for longer term performance to be reflected.\n\nMore detail relating to the 2021 performance rights is provided below.\n\n| Element                             | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performance   rights hurdles        | The performance rights have TSR performance hurdles reflecting the importance of focusing on achieving longer term  strategic objectives and aligning executives' and shareholders' interests.

Each tranche value is then divided by the market price (five trading day VWAP  of ANZ shares at the start of the performance period) to determine the number of performance rights we award in  each tranche. |\n|                                                 | Performance rights are allocated in late November/early December for Disclosed Executives and December for the   CEO (subject to shareholder approval).                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Expensing  performance  rights                  | ANZ engages PricewaterhouseCoopers to independently determine the fair value of performance rights, which is only  used for expensing purposes. They consider factors including: the market performance conditions, share price volatility,  life of the instrument, dividend yield, and share price at grant date.                                                                 |\n\n## 5.2.3b Deferred share rights - CRO (VR)\n\nThe CRO receives deferred share rights instead of performance rights to preserve the independence of the role and to minimise any conflicts of interest in carrying out the risk control function across the organisation.\n\nThe CRO's deferred share rights are subject to a time-based vesting hurdle of four years. The value the Board uses to determine the number of deferred share rights to be allocated to the CRO is the face value of the Company's shares traded on the ASX at the time of grant (five trading day VWAP).\n\n## 5.3 MALUS (DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT OF PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED REMUNERATION) - BOARD DISCRETION\n\nAll deferred remuneration we award to an employee is subject to ANZ's on-going and absolute discretion to adjust this downward (malus) (including to zero) at any time.\n\nANZ may exercise this discretion, for example, where:\n\n- \u00b7 there is a need to protect the financial soundness of ANZ or to meet regulatory requirements or there has been a material failure of risk management or controls within ANZ;\n- \u00b7 the employee has acted fraudulently or dishonestly, failed to act with due care, skill and diligence, or failed to comply with ANZ policies (including the Code of Conduct), processes or directions;\n- \u00b7 the employee is responsible or accountable, directly or indirectly, by virtue of their role or seniority for an occurrence/event which has had an adverse impact on ANZ;\n- \u00b7 there has been misconduct and the employee was involved directly or indirectly, failed to take adequate steps, could be considered responsible due to their seniority, or the decision to award or grant the deferred remuneration was made on the basis of misinformation.\n\nFurther, where the CEO and/or Disclosed Executives of ANZ have failed to comply with their accountability obligations under the BEAR, their deferred remuneration will be reduced by an amount that is proportionate to the failure, as required by the BEAR.\n\nAn employee's deferred remuneration is also subject to ANZ's on-going and absolute discretion to further defer the vesting. Where ANZ exercises this discretion, the vesting date is postponed and will not vest unless and until ANZ determines it should vest.\n\nBefore any scheduled vesting of deferred remuneration, the Board (for the CEO, Disclosed Executives and other specified roles) and/or the Enterprise Accountability Group (EAG) (for other employees) considers whether malus/downward adjustment or further deferral should be applied. See section 6 for details.\n\n## 6. ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONSEQUENCE FRAMEWORK\n\nThroughout 2021 we continued to strengthen and evolve ANZ's Accountability and Consequence Framework (A&CF).\n\nThe Enterprise Accountability Group (EAG) operates under the delegated authority of the Board HR Committee and:\n\n- \u00b7 supports the Board in monitoring the implementation and ongoing effectiveness of ANZ's A&CF, being cognisant of its impact on the culture of ANZ.\n- \u00b7 is chaired by the CEO and members include the CRO, CFO and GE T&C.\n- \u00b7 reviews the most material risk, conduct and audit events (as relevant), accountability and the application of consequences, where appropriate.\n- \u00b7 provides guidance to the Divisions and considers initiatives across the Divisions to strengthen risk behaviours and recognise risk role models, whose achievements are profiled across the organisation.\n\nIn 2021, 43 individuals were recognised as role modelling outstanding risk behaviours for their work to manage and mitigate the organisation's risks and their continuous improvement of our risk culture. The recognition provided included personalised messages from the CEO, the opportunity to meet with the Board and ExCo, and having their achievements profiled on our intranet and in internal newsletters.\n\nThe EAG has processes in place to ensure that we mitigate the risk of conflicts of interest in reviewing events and determining accountability and consequences. For example, when undertaking accountability reviews, a recommendation regarding the review leader must be sent to the CRO or (in the case of an event involving Group Risk) the CEO, for review and approval to ensure the individual is capable of undertaking an impartial and unbiased review. Further, considerations regarding accountability and consequences for our most senior executives are considered and determined by the HR Committee and Board.\n\nReports on the most material risk, audit and conduct issues were presented to the HR, Risk and Audit Committees at a concurrent meeting. This information was taken into consideration by the Board when considering the performance of the Group and the 2021 ANZIP variable remuneration pool for all employees, and determining the performance and remuneration outcomes of the CEO and Disclosed Executives.\n\nThe HR Committee and Board consider accountability and consequences for the CEO and Disclosed Executives, including the application of malus to previously deferred remuneration. No/uni00A0malus was applied to the previously deferred remuneration of the CEO and Disclosed Executives during 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen determining consequences, consideration is given to the level of accountability, and the severity of the issue, including customer impacts. Consequences may include, for example, one or more of the following: counselling, formal warnings, impacts to in year performance and remuneration outcomes or application of malus to previously deferred remuneration and ultimately termination of employment for the most serious issues.\n\nOur ongoing focus on accountability, consequences and driving a strong risk culture supports our customer commitment that when things go wrong, we fix them quickly and hold executives, current (and former where we can), to account where appropriate. We are also focused on ensuring that we learn from the cause of the event, and mitigate the risk of future recurrences and continuously seek to strengthen our risk culture. We review the effectiveness of the A&CF every year and implement enhancements to further strengthen the framework based on regulatory and internal stakeholder input.\n\nWe also continue to raise employee awareness of, and promote the various ways that employees can speak up and raise issues and ideas for improvement including through initiatives such as the Whistleblower Awareness Day, and through monitoring responses in our employee engagement surveys. Key risk and speak-up scores, including 'Leaders demonstrate accountability for risk' (87%), 'I can raise issues without fear of reprisals' (80%) and 'When I speak up, my ideas, opinions and concerns are heard' (81%) held firm at or near the 2020 highs.\n\nIn 2021, there were 1,435 matters involving alleged breaches of our Code of Conduct with 573 resulting in a formal consequence or the employee leaving ANZ, marginally up from 569 in 2020. Breaches ranged from compliance/procedural breaches (44%), general unacceptable behaviour (31%) through to email/systems misuse (11%), attendance issues (5%), fraud/theft (4%), conflict of interest (3%) and breaches of our Equal Opportunity, Bullying and Harassment Policy (2%). Outcomes following investigations of/uni00A0breaches this year included 114 terminations, 381 warnings and 78 employees leaving ANZ 1 . There was no evidence of broader systemic conduct issues.\n\nIn relation to the application of consequences to our senior leadership population (senior executives, executives and senior managers), 16 current and former employees (34 in 2020) had a consequence applied as a result of the application of our Code of Conduct policy and/or findings of accountability for a relevant event. Consequences included warnings, impacts on performance and remuneration outcomes and, for former employees, downward adjustment of previously deferred remuneration where relevant. The 16 current and former employees represent 0.6% of our senior leadership population.",

NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (NED) REMUNERATION\n\n## 7.1 REMUNERATION STRUCTURE\n\nThe HR Committee reviewed NED fees for 2021 and determined not to increase their fees.\n\nNEDs receive a base fee for being a Director of the Board, and additional fees for either chairing, or being a member of a Board Committee. The Chairman of the Board does not receive additional fees for serving on a Board Committee.\n\nIn setting Board and Committee fees, the Board considers: general industry practice, ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations, the responsibilities and risks attached to the NED role, the time commitment expected of NEDs on Group and Company matters, and fees paid to NEDs of comparable companies.\n\nANZ compares NED fees to a comparator group of Australian listed companies with a similar market capitalisation, with particular focus on the major financial services institutions. This is considered an appropriate group, given similarity in size and complexity, nature of work and time commitment by NEDs.\n\nTo maintain NED independence and impartiality:\n\n- \u00b7 NED fees are not linked to the performance of the Group; and\n- \u00b7 NEDs are not eligible to participate in any of the Group's variable remuneration arrangements.\n\nThe current aggregate fee pool for NEDs of $4 million was approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. The annual total of NEDs' fees, including superannuation contributions, is within this agreed limit.\n\nThis table shows the NED fee policy structure for 2021.\n\n## 2021 NED FEE POLICY STRUCTURE\n\n|            | Board /one.superior/comma.superior /two.superior   | Audit   Committee   | Risk   Committee   | HR   Committee   | Digital Business &  Technology  Committee   | Ethics, Environment,  Social &  Governance Committee   |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Chair fee  | $825,000                                           | $65,000             | $62,000            | $57,000          | $45,000                                     | $35,000                                                |\n| Member fee | $240,000                                           | $32,500             | $31,000            | $29,000          | $15,000                                     | $15,000                                                |\n\n1. Including superannuation. 2. The Chairman of the Board does not receive additional fees for serving on a Board Committee. The Chairman of the Board and NEDs do not receive a fee for serving on the Nomination and Board Operations Committee.\n\n## NED shareholding guidelines\n\nWe expect our NEDs to hold ANZ shares. NEDs are required:\n\n- \u00b7 to accumulate shares - over a five-year period from their appointment - to the value of 100% (200% for the Chairman) of the NED member fee; and\n- \u00b7 to maintain this shareholding while they are a Director of ANZ.\n\nAs at 30 September 2021, based on the ANZ share price at that time, all NEDs who have served five years met the holding requirement.\n\n## 7.2 2021 STATUTORY REMUNERATION - NEDS\n\nThe following table outlines the statutory remuneration disclosed in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards for the NEDs.\n\nIn addition to the fees shown below, Sir John Key also received NZD 391,000 in each of 2020 and 2021 for his role as Chairman of ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited.\n\n## 2021 STATUTORY REMUNERATION - NEDS\n\n|                                      | Short-term NED benefits   | Short-term NED benefits   | Short-term NED benefits    | Post-employment           | Post-employment          |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                      | Financial  year           | Fees 1 $                  | Non monetary  benefits 2 $ | Super   contributions 1 $ | Total   remuneration 3 $ |\n| Current Non-Executive Directors      |                           |                           |                            |                           |                          |\n| P O'Sullivan/four.superior           | 2021                      | 764,033                   | 19,931                     | 22,163                    | 806,127                  |\n|                                      | 2020                      | 243,331                   | -                          | 19,207                    | 262,538                  |\n| I Atlas                              | 2021                      | 322,337                   | -                          | 22,163                    | 344,500                  |\n|                                      | 2020                      | 323,324                   | -                          | 21,176                    | 344,500                  |\n| P Dwyer                              | 2021                      | 365,000                   | -                          | -                         | 365,000                  |\n|                                      | 2020                      | 354,326                   | -                          | 10,674                    | 365,000                  |\n| J Halton                             | 2021                      | 306,837                   | -                          | 22,163                    | 329,000                  |\n|                                      | 2020                      | 307,824                   | -                          | 21,176                    | 329,000                  |\n| J Key                                | 2021                      | 278,837                   | -                          | 22,163                    | 301,000                  |\n|                                      | 2020                      | 279,824                   | -                          | 21,176                    | 301,000                  |\n| G Liebelt                            | 2021                      | 341,337                   | -                          | 22,163                    | 363,500                  |\n|                                      | 2020                      | 342,324                   | -                          | 21,176                    | 363,500                  |\n| J Macfarlane                         | 2021                      | 296,337                   | -                          | 22,163                    | 318,500                  |\n|                                      | 2020                      | 297,324                   | -                          | 21,176                    | 318,500                  |\n| Former Non-Executive Directors       |                           |                           |                            |                           |                          |\n| D Gonski/five.superior               | 2021                      | 57,348                    | 3,363                      | 5,424                     | 66,135                   |\n|                                      | 2020                      | 803,824                   | -                          | 21,176                    | 825,000                  |\n| Total of all Non-Executive Directors | 2021                      | 2,732,066                 | 23,294                     | 138,402                   | 2,893,762                |\n|                                      | 2020                      | 2,952,101                 | -                          | 156,937                   | 3,109,038                |",

It reviews the remuneration policies and practices of the Group, and monitors market practice and regulatory and compliance requirements in Australia and overseas.\n\nDuring the year the HR Committee met on five occasions/one.superior and reviewed and approved, or made recommendations to the Board on matters including:\n\n- \u00b7 remuneration for the CEO and other key executives (broader than those disclosed in the Remuneration Report) covered by the ANZBGL Remuneration Policy, and fees for the NEDs;\n- \u00b7 ANZ's response to the industry-wide Retail Remuneration Review by Stephen Sedgwick AO;\n- \u00b7 updates on APRA's draft Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration, the BEAR Thematic Review, and Treasury's Financial Accountability Regime (FAR);\n- \u00b7 potential changes to the executive reward structure in light of CPS 511/two.superior;\n- \u00b7 the ANZ Group Performance Framework (annual objectives setting and assessment) and annual variable remuneration spend;\n- \u00b7 performance and reward outcomes for key senior executives, including the consideration of material events that have either occurred or came to light in the year;\n- \u00b7 the release, further deferral or application of malus/downward adjustment of deferred remuneration;\n- \u00b7 key senior executive appointments and terminations;\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness of the ANZBGL Remuneration Policy;\n- \u00b7 building capabilities required to deliver on our strategy;\n- \u00b7 succession plans for key senior executives;\n- \u00b7 culture and governance including updates on the strengthened Accountability and Consequence Framework (A&CF); and\n- \u00b7 diversity, inclusion, and employee engagement.\n\nMore details about the role of the HR Committee, including its Charter, can be found on our website. Go to anz.com > Our company > Strong governance framework > ANZ Human Resources Committee Charter.\n\n1. A subset of the HR Committee also met on a number of occasions during the year to discuss regulatory developments and 2021 outcomes. 2. A HR Committee sub-group was established to review in detail the executive reward structure.\n\n## 8.1.2 Link between remuneration and risk\n\nThe HR Committee has a strong focus on the relationship between business performance, risk management and remuneration, aligned with our business strategy. The chairs of the Risk and Audit Committees are members of the HR Committee and the full Board is in attendance for specific HR Committee meetings. A concurrent meeting of the HR, Risk and Audit Committees was held to review:\n\n- \u00b7 material risk, conduct and audit events that either occurred or came to light in 2021;\n- \u00b7 2021 performance and variable remuneration recommendations at both the Group and Disclosed Executive level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo further reflect the importance of the link between remuneration and risk:\n\n- \u00b7 the Board had two NEDs (in addition to the Chairman) in 2021 who served on both the HR Committee and the Risk Committee;\n- \u00b7 the HR Committee has free and unfettered access to risk and financial control personnel (the CRO and CFO attend HR Committee meetings for specific agenda items);\n- \u00b7 the CRO provides an independent report to the HR Committee on the most material risk, conduct and audit events (as relevant) to help inform considerations of performance and remuneration, and accountability and consequences at the Group, Divisional and individual level;\n- \u00b7 the CRO also provides an independent report to assist the Board in their assessment of performance and remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives;\n- \u00b7 the chairs of the Audit and Risk Committees are asked to provide input to ensure appropriate consideration of all relevant risk and internal audit issues; and\n- \u00b7 the Group Performance Framework and Divisional Performance Frameworks include Risk as a key element acting as a modifier, and it forms an integral part of each framework's assessment and directly impacts the overall outcomes.\n\n## 8.1.3 Conflict of interest\n\nTo help mitigate potential conflicts of interest:\n\n- \u00b7 management are not in attendance when their own performance or remuneration is being discussed by the HR Committee or Board;\n- \u00b7 the CEO's AVR is funded and determined separately from the ANZIP pool;\n- \u00b7 the CRO's remuneration arrangements differ to other Disclosed Executives to preserve the independence of the role;\n- \u00b7 the EAG also has processes in place to help mitigate conflicts of interest as outlined in section 6; and\n- \u00b7 the HR Committee seeks input from a number of sources to inform their consideration of performance and remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives including:\n- - independent reports from Risk, Finance, Talent and Culture, and Internal Audit;\n- - material risk, conduct and audit event data provided by the CRO;\n- - input from both the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board.\n\n## 8.1.4 External advisors provided information but not recommendations\n\nThe HR Committee can engage independent external advisors as needed.\n\nThroughout the year, the HR Committee and management received information from the following external providers: Aon, Ashurst, EY, Mercer Consulting (Australia) Pty Ltd and PricewaterhouseCoopers. This information related to market data, market practices, analysis and modelling, legislative requirements and the interpretation of governance and regulatory requirements.\n\nDuring the year, ANZ did not receive any remuneration recommendations from external consultants about the remuneration of KMP.\n\nANZ employs in-house remuneration professionals who provide recommendations to the HR Committee and the Board. The Board made its decisions independently, using the information provided and with careful regard to ANZ's strategic objectives, purpose and values, risk appetite and the ANZBGL Remuneration Policy and Principles.\n\n## 8.2 INTERNAL GOVERNANCE\n\n## 8.2.1 Hedging prohibition\n\nAll deferred equity must remain at risk until it has fully vested. Accordingly, executives and their associated persons must not enter into any schemes that specifically protect the unvested value of equity allocated. If they do so, then they would forfeit the relevant equity.\n\n## 8.2.2 CEO and Disclosed Executives' shareholding guidelines\n\nWe expect the CEO and each Disclosed Executive to, over a five-year period:\n\n- \u00b7 accumulate ANZ shares to the value of 200% of their fixed remuneration; and\n- \u00b7 maintain this shareholding level while they are an executive of ANZ.\n\nFor this purpose, shareholdings include all vested and unvested equity that is not subject to performance hurdles. Based on equity holdings as at 30 September 2021, and the equity to be granted on 22 November 2021 as a result of the 2021 Performance and Remuneration Review outcomes, the CEO and all Disclosed Executives meet or, if less than five years' tenure, are on track to meet their minimum shareholding guidelines requirements.\n\n## 8.2.3 CEO and Disclosed Executives' contract terms and equity treatment\n\nThe details of the contract terms and also the equity treatment on termination (in accordance with the Conditions of Grant) relating to the CEO and Disclosed Executives are below. Although they are similar, they vary in some cases to suit different circumstances.\n\n| Type of contract                                 | Permanent ongoing employment contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Notice on resignation                            | \u00b7 12 months by CEO; \u00b7 6 months by Disclosed Executives/one.superior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Notice on termination   by ANZ/two.superior      | \u00b7 12 months by ANZ for CEO and Disclosed Executives/three.superior. However, ANZ may immediately terminate an individual's employment at any time in the case of serious  misconduct. In that case, the individual will be entitled only to payment of fixed remuneration up to the date  of their termination and their statutory entitlements. |\n| How unvested   equity is treated on  leaving ANZ | Executives who resign or are terminated will forfeit all their unvested deferred equity - unless the Board  determines otherwise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n\nIf an executive is terminated due to redundancy or they are classified as a 'good leaver', unless the Board determines otherwise, then:\n\n- \u00b7 their deferred shares/share rights are released at the original vesting date;\n- \u00b7 their performance rights/four.superior remain on foot and are released at the original vesting date (to the extent that the performance hurdles are met); and\n- \u00b7 their performance rights/four.superior (for grants awarded pre 31 December 2020) are prorated for service to the full notice termination date and released at the original vesting date (to the extent that the performance hurdles are met).\n\nOn an executive's death or total and permanent disablement, their deferred equity vests.\n\nUnvested equity remains subject to malus post termination.\n\n## Change of control (applies to the CEO only)\n\nIf a change of control or other similar event occurs, then we will test the performance conditions applying to the CEO's performance rights. They will vest to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied.\n\n1. 3 months by the Acting CFO. 2. For K Corbally and M Hand, their contracts state that in particular circumstances they may be eligible for a retrenchment benefit in accordance with the relevant ANZ policy, as varied from time to time, and M Hand is also eligible to receive a Retirement Allowance on retirement, retrenchment, death, or resignation for illness, incapacity or domestic reasons (see footnote 5 of section 9.1). For A Watson, notice on retrenchment is 6 weeks and compensation on retrenchment is calculated on a scale up to a maximum of 79 weeks after 25 years' service. 3. 6 months by ANZ for the Acting CFO. 4.

Cash salary includes any adjustments required to reflect the use of ANZ's Lifestyle Leave Policy for the period in the KMP role. 2. Non monetary benefits generally consist of company-funded benefits (and the associated Fringe Benefits Tax) such as car parking, taxation services, costs met by the Company in relation to in-country benefits, and gifts received on leaving ANZ for former Disclosed Executives. 3. The total cash incentive relates to the cash component only. The relevant amortisation of the AVR/VR deferred components is included in share-based payments and has been amortised over the vesting period. The total AVR/VR was approved by the ANZBGL Board on 15 October 2021, and in addition for A Watson by the ANZ NZ Board on 19 October 2021. 100% of the cash component of the AVR/VR awarded for the 2020 and 2021 years vested to the executive in the applicable financial year. 4. For all Australian based executives, the 2020 and 2021 superannuation contributions reflect the Superannuation Guarantee Contribution based on the Maximum Contribution Base. A Watson participates in KiwiSaver where ANZ provides an employer superannuation contribution matching member contributions up to 4% of total gross pay (less employer superannuation contribution tax). 5. Accrual relates to Retirement Allowance. As a result of being employed with ANZ before November 1992, M Hand is eligible to receive a Retirement Allowance on retirement, retrenchment, death, or resignation for illness, incapacity or domestic reasons. The Retirement Allowance is calculated as three months of preserved notional salary (which is 65% of fixed remuneration) plus an additional 3% of notional salary for each year of fulltime service above 10 years less the total accrual value of long service leave (including taken and untaken). 6. Long service leave accrued during the year increased year-on-year for K van der Merwe and M Whelan as a result of their fixed remuneration increases. 7. As required by AASB 2 Share-based payments, the amortisation value includes a proportion of the fair value (taking into account market-related vesting conditions) of all equity that had not yet fully vested as at the commencement of the financial year. The fair value is determined at grant date and is allocated on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period. The amount included as remuneration neither relates to, nor indicates, the benefit (if any) that the executive may ultimately realise if the equity\n\nbecomes exercisable. No terms of share-based payments have been altered or modified during the financial year. There were no cash settled share-based payments or any other form of sharebased payment compensation during the financial year for the CEO or Disclosed Executives. 8. Other equity allocations relate to employment arrangements such as compensation for deferred remuneration forfeited, and shares received in relation to the historical Employee Share Offer. 9. Termination benefits reflect payment of accrued annual leave and long service leave in accordance with contract, payable on cessation. 10. S Buggle's 2021 remuneration reflects a partial service year as he commenced in a Disclosed Executive role on 8 February 2021. 11. A Watson's fixed remuneration is paid in NZD and converted to AUD. In 2018, 2019 and 2020 A Watson was eligible to receive shares under the historical Employee Share Offer. That offer provided a grant of ANZ shares in each financial year to eligible employees subject to Board approval. See Note 31 Employee Share and Option Plans for further details on the historical Employee Share Offer. 12. A/uni00A0George ceased employment 30 July 2021. Remuneration reflects up to her date of resignation (noting her annual fixed remuneration for 2021 remained unchanged at $1.1 million). Share-based payments include the expensing treatment on resignation for unvested deferred remuneration (including reversals for forfeiture on resignation). Termination benefits reflect payment for accrued annual leave and long service leave in accordance with contract, payable on resignation. 13. M Jablko ceased employment 7 February 2021. Remuneration reflects up to her date of resignation (noting her annual fixed remuneration for 2021 remained unchanged at $1.1 million). Share-based payments include the expensing treatment on resignation for unvested deferred remuneration (including reversals for forfeiture on resignation). Other equity allocations for M Jablko relate to previously disclosed compensation for deferred remuneration forfeited. Termination benefits reflect payment for accrued annual leave in accordance with contract, payable on resignation.",

The information below forms part of this Directors' Report:\n\n- \u00b7 Principal activities on page 10\n- \u00b7 Operating and financial review on pages 56 to 70\n- \u00b7 Dividends on page 70\n- \u00b7 Information on the Directors, Company Secretaries and Directors' meetings on pages 40 to 50\n- \u00b7 Remuneration report on pages 74 to 109.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STATE OF AFFAIRS\n\nThere have been no significant changes in the Group's state of affairs.\n\n## EVENTS SINCE THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nOn 22 October 2021, a Group fund that owns 19% of the shares in Cashrewards Limited announced it would make an off-market takeover offer to acquire the remaining 81% of the shares, for ~$80 million. The offer is subject to a number of conditions and completion remains uncertain.\n\nOther than the matter above, there have been no significant events from 30 September 2021 to the date of signing this report.\n\n## POLITICAL DONATIONS\n\nFor the year ending 30 September 2021, our Public Policy Advocacy, Political Donations and Foreign Influence Policy included an annual donation to the two major federal political parties to support Australia's democratic process. In October 2020, ANZ donated $100,000 to the Liberal Party of Australia and $100,000 to the Australian Labor Party. ANZ also attended paid events including business forums hosted by the major Australian Federal political parties, totalling $47,600. ANZ discloses associated costs and donations through the Australian Electoral Commission's (AEC) donors annual return process, noting the AEC's reporting year is a different period to ANZ's financial year.\n\nANZ updated its policy on 1 October 2021. It prohibits political donations, but allows attendance at paid events hosted by the major Australian Federal political parties.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION\n\nANZ recognises the expectations of its stakeholders - customers, shareholders, staff and the community - to operate in a way that mitigates its environmental impact.\n\nIn Australia, ANZ meets the requirements of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth), which imposes reporting obligations where energy production, usage or greenhouse gas emissions trigger specified thresholds.\n\nThe Group does not believe that its operations are subject to any other particular and significant environmental regulation under a law of the Commonwealth of Australia or of an Australian State or Territory. It may become subject to environmental regulation as a result of its lending activities in the ordinary course of business and has developed policies, which are reviewed on a regular basis to help identify and manage such environmental matters.\n\nHaving made due enquiry, and to the best of ANZ's knowledge, no entity of the Group has incurred any material environmental liability during the year. Further details of ANZ's environmental performance, including progress against its targets and management of material issues aligned with its commitment to fair and responsible banking and priority areas of financial wellbeing, environmental sustainability and housing, are available in ANZ's ESG Supplement, at anz.com/annualreport .\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT\n\nANZ is committed to maintaining a high standard in its governance framework. ANZ confirms it has followed the ASX Corporate Governance Council's Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4th edition) during the 2021 financial year. ANZ's Corporate Governance Statement, together with the ASX Appendix 4G which relates to the Corporate Governance Statement, can be viewed at anz.com/corporategovernance and has been lodged with the ASX.\n\n## PILLAR 3 INFORMATION\n\nANZ provides information required by APS 330: Public Disclosure in the Regulatory Disclosures section at anz.com/shareholder/centre/ reporting/regulatory-disclosure/ .\n\n## EXTERNAL AUDITOR\n\nThe Group's external auditor is KPMG. The Group appointed Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co (predecessor to KPMG) in 1969.\n\nThe Board Audit Committee conducts a formal annual performance assessment of the external auditor, including whether to commence an external tender for the audit. After considering relevant factors including tenure, audit quality, local and international capability and experience, and independence, the Board Audit Committee resolved to reappoint KPMG for the 30 September 2022 financial year audit.\n\nThe KPMG Lead Audit Engagement Partner for the Group was appointed for the financial year ended 30 September 2021 replacing the previous Lead Audit Engagement partner who had been in the role since the 30 September 2017 financial year. In addition, KPMG regularly rotates the Engagement Quality Control Review Partner with the most recent rotation being for the financial year ended 30/uni00A0September 2020.\n\n## NON-AUDIT SERVICES\n\nThe Group's Stakeholder Engagement Model for Relationship with the External Auditor (the Policy), which incorporates requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and industry best practice, prevents the external auditor from providing services that are perceived to be in conflict with the role of the external auditor or breach independence requirements. This includes consulting advice and sub-contracting of operational activities normally undertaken by management, and engagements where the external auditor may ultimately be required to express an opinion on its own work.\n\nSpecifically the Policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Limits the scope of non-audit services that may be provided;\n- \u00b7 Requires that audit, audit-related and permitted non-audit services be considered in light of independence requirements and for any potential conflicts of interest before they are approved by the Audit Committee, or approved by the Chair of the Audit Committee (or delegate) and notified to the Audit Committee; and\n- \u00b7 Requires pre-approval before the external auditor can commence any engagement for the Group.\n\nFurther details about the Policy can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement.\n\nThe external auditor has confirmed to the Audit Committee that it has:\n\n- \u00b7 Implemented procedures to ensure it complies with independence rules in applicable jurisdictions; and\n- \u00b7 Complied with applicable policies and regulations in those jurisdictions regarding the provision of non-audit services, and the Policy.\n\nThe Audit Committee has reviewed the non-audit services provided by the external auditor during the 2021 financial year, and has confirmed that the provision of these services is consistent with the Policy, compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 . This has been formally advised by the Audit Committee to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe categories of non-audit services supplied to the Group during the year ended 30 September 2021 by the external auditor, KPMG, or by another person or firm on KPMG's behalf, and the amounts paid or payable (including GST) by the Group are as follows:\n\n|                                    | Amount paid/payable  $'000's   | Amount paid/payable  $'000's   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Non-audit services                 | 2021                           | 2020                           |\n| Training and related services      | -                              | 16                             |\n| Controls related assessments       | 90                             | -                              |\n| Methodology and procedural reviews | 101                            | 107                            |\n| Total                              | 191                            | 123                            |\n\nFurther details on the compensation paid to KPMG is provided in Note 34 Auditor Fees to the financial statements including details of audit-related services provided during the year of $4.43/uni00A0million (2020: $5.37 million).\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Directors are satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor during the year ended 30 September 2021 is compatible with the general standard of independence for external auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001 and did not compromise the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNITY\n\nThe Company's Constitution (Rule 11.1) permits the Company to:\n\n- \u00b7 Indemnify any officer or employee of the Company, or its auditor, against liabilities (so far as may be permitted under applicable law) incurred as such by an officer, employee or auditor, including liabilities incurred as a result of appointment or nomination by the Company as a trustee or as an officer or employee of another corporation; and\n- \u00b7 Make payments in respect of legal costs incurred by an officer, employee or auditor in defending an action for a liability incurred as such by an officer, employee or auditor, or in resisting or responding to actions taken by a government agency, a duly constituted Royal Commission or other official inquiry, a liquidator, administrator, trustee in bankruptcy or other authorised official.\n\nIt is the Company's policy that its employees should be protected from any liability they incur as a result of acting in the course of their employment, subject to appropriate conditions.\n\nUnder the policy, the Company will indemnify employees and former employees against any liability they incur to any third party as a result of acting in the course of their employment with the Company or a subsidiary of the Company and this extends to liability incurred as a result of their appointment/nomination by or at the request of the Group as an officer or employee of another corporation or body or as trustee.\n\nThe indemnity is subject to applicable law and certain exceptions. In accordance with the employee indemnity policy, the Company has during or since the year ended 30 September 2021 paid legal expenses totalling $1,815,847.35 incurred by Mr Richard Moscati in relation to legal proceedings brought against him and the Company by a third party.\n\nThe Company has entered into Indemnity Deeds with each of its Directors, with certain secretaries and former Directors of the Company, and with certain employees and other individuals who act as directors or officers of related bodies corporate or of another company, to indemnify them against liabilities and legal costs of the kind mentioned in the Company's Constitution.\n\nDuring the financial year, the Company has paid premiums for insurance for the benefit of the Directors and employees of the Company and related bodies corporate of the Company. In accordance with common commercial practice, the insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium.",

ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThese are the financial statements for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ('the Company') and its controlled entities (together, 'the Group' or 'ANZ') for the year ended 30 September 2021. The Company is incorporated and domiciled in Australia. The address of the Company's registered office and its principal place of business is ANZ Centre, 833 Collins Street, Docklands, Victoria, Australia 3008. The Group provides banking and financial services to individuals and business customers and operates in and across 32 markets.\n\nOn 27 October 2021, the Directors resolved to authorise the issue of these financial statements.\n\nInformation in the financial statements is included only to the extent we consider it material and relevant to the understanding of the financial statements. A disclosure is considered material and relevant if, for example:\n\n- \uf0b7 the amount is significant in size (quantitative factor);\n- \uf0b7 the information is significant by nature (qualitative factor);\n- \uf0b7 the user cannot understand the Group's results without the specific disclosure (qualitative factor);\n- \uf0b7 the information is critical to a user's understanding of the impact of significant changes in the Group's business during the period - for example, business acquisitions or disposals (qualitative factor);\n- \uf0b7 the information relates to an aspect of the Group's operations that is important to its future performance (qualitative factor); and\n- \uf0b7 the information is required under legislative requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) or by the Group's principal regulators, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).\n\nThis section of the financial statements:\n\n- \uf0b7 outlines the basis upon which the Group's financial statements have been prepared; and\n- \uf0b7 discusses any new accounting standards or regulations that directly impact the financial statements.\n\n## BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThis financial report is a general purpose (Tier 1) financial report prepared by a 'for profit' entity, in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AASs) and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), the Corporations Act 2001, and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nWe present the financial statements of the Group in Australian dollars, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency. We have rounded values to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated, as allowed under the ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors Report) Instrument 2016/191. We measure the financial statements of each entity in the Group using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates (the functional currency).\n\n## BASIS OF MEASUREMENT\n\nWe have prepared the financial information in accordance with the historical cost basis - except the following assets and liabilities which we have stated at their fair value:\n\n- \uf0b7 derivative financial instruments and in the case of fair value hedging, a fair value adjustment made to the underlying hedged item;\n- \uf0b7 financial instruments held for trading;\n- \uf0b7 financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \uf0b7 financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income; and\n- \uf0b7 assets and liabilities classified as held for sale (except those at carrying value).\n\nIn accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits (AASB 119) we have measured defined benefit obligations using the Projected Unit Credit Method.\n\n## DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nThe sale of Wealth Australia business to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF) and Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich) completed across 2020 and 2019. The financial results of these divested businesses are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries. An entity, including a structured entity, is considered a subsidiary of the Group when we determine that the Company has control over the entity. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. We assess power by examining existing rights that give the Company the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity. We have eliminated, on consolidation, the effect of all transactions between entities in the Group.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nANZ 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## 1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\n## TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the relevant spot rate. Any foreign currency translation gains or losses that arise are included in profit or loss in the period they arise.\n\nWe measure translation differences on non-monetary items at fair value through profit or loss and report them as part of the fair value gain or loss on these items. For non-monetary items classified as investment securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, translation differences are included in other comprehensive income.\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS THAT HAVE A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY THAT IS NOT AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS\n\nThe financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars for consolidation into the Group Financial Statements using the following method:\n\n| Foreign currency item   | Exchange rate used                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assets and liabilities  | The reporting date rate                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Equity                  | The initial investment date rate                                                                                                                                           |\n| Income and expenses     | The average rate for the period - but if for a significant transaction we believe the average rate is not  reasonable, then we use the rate at the date of the transaction |\n\nExchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. When we dispose of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences are transferred to profit or loss.\n\n## FIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Group provides fiduciary services to third parties including custody, nominee and trustee services. This involves the Group holding assets on behalf of third parties and making decisions regarding the purchase and sale of financial instruments. If ANZ is not the beneficial owner or does not control the assets, then we do not recognise these transactions in these financial statements, except when required by accounting standards or another legislative requirement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements and applied estimates and assumptions about past and future events. Further information on the key judgements and estimates that we consider material to the financial statements are contained within each relevant note to the financial statements.\n\n## Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing effects on the global economy has continued to impact our customers, operations and Group performance. Governments have responded at unprecedented levels to protect the health of the population, local economies and livelihoods. The course of the pandemic and vaccination levels has varied across the globe and government responses have differed in their extent and timing. Economies are reopening at different rates whilst the risk of subsequent waves of infection remain. Thus there remains an elevated level of estimation uncertainty involved in the preparation of these financial statements including:\n\n- \uf0b7 the extent and duration of the disruption to business arising from the actions of governments, businesses and consumers in the ongoing management of the virus;\n- \uf0b7 the impact and expected response of the economy (and forecasts of key economic factors including GDP, employment and house prices). This includes the response of capital markets, and the impacts on credit quality, liquidity, unemployment, consumer spending, as well as specific sector impacts; and\n- \uf0b7 the efficacy of vaccines against variants of the virus, and the effectiveness of government and central bank measures to support businesses and consumers through this disruption.\n\nThe Group has made various accounting estimates in this Financial Report based on forecasts of economic conditions which reflect expectations and assumptions as at 30 September 2021 about future events that the Directors believe are reasonable in the circumstances. There is a considerable degree of judgement involved in preparing these estimates. The underlying assumptions are also subject to uncertainties which are outside the control of the Group. Accordingly, actual economic conditions are likely to be different from those forecast since anticipated events frequently do not occur as expected, and the effect of those differences may significantly impact accounting estimates included in these financial statements.\n\nThe significant accounting estimates impacted by these forecasts and associated uncertainties are predominantly related to expected credit losses and recoverable amounts of non-financial assets.\n\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on each of these estimates is discussed further in the relevant note of these financial statements. Readers should carefully consider these disclosures in light of the inherent uncertainty described above.\n\n121",

ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THE PERIOD\n\n## INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM\n\nInterbank offered rates (IBORs), such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) have played a critical role in global financial markets, serving as reference rates for derivatives, loans and securities, and in the valuation of financial instruments. Uncertainty surrounding the integrity of IBOR rates has led to regulators and industry to transition away from IBOR to alternative risk-free benchmark reference rates (RFRs).\n\nAs had been anticipated, in March 2021 the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the dates on which IBORs will cease, after which representative IBOR rates will no longer be available. The cessation of the majority of IBOR rates will occur on 31 December 2021, notably for the Pound Sterling (GBP), Euro (EUR), Swiss Franc (CHF) and Japanese Yen (JPY) settings in their entirety, and the US Dollar (USD) 1-week and 2-month LIBOR settings. The Group has ceased issuing new products referencing these rates. Other USD LIBOR settings will cease by 30 June 2023.\n\nThe Group has exposure to IBORs through its loan and derivative transactions with customers, issuance of debt and its asset and liability management activities.\n\nOther significant interest rate benchmarks applicable to the Group's banking activities with customers and our own risk management activities include the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), the AUD Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW) and the NZ Bank Bill Market (BKBM). These are not impacted by IBOR reform and these benchmark rates are expected to remain for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Group approach to interest rate benchmark reform\n\nThe development of new RFR products and the migration of the Group's existing contracts that reference IBORs to RFRs exposes the Group to financial, compliance, legal and operational risks. The Group is managing the transition to RFRs and these risks through an enterprise-wide Benchmark Transition Program (the Program), which is overseen by a formal Steering Committee of senior executives. The Program provides regular updates to the Group Executive and Board Audit & Board Risk committees.\n\nThe IBOR reforms have a wide-ranging impact for the Group and our customers given the fundamental differences between IBORs and RFRs. RFRs are available both as backward-looking in arrears rates and, for some currencies, as forward-looking term rates. The key difference between IBORs and RFRs is that IBOR rates include a term and bank credit risk premium, whereas RFRs do not. As a result of these differences, adjustments are required to an RFR to ensure contracts referencing an IBOR rate, transition on an economically comparable basis.\n\nThe Program includes the identification of impacted IBOR contracts across the Group, actions necessary to develop product capability and transition existing contracts to RFRs. This includes the assessment and mitigation of financial, legal and conduct risks arising from changes to pricing and valuation (largely interest rate risk), compliance risks arising from any potential non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, legal risks arising from changes to customer contracts, and operational risks including changes to IT systems, controls and reporting infrastructure. In undertaking these changes, the Group is actively engaging with various regulatory bodies across a number of countries in which the Group operates in respect of our IBOR transition readiness. From an industry perspective, the Group is also actively participating in, and contributing to, different RFR Working Groups, industry associations and business forums focusing on different aspects of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nTo date, the Group has successfully transitioned a significant number of loan transactions that previously referenced an IBOR benchmark, to referencing an RFR benchmark rate. The Group has also commenced transitioning existing IBOR derivative trades to reference RFR benchmark rates. The Group continues to extend and deliver its RFR product suite and pricing options to be able support our customers in line with regulatory best practice guidelines.\n\nThe Program also includes the management of the impact on customers. The Group is well-progressed in ensuring all customer transition plans are finalised ahead of IBOR cessation dates, with the significant majority of our derivative counterparties with exposures referencing IBORs agreeing to amend existing contracts by adhering to the industry developed ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (ISDA Protocol) to facilitate a standardised and orderly transition to RFRs. The Group has also adhered to the ISDA Protocol.\n\nIn relation to our loan and transaction banking customers, the Group has commenced a proactive outreach program to ensure an orderly and wellmanaged migration to RFRs. Given that USD LIBOR will continue to be published for the most widely used settings until 30 June 2023, the Program is focussing on customer engagement with those customers whose arrangements reference IBORs ceasing on 31 December 2021.\n\n122\n\nANZ 2021 ANNUAL REPORT\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## 1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THE PERIOD (continued)\n\n## Changes to accounting standards iii) Hedge accounting exposures subject to IBOR reform\n\nIn 2018, given the uncertainty with regards to the longer term viability of IBORs, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) commenced a review of the financial reporting implications of the reforms, given the significant potential consequences for financial instrument accounting. The Group has hedge-accounted relationships referencing IBORs, with the most significant being USD LIBOR, primarily due to fixed rate investment securities and the Group's fixed rate debt issuances denominated in USD that are designated in fair value hedge accounting\n\nIn October 2019, the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) issued AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 1, which amended certain existing hedge accounting requirements to provide relief from potential effects of the uncertainty caused by the interest rate benchmark reform. The Group elected to early adopt the amendments from 1 October 2019, which have not had a significant impact on the Group. relationships. The table below details the carrying values of the Group's USD exposures designated in hedge accounting relationships referencing LIBOR that will be impacted by reform. The nominal value of the associated hedging instruments is also included: As at 30 September 2021\n\nIn September 2020, the AASB issued AASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 (the Standard), which the Group early adopted from 1 April 2021. This Standard addresses issues that may affect the Group at the point of transition from an existing IBOR rate to a RFR, including the effects of changes to contractual cash flows or hedging relationships. The Standard includes amendments in respect of: Hedged items $m Investment securities at FVOCI 13,096 Net loans and advances 236 Deposits and other borrowings 577 Debt issuances 24,249\n\n- \uf0b7 Modification of a financial asset or a financial liability measured at amortised cost: IBOR reform is expected to result in a change to the basis for determining contractual cash flows of impacted assets and liabilities of the Group. The Standard provides a practical expedient to account for a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows by updating the effective interest rate. As a result, no immediate gain or loss is recognised. This applies only when the change is a direct consequence of IBOR reform, and the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically comparable to the previous basis; Hedging instruments Notional designated up to 30 June 2023 $m Notional designated beyond 30 June 2023 $m Total notional amount $m Fair value hedges 13,335 23,043 36,379 Cash flow hedges 458 258 716\n- \uf0b7 Additional relief for hedging relationships: the Standard also amends a number of existing hedge accounting requirements such that the Group will not have to discontinue any hedge accounting relationships solely because of changes made because of the reform if all other hedge accounting criteria are met; and As at 30 September 2021, the Group also has GBP, CHF and JPY exposures designated in hedge accounting relationships of $1,510 million, $940 million and $1,853 million respectively subject to IBOR reform.\n- \uf0b7 Additional disclosure requirements: the Standard amended AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures in relation to the impact of IBOR reforms on the Group. These disclosures are contained within this note. Other hedge accounting relationships referencing the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), the AUD Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW) and the NZ Bank Bill Market (BKBM) are not impacted by IBOR reform as these benchmark rates are expected to remain for the foreseeable future.\n\n## Financial Impacts of IBOR reform iv) Future Developments\n\n## i) Impact for the year ended 30 September 2021\n\nThe following sets out the Group's impact assessment in relation to IBOR reforms as at 30 September 2021: As the most widely referenced USD LIBOR benchmark tenors will continue to be published up to 30 June 2023, the Group's transition program supporting our customers and the Group's own risk management activities will continue beyond 2021.\n\n- For the year ended 30 September 2021, the net impact of the IBOR reforms recognised in the Group's net profit after tax is not material. The impacts recognised in the current year include: REVISED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK On 1 October 2020, the Group adopted the revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. The new Framework includes updated definitions\n- a) changes in the fair values of certain derivative financial instruments for which it is known at balance sheet date - as a result of regulatory pronouncements confirming IBOR cessation - that the fair valuation will incorporate a change to an RFR at a future date; and and criteria for the recognition and derecognition of assets and liabilities. Additionally, it introduces new concepts on measurement, including factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis. The adoption of the revised conceptual framework did not have a material impact on the Group.\n- b) revenue from a small number of customers in the Institutional division who have transitioned to loan and derivative contracts referencing an RFR by 30 September. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED\n\nA number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been published but are not mandatory for the financial statements\n\nThe table below shows the Group's exposure to interest rate benchmarks subject to IBOR reform.

ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THE PERIOD (continued)\n\n## iii) Hedge accounting exposures subject to IBOR reform\n\nThe Group has hedge-accounted relationships referencing IBORs, with the most significant being USD LIBOR, primarily due to fixed rate investment securities and the Group's fixed rate debt issuances denominated in USD that are designated in fair value hedge accounting relationships.\n\nThe table below details the carrying values of the Group's USD exposures designated in hedge accounting relationships referencing LIBOR that will be impacted by reform. The nominal value of the associated hedging instruments is also included:\n\n| Hedged items                        |                           |                            | As at 30 September 2021  $m   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Investment securities at FVOCI      |                           |                            | 13,096                        |\n| Net loans and advances              |                           |                            | 236                           |\n| Deposits and other borrowings       |                           |                            | 577                           |\n| Debt issuances                      |                           |                            | 24,249                        |\n|                                     | Notional designated up to | Notional designated beyond |                               |\n| Hedging instruments                 | 30 June 2023              | 30 June 2023   $m          | Total notional amount  $m     |\n|                                     | $m                        | 23,043                     | 36,379                        |\n| Fair value hedges  Cash flow hedges | 13,335  458               | 258                        | 716                           |\n\nAs at 30 September 2021, the Group also has GBP, CHF and JPY exposures designated in hedge accounting relationships of $1,510 million, $940 million and $1,853 million respectively subject to IBOR reform.\n\nOther hedge accounting relationships referencing the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), the AUD Bank Bill Swap Rate (BBSW) and the NZ Bank Bill Market (BKBM) are not impacted by IBOR reform as these benchmark rates are expected to remain for the foreseeable future.\n\n## iv) Future Developments\n\nAs the most widely referenced USD LIBOR benchmark tenors will continue to be published up to 30 June 2023, the Group's transition program supporting our customers and the Group's own risk management activities will continue beyond 2021.\n\n## REVISED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK\n\nOn 1 October 2020, the Group adopted the revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting. The new Framework includes updated definitions and criteria for the recognition and derecognition of assets and liabilities. Additionally, it introduces new concepts on measurement, including factors to consider when selecting a measurement basis. The adoption of the revised conceptual framework did not have a material impact on the Group.\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED\n\nA number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been published but are not mandatory for the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2021, and have not been applied by the Group in preparing these financial statements. Further details of these are set out below.\n\n## GENERAL HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging both financial and non-financial risks. AASB 9 provides the Group with an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139) hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board's ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. The Group continues to apply the hedge accounting requirements of AASB 139.\n\n## AASB 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS (AASB 17)\n\nThe final version of AASB 17 was issued in July 2017 and is not effective for the Group until 1 October 2023. It will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts. AASB 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts.\n\nThe measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements under AASB 17 are significantly different from current accounting standards. Although the overall profit recognised in respect of insurance contracts will not change, it is expected that the timing of profit recognition will change.\n\nAASB 17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.\n\n124\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED (continued)\n\n## DEFERRED TAX RELATED TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM A SINGLE TRANSACTION\n\nAASB 2021-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction amends AASB 112 Income Taxes and clarifies that entities are required to recognise deferred tax on transactions for which there is both an asset and a liability and that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. This may include transactions such as leases and decommissioning or restoration obligations. This amendment is effective for the Group from 1 October 2023 and is not expected to have a significant impact.\n\n## CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## INTRAGROUP TRANSACTIONS WITH CONSOLIDATED SECURITISATION ENTITIES\n\nDuring the year, the Company changed its accounting policy relating to intragroup transactions with consolidated securitisation structured entities (SEs) in which it holds all the instruments issued by the SE. The Company will no longer separately record a liability to pass the cash flows from the underlying loans to the SE and an asset in the form of notes issued by the SE which entitle the Company to those same cash flows. Rather the transactions will be considered together with the Company recording a net nil position with the SE in order to better reflect the economic substance of the intragroup transactions that are fully offsetting. Comparatives have been restated in the financial statements of the Company. There has been no change to the Group because the relevant securitisation SEs are fully consolidated and the intra-group transactions eliminated. Refer to Note 35 Impact of Adoption of New Standards and Other Changes for further details of this change.\n\n125",

We use the effective interest rate method to calculate the amortised cost of assets held at amortised cost and to recognise interest income on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the stream of estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. For assets subject to prepayment, we determine their expected life on the basis of historical behaviour of the particular asset portfolio - taking into account contractual obligations and prepayment experience.\n\nWe recognise fees and costs, which form an integral part of the financial instrument (for example loan origination fees and costs), using the effective interest rate method. These are presented as part of interest income or expense depending on whether the underlying financial instrument is a financial asset or financial liability.\n\n## Major Bank Levy\n\nThe Major Bank Levy Act 2017 ('Levy' or 'Major bank levy') applies a rate of 0.06% to certain liabilities of the Company. The Group has determined that the levy represents a finance cost for the Group and the Company and it is presented as interest expense in the Income Statement.\n\n126\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 3.

NON-INTEREST INCOME (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## OTHER OPERATING INCOME\n\n## Fee and Commission Revenue\n\nWe recognise fee and commission revenue arising from contracts with customers (a) over time when the performance obligation is satisfied across more than one reporting period or (b) at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied immediately or is satisfied within one reporting period.\n\n- \uf0b7 lending fees exclude fees treated as part of the effective yield calculation of interest income. Lending fees include certain guarantee and commitment fees where the loan or guarantee is not likely to be drawn upon, and other fees charged for providing customers a distinct good or service that are recognised separately from the underlying lending product (including annual package fees that provide benefits on other ANZ products).\n- \uf0b7 non-lending fees includes fees associated with deposit and credit card accounts, interchange fees and fees charged for specific customer transactions such as international money transfers. Where the Group provides multiple goods or services to a customer under the same contract, the Group allocates the transaction price of the contract to distinct performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied.\n- \uf0b7 commissions represent fees from third parties where we act as an agent by arranging a third party (such as an insurance provider) to provide goods and services to a customer. In such cases, we are not primarily responsible for providing the underlying good or service to the customer. If the Group collects funds on behalf of a third party when acting as an agent, we only recognise the net commission it retains as revenue. When the commission is variable based on factors outside our control (such as a trail commission), revenue is only recognised if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the variable amount will not be required in future periods.\n- \uf0b7 funds management income represents fees earned from customers for providing financial advice and fees for asset management services and advice provided to investment funds. Revenue is recognised either at the point the financial advice is provided or over the period in which the asset management services are delivered. Performance fees associated with funds management activities are only recognised when it becomes highly probable the performance hurdle will be achieved.\n\n## Net Foreign Exchange Earnings and Other Financial Instruments Income\n\nWe recognise the following as net foreign exchange earnings and other financial instruments income:\n\n- \uf0b7 exchange rate differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and translation differences on monetary items translated at rates different to those at which they were initially recognised or included in a previous financial report;\n- \uf0b7 fair value movements (excluding realised and accrued interest) on derivatives that we use to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk on funding instruments not designated as accounting hedges;\n- \uf0b7 the ineffective portions of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges;\n- \uf0b7 immediately upon sale or repayment of a hedged item, the unamortised fair value adjustments in items designated as fair value hedges and amounts accumulated in equity related to designated cash flow hedges;\n- \uf0b7 fair value movements on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss or held for trading;\n- \uf0b7 amounts released from the fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) reserve when a debt instrument classified as FVOCI is sold; and\n- \uf0b7 the gain or loss on derecognition of financial assets or liabilities measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Gain or Loss on Disposal of Non-Financial Assets\n\nThe gain or loss on the disposal of assets is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the proceeds of disposal net of costs. This is recognised in Other income in the year in which the significant risks and rewards from the asset transfer to the buyer.\n\nWhen a non-financial asset or group of assets is classified as held for sale, the difference between the carrying value immediately prior to reclassification and the fair value less costs to sell is recognised in Other operating income to align with the classification of gain or loss on sale that would have applied if the sale had completed during the year.\n\n128\n\n## 3. NON-INTEREST INCOME (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## NET INCOME FROM INSURANCE BUSINESS\n\nWe recognise:\n\n- \uf0b7 premiums received (net of reinsurance premiums paid) based on an assessment of the likely pattern in which risk will emerge over the term of the policies written. This assessment is undertaken periodically and updated in accordance with the latest pattern of risk emergence; and\n- \uf0b7 claims incurred net of reinsurance, on an accruals basis once the liability to the policy owner has been established under the terms of the contract and through actuarial assumptions of future claims.\n\n## SHARE OF ASSOCIATES' PROFIT/(LOSS)\n\nThe equity method is applied to accounting for associates. Under the equity method, our share of the after tax results of associates is included in the Income Statement and the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n129",

OPERATING EXPENSES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## OPERATING EXPENSES\n\nOperating expenses are recognised as services are provided to the Group, over the period in which an asset is consumed, or once a liability is created.\n\n## SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS - ANNUAL LEAVE, LONG SERVICE LEAVE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nWages and salaries, annual leave and other employee entitlements expected to be paid or settled within twelve months of employees rendering service are measured at their nominal amounts using remuneration rates that the Group expects to pay when the liabilities are settled.\n\nWe accrue employee entitlements relating to long service leave using an actuarial calculation. It includes assumptions regarding staff departures, leave utilisation and future salary increases. The result is then discounted using market yields at the reporting date. The market yields are determined from a blended rate of high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity that closely match the estimated future cash outflows.\n\nIf we expect to pay short term cash bonuses, then a liability is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount (as a result of past service provided by the employee) and the obligation can be reliably measured.\n\nPersonnel expenses also include share-based payments which may be cash or equity settled. We calculate the fair value of equity settled remuneration at grant date, which is then amortised over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in share capital or the share option reserve as applicable. When we estimate the fair value, we take into account market vesting conditions, such as share price performance conditions. We take non-market vesting conditions, such as service conditions, into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the expense.\n\nAfter the grant of an equity-based award, the amount we recognise as an expense is reversed when non-market vesting conditions are not met, for example an employee fails to satisfy the minimum service period specified in the award on resignation, termination or notice of dismissal for serious misconduct. However, we do not reverse the expense if the award does not vest due to the failure to meet a marketbased performance condition.\n\nFurther information on share-based payment schemes operated by the Group during the current and prior year is included in Note 31 Employee Share and Option Plans.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n131",

INCOME TAX (continued)\n\n## TAX CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Company and all its wholly owned Australian resident entities are part of a tax-consolidated group under Australian taxation law. The Company is the head entity in the tax-consolidated group. We recognise each of the following in the separate financial statements of members of the tax consolidated group on a 'group allocation' basis: tax expense/income, and deferred tax liabilities/assets that arise from temporary differences of the members of the tax-consolidated group. The Company (as head entity in the tax-consolidated group) recognises current tax liabilities and assets of the tax-consolidated group.\n\nUnder a tax funding arrangement between the entities in the tax-consolidated group, amounts are recognised as payable to or receivable by the Company and each member of the tax-consolidated group in relation to the tax contribution amounts paid or payable between the Company and the other members of the tax-consolidated group.\n\nMembers of the tax-consolidated group have also entered into a tax sharing agreement that provides for the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities were the head entity to default on its income tax payment obligations.\n\n## UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets related to unused realised tax losses (on revenue account) total $6 million (2020: $10 million) for the Group and $2 million (2020: $5 million) for the Company.\n\nUnrecognised deferred tax liabilities related to additional potential foreign tax costs (assuming all retained earnings in offshore branches and subsidiaries are repatriated) total $344 million (2020: $329 million) for the Group and $15 million (2020: $14 million) for the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## INCOME TAX EXPENSE\n\nIncome tax expense comprises both current and deferred taxes and is based on the accounting profit adjusted for differences in the accounting and tax treatments of income and expenses (that is, taxable income). We recognise tax expense in profit or loss except when the tax relates to items recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income, in which case we recognise the tax directly in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.\n\n## CURRENT TAX EXPENSE\n\nCurrent tax is the tax we expect to pay on taxable income for the year, based on tax rates (and tax laws) which are enacted at the reporting date. We recognise current tax as a liability (or asset) to the extent that it is unpaid (or refundable).\n\n## DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nWe account for deferred tax using the balance sheet method. Deferred tax arises because the accounting income is not always the same as the taxable income. This creates temporary differences, which usually reverse over time. Until they reverse, we recognise a deferred tax asset, or liability, on the balance sheet. We measure deferred taxes at the tax rates that we expect will apply to the period(s) when the asset is realised, or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.\n\nWe offset current and deferred tax assets and liabilities only to the extent that:\n\n- \uf0b7 they relate to income taxes imposed by the same taxation authority;\n- \uf0b7 there is a legal right and intention to settle on a net basis; and\n- \uf0b7 it is allowed under the tax law of the relevant jurisdiction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nJudgement is required in determining provisions held in respect of uncertain tax positions. The Group estimates its tax liabilities based on its understanding of the relevant law in each of the countries in which it operates and seeks independent advice where appropriate.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n133",

Eligible shareholders can elect to forgo their dividend entitlement and instead receive ANZ ordinary shares under the Company's Bonus Option Plan (BOP). For the 2021 final dividend, DRP participation will be satisfied by an on-market purchase, and BOP participation will be satisfied by an issue, of new ANZ ordinary shares. There will be no discount applied to the DRP and BOP price.\n\nSee Note 23 Shareholders' Equity for details of shares the Company purchased or issued in respect of the DRP and BOP.\n\n134\n\n## 6. DIVIDENDS (continued)\n\n## DIVIDEND FRANKING ACCOUNT\n\n|                                                                                                                                                         | Currency   | 2021  $m   | 2020  $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Australian franking credits available at 30% tax rate                                                                                                   | AUD        | 772        | 477        |\n| New Zealand imputation credits available (which can be attached to our Australian  dividends but may only be used by New Zealand resident shareholders) | NZD        | 5,020      | 4,583      |\n\nThe above amounts represent the balances of the franking accounts as at the end of the financial year, adjusted for:\n\n- \uf0b7 franking credits that will arise from the payment of income tax payable as at the end of the financial year; and\n- \uf0b7 franking credits/debits from the receipt/payment of dividends that have been recognised as tax receivables/payables as at the end of the financial year.\n\nThe proposed final 2021 dividend will utilise the entire balance of $772 million franking credits available at 30 September 2021. Instalment tax payments on account of the 2021 financial year, which will be made after 30 September 2021, will generate sufficient franking credits to enable the final 2021 dividend to be fully franked. The extent to which future dividends will be franked will depend on a number of factors, including the level of profits generated by the Group that will be subject to tax in Australia.\n\n## RESTRICTIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS\n\nAPRA's written approval is required before paying dividends on ANZ ordinary shares if:\n\n- \uf0b7 the aggregate dividends exceed the Company's after tax earnings (in calculating those after tax earnings, we take into account any payments we made on senior capital instruments) in the financial year to which they relate; or\n- \uf0b7 the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio falls within capital range buffers specified by APRA.\n\nIf the Company fails to pay a dividend or distribution on its ANZ Capital Notes or ANZ Capital Securities on the scheduled payment date, it may (subject to a number of exceptions) be restricted from resolving to pay or paying any dividend on the ANZ ordinary shares.\n\nIn response to the uncertain impacts of COVID-19, in July 2020 APRA provided guidance on capital management, including its expectations in relation to limits on the amount of dividends to be paid out of that year's earnings. The Company's 2020 interim dividend of 25 cents per share (paid to shareholders on 30 September 2020) and 2020 final dividend of 35 cents per share (paid to shareholders on 16 December 2020) took into account this guidance.\n\nFollowing an improvement in the economic outlook and stability in financial markets, APRA updated their guidance in December 2020, whereby from the 2021 calendar year, APRA will no longer hold ADIs to a minimum level of earnings retention but emphasised the requirement for ADIs to maintain vigilance and careful planning in capital management, including conducting regular stress testing and assurance on the capacity to continue to lend. APRA also stated that the onus will be on Boards to consider carefully the sustainable rate for dividends, taking into account the outlook for profitability, capital and economic environment.\n\n135\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE\n\nBasic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period (after eliminating ANZ shares held within the Group known as treasury shares).

SEGMENT REPORTING\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF SEGMENTS\n\nThe Group's five continuing operating segments are presented on a basis that is consistent with the information provided internally to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker. This reflects the way the Group's businesses are managed, rather than the legal structure of the Group.\n\nWe measure the performance of these segments on a cash profit basis. To calculate cash profit, we remove certain non-core items from statutory profit. Details of these items are included in the 'Other Items' section of this note. Transactions between business units across segments within ANZ are conducted on an arm's-length basis and disclosed as part of the income and expenses of these segments.\n\nThe reportable segments are divisions engaged in providing either different products or services or similar products and services in different geographical areas.

We deliver our services via our internet and app-based digital solutions and network of branches, mortgage specialists, relationship managers and contact centres.\n- \uf0b7 Business (previously Commercial) provides a full range of banking services including small business banking, through our digital, branch and contact centre channels, and traditional relationship banking and sophisticated financial solutions through dedicated managers. These cover privately owned small, medium and large enterprises, the agricultural business segment, government and government related entities.\n\n## Pacific\n\nThe Pacific division provides products and services to retail customers, small to medium-sized enterprises, institutional customers and governments located in the Pacific Islands. Products and services include retail products provided to consumers, traditional relationship banking and sophisticated financial solutions provided to business customers through dedicated managers.\n\n## Technology, Services & Operations (TSO) and Group Centre\n\nTSO and Group Centre division provides support to the operating divisions, including technology, group operations, shared services, property, risk management, financial management, strategy, marketing, human resources and corporate affairs. The Group Centre includes residual components of Group divestments, Group Treasury, Shareholder Functions and minority investments in Asia.\n\nRefer to Note 29 Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale for further details.\n\n## OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nThere have been no material structural changes during the year which have impacted the presentation of the Group's operating segments in 2021. As such, the presentation of the divisional results remains consistent with the prior period.\n\n137\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

Financial assets are classified into these measurement classifications on the basis of two criteria:\n\n- \uf0b7 the business model within which the financial asset is managed; and\n- \uf0b7 the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (specifically whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest).\n\nThe resultant financial asset classifications are as follows:\n\n- \uf0b7 Amortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows;\n- \uf0b7 FVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell the assets; and\n- \uf0b7 FVTPL: Any other financial assets not falling into the categories above are measured at FVTPL.\n\n## Fair value option for financial assets\n\nA financial asset may be irrevocably designated on initial recognition:\n\n- \uf0b7 at FVTPL when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise; or\n- \uf0b7 at FVOCI for investments in equity securities, where that instrument is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination.\n\n## 9.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\n\n## RISKS MANAGED\n\nThe Group offers and uses the instruments described above to manage fluctuations in the following market factors:\n\n| Foreign Exchange   | Currencies at current or determined rates of exchange.                                                                                                              |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest Rate      | Fixed or variable interest rates applying to money lent, deposited or borrowed.                                                                                     |\n| Commodity          | Soft commodities (that is, agricultural products such as wheat, coffee, cocoa and sugar) and hard commodities (that  is, mined products such as gold, oil and gas). |\n| Credit             | Risk of default by customers or third parties.                                                                                                                      |\n\nThe Group uses a number of central clearing counterparties and exchanges to settle derivative transactions. Different arrangements for posting of collateral exist with these exchanges:\n\n- \uf0b7 some transactions are subject to clearing arrangements which result in separate recognition of collateral assets and liabilities, with the carrying values of the associated derivative assets and liabilities held at their fair value.\n- \uf0b7 other transactions, are legally settled by the payment or receipt of collateral which reduces the carrying values of the related derivative instruments by the amount paid or received.\n\nIn August 2021, the Group amended the terms of its legal agreements with one of its central clearing counterparties giving effect to this form of legal settlement. As a result of this change, collateral paid and received by the Group under these agreements is no longer separately recognised, instead settling the Group's outstanding derivative exposures and reducing the associated carrying values of the derivative asset and liability balances. The impact of this change as at 30 September 2021 is a reduction in derivative assets of $55.1 billion, derivative liabilities of $55.2 billion, and a reduction in net collateral paid of $0.1 billion.\n\n144\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 11.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Recognition                              | Initially and at each reporting date, we recognise all derivatives at fair value. If the fair value of a  derivative is positive, then we carry it as an asset, but if its value is negative, then we carry it as a  liability.   Valuation adjustments are integral in determining the fair value of derivatives. This includes:                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Recognition                              | \uf0b7 a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) to reflect the counterparty risk and/or event of default; and  \uf0b7 a funding valuation adjustment (FVA) to account for funding costs and benefits in the derivatives  portfolio.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Derecognition of  assets and liabilities | We remove derivative assets from our balance sheet when the contracts expire or we have transferred  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. We remove derivative liabilities from our balance  sheet when the Group's contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.                                                                                                                                 |\n| Derecognition of  assets and liabilities | derivative is held for trading or is designated in a hedging relationship. For derivative financial  instruments held for trading, gains or losses from changes in the fair value are recognised in profit or  loss.   For an instrument designated in a hedging relationship, the recognition of gains or losses depends on  the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to the table on page 147 for profit or loss treatment for |\n| Derecognition of  assets and liabilities | Sources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from differences in the interest rate reference rate, margins,  or rate set differences and differences in discounting between the hedged items and the hedging  instruments. The hedging instruments are discounted using Overnight Index Swaps discount curves  which are not applied to the hedged items.                                                                            |\n| Hedge effectiveness                      | To qualify for hedge accounting, a hedge is expected to be highly effective.

By way of exception, bills of exchange (a form of security/transferable instrument) which are used to facilitate the Group's customer lending activities are classified as Loans and advances (rather than Investment securities) to better reflect the substance of the arrangement.\n\nNon-traded equity investments may be designated at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis. If this election is made, gains or losses are not reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss on disposal of the investment. However, gains or losses may be reclassified within equity.\n\nAssets disclosed as Investment securities are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at the commencement of the Group's financial asset disclosures on page 141. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with 'Investment securities - debt securities at amortised cost' and 'Investment securities - debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income' are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 14 Allowance for Expected Credit Losses. For 'Investment securities - debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income' the allowance for Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is recognised in the FVOCI reserve in equity with a corresponding charge to profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nJudgement is required when we select valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of assets not valued using quoted market prices, particularly the selection of valuation inputs that are not readily observable. Refer to Note 18 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details.\n\n157",

Subsequently, we then measure loans and advances at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, or at fair value when they are specifically designated on initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss or when held for trading.\n\nWe classify contracts to lease assets and hire purchase agreements as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the customer or an unrelated third party. We include these facilities in 'Other' in the table above.\n\nThe Group enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets that are recognised on its balance sheet. When the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets remain on the Group's balance sheet, however if substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred, the Group derecognises the asset. If the risks and rewards are partially retained and control over the asset is lost, the Group derecognises the asset. If control over the asset is not lost, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.\n\nWe separately recognise the rights and obligations retained, or created, in the transfer of assets and liabilities as appropriate.\n\nAssets disclosed as net loans and advances are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for financial assets outlined on page 141. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with loans and advances at amortised cost are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 14 Allowance for Expected Credit Losses.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 14.

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS MODEL\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and takes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nExpected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:\n\n- \uf0b7 Stage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since origination, an allowance equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, expected credit losses are estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity.\n- \uf0b7 Stage 2: Where there has been a SICR since origination, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a Stage 1 classification and a 12 month ECL applies.\n- \uf0b7 Stage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised.\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis when transferred to Stage 3.\n\n## MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS\n\nECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money:\n\n- \uf0b7 Probability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period;\n- \uf0b7 Exposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest; and\n- \uf0b7 Loss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD, taking into account direct and indirect recovery costs.\n\nThese credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward-looking information through the use of macro-economic variables.\n\n## EXPECTED LIFE\n\nWhen estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Group considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk.\n\nFor non-retail portfolios, the Group uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For non-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Group's contractual right to withdraw a facility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period.\n\nFor retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using a behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour and substantial modifications.\n\n## DEFINITION OF DEFAULT, CREDIT IMPAIRED AND WRITE-OFFS\n\nThe definition of default used in measuring expected credit losses is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due.\n\nFinancial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default.\n\nWhen there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the Group's internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written-off are credited to credit impairment charge in the income statement.\n\n163",

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## MODIFIED FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nIf the terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or commercial reasons, an assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered substantial. This assessment considers both changes in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall instrument risk profile; for example, changes in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is considered non-substantial, the existing financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine SICR. Where a modification is considered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at its fair value on the modification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK (SICR)\n\nStage 2 assets are those that have experienced a SICR since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative information:\n\n- i. Internal credit rating grade\n\nFor the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility since origination and is measured by application of thresholds.\n\nFor non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date to the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the probability of default of the borrower and incorporates both borrower and non-borrower specific information, including forward-looking information. CCRs are subject to review at least annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer.\n\nFor retail portfolios, a SICR is determined, depending on the type of facility, by either comparing the scenario weighted lifetime probability of default at the reporting date to that at origination, or by reference to customer behavioural score thresholds. The scenario weighted lifetime probability of default may increase significantly if:\n\n- \uf0b7 there has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or\n- \uf0b7 there has been a deterioration in the customer's overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations.\n- ii. Backstop criteria\n\nThe Group uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criterion for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only, facilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to being allocated back to Stage 1.\n\n- iii. COVID-19 initiatives\n\nFacilities previously subject to the COVID-19 repayment deferral arrangements have been subsumed into the normal loan portfolios and SICR applied accordingly.\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\n\nForward-looking information is incorporated into both our assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a SICR since its initial recognition and in our estimate of ECL. In applying forward-looking information for estimating ECL, the Group considers four probabilityweighted forecast economic scenarios as follows:\n\n- i. Base case scenario\n\nThe base case scenario is ANZ's view of future macro-economic conditions. It reflects management's assumptions used for strategic planning and budgeting, and also informs the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process the Group applies in strategic and capital planning over a 3-year time horizon;\n\n- ii. Upside and iii. Downside scenarios\n\nThe upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the economic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and pessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and\n\n- iv. Severe downside scenario\n\nThe severe downside scenario is fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions and accounts for the potentially severe impact of less likely extremely adverse economic conditions. It reflects macro-economic conditions of a downturn economic event with a probability of occurrence once every 25 years.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 14. ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT (continued)\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION (continued)\n\nThe four scenarios are described in terms of macro-economic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models) depending on the lending portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the variables include unemployment rates, GDP growth rates, house price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price indices.\n\nProbability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case economic scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required. The Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) is responsible for reviewing and approving the base case economic scenario and the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) approves the probability weights applied to each scenario.\n\nWhere applicable, temporary adjustments may be made to account for situations where known or expected risks have not been adequately addressed in the modelling process. CMRC is responsible for approving such adjustments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nIn estimating collectively assessed ECL, the Group makes judgements and assumptions in relation to:\n\n- \uf0b7 the selection of an estimation technique or modelling methodology; and\n- \uf0b7 the selection of inputs for those models, and the interdependencies between those inputs.\n\nThe following table summarises the key judgements and assumptions in relation to the model inputs and the interdependencies between those inputs, and highlights significant changes during the current period.\n\nThe judgements and associated assumptions have been made within the context of the impact of COVID-19, and reflect historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Group's ECL estimates are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Considerations for the year ended 30 September 2021\n\n| Judgement/Assumption                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Determining when a  Significant Increase in  Credit Risk (SICR) has  occurred | In the measurement of ECL, judgement is  involved in setting the rules and trigger points  to determine whether there has been a SICR  since initial recognition of a loan, which would  result in the financial asset moving from Stage 1  to Stage 2. This is a key area of judgement since  transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2 increases the  ECL from an allowance based on the probability  of default in the next 12 months, to an  allowance for lifetime expected credit losses.  Subsequent decreases in credit risk resulting in | The support packages offered to customers in response  to COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021 have ceased with the  majority of customers who took up the support  packages having reverted back to their normal loan  repayments. Given the recency of cessation of these  packages, the Group has provided a component of ECL  for expected delinquencies that may have been  obscured by the support measures. |\n\n164\n\n165",

Additionally, financial liabilities can be designated at FVTPL where:\n\n- \uf0b7 the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise;\n- \uf0b7 a group of financial liabilities are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management strategy; or\n- \uf0b7 the financial liability contains one or more embedded derivatives unless:\n- a) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract; or b) the embedded derivative is closely related to the host financial liability.\n\nWhere financial liabilities are designated as measured at fair value, gains or losses relating to changes in the entity's own credit risk are included in other comprehensive income, except where doing so would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.\n\n169",

Any remaining amount of fair value gain or loss we recognise directly in profit and loss. Once we have recognised an amount in other comprehensive income, we do not later reclassify it to profit and loss.\n\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements represent a liability to repurchase the financial assets that remain on our balance sheet since the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the Group. Over the life of the repurchase agreement, we recognise the difference between the sale price and the repurchase price and charge it to interest expense in the profit and loss.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 16. DEBT ISSUANCES\n\nThe Group uses a variety of funding programmes to issue senior debt (including covered bonds and securitisations) and subordinated debt. The difference between senior debt and subordinated debt is that holders of senior debt take priority over holders of subordinated debt owed by the relevant issuer. In the winding up of the relevant issuer, the subordinated debt will be repaid by the relevant issuer only after the repayment of claims of depositors, other creditors and the senior debt holders.\n\n|                                              | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                              | 2021  $m       | 2020  $m       | 2021  $m      | 2020  $m      |\n| Senior debt                                  | 58,952         | 80,835         | 45,348        | 64,591        |\n| Covered bonds                                | 15,399         | 15,948         | 11,342        | 11,761        |\n| Securitisation                               | 1,424          | 1,824          | -             | -             |\n| Total unsubordinated debt                    | 75,775         | 98,607         | 56,690        | 76,352        |\n| Subordinated debt                            |                |                |               |               |\n| - Additional Tier 1 capital                  | 8,506          | 8,196          | 8,191         | 7,833         |\n| - Tier 2 capital                             | 16,207         | 12,865         | 16,207        | 12,865        |\n| - Other subordinated debt securities         | 566            | -              | -             | -             |\n| Total subordinated debt                      | 25,279         | 21,061         | 24,398        | 20,698        |\n| Total debt issued                            | 101,054        | 119,668        | 81,088        | 97,050        |\n| Residual contractual maturity 1 :            |                |                |               |               |\n| Within one year                              | 22,621         | 25,688         | 18,512        | 20,937        |\n| More than one year                           | 76,594         | 92,059         | 60,605        | 74,122        |\n| No maturity date (instruments in perpetuity) | 1,839          | 1,921          | 1,971         | 1,991         |\n| Total debt issued                            | 101,054        | 119,668        | 81,088        | 97,050        |\n\n1.\n\n## TOTAL DEBT ISSUED BY CURRENCY\n\nThe table below shows the Group's issued debt by currency of issue, which broadly represents the debt holders' base location.\n\n|                   |                                                                         | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                   |                                                                         | 2021  $m       | 2020  $m       | 2021  $m      | 2020  $m      |\n| USD               | United States dollars                                                   | 29,788         | 41,100         | 22,354        | 31,836        |\n| EUR               | Euro                                                                    | 22,984         | 23,038         | 15,294        | 15,325        |\n| AUD               | Australian dollars                                                      | 35,709         | 43,697         | 34,299        | 41,857        |\n| NZD               | New Zealand dollars                                                     | 3,276          | 3,682          | 839           | 923           |\n| JPY               | Japanese yen                                                            | 1,854          | 2,131          | 1,853         | 2,131         |\n| CHF               | Swiss francs                                                            | 940            | 975            | -             | -             |\n| GBP               | Pounds sterling                                                         | 4,286          | 2,387          | 4,287         | 2,387         |\n| HKD               | Hong Kong dollars                                                       | 727            | 1,088          | 727           | 1,088         |\n| Other             | Chinese yuan, Norwegian kroner, Singapore dollars and Canadian  dollars | 1,490          | 1,570          | 1,435         | 1,503         |\n| Total debt issued | Total debt issued                                                       | 101,054        | 119,668        | 81,088        | 97,050        |\n\n## SUBORDINATED DEBT\n\nAt 30 September 2021, all subordinated debt issued by the Company and certain other subordinated debt issued by its subsidiary ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited (ANZ NZ) qualify as regulatory capital for the Group. They are classified as either Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital, in the case of the ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN), ANZ Capital Securities (ANZ CS) or ANZ NZ Capital Notes (ANZ NZ CN), or Tier 2 capital, in the case of perpetual or term subordinated notes, for APRA's capital adequacy purposes depending on the terms and conditions of the instruments.\n\nTier 2 capital instruments rank ahead of AT1 capital instruments, and AT1 capital instruments only rank ahead of ordinary shares, in any liquidation event impacting the issuer of the instruments.\n\n171",

DEBT ISSUANCES (continued)\n\n## AT1 CAPITAL\n\nAll outstanding AT1 capital instruments are Basel III fully compliant instruments (refer to Note 24 Capital Management for further information about Basel III). Each of the ANZ CN and ANZ CS rank equally with each other.\n\nDistributions on the AT1 capital instruments are non-cumulative and subject to the issuer's absolute discretion and certain payment conditions (including regulatory requirements). Distributions on ANZ CNs are franked in line with the franking applied to ANZ ordinary shares.\n\nWhere specified, the AT1 capital instruments provide the issuer with an early redemption or conversion option on a specified date and in certain other circumstances (such as a tax or regulatory event). This redemption option is subject to APRA's and, in respect of the ANZ NZ CN, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) prior written approval.\n\nEach of the AT1 capital instruments will immediately convert into a variable number of ANZ ordinary shares (based on the average market price of the shares immediately prior to conversion less a 1% discount, subject to a maximum conversion number of ANZ ordinary shares) if:\n\n- \uf0b7 ANZ's or, in the case of the ANZ NZ CN, ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited's (ANZ NZ) Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio is equal to or less than 5.125% - known as a Common Equity Capital Trigger Event; or\n- \uf0b7 APRA notifies the Company that, without the conversion or write-off of certain securities or a public sector injection of capital (or equivalent support), it considers that the Company would become non-viable or, in the case of the ANZ NZ CN, the RBNZ directs ANZ NZ to convert or writeoff the notes, or a statutory manager is appointed to ANZ NZ and decides that ANZ NZ must convert or write-off the notes - known as a NonViability Trigger Event.\n\nWhere specified, AT1 capital instruments mandatorily convert into a variable number of ANZ ordinary shares (based on the average market price of the shares immediately prior to conversion less a 1% discount):\n\n- \uf0b7 on a specified mandatory conversion date; or\n- \uf0b7 on an earlier date under certain circumstances as set out in the terms.\n\nHowever, the mandatory conversion is deferred for a specified period if certain conversion tests are not met.\n\nThe tables below show the key details of the Group's AT1 capital instruments on issue at 30 September in both the current and prior years:\n\n|                                                                 |                                                                 |                                                                 | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                 |                                                                 |                                                                 | 2021  $m       | 2020  $m       | 2021  $m      | 2020  $m      |\n| Additional Tier 1 capital (perpetual subordinated securities) 1 | Additional Tier 1 capital (perpetual subordinated securities) 1 | Additional Tier 1 capital (perpetual subordinated securities) 1 |                |                |               |               |\n| ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN)                                      | ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN)                                      | ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN)                                      |                |                |               |               |\n| AUD                                                             | 1,120m                                                          | ANZ CN1 2                                                       | -              | 1,119          | -             | 1,119         |\n| AUD                                                             | 1,610m                                                          | ANZ CN2                                                         | 1,609          | 1,608          | 1,609         | 1,608         |\n| AUD                                                             | 970m                                                            | ANZ CN3                                                         | 968            | 967            | 998           | 997           |\n| AUD                                                             | 1,622m                                                          | ANZ CN4                                                         | 1,617          | 1,614          | 1,617         | 1,614         |\n| AUD                                                             | 931m                                                            | ANZ CN5                                                         | 927            | 926            | 927           | 926           |\n| AUD                                                             | 1,500m                                                          | ANZ CN6                                                         | 1,486          | -              | 1,486         | -             |\n| ANZ Capital Securities (ANZ CS)                                 | ANZ Capital Securities (ANZ CS)                                 | ANZ Capital Securities (ANZ CS)                                 |                |                |               |               |\n| USD                                                             | 1,000m                                                          | ANZ Capital Securities                                          | 1,422          | 1,499          | 1,554         | 1,569         |\n| ANZ NZ Capital Notes (ANZ NZ CN)                                | ANZ NZ Capital Notes (ANZ NZ CN)                                | ANZ NZ Capital Notes (ANZ NZ CN)                                |                |                |               |               |\n| NZD                                                             | 500m                                                            | ANZ NZ Capital Notes                                            | 477            | 463            | -             | -             |\n| Total Additional Tier 1 capital 3                               | Total Additional Tier 1 capital 3                               | Total Additional Tier 1 capital 3                               | 8,506          | 8,196          | 8,191         | 7,833         |\n\n- 1.

In March 2021, the RBNZ announced that it would remove these restrictions on the redemption of non-CET1 capital instruments. However, as the restriction was in place in May 2020, ANZ NZ was not able to redeem its ANZ NZ CNs and decided not to exercise its option to convert at the optional exchange date in May 2020. As ANZ NZ did not exercise its option to convert in May 2020, the terms of the ANZ NZ CNs provide for their conversion into a variable number of shares of the Company in May 2022 subject to certain conditions.\n\nThe RBNZ has released new capital adequacy requirements for New Zealand banks, which are being implemented from October 2021 to July 2028. Under these changes, from 1 January 2022, the ANZ NZ CNs are subject to a reduction in their regulatory capital recognition, and as a result, ANZ NZ has determined that a Regulatory Event (as defined in the ANZ NZ CN Deed Poll) has occurred in respect of these notes. The occurrence of a Regulatory Event means that ANZ NZ may choose to redeem the ANZ NZ CNs at its discretion. A redemption of the ANZ NZ CNs is subject to certain conditions, including approval from the RBNZ and APRA. At the date of this financial report, no decision had been made on whether ANZ NZ will redeem the ANZ NZ CNs (subject to regulatory approvals).\n\n174\n\n## 16. DEBT ISSUANCES (continued)\n\n## TIER 2 CAPITAL\n\nConvertible term subordinated notes issued by the Company are Basel III fully compliant instruments. If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, each of the convertible term subordinated notes will immediately convert into ANZ ordinary shares (based on the average market price of the shares immediately prior to conversion less a 1% discount, subject to a maximum conversion number).\n\nAPRA has granted transitional Basel III capital treatment for the USD 300 million perpetual subordinated notes until the end of the transitional period (December 2021). These subordinated notes do not contain a Non-Viability Trigger Event.\n\nThe table below shows the Tier 2 capital subordinated notes the Group holds at 30 September in both the current and prior year:\n\n|                                                                 |                                                                 |                                                                 |                                                                 |                | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Currency                                                        | Face value                                                      | Maturity                                                        | Next optional call date -

DEBT ISSUANCES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nDebt issuances are measured at amortised cost, except where designated at fair value through profit or loss. Where the Group enters into a fair value hedge accounting relationship, the fair value attributable to the hedge risk is reflected in adjustments to the carrying value of the debt. Interest expense is recognised using the effective interest rate method.\n\nSubordinated debt with capital-based conversion features (i.e. Common Equity Capital Trigger Events or Non-Viability Trigger Events) are considered to contain embedded derivatives that we account for separately at fair value through profit and loss. The embedded derivatives arise because the amount of shares issued on conversion following any of those trigger events is subject to the maximum conversion number, however they have no significant value as of the reporting date given the remote nature of those trigger events.\n\n176\n\n## 17. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK AND MODEL\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nThe use of financial instruments is fundamental to the Group's businesses of providing banking and other financial services to our customers. The associated financial risks (primarily credit, market, and liquidity risks) are a significant portion of the Group's key material risks.\n\nWe disclose details of all key material risks impacting the Group, and further information on the Group's risk management activities, in the Governance and Risk Management sections of this Annual Report.\n\nThis note details the Group's financial risk management policies, processes and quantitative disclosures in relation to the key financial risks.\n\n## Key material financial risks\n\n## Key sections applicable to this risk\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe risk of financial loss resulting from:\n\n- \uf0b7 a counterparty failing to fulfil its obligations; or\n- \uf0b7 a decrease in credit quality of a counterparty resulting in a financial loss.\n\nCredit risk incorporates the risks associated with us lending to customers who could be impacted by climate change or by changes to laws, regulations, or other policies adopted by governments or regulatory authorities, including carbon pricing and climate change adaptation or mitigation policies.\n\n## Market risk\n\nThe risk to the Group's earnings arising from:\n\n- \uf0b7 changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, volatility and correlations; or\n- \uf0b7 fluctuations in bond, commodity or equity prices.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nThe risk that the Group is unable to meet payment obligations as they fall due, including:\n\n- \uf0b7 repaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt; or\n- \uf0b7 the Group having insufficient capacity to fund increases in assets.\n- \uf0b7 Credit risk overview, management and control responsibilities\n- \uf0b7 Maximum exposure to credit risk\n- \uf0b7 Credit quality\n- \uf0b7 Concentrations of credit risk\n- \uf0b7 Collateral management\n- \uf0b7 Market risk overview, management and control responsibilities\n- \uf0b7 Measurement of market risk\n- \uf0b7 Traded and non-traded market risk\n- \uf0b7 Equity securities designated at FVOCI\n- \uf0b7 Foreign currency risk - structural exposure\n- \uf0b7 Liquidity risk overview, management and control responsibilities\n- \uf0b7 Key areas of measurement for liquidity risk\n- \uf0b7 Liquidity risk outcomes\n- \uf0b7 Residual contractual maturity analysis of the Group's liabilities\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n177",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\n## AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\nThis overview is provided to aid the users of the financial statements in understanding the context of the financial disclosures required under AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (AASB 7). It should be read in conjunction with the Governance and Risk Management sections of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group's Risk Management Framework (RMF). The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group's risk management policies. The BRC reports regularly to the Board on its activities.\n\nThe Board approves the strategic objectives of the Group including:\n\n- \uf0b7 the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board's expectations regarding the degree of risk that ANZ is prepared to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plan; and\n- \uf0b7 the Risk Management Strategy (RMS), which describes ANZ's strategy for managing risks and the key elements of the RMF that give effect to this strategy. This includes a description of each material risk, and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how ANZ identifies, measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and controls or mitigates material risks.\n\nThe Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and robust control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. At ANZ, risk is everyone's responsibility.\n\nThe Group has an independent risk management function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer who:\n\n- \uf0b7 is responsible for overseeing the risk profile and the risk management framework;\n- \uf0b7 can effectively challenge activities and decisions that materially affect ANZ's risk profile; and\n- \uf0b7 has an independent reporting line to the BRC to enable the appropriate escalation of issues of concern.\n\nThe Internal Audit Function reports directly to the Board Audit Committee (BAC). Internal Audit provides:\n\n- \uf0b7 an independent evaluation of the Group's RMF annually that seeks to ensure compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the risk management framework;\n- \uf0b7 facilitation of a comprehensive review every three years that seeks to ensure the appropriateness, effectiveness and adequacy of the risk management framework; and\n- \uf0b7 recommendations to improve the framework and/or work practices to strengthen the effectiveness of day to day operations.\n\n178\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 17. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## CREDIT RISK\n\n## CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nGranting credit facilities to customers is one of the Group's major sources of income. As this activity is also a principal risk, the Group dedicates considerable resources to its management. The Group assumes credit risk in a wide range of lending and other activities in diverse markets and in many jurisdictions. Credit risks arise from traditional lending to customers as well as from interbank, treasury, trade finance and capital markets activities around the world.\n\nOur credit risk management framework ensures we apply a consistent approach across the Group when we measure, monitor and manage the credit risk appetite set by the Board. The Board is assisted and advised by the BRC in discharging its duty to oversee credit risk. The BRC:\n\n- \uf0b7 sets the credit risk appetite and credit strategies; and\n- \uf0b7 approves credit transactions beyond the discretion of executive management.\n\nWe quantify credit risk through an internal credit rating system (masterscales) to ensure consistency across exposure types and to provide a consistent framework for reporting and analysis. The system uses models and other tools to measure the following for customer exposures:\n\n| Probability of Default (PD)   | Expressed by a Customer Credit Rating (CCR), reflecting the Group's assessment of a customer's ability  to service and repay debt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Exposure at Default (EAD)     | The expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and  interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest at the time of default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Loss Given Default (LGD)      | Expressed by a Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G. The SI is calculated by reference to the  percentage of loan covered by security which the Group can realise if a customer defaults. The A-G  scale is supplemented by a range of other SIs which cover factors such as cash cover and sovereign  backing. For retail and some small business lending, we group exposures into large homogenous pools |\n\nOur specialist credit risk teams develop and validate the Group's PD and LGD rating models. The outputs from these models drive our day-to-day credit risk management decisions including origination, pricing, approval levels, regulatory capital adequacy, economic capital allocation, and credit provisioning.\n\nAll customers with whom ANZ has a credit relationship are assigned a CCR at origination via either of the following assessment approaches:\n\n| Large and more complex lending                                     | Retail and some small business lending                                  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rating models provide a consistent and structured assessment, with | Automated assessment of credit applications using a combination of      |\n| judgement required around the use of out-of-model factors. We      | scoring (application and behavioural), policy rules and external credit |\n| handle credit approval on a dual approval basis, jointly with the  | reporting information. If the application does not meet the automated   |\n| business writer and an independent credit officer.                 | assessment criteria, then it is subject to manual assessment.           |\n\nWe use the Group's internal CCRs to manage the credit quality of financial assets. To enable wider comparisons, the Group's CCRs are mapped to external rating agency scales as follows:\n\n| Credit Quality  Description   | Internal CCR   | ANZ Customer Requirements                                                                                                                                                                  | Moody's  Rating   | Standard & Poor's  Rating   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Strong                        | CCR 0+ to 4-   | Demonstrated superior stability in their operating and financial  performance over the long-term, and whose earnings capacity  is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.      | Aaa - Baa3        | AAA - BBB-                  |\n| Satisfactory                  | CCR 5+ to 6-   | Demonstrated sound operational and financial stability over  the medium to long-term, even though some may be  susceptible to cyclical trends or variability in earnings.                  | Ba1 - B1          | BB+ - B+                    |\n| Weak                          | CCR 7+ to 8=   | Demonstrated some operational and financial instability, with  variability and uncertainty in profitability and liquidity  projected to continue over the short and possibly medium  term. | B2 - Caa          | B - CCC                     |\n| Defaulted                     | CCR 8- to 10   | When doubt arises as to the collectability of a credit facility, the  financial instrument (or 'the facility') is classified as defaulted.                                                 | N/A               | N/A                         |\n\n179",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## CREDIT RISK (continued)\n\n## MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK\n\nFor financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount. In certain circumstances there may be differences between the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet and the amounts reported in the tables below. Principally, these differences arise in respect of financial assets that are subject to risks other than credit risk, such as equity instruments which are primarily subject to market risk, or bank notes and coins.\n\nFor undrawn facilities, this maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the committed facilities. For contingent exposures, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is called upon.\n\nThe table below shows our maximum exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions before taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements.\n\n|                                     | Reported   | Reported   | Excluded 1   | Excluded 1   | Maximum exposure  to credit risk   | Maximum exposure  to credit risk   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Consolidated                        | 2021  $m   | 2020  $m   | 2021  $m     | 2020  $m     | 2021  $m                           | 2020  $m                           |\n| On-balance sheet positions          |            |            |              |              |                                    |                                    |\n| Net loans and advances              | 629,719    | 617,093    | -            | -            | 629,719                            | 617,093                            |\n| Other financial assets:             |            |            |              |              |                                    |                                    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents           | 151,260    | 107,923    | 1,127        | 1,514        | 150,133                            | 106,409                            |\n| Settlement balances owed to ANZ     | 7,530      | 7,541      | 7,530        | 7,541        | -                                  | -                                  |\n| Collateral paid                     | 9,166      | 14,308     | -            | -            | 9,166                              | 14,308                             |\n| Trading securities                  | 44,688     | 50,913     | 4,996        | 5,698        | 39,692                             | 45,215                             |\n| Derivative financial instruments    | 38,736     | 135,331    | -            | -            | 38,736                             | 135,331                            |\n| Investment securities               |            |            |              |              |                                    |                                    |\n| - debt securities at amortised cost | 7,031      | 6,816      | -            | -            | 7,031                              | 6,816                              |\n| - debt securities at FVOCI          | 74,743     | 85,460     | -            | -            | 74,743                             | 85,460                             |\n| - equity securities at FVOCI        | 1,310      | 1,062      | 1,310        | 1,062        | -                                  | -                                  |\n| - debt securities at FVTPL          | 42         | 53         | -            | -            | 42                                 | 53                                 |\n| Regulatory deposits                 | 671        | 801        | -            | -            | 671                                | 801                                |\n| Other financial assets 2            | 2,054      | 2,407      | -            | -            | 2,054                              | 2,407                              |\n| Total other financial assets        | 337,231    | 412,615    | 14,963       | 15,815       | 322,268                            | 396,800                            |\n| Subtotal                            | 966,950    | 1,029,708  | 14,963       | 15,815       | 951,987                            | 1,013,893                          |\n| Off-balance sheet positions         |            |            |              |              |                                    |                                    |\n| Undrawn and contingent facilities 3 | 259,789    | 266,716    | -            | -            | 259,789                            | 266,716                            |\n| Total                               | 1,226,739  | 1,296,424  | 14,963       | 15,815       | 1,211,776                          | 1,280,609                          |\n\n- 1.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## CREDIT RISK (continued)\n\n## CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\n\nCredit risk becomes concentrated when a number of customers are engaged in similar activities, have similar economic characteristics, or have similar activities within the same geographic region - therefore, they may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The Group monitors its credit portfolio to manage risk concentration and rebalance the portfolio. The Group also applies single customer counterparty limits to protect against unacceptably large exposures to one single customer.\n\nComposition of financial instruments that give rise to credit risk by industry group are presented below:\n\n|                                                               | Loans  and advances   | Loans  and advances   | Other financial  assets   | Other financial

MANAGEMENT\n\nWe use collateral for on and off-balance sheet exposures to mitigate credit risk if a counterparty cannot meet its repayment obligations. Where there is sufficient collateral, an expected credit loss is not recognised. This is largely the case for certain lending products that are secured by corresponding investment for which the margin loans are utilised and for reverse repurchase agreements. For some products, the collateral provided by customers is fundamental to the product's structuring, so it is not strictly the secondary source of repayment - for example, lending secured by trade receivables is typically repaid by the collection of those receivables. During the period there was no change in our collateral policies.\n\n190\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 17.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## MARKET RISK\n\n## MARKET RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nMarket risk stems from the Group's trading and balance sheet management activities and the impact of changes and correlations between interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and volatility in bond, commodity or equity prices.\n\nThe BRC delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of both market risks and compliance with market risk policies to the Credit & Market Risk Committee (CMRC) and the Group Asset & Liability Committee (GALCO).\n\nWithin overall strategies and policies established by the BRC, business units and risk management have joint responsibility for the control of market risk at the Group level. The Market Risk team (a specialist risk management unit independent of the business) allocates market risk limits at various levels and monitors and reports on them daily. This detailed framework allocates individual limits to manage and control exposures using risk factors and profit and loss limits.\n\nManagement, measurement and reporting of market risk is undertaken in two broad categories:\n\n## Traded Market Risk\n\n## Non-Traded Market Risk\n\nRisk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative trading positions. Principal risk categories monitored are:\n\n- 1. Currency risk - potential loss arising from changes in foreign exchange rates or their implied volatilities.\n- 2. Interest rate risk - potential loss from changes in market interest rates or their implied volatilities.\n- 3. Credit spread risk - potential loss arising from a movement in margin or spread relative to a benchmark.\n- 4. Commodity risk - potential loss arising from changes in commodity prices or their implied volatilities.\n- 5. Equity risk - potential loss arising from changes in equity prices.\n\n## MEASUREMENT OF MARKET RISK\n\nWe primarily manage and control market risk using Value at Risk (VaR), sensitivity analysis and stress testing.\n\nVaR measures the Group's possible daily loss based on historical market movements.\n\nThe Group's VaR approach for both traded and non-traded risk is historical simulation. We use historical changes in market rates, prices and volatilities over:\n\n- \uf0b7 the previous 500 business days, to calculate standard VaR; and\n- \uf0b7 a 1-year stressed period, to calculate stressed VaR.\n\nWe calculate traded and non-traded VaR using one-day and ten-day holding periods. For stressed VaR, we use a ten-day period. Back testing is used to ensure our VaR models remain accurate.\n\nANZ measures VaR at a 99% confidence interval which means there is a 99% chance that a loss will not exceed the VaR for the relevant holding period.\n\n192\n\nRisk of loss associated with the management of non-traded interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange exposures. This includes interest rate risk in the banking book. This risk of loss arises from adverse changes in the overall and relative level of interest rates for different tenors, differences in the actual versus expected net interest margin, and the potential valuation risk associated with embedded options in financial instruments and bank products.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 17.

The diversification benefit reflects risks that offset across categories. The high and low VaR figures reported for each factor did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported for the Group as a whole. Consequently, a diversification benefit for high and low would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the table.\n\n193",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## MARKET RISK (continued)\n\n## Non-traded market risk\n\n## Balance sheet risk management\n\nThe principal objectives of balance sheet risk management are to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to mitigate the negative impact of movements in interest rates on the earnings and market value of the Group's banking book, while ensuring the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due.\n\n## Interest rate risk management\n\nNon-traded interest rate risk relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on the Group's future net interest income. This risk arises from two principal sources, namely mismatches between the repricing dates of interest bearing assets and liabilities; and the investment of capital and other non-interest bearing liabilities and assets. Interest rate risk is reported using VaR and scenario analysis (based on the impact of a 1% rate shock). The table below shows VaR figures for non-traded interest rate risk for the combined Group as well as Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific, Europe and Americas (APEA) geographies which are calculated separately.\n\n|                                         | 2021      | 2021               | 2021              | 2021                  | 2020      | 2020               | 2020              | 2020                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| Consolidated                            | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m |\n| Non-traded value at risk 99% confidence |           |                    |                   |                       |           |                    |                   |                       |\n| Australia                               | 67.0      | 81.8               | 61.9              | 69.8                  | 60.8      | 60.8               | 18.8              | 33.4                  |\n| New Zealand                             | 21.6      | 32.8               | 21.6              | 26.7                  | 26.3      | 26.3               | 9.4               | 15.2                  |\n| Asia Pacific, Europe & America          | 31.5      | 34.9               | 29.0              | 32.0                  | 29.4      | 30.2               | 17.8              | 24.2                  |\n| Diversification benefit 1               | (32.9)    | n/a                | n/a               | (53.7)                | (61.4)    | n/a                | n/a               | (29.5)                |\n| Total VaR                               | 87.2      | 87.2               | 59.3              | 74.8                  | 55.1      | 58.3               | 31.5              | 43.3                  |\n\n|                                         | 2021      | 2021               | 2021              | 2021                  | 2020      | 2020               | 2020              | 2020                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| The Company                             | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m |\n| Non-traded value at risk 99% confidence |           |                    |                   |                       |           |                    |                   |                       |\n| Australia                               | 67.0      | 81.8               | 61.9              | 69.8                  | 60.8      | 60.8               | 18.8              | 33.4                  |\n| New Zealand                             | 0.0       | 0.0                | 0.0               | 0.0                   | 0.0       | 0.1                | 0.0               | 0.0                   |\n| Asia Pacific, Europe & America          | 30.8      | 35.2               | 27.5              | 31.2                  | 28.5      | 30.9               | 17.7              | 24.1                  |\n| Diversification benefit 1               | (31.9)    | n/a                | n/a               | (36.2)                | (43.3)    | n/a                | n/a               | (21.4)                |\n| Total VaR                               | 65.9      | 69.9               | 55.0              | 64.8                  | 46.0      | 47.6               | 25.5              | 36.1                  |\n\n194\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 17. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## MARKET RISK (continued)\n\nWe undertake scenario analysis to stress test the impact of extreme events on the Group's market risk exposures. We model a 1% overnight parallel positive shift in the yield curve to determine the potential impact on our net interest income over the next 12 months. This is a standard risk measure which assumes the parallel shift is reflected in all wholesale and customer rates.\n\nThe table below shows the outcome of this risk measure for the current and previous financial years, expressed as a percentage of reported net interest income.\n\n|                                      | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                      | 2021           | 2020           | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Impact of 1% rate shock              |                |                |               |               |\n| As at period end                     | 2.43%          | 1.25%          | 2.02%         | 0.78%         |\n| Maximum exposure                     | 2.43%          | 1.61%          | 2.02%         | 1.78%         |\n| Minimum exposure                     | 0.98%          | 0.52%          | 0.54%         | 0.06%         |\n| Average exposure (in absolute terms) | 1.55%          | 1.01%          | 1.08%         | 0.78%         |\n\n## EQUITY SECURITIES DESIGNATED AT FVOCI\n\nOur investment securities contain equity investment holdings which predominantly comprise investments we hold for longer-term strategic reasons. The market risk impact on these equity investments is not captured by the Group's VaR processes for traded and non-traded market risks. Therefore, the Group regularly reviews the valuations of the investments within the portfolio and assesses whether the investments are appropriately measured based on the recognition and measurement policies set out in Note 12 Investment Securities.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK - STRUCTURAL EXPOSURES\n\nOur investment of capital in foreign operations - for example, branches, subsidiaries or associates with functional currencies other than the Australian Dollar - exposes the Group to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates. Variations in the value of these foreign operations arising as a result of exchange differences are reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.\n\nWhere it is considered appropriate, the Group takes out economic hedges against larger foreign exchange denominated revenue streams (primarily New Zealand Dollar, US Dollar and US Dollar correlated). The primary objective of hedging is to ensure that, if practical, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the consolidated capital ratios are minimised.\n\n195",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group is either:\n\n- \uf0b7 unable to meet its payment obligations (including repaying depositors or maturing wholesale debt) when they fall due; or\n- \uf0b7 does not have the appropriate amount, tenor and composition of funding and liquidity to fund increases in its assets.\n\nManagement of liquidity and funding risks are overseen by GALCO. The Group's liquidity and funding risks are governed by a set of principles approved by the BRC and include:\n\n- \uf0b7 maintaining the ability to meet all payment obligations in the immediate term;\n- \uf0b7 ensuring that the Group has the ability to meet 'survival horizons' under a range of ANZ specific, and general market, liquidity stress scenarios, at the site and Group-wide level, to meet cash flow obligations over the short to medium term;\n- \uf0b7 maintaining strength in the Group's balance sheet structure to ensure long term resilience in the liquidity and funding risk profile;\n- \uf0b7 ensuring the liquidity management framework is compatible with local regulatory requirements;\n- \uf0b7 preparing daily liquidity reports and scenario analysis to quantify the Group's positions;\n- \uf0b7 targeting a diversified funding base to avoid undue concentrations by investor type, maturity, market source and currency;\n- \uf0b7 holding a portfolio of high quality liquid assets to protect against adverse funding conditions and to support day-to-day operations; and\n- \uf0b7 establishing detailed contingency plans to cover different liquidity crisis events.\n\n## KEY AREAS OF MEASUREMENT FOR LIQUIDITY RISK\n\n## Scenario modelling of funding sources\n\nANZ's liquidity risk appetite is defined by a range of regulatory and internal liquidity metrics mandated by the Board. The metrics cover a range of scenarios of varying duration and level of severity.\n\nA key component of this framework is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is a severe short term liquidity stress scenario mandated by banking regulators including APRA. As part of meeting LCR requirements, the Group has a Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The CLF was established to offset the shortage of available High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in Australia and provides an alternative form of contingent liquidity. The CLF is collateralised by assets, including internal residential mortgage backed securities, that are eligible to be pledged as security with the RBA. The total amount of the CLF available to a qualifying Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) is set annually by APRA. The total amount of the CLF available to a qualifying Australian Deposit-taking Institution is set annually by APRA. In September 2021, APRA wrote to ADI's to advise that APRA and the RBA consider there to be sufficient HQLA for ADI's to meet their LCR requirements, and therefore the use of the CLF should no longer be required beyond 2022.\n\nFrom 1 January 2021, ANZ's CLF is $10.7 billion (2020 calendar year end: $35.7 billion). Consistent with APRA's requirement, ANZ's CLF will decrease to zero through equal reductions on 1 January, 30 April, 31 August and 31 December 2022. This reduction will be managed as part of ANZ's funding plans over this period.\n\n## Liquid assets\n\nThe Group holds a portfolio of high quality (unencumbered) liquid assets to protect the Group's liquidity position in a severely stressed environment and to meet regulatory requirements. HQLA comprise three categories consistent with Basel III LCR requirements:\n\n- \uf0b7 HQLA1- Cash and highest credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\n- \uf0b7 HQLA2 - High credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities, high quality corporate debt securities and high quality covered bonds eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\n- \uf0b7 Alternative liquid assets (ALA) - Assets qualifying as collateral for the CLF and eligible securities that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will accept in its domestic market operations.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK OUTCOMES 1\n\n## Liquidity Coverage Ratio\n\nANZ's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) averaged 136% for 2021, a decrease from the 2020 average of 139%, and above the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio\n\nANZ's Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as at 30 September 2021 was 124% (2020: 124%), above the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\n- 1. This information is not within the scope of the external audit of the Group Financial Report by the Group's external auditor, KPMG. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding Ratio are non-IFRS disclosures and are disclosed as part of the Group's APS 330 Public Disclosure which is subject to specific review procedures in accordance with the Australian Standard on Related Services (ASRS) 4400 Agreed upon Procedures Engagements to Report Factual Findings.\n\n196\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 17. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK (continued)\n\n## Liquidity crisis contingency planning\n\nThe Group maintains APRA-endorsed liquidity crisis contingency plans for analysing and responding to a liquidity threatening event at a country and Group-wide level. Key liquidity contingency crisis planning requirements and guidelines include:\n\n| Ongoing business management                    | Early signs/ mild stress                                     | Severe stress                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \uf0b7 establish crisis/severity levels             | \uf0b7 monitoring and review                                      | \uf0b7 activate contingency funding plans                             |\n| \uf0b7 liquidity limits  \uf0b7 early warning indicators | \uf0b7 management actions not requiring  business rationalisation | \uf0b7 management actions for altering asset and liability  behaviour |\n\nAssigned responsibility for internal and external communications and the appropriate timing to communicate\n\nSince the precise nature of any stress event cannot be known in advance, we design the plans to be flexible to the nature and severity of the stress event with multiple variables able to be accommodated in any plan.\n\n## Group funding\n\nThe Group monitors the composition and stability of its funding so that it remains within the Group's funding risk appetite. This approach ensures that an appropriate proportion of the Group's assets are funded by stable funding sources, including customer deposits; longer-dated wholesale funding (with a remaining term exceeding one year); and equity.\n\nFunding plans prepared\n\n## Considerations in preparing funding plans\n\n- \uf0b7 3 year strategic plan prepared annually\n- \uf0b7 annual funding plan as part of budgeting process\n- \uf0b7 forecasting in light of actual results as a calibration to the annual plan\n- \uf0b7 customer balance sheet growth\n- \uf0b7 changes in wholesale funding including: targeted funding volumes; markets; investors; tenors; and currencies for senior, secured, subordinated, hybrid transactions and market conditions\n\n## RBA Term Funding Facility\n\nAs an additional source of funding, in March 2020, the RBA announced a term funding facility (TFF) for the banking system to support lending to Australian businesses. The TFF is a three-year secured funding facility to ADIs at a fixed rate of 0.25%. APRA has determined that the TFF qualifies for inclusion in determining the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). ADIs can obtain initial funding of up to 3% of their existing credit outstanding to Australian households and businesses, and have access to additional funding if they increase lending to business, especially to small and medium-sized businesses. The TFF closed to drawdowns on 30 June 2021.\n\nAs at 30 September 2021, ANZ had drawn $20.1 billion under the RBA's TFF.\n\n## RBNZ Funding for Lending Programme and Term Lending Facility\n\n- \uf0b7 Between May 2020 and July 2021, the RBNZ made funds available under a term lending facility (TLF) to promote lending to businesses. The TLF is a three to five-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a fixed rate of 0.25%.\n- \uf0b7 In November 2020, the RBNZ announced a funding for lending programme (FLP) which aimed to lower the cost of borrowing for New Zealand businesses and households. The FLP is a three-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a floating rate of the New Zealand Official Cash Rate (OCR). New Zealand banks can obtain initial funding of up to 4% of their lending to New Zealand resident households, non-financial businesses and non-profit institutions serving households as at 31 October 2020 (eligible loans). An additional allocation of up to 2% of eligible loans is available, subject to certain conditions. The additional allocation is available until 6 December 2022, and the initial allocation is available until 6 June 2022.\n\nAs at 30 September 2021, ANZ NZ had drawn $0.3 billion under the TLF and $0.9 billion under the FLP.\n\n197",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK (continued)\n\n## RESIDUAL CONTRACTUAL MATURITY ANALYSIS OF GROUP'S LIABILITIES\n\nThe tables below provide residual contractual maturity analysis of financial liabilities, including financial liabilities reclassified to held for sale, at 30 September within relevant maturity groupings. All outstanding debt issuance and subordinated debt is profiled on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay. All at-call liabilities are reported in the 'Less than 3 months' category. Any other items without a specified maturity date are included in the 'After 5 years' category. The amounts represent principal and interest cash flows - so they may differ from equivalent amounts reported on balance sheet. For the purpose of this note, liabilities presented as liabilities held for sale in the Balance Sheet have been reallocated to their respective Balance Sheet categories.\n\nIt should be noted that this is not how the Group manages its liquidity risk. The management of this risk is detailed on page 196.\n\n| Consolidated                                                                 | Less than   3 months  $m   | 3 to 12  months  $m   | 1 to 5   years  $m   | After   5 years  $m   | Total  $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|\n| As at 30 September 2021                                                      |                            |                       |                      |                       |             |\n| Settlement balances owed by ANZ                                              | 17,427                     | -

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nThe Group carries a significant number of financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. The fair value is the best estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\n## VALUATION\n\nThe Group has an established control framework, including appropriate segregation of duties, to ensure that fair values are accurately determined, reported and controlled. The framework includes the following features:\n\n- \uf0b7 products are approved for transacting with external customers and counterparties only where fair values can be appropriately determined;\n- \uf0b7 quoted market prices used to value financial instruments are independently verified with information from external pricing providers;\n- \uf0b7 fair value methodologies and inputs are evaluated and approved by a function independent of the party that undertakes the transaction;\n- \uf0b7 movements in fair values are independently monitored and explained by reference to underlying factors relevant to the fair value; and\n- \uf0b7 valuation adjustments (such as funding valuation adjustments, credit valuation adjustments and bid-offer adjustments) are independently validated and monitored.\n\nIf the Group holds offsetting risk positions, then the Group uses the portfolio exception in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (AASB 13) to measure the fair value of such groups of financial assets and financial liabilities. We measure the portfolio based on the price that would be received to sell a net long position (an asset) for a particular risk exposure, or to transfer a net short position (a liability) for a particular risk exposure.\n\n## Fair value designation\n\nWe designate certain loans and advances and certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss:\n\n- \uf0b7 where they contain a separable embedded derivative which significantly modifies the instruments' cash flow; or\n- \uf0b7 in order to eliminate an accounting mismatch which would arise if the asset or liabilities were otherwise carried at amortised cost. This mismatch arises due to measuring the derivative financial instruments (which we acquired to mitigate interest rate risk of these assets or liabilities) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nOur approach ensures that we recognise the fair value movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on the associated derivatives.\n\nWe may also designate certain loans and advances, certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis to align the measurement with how the instruments are managed.\n\n## FAIR VALUE APPROACH AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES\n\nWe use valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities for recognition, measurement and disclosure purposes where no quoted price in an active market exists for that asset or liability.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY\n\nThe Group categorises assets and liabilities carried at fair value into a fair value hierarchy as required by AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement based on the observability of inputs used to measure the fair value:\n\n- \uf0b7 Level 1 - valuations based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n- \uf0b7 Level 2 - valuations using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for a similar asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\n- \uf0b7 Level 3 - valuations where significant unobservable inputs are used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability.\n\nThe following table presents assets and liabilities carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value hierarchy:\n\n|                                           | Fair value measurements                     | Fair value measurements                     | Fair value measurements            | Fair value measurements            | Fair value measurements              | Fair value measurements              | Fair value measurements   | Fair value measurements   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                           | Quoted price in  active markets   (Level 1) | Quoted price in  active markets   (Level 1) | Using observable  inputs (Level 2) | Using observable  inputs (Level 2) | Using unobservable  inputs (Level 3) | Using unobservable  inputs (Level 3) | Total                     | Total                     |\n|                                           | 2021                                        | 2020                                        | 2021                               | 2020                               | 2021                                 | 2020                                 | 2021                      | 2020                      |\n| Consolidated                              | $m                                          | $m                                          | $m                                 | $m                                 | $m                                   | $m                                   | $m                        | $m                        |\n| Assets                                    |                                             |                                             |                                    |                                    |                                      |                                      |                           |                           |\n| Trading securities 1                      | 36,025                                      | 44,004                                      | 8,663                              | 6,909                              | -

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT INCORPORATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET DATA\n\n## Level 3 fair value measurements\n\nThe net balance of Level 3 financial instruments is an asset of $1,467 million (2020: $1,128 million) for the Group and $1,160 million (2020: $1,003 million) for the Company.\n\nThe assets and liabilities which incorporate significant unobservable inputs primarily include:\n\n- \uf0b7 equities for which there is no active market or traded prices cannot be observed;\n- \uf0b7 net loans and advances that are required to be measured at fair value for which there is no observable market data; and\n- \uf0b7 derivatives referencing market rates that cannot be observed primarily due to lack of market activity.\n\nThe increase in the net balance of Level 3 financial instruments is Investment Securities, due to the revaluation of the investment in Bank of Tianjin (Group and Company), and an increase in unlisted equity investments (Group).\n\nDuring the year, the Group and Company transferred $5 million of derivative liabilities from Level 3 to Level 2, where valuation parameters for these financial instruments became observable during the year, and $105 million of Loan and advances measured at fair value from Level 2 to Level 3, where valuation parameters for these loans became unobservable during the year. There were no other transfers in or out of Level 3 in the current or prior year.\n\n## Bank of Tianjin (BoT)\n\nThe investment is valued based on comparator bank price-to-book (P/B) multiples (a P/B multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity). The extent of judgement applied in determining the appropriate multiple and comparator group from which the multiple is derived are non-observable inputs which have resulted in the Level 3 classification.\n\n## Sensitivity to Level 3 data inputs\n\nWhen we make assumptions due to significant inputs not being directly observable in the market place (Level 3 inputs), then changing these assumptions changes the Group's estimate of the instrument's fair value. Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined by changing the primary unobservable parameter used to derive the valuation.\n\n## Bank of Tianjin (BoT)\n\nThe valuation of the BoT investment is sensitive to the selected unobservable input, being the P/B multiple. If the P/B multiple was increased or decreased by 10% it would result in a $99 million (2020: $93 million) increase or decrease to the fair value of the investment, which would be recognised in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Other\n\nThe remaining Level 3 balance is immaterial and changes in inputs have a minimal impact on net profit and net assets of the Group.\n\n## Deferred fair value gains and losses\n\nWhere fair values are determined using unobservable inputs significant to the fair value of a financial instrument, the Group does not immediately recognise the difference between the transaction price and the amount we determine based on the valuation technique (day one gain or loss) in profit or loss. After initial recognition, we recognise the deferred amount in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the life of the transaction or until all inputs become observable.\n\nDay one gains and losses which have been deferred are not material.\n\n204\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 18.

This has not changed as a result of COVID19, however the Group has considered the impact of related economic and market disruptions on fair value measurement assumptions and the appropriateness of valuation inputs, notably valuation adjustments, as well as the impact of COVID-19 on the classification of exposures in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFor certain financial instruments, we may use data that is not readily observable in current markets. If we use unobservable market data, then we need to exercise more judgement to determine fair value depending on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Generally, we derive unobservable inputs from other relevant market data and compare them to observed transaction prices where available.\n\nWhen establishing the fair value of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers valuation adjustments in determining the fair value. We may apply adjustments (such as bid/offer spreads, credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation adjustments - refer Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments) to reflect the Group's assessment of factors that market participants would consider in determining fair value.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 19.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at the date of acquisition to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the related business combination. These CGUs are ANZ's reportable segments. Goodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nWe estimate the recoverable amount of each CGU to which goodwill is allocated using a fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCOD) approach, with a value-in-use (VIU) assessment performed where the FVLCOD is less than the carrying amount.\n\nDuring the year ended 30 September 2021, $251 million of goodwill was written off upon reclassification of ANZ Share Investing to held for sale in the Group (Company: nil) with a remaining $13 million of goodwill derecognised upon completion of the disposal.\n\nDuring the year ended 30 September 2020, the Group wrote off $124 million of goodwill in relation to completed divestments (Company: $10 million). In addition, the Group announced its intention to begin winding up the Bonus Bonds business, a managed investment product in New Zealand and the Group wrote off the associated goodwill of $27 million (Company: nil). The Group wrote off $50 million of goodwill in the Pacific division (Company: $10 million) as a result of changes in economic outlook.\n\n210\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 21. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)\n\n## Fair Value Less Cost of Disposal\n\nThe recoverable amount of each CGU to which goodwill is allocated is estimated on a FVLCOD basis, calculated using a market multiple approach. Under this approach, we determine the estimated fair value of each CGU by applying observable price earnings multiples of appropriate comparator companies to the estimated future maintainable earnings of each CGU. A deduction is then made for estimated costs of disposal. The valuation is considered to be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to unobservable inputs used in the valuation.\n\nManagement's approach and the key assumptions used to determine FVLCOD, for those CGUs where recoverable amount was determined on the basis of FVLCOD were as follows:\n\n| Key assumption                         | Approach to determining the value (or values) for each key assumption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Future maintainable earnings           | Future maintainable earnings for each CGU have been estimated as the sum of:  \uf0b7 The Group's 2022 financial plan for each CGU; plus  \uf0b7 An allocation of the central costs recorded outside of the CGU's to which goodwill is allocated.  Where relevant, adjustments are made to the Group's financial plan to reflect the long term expectations for |\n| Price/Earnings (P/E) multiple  applied | The P/E multiples used have been derived from valuations of comparable publicly traded companies  relevant to the respective CGU.  In the case of the New Zealand and Institutional CGUs, management has made downwards adjustments to                                                                                                               |\n|                                        | comparator group multiples to address specific factors relevant to those CGUs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                                        | Division  2021  2020                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Costs of disposal                      | Costs of disposal have been estimated as 2% of the fair value of the CGU based on input from historical and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n\nAs noted above, our impairment testing did not result in any material impairment of goodwill being identified as at 30 September 2021.\n\n## FVLCOD assessment outcomes\n\nFor each CGU, the surplus of the recoverable amount over the carrying amount determined on the basis of FVLCOD was as follows:\n\n|                                 | Surplus  2021   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Cash generating unit:           | $m              |\n| Australia Retail and Commercial | 12,168          |\n| New Zealand                     | 6,332           |\n| Institutional                   | 4,249           |\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe surpluses disclosed above are sensitive to judgements and estimates however the FVLCOD estimates for the respective CGUs would continue to show a surplus in recoverable amount over carrying amount even where reasonably possible alternative estimates were used.\n\n211",

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nManagement judgement is used to assess the recoverable value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the useful economic life of an asset, or whether an asset has an indefinite life. We reassess the recoverability of the carrying value at each reporting date.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nA number of key judgements are required in the determination of whether or not a goodwill balance is impaired including:\n\n- \uf0b7 the level at which goodwill is allocated - consistent with prior periods the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated are the Group's revenue generating segments that benefit from relevant historical business combinations generating goodwill.\n- \uf0b7 determination of the carrying amount of each CGU which includes an allocation, on a reasonable and consistent basis, of corporate assets and liabilities that are not directly attributable to the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.\n- \uf0b7 assessment of the recoverable amount of each CGU including:\n- o selection of the model used to determine the fair value - the Group has used the market multiple approach to estimate the fair value; and\n- o selection of the key assumptions in respect of future maintainable earnings, the P/E multiple applied, including selection of an appropriate comparator group and determination of an appropriate control premium, and costs of disposal as described above.\n\n## Software and other intangible assets\n\nAt each reporting date, software and other intangible assets are assessed for indicators of impairment and, where such indicators are identified, an impairment assessment is performed. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the asset is written down immediately. Those assets not yet ready for use are tested for impairment annually.\n\nIn addition, the expected useful lives of intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date. The assessment requires management judgement, and in relation to our software assets, a number of factors can influence the expected useful lives.

OTHER PROVISIONS (continued)\n\n## Customer remediation\n\nCustomer remediation includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation outcomes.\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nProvisions for restructuring costs arise from activities related to material changes in the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner in which that business is undertaken and include employee termination benefits. Costs relating to on-going activities are not provided for and are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Non-lending losses, frauds and forgeries\n\nNon-lending losses include losses arising from certain legal actions not directly related to amounts of principal outstanding for loans and advances and losses arising from forgeries, frauds and the correction of operational issues. The amounts recognised are the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties that surround the events and circumstances that affect the provision.\n\n## Other\n\nOther provisions comprise various other provisions including workers compensation, make-good provisions associated with leased premises, warranties and indemnities provided in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets, and contingent liabilities recognised as part of a business combination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Group recognises provisions when there is a present obligation arising from a past event, an outflow of economic resources is probable, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably.\n\nThe amount recognised is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the timing and amount of the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the estimated cash flows required to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe Group holds provisions for various obligations including customer remediation, restructuring costs, non-lending losses, fraud and forgeries and litigation related claims. These provisions involve judgements regarding the timing and outcome of future events, including estimates of expenditure required to satisfy such obligations. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in light of such advice, provisions and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made.\n\nIn relation to customer remediation, determining the amount of the provisions, which represent management's best estimate of the cost of settling the identified matters, requires the exercise of significant judgement. It will often be necessary to form a view on a number of different assumptions, including, the number of impacted customers, the average refund per customer, the associated remediation project costs, and the implications of regulatory exposures and customer claims having regard to their specific facts and circumstances. Consequently, the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence including expert legal advices and adjustments are made to the provisions where appropriate.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n215",

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n## CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\n\nANZ's capital management strategy aims to protect the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. We achieve this through an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) whereby ANZ conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon. The process involves:\n\n- \uf0b7 forecasting economic variables, financial performance of ANZ's divisions and the financial impact of new strategic initiatives to be implemented during the planning period;\n- \uf0b7 performing stress tests under different economic scenarios to determine the level of additional capital ('stress capital buffer') needed to absorb losses that may be experienced under an economic downturn;\n- \uf0b7 reviewing capital ratios and targets across various classes of capital against ANZ's risk profile; and\n- \uf0b7 developing a capital plan, taking into account capital ratio targets, current and future capital issuances requirements and options around capital products, timing and markets to execute the capital plan under differing market and economic conditions.\n\nThe capital plan is approved by the Board and updated as required. The Board and senior management are provided with regular updates of ANZ's capital position. Any material actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. Throughout the year, the Group maintained compliance with all the regulatory requirements related to Capital Adequacy in the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n\n## REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Australia\n\nAs ANZ is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) in Australia, it is primarily regulated by APRA under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). ANZ must comply with the minimum regulatory capital requirements, prudential capital ratios and specific reporting levels that APRA sets and which are consistent with the global Basel III capital framework. This is the common framework for determining the appropriate level of bank regulatory capital as set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('BCBS'). APRA requirements are summarised below:\n\n## Regulatory Capital Definition\n\n| Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital                                                                                                                   | Tier 1 Capital                                                                                                            | Tier 2 Capital                                                                      | Total Capital                            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Shareholders' equity adjusted for  specific items.                                                                                                    | CET1 Capital plus certain  securities with complying loss  absorbing characteristics known  as Additional Tier 1 Capital. | Subordinated debt instruments  which have a minimum term of 5  years at issue date. | Tier 1 plus Tier 2 Capital.              |\n| Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs)                                                                                                              | Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs)                                                                                  | Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs)                                            | Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs) |\n| CET1 Ratio                                                                                                                                            | Tier 1 Ratio                                                                                                              | Total Capital Ratio                                                                 |                                          |\n| CET1 Capital divided by total risk  weighted assets must be at least 4.5%.                                                                            | Tier 1 Capital divided by total risk  weighted assets must be at least  6.0%.                                             | Total Capital divided by total risk weighted  assets must be at least 8.0%.         |                                          |\n| Reporting Levels                                                                                                                                      | Reporting Levels                                                                                                          | Reporting Levels                                                                    | Reporting Levels                         |\n| Level 1                                                                                                                                               | Level 2                                                                                                                   | Level 3                                                                             |                                          |\n| The ADI on a stand-alone basis (that is  the Company and specified subsidiaries  which are consolidated to form the  ADI's Extended Licensed Entity). | The consolidated Group less  certain subsidiaries and associates  that are excluded under  prudential standards.          | A conglomerate Group at the widest level.                                           |                                          |\n\nAPRA also requires the ADI to hold additional CET1 buffers as follows:\n\n- \uf0b7 a capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 3.5% which is inclusive of the additional 1% surcharge for domestically systemically important banks (D-SIBs). APRA has determined that ANZ is a D-SIB.\n- \uf0b7 a countercyclical capital buffer which is set on a jurisdictional basis. The requirement is currently set to zero for Australia.\n\nANZ reports to APRA on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and measures capital adequacy monthly on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and is not yet required to maintain capital on a Level 3 basis (APRA have yet to conclude required timing for Level 3 reporting).\n\n218\n\n## 24. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## Life Insurance and Funds Management\n\nAs required by APRA's Prudential Standards, insurance and funds management activities are:\n\n- \uf0b7 de-consolidated for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy; and\n- \uf0b7 excluded from the risk based capital adequacy framework.\n\nWe deduct the investment in these controlled entities 100% from CET1 capital, and if we include any profits from these activities in the Group's results, then we exclude them from the determination of CET1 capital to the extent they have not been remitted to the Company.\n\n## Outside Australia\n\nIn addition to APRA, the Company's branch operations and major banking subsidiary operations are also overseen by local regulators such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the US Federal Reserve, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. They may impose minimum capital levels on operations in their individual jurisdictions.\n\n## CAPITAL ADEQUACY 1\n\nThe following table provides details of the Group's capital adequacy ratios at 30 September:\n\n|                                                    | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                    | 2021  $m       | 2020  $m       |\n| Qualifying capital                                 |                |                |\n| Tier 1                                             |                |                |\n| Shareholders' equity and non-controlling interests | 63,676         | 61,297         |\n| Prudential adjustments to shareholders' equity 2   | 3              | 189            |\n| Gross Common Equity Tier 1 capital                 | 63,679         | 61,486         |\n| Deductions 2                                       | (12,320)       | (12,784)       |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 capital                       | 51,359         | 48,702         |\n| Additional Tier 1 capital 3                        | 8,114          | 7,779          |\n| Tier 1 capital                                     | 59,473         | 56,481         |\n| Tier 2 capital 4                                   | 17,125         | 13,957         |\n| Total qualifying capital                           | 76,598         | 70,438         |\n| Capital adequacy ratios (Level 2)                  |                |                |\n| Common Equity Tier 1                               | 12.3%          | 11.3%          |\n| Tier 1                                             | 14.3%          | 13.2%          |\n| Tier 2                                             | 4.1%           | 3.3%           |\n| Total capital ratio                                | 18.4%          | 16.4%          |\n| Risk weighted assets                               | 416,086        | 429,384        |\n\n- 2.

CONTROLLED ENTITIES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are those entities it controls through:\n\n- \uf0b7 being exposed to, or having rights to, variable returns from the entity; and\n- \uf0b7 being able to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe Group assesses whether it has power over those entities by examining the Group's existing rights to direct the relevant activities of the entity.\n\nIf the Group sells or acquires subsidiaries during the year, it includes their operating results in the Group results to the date of disposal or from the date of acquisition. When the Group's control ceases, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any related noncontrolling interest and other components of equity.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to control a subsidiary, it:\n\n- \uf0b7 measures any retained interest in the entity at fair value; and\n- \uf0b7 recognises any resulting gain or loss in profit or loss.\n\nIf the Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary changes in a way that does not result in a loss of control, then the Group accounts for that as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders.\n\nAll transactions between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n221",

STATEMENTS\n\n## 26. INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (continued)\n\n## IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT\n\nThe Group assesses the carrying value of its associate investments for impairment indicators.\n\nAt 30 September 2021, the impairment assessment of non-lending assets identified that two of the Group's associate investments AmBank and PT Panin had indicators of impairment. No impairment was recognised as their carrying values are supported by their value-in-use (VIU) calculations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence over its operating and financial policies but does not control. The Group accounts for associates using the equity method. Its investments in associates are carried at cost plus the post-acquisition share of changes in the associate's net assets less accumulated impairments. Dividends the Group receives from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The Group includes goodwill recognised by the associate in the carrying amount of the investment. It does not individually test the goodwill incorporated in the associates carrying amount for impairment.\n\nAt least at each reporting date, the Group reviews investments in associates for any indication of impairment. If an indication of impairment exists, then the Group determines the recoverable amount of the associate using the higher of:\n\n- \uf0b7 the associate's fair value less cost of disposal; and\n- \uf0b7 its value-in-use.\n\nWe use a discounted cash flow methodology, and when applicable, other methodologies (such as capitalisation of earnings methodology), to determine the recoverable amount.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the valuation of AmBank and PT Panin remains uncertain. Significant management judgment is required in determining the key assumptions underpinning the VIU calculations. Factors may change in subsequent periods and lead to potential future impairments or reversals of prior period impairments. These include forecast earnings levels in the near term and/or changes in the long term growth forecasts, required levels of regulatory capital and post-tax discount rate.\n\nThe key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are outlined below:\n\n| As at 30 September 2021                                          | AmBank   | PT Panin   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| Post-tax discount rate                                           | 10.6%    | 14.4%      |\n| Terminal growth rate                                             | 5.0%     | 5.1%       |\n| Expected earnings growth (compound annual growth rate - 5 years) | 4.2%     | 6.4%       |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (5 year average)                      | 13.4%    | 12.8%      |\n\nThe VIU calculations are sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions with reasonably possible changes in key assumptions having a positive or negative impact on the VIU outcome, and as such the recoverable amount of the investment.\n\n- \uf0b7 A change in the September 2021 post-tax discount rate by +/- 50 bps would impact the VIU outcome for PT Panin by ($55 million)/ $60 million, and ($84 million)/$106 million for AmBank.\n- \uf0b7 A change in the September 2021 terminal growth rate by +/- 25 bps would impact the VIU outcome for PT Panin by $9 million/ ($10 million), and $49 million/($45 million) for AmBank.\n\nNeither investment would be impaired if the discount rate were increased or the terminal growth rate reduced by the reasonably possible changes above.\n\n223",

STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nA Structured Entity (SE) is an entity that has been designed such that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in determining who controls the entity. SEs are generally established with restrictions on their ongoing activities in order to achieve narrow and well defined objectives.\n\nSEs are classified as subsidiaries and consolidated when control exists. If the Group does not control a SE, then it is not consolidated. This note provides information on both consolidated and unconsolidated SEs.\n\nThe Group's involvement with SEs is as follows:\n\n| Type                             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Securitisation                   | The Group establishes SEs to securitise customer loans and advances that it has originated, in order to diversify  sources of funding for liquidity management. Securitisation programs include customer loans and advances  assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide either security for obligations payable on notes issued by the SEs  to external investors or create assets held by the Group eligible for repurchase agreements with applicable  central banks.                      |\n|                                  | The Group retains control over these SEs and therefore they are consolidated.

STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued)\n\n## UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\n## GROUP'S INTEREST IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nAn 'interest' in an unconsolidated SE is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement with a SE that exposes the Group to variability of returns from the performance of that SE. These interests include, but are not limited to: holdings of debt or equity securities; derivatives that pass-on risks specific to the performance of the SE; lending; loan commitments; financial guarantees; and fees from funds management activities.\n\nFor the purpose of disclosing interests in unconsolidated SEs:\n\n- \uf0b7 no disclosure is made if the Group's involvement is not more than a passive interest - for example: when the Group's involvement constitutes a typical customer-supplier relationship. On this basis, exposures to unconsolidated SEs that arise from lending, trading and investing activities are not considered disclosable interests - unless the design of the structured entity allows the Group to participate in decisions about the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity's returns).\n- \uf0b7 'interests' do not include derivatives intended to expose the Group to market-risk (rather than performance risk specific to the SE) or derivatives through which the Group creates, rather than absorbs, variability of the unconsolidated SE (such as purchase of credit protection under a credit default swap).\n\nThe table below sets out the Group's interests in unconsolidated SEs together with the maximum exposure to loss that could arise from those interests:\n\n|                                  | Securitisation   | Securitisation   | Structured finance   | Structured finance   | Total    | Total    |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|----------|\n|                                  | 2021  $m         | 2020  $m         | 2021  $m             | 2020  $m             | 2021  $m | 2020  $m |\n| On-balance sheet interests       |                  |                  |                      |                      |          |          |\n| Investment securities            | 2,624            | 2,280            | -                    | -                    | 2,624    | 2,280    |\n| Gross loans and advances         | 7,697            | 8,479            | 53                   | 74                   | 7,750    | 8,553    |\n| Total on-balance sheet           | 10,321           | 10,759           | 53                   | 74                   | 10,374   | 10,833   |\n| Off-balance sheet interests      |                  |                  |                      |                      |          |          |\n| Commitments (facilities undrawn) | 2,034            | 2,072            | -                    | 22                   | 2,034    | 2,094    |\n| Guarantees                       | 50               | 40               | -                    | -                    | 50       | 40       |\n| Total off-balance sheet          | 2,084            | 2,112            | -                    | 22                   | 2,084    | 2,134    |\n| Maximum exposure to loss         | 12,405           | 12,871           | 53                   | 96                   | 12,458   | 12,967   |\n\nIn addition to the interests above, the Group earned funds management fees from unconsolidated investment funds of $192 million (2020: $285 million) during the year.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to loss represents the maximum amount of loss that the Group could incur as a result of its involvement with unconsolidated SEs if loss events were to take place - regardless of the probability of occurrence. This does not in any way represent the actual losses expected to be incurred. Furthermore, the maximum exposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered into to mitigate ANZ's exposure to loss.\n\nThe maximum exposure to loss has been determined as:\n\n- \uf0b7 the carrying amount of Investment securities measured at amortised cost; and\n- \uf0b7 the carrying amount plus the undrawn amount of any committed loans and advances.\n\nThe size of unconsolidated SEs is indicated by total assets which vary by SE with a maximum value of approximately $4.3 billion.\n\nThe Group did not provide any non-contractual support to unconsolidated SEs during the year (2020: nil) nor does it have any current intention to provide financial or other support to unconsolidated SEs.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n225",

STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued)\n\n## SPONSORED UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nThe Group may also sponsor unconsolidated SEs in which it has no disclosable interest.\n\nFor the purposes of this disclosure, the Group considers itself the 'sponsor' of an unconsolidated SE if it is the primary party involved in the design and establishment of that SE and:\n\n- \uf0b7 the Group is the major user of that SE; or\n- \uf0b7 the Group's name appears in the name of that SE, or on its products; or\n- \uf0b7 the Group provides implicit or explicit guarantees of that SE's performance.\n\nThe Group has sponsored the ANZ PIE Fund in New Zealand, which invests only in deposits with ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited. The Group does not provide any implicit or explicit guarantees of the capital value or performance of investments in the ANZ PIE Fund. There was no income received from, nor assets transferred to, this entity during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nSignificant judgement is required in assessing whether the Group has control over Structured Entities. Judgement is required to determine the existence of:\n\n- \uf0b7 power over the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity's returns);\n- \uf0b7 exposure to variable returns of the entity; and\n- \uf0b7 the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the Group's returns.\n\n## 28. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nIn the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions where it transfers financial assets directly to third parties or to SEs. These transfers may give rise to the Group fully, or partially, derecognising those financial assets - depending on the Group's exposure to the risks and rewards or control over the transferred assets. If the Group retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of a transferred asset, the transfer does not qualify for derecognition and the asset remains on the Group's balance sheet in its entirety.\n\n## SECURITISATIONS\n\nNet loans and advances include residential mortgages securitised under the Group's securitisation programs which are assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for obligations payable on the notes issued by the SEs. The holders of the issued notes have full recourse to the pool of residential mortgages which have been securitised and the Group cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets.\n\nIn some instances, the Group is also the holder of the securitised notes issued by the SEs. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of the SEs and sometimes enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets.\n\nThe Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with these securitisation SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group.\n\nDuring the 2021 financial year, the Company changed its accounting policy regarding intragroup positions with consolidated securitisation SEs in which it holds all of the issued securities of the SE. The Company records a net nil position with the securitisation SE to reflect the economic substance of these fully offsetting intercompany transactions. Refer to Note 35 Impacts of Adoption of New Standards and Other Changes for further details of the change in accounting policy.\n\n226\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 28. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS (continued)\n\n## COVERED BONDS\n\nThe Group operates various global covered bond programs to raise funding in its primary markets. Net loans and advances include residential mortgages assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs associated with these covered bond programs. The mortgages provide security for the obligations payable on the issued covered bonds.\n\nThe covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool of assets. The issuer cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets, however, subject to legal arrangements it may repurchase and substitute assets as long as the required cover is maintained.\n\nThe Group is required to maintain the cover pool at a level sufficient to cover the bond obligations. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of the covered bond SEs and enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the majority of the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SEs is recognised as a financial liability of the Group.\n\nThe Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with the covered bond SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group. The covered bonds issued externally are included within debt issuances.\n\n## REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nWhen the Group sells securities subject to repurchase agreements under which we retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, then those assets do not qualify for derecognition. An associated liability is recognised for the consideration received from the counterparty.\n\n## STRUCTURED FINANCE ARRANGEMENTS\n\nThe Group arranges funding for certain customer transactions through structured leasing and commodity prepayment arrangements. These transactions are recognised on Group's balance sheet as lease receivables or loans. At times, other financial institutions participate in the funding of these arrangements. This participation involves a proportionate transfer of the rights to the assets recognised by the Group. The participating banks have limited recourse to the leased assets or financed commodity and related proceeds. Where the Group continues to be exposed to some of the risks of the transferred assets through a derivative or other continuing involvement, the Group does not derecognise the lease receivable or loan. Instead, the Group recognises an associated liability representing its obligations to the participating financial institutions.\n\nThe tables below set out the balance of assets transferred that do not qualify for derecognition, along with the associated liabilities.\n\n|                                               | Securitisations 1,2   | Securitisations 1,2   | Covered bonds   | Covered bonds   | Repurchase  agreements   | Repurchase  agreements   | Structured finance  arrangements   | Structured finance  arrangements   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                               | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2021            | 2020            | 2021                     | 2020                     | 2021                               | 2020                               |\n| Consolidated                                  | $m                    | $m                    | $m              | $m              | $m                       | $m                       | $m                                 | $m                                 |\n| Current carrying amount of assets transferred | 1,430                 | 1,831                 | 28,816          | 28,559          | 51,208                   | 61,415                   | 55                                 | 67                                 |\n| Carrying amount of associated liabilities     | 1,424                 | 1,824                 | 15,399          | 15,948          | 46,147                   | 55,716                   | 55                                 | 67                                 |\n\n|                                               | Securitisations 1,2   | Securitisations 1,2   | Covered bonds   | Covered bonds   | Repurchase  agreements   | Repurchase  agreements   | Structured finance  arrangements   | Structured finance  arrangements   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                               | 2021                  | 2020                  | 2021            | 2020            | 2021                     | 2020                     | 2021                               | 2020                               |\n| The Company                                   | $m                    | $m                    | $m              | $m              | $m                       | $m                       | $m                                 | $m                                 |\n| Current carrying amount of assets transferred | 1,430                 | 1,831                 | 17,925          | 17,937          | 48,663                   | 60,612                   | -                                  | -                                  |\n| Carrying amount of associated liabilities     | 1,430                 | 1,831                 | 17,925          | 17,937          | 43,925                   | 54,951                   | -                                  | -                                  |\n\n227",

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE\n\n## DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nThe Group completed the sale of its Aligned Dealer Groups business to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF) on 1 October 2018, its life insurance business to Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich) on 31 May 2019 and its OnePath pensions and investments business to IOOF on 31 January 2020.\n\nThe financial results of these divested businesses are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective. The financial results after transaction completion primarily relate to residual operational costs on separation and part recovery based on the respective Transition Service Agreements. The loss after tax from discontinued operations for the year was $17 million (2020: $98 million loss).\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT RELATING TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE\n\nDuring the 2021 financial year, the Group recognised the following impacts in relation to discontinued operations:\n\n- \uf0b7 $17 million loss after tax attributable to customer remediation charges of $3 million and an associated $1 million tax benefit, and ongoing sale completion costs net of recoveries.\n\nDuring the 2020 financial year, the Group recognised the following impacts in relation to discontinued operations:\n\n- \uf0b7 $13 million loss after tax recorded in operating income attributable to sale completion costs.\n- \uf0b7 $126 million of customer remediation charges and an associated $30 million tax benefit.\n- \uf0b7 $101 million charge recognised in operating income offset by a $101 million tax benefit within income tax expense relating to the finalisation of the policyholder tax position associated with the sale of the life insurance business to Zurich.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nA significant level of judgement is used by the Group to determine:\n\n- \uf0b7 whether an asset or group of assets is classified and presented as held for sale or as a discontinued operation; and\n- \uf0b7 the fair value of the assets and liabilities classified as being held for sale.\n\nManagement is required to exercise significant judgement when assessing the fair value less costs to sell for assets and liabilities held for sale. The judgemental factors include determining: costs to sell, allocation of goodwill, indemnities provided under the sale contract and consideration received - particularly where elements of consideration are contingent in nature. Any impairment we record is based on the best available evidence of fair value compared to the carrying value before the impairment. The final sale price may be different to the fair value we estimate when recording the impairment. Management regularly assess the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions against actual outcomes and other relevant evidence and adjustments are made to fair value where appropriate. We expect that sales will complete within 12 months after balance date, subject to the relevant regulatory approvals and customary terms of sale for such assets.\n\n228\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 30.

In 2021, the Group made defined benefit contributions totaling $3 million (2020: $4 million). It expects to make contributions of around $2 million next financial year.\n\n## GOVERNANCE OF THE SCHEMES AND FUNDING OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT SECTIONS\n\nThe main defined benefit superannuation schemes in which the Group participates operate under trust law and are managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the relevant trust deed and rules and all relevant legislation. These schemes have corporate trustees, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group. The trustees are the legal owners of the assets, which are held separately from the assets of the Group, and are responsible for setting investment policy and agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial actuarial valuation process.\n\nThe Group has defined benefit arrangements in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, Taiwan and United Kingdom. The defined benefit section of the ANZ Australian Staff Superannuation Scheme, the ANZ UK Staff Pension Scheme and the ANZ National Retirement Scheme in New Zealand are the three largest plans. They have been closed to new members since 1987, 2004 and 1991 respectively. None of the schemes had a material deficit, or surplus, at the last funding valuation. The Group has no present liability under any of the schemes' trust deeds to fund a deficit (measured on a funding basis). A contingent liability of the Group may arise if any of the schemes were wound up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## Defined benefit superannuation schemes\n\nThe Group operates a small number of defined benefit schemes. Independent actuaries calculate the liability and expenses related to providing benefits to employees under each defined benefit scheme. They use the Projected Unit Credit Method to value the liabilities. The balance sheet includes:\n\n- \uf0b7 a defined benefit liability if the obligation is greater than the fair value of the schemes assets; and\n- \uf0b7 an asset (capped to its recoverable amount) if the fair value of the assets is greater than the obligation.\n\nIn each reporting period, the movements in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as follows:\n\n- \uf0b7 the net movement relating to the current period's service cost, net interest on the defined benefit liability, past service costs and other costs (such as the effects of any curtailments and settlements) as operating expenses;\n- \uf0b7 remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (which comprise actuarial gains and losses and return on scheme assets, excluding interest income included in net interest) directly in retained earnings through other comprehensive income; and\n- \uf0b7 contributions of the Group directly against the net defined benefit position.\n\n## Defined contribution superannuation schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. It also contributes (according to local law, in the various countries in which it operates) to Government and other plans that have the characteristics of defined contribution plans. The Group's contributions to these schemes are recognised as personnel expenses when they are incurred.\n\n229",

EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)\n\n## Fair Value Assumptions\n\nWhen determining the fair value, we apply the standard market techniques for valuation, including Monte Carlo and/or Black Scholes pricing models. We do so in accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payments. The models take into account early exercise of vested equity, nontransferability and internal/external performance hurdles (if any).\n\nThe table below shows the significant assumptions we used as inputs into our fair value calculation of instruments granted during the period. We present the values as weighted averages, but the specific values we use for each allocation are the ones we use for the fair value calculation.\n\n|                                              | 2021                      | 2021                | 2020                      | 2020                   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                              | Deferred   share   rights | Performance  rights | Deferred   share   rights | Performance   rights 1 |\n| Exercise price ($)                           | 0.00                      | 0.00                | 0.00                      | 0.00                   |\n| Share closing price at grant date ($)        | 23.37                     | 23.32               | 24.78                     | 24.93                  |\n| Expected volatility of ANZ share price (%) 2 | 26.5                      | 25.0                | 20.0                      | 20.0                   |\n| Equity term (years)                          | 2.3                       | 6.0                 | 2.5                       | 6.0                    |\n| Vesting period (years)                       | 2.0                       | 4.0                 | 2.1                       | 4.0                    |\n| Expected life (years)                        | 2.0                       | 4.0                 | 2.1                       | 4.0                    |\n| Expected dividend yield (%)                  | 4.85                      | 5.25                | 6.0                       | 6.0                    |\n| Risk free interest rate (%)                  | 0.10                      | 0.21                | 0.77                      | 0.74                   |\n| Fair value ($)                               | 21.15                     | 9.56                | 21.95                     | 9.07                   |\n\n## SATISFYING EQUITY AWARDS\n\nAll shares underpinning equity awards may be purchased on market, reallocated or be newly issued shares, or a combination.\n\nThe equity we purchased on market during the 2021 financial year (either under the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the ANZ Share Option Plan, or to satisfy options or rights) for all employees amounted to 3,593,574 shares at an average price of $22.03 per share (2020: 4,882,936 shares at an average price of $25.06 per share).\n\n236\n\n## 32.

RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES (continued)\n\n## OTHER TRANSACTIONS OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND THEIR RELATED PARTIES\n\nThe aggregate of deposits of KMP and their related parties with the Group were $46 million (2020: $48 million) and with the Company were $38 million (2020: $37 million).\n\nDuring the year, in recognition of the contribution of David Gonski as Group Chairman over the period from 2014-2020 the Group donated a painting (valued at approximately $325,000) from its collection to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, where he is the president on the Board of Trustees. ANZ has enjoyed an association with the Art Gallery of NSW since 2010, through its sponsorship of various annually awarded art prizes and it has been a Leadership Partner since 2017. The transaction between the Group and the Art Gallery New South Wales is not a related party transaction for accounting purposes.\n\nOther transactions with KMP and their related parties included amounts paid to the Group in respect of investment management service fees, brokerage and bank fees and charges. The Group has reimbursed KMP for the costs incurred for security and secretarial services associated with the performance of their duties. These transactions are conducted on normal commercial terms and conditions no more favourable than those given to other employees or customers. Gifts in the form of charitable donation amounting to $500 were provided on behalf of the related parties of KMP during the year.\n\n## ASSOCIATES\n\nWe disclose significant associates in Note 26 Investments in Associates. During the course of the financial year, transactions conducted with all associates were on terms equivalent to those made on an arm's length basis.\n\n|                                    | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                    | 2021  $'000    | 2020  $'000    | 2021  $'000   | 2020  $'000   |\n| Amounts receivable from associates | 7              | 354            | -             | -             |\n| Amounts payable to associates      | 1,739          | 1,354          | 716           | 746           |\n| Interest expense to associates     | 2              | 10             | -             | -             |\n| Other revenue from associates      | -              | 500            | -             | -             |\n| Other expenses paid to associates  | 9,988          | 9,018          | 8,063         | 7,706         |\n| Guarantees given to associates     | 28             | -              | 28            | -             |\n| Dividend income from associates    | -              | 32,465         | -             | -             |\n\nThere have been no material guarantees given or received. No amounts receivable from the associates have been written-off during the period, or individual provisions raised in respect of these balances.\n\n## SUBSIDIARIES\n\nWe disclose material controlled entities in Note 25 Controlled Entities. During the financial year, subsidiaries conducted transactions with each other and with associates on terms equivalent to those on an arm's length basis. As of 30 September 2021, we consider all outstanding amounts on these transactions to be fully collectible.\n\nTransactions between the Company and its subsidiaries include providing a wide range of banking and other financial facilities. Details of amounts paid to, or received from, related parties, in the form of dividends or interest, are set out in Note 2 Net Interest Income and Note 3 Non-Interest Income.\n\nOther intragroup transactions include providing management and administrative services, staff training, data processing facilities, transfer of tax losses, and the leasing of Premises and equipment.\n\n238\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 33. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS\n\n## CREDIT RELATED COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\n|                                   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                   | 2021  $m       | 2020  $m       | 2021  $m      | 2020  $m      |\n| Contract amount of:               |                |                |               |               |\n| Undrawn facilities                | 212,265        | 227,819        | 176,077       | 191,300       |\n| Guarantees and letters of credit  | 30,027         | 22,778         | 27,957        | 20,640        |\n| Performance related contingencies | 18,303         | 17,017         | 17,085        | 15,505        |\n| Total                             | 260,595        | 267,614        | 221,119       | 227,445       |\n\n## UNDRAWN FACILITIES\n\nThe majority of undrawn facilities are subject to customers maintaining specific credit and other requirements or conditions. Many of these facilities are expected to be only partially used, and others may never be used at all. As such, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not necessarily representative of future liquidity risks or future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group or the Company may be required to pay, the full amount of undrawn facilities for the Group and the Company mature within 12 months.\n\n## GUARANTEES, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE RELATED CONTINGENCIES\n\nGuarantees, letters of credit and performance related contingencies relate to transactions that the Group has entered into as principal - including guarantees, standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit.\n\nDocumentary letters of credit involve the Group issuing letters of credit guaranteeing payment in favour of an exporter. They are secured against an underlying shipment of goods or backed by a confirmatory letter of credit from another bank.\n\nPerformance related contingencies are liabilities that oblige the Group to make payments to a third party if the customer fails to fulfil its non-monetary obligations under the contract.\n\nTo reflect the risk associated with these transactions, we apply the same credit origination, portfolio management and collateral requirements that we apply to loans. The contract amount represents the maximum potential amount that we could lose if the counterparty fails to meet its financial obligations. As the facilities may expire without being drawn upon, the notional amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group or the Company may be required to pay, the full amount of guarantees and letters of credit and performance related contingencies for the Group and the Company mature within 12 months.\n\n239",

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS (continued)\n\n## OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nAs at 30 September 2021, the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of the matters outlined below. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in the light of such advice, provisions (refer to Note 22 Other Provisions) and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made. In some instances we have not disclosed the estimated financial impact of the individual items either because it is not practicable to do so or because such disclosure may prejudice the interests of the Group.\n\n## REGULATORY AND CUSTOMER EXPOSURES\n\nIn recent years there has been an increase in the number of matters on which the Group engages with its regulators. There have also been significant increases in the nature and scale of regulatory investigations, surveillance and reviews, civil and criminal enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise), formal and informal inquiries, regulatory supervisory activities and the quantum of fines issued by regulators, particularly against financial institutions both in Australia and globally. The Group has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions can be wide ranging and, for example, include or have included a range of matters including responsible lending practices, regulated lending requirements, product suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, insurance distribution, pricing, competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations, reporting and disclosure obligations and product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain.\n\n## BENCHMARK/RATE ACTIONS\n\nIn July and August 2016, class action complaints were brought in the United States District Court against local and international banks, including the Company - one action relating to the bank bill swap rate (BBSW), and one action relating to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR) and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR). The class actions are expressed to apply to persons and entities that engaged in US-based transactions in financial instruments that were priced, benchmarked, and/or settled based on BBSW or SIBOR. The claimants seek damages or compensation in amounts not specified, and allege that the defendant banks, including the Company, violated US anti-trust laws and (in the BBSW case only) antiracketeering laws, the Commodity Exchange Act, and unjust enrichment principles. In March 2021, the Company reached an agreement to settle the BBSW class action. The settlement is without admission of liability and remains subject to negotiation and execution of complete settlement terms as well as court approval. The financial impact of the settlement is not material and has been fully provided at 31 March 2021. The separate class action in relation to SIBOR is ongoing and is being defended.\n\nIn February 2017, the South African Competition Commission commenced proceedings against local and international banks including the Company alleging breaches of the cartel provisions of the South African Competition Act in respect of trading in the South African rand. The potential civil penalty or other financial impact is uncertain.\n\n## CAPITAL RAISING ACTIONS\n\nIn June 2018, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions commenced criminal proceedings against a number of companies and individuals, including the Company and a senior employee. It is alleged that the joint lead managers of the Company's August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement engaged in cartel conduct and that the Company and its senior employee were involved in one of those joint lead managers giving effect to a cartel. The Company and its senior employee are defending the allegations. The trial is currently scheduled to start in April 2022.\n\nIn September 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company alleging failure to comply with continuous disclosure obligations in connection with the Company's August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement. ASIC alleges the Company should have advised the market that the joint lead managers took up approximately 25.5 million ordinary shares of the placement. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n## CONSUMER CREDIT INSURANCE LITIGATION\n\nIn February 2020, a class action was brought against the Company alleging breaches of financial advice obligations, misleading or deceptive conduct and unconscionable conduct in relation to the distribution of consumer credit insurance products. The issuers of the insurance products, QBE and OnePath Life, are also defendants to the claim. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n## ESANDA DEALER CAR LOAN LITIGATION\n\nIn August 2020, a class action was brought against the Company alleging unfair conduct, misleading or deceptive conduct and equitable mistake in relation to the use of flex commissions in dealer arranged Esanda car loans. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n## ONEPATH SUPERANNUATION LITIGATION\n\nIn December 2020, a class action was brought against OnePath Custodians, OnePath Life and the Company alleging that OnePath Custodians breached its obligations under superannuation legislation, and its duties as trustee, in respect of superannuation investments and fees. The claim also alleges that the Company was involved in some of OnePath Custodians' investment breaches. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n240\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 33. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS (continued)\n\n## OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## NEW ZEALAND LOAN INFORMATION LITIGATION\n\nIn September 2021, a representative proceeding was brought against ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, alleging breaches of disclosure requirements under consumer credit legislation in respect of variation letters sent to certain loan customers. ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited is defending the allegations.\n\n## ROYAL COMMISSION\n\nThe Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry released its final report on 4 February 2019. Following the Royal Commission there have been, and continue to be, additional costs and further exposures, including exposures associated with further regulator activity or potential customer exposures such as class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with these possible exposures remain uncertain.\n\n## SECURITY RECOVERY ACTIONS\n\nVarious claims have been made or are anticipated, arising from security recovery actions taken to resolve impaired assets. These claims will be defended.\n\n## WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES\n\nThe Group has provided warranties, indemnities and other commitments in favour of the purchaser and other persons in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets and other transactions, covering a range of matters and risks. It is exposed to claims under those warranties, indemnities and commitments.\n\n## CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nCertain group companies have a commitment to comply with rules governing various clearing and settlement arrangements which could result in a credit risk exposure and loss if another member institution fails to settle its payment clearing activities. The Group's potential exposure arising from these arrangements is unquantifiable in advance.\n\nCertain group companies hold memberships of central clearing houses, including ASX Clear (Futures), London Clearing House (LCH) SwapClear and RepoClear, Korea Exchange (KRX), Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX), Clearing Corporation of India and the Shanghai Clearing House. These memberships allow the relevant group company to centrally clear derivative instruments in line with cross-border regulatory requirements. Common to all of these memberships is the requirement for the relevant group company to make default fund contributions. In the event of a default by another member, the relevant group company could potentially be required to commit additional default fund contributions which are unquantifiable in advance.\n\n## PARENT ENTITY GUARANTEES\n\nThe Company has issued letters of comfort and guarantees in respect of certain subsidiaries in the normal course of business. Under these letters and guarantees, the Company undertakes to ensure that those subsidiaries continue to meet their financial obligations, subject to certain conditions including that the entity remains a controlled entity of the Company.\n\n## SALE OF GRINDLAYS BUSINESSES\n\nOn 31 July 2000, the Company completed the sale to Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) of ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited (Grindlays) and certain other businesses. The Company provided warranties and indemnities relating to those businesses.\n\nThe indemnified matters include civil penalty proceedings and criminal prosecutions brought by Indian authorities against Grindlays and certain of its officers, in relation to certain transactions conducted in 1991 that are alleged to have breached the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973.\n\nCivil penalties were imposed in 2007 which are the subject of appeals. The criminal prosecutions are being defended.\n\n## CONTINGENT ASSETS\n\n## NATIONAL HOUSING BANK\n\nThe Company is pursuing recovery of the proceeds of certain disputed cheques which were credited to the account of a former Grindlays customer in the early 1990s.\n\nThe disputed cheques were drawn on the National Housing Bank (NHB) in India. Proceedings between Grindlays and NHB concerning the proceeds of the cheques were resolved in early 2002.\n\nRecovery is now being pursued from the estate of the Grindlays customer who received the cheque proceeds. Any amounts recovered are to be shared between the Company and NHB.\n\n241",

These include regulatory and prudential reviews requested by regulators such as APRA. Any other services that are not audit or audit-related services are non-audit services. The Policy allows certain non-audit services to be provided where the service would not contravene auditor independence requirements. KPMG Australia or any of its related practices may not provide services that are perceived to be in conflict with the role of the external auditor or breach auditor independence. These include consulting advice and subcontracting of operational activities normally undertaken by management, and engagements where the external auditor may ultimately be required to express an opinion on its own work.\n\n242\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 35. IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF NEW STANDARDS AND OTHER CHANGES\n\n## INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM\n\nThere was no material impact from the early adoption of AASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2. Refer to Note 1 About Our Financial Statements for further details.\n\n## INTRAGROUP TRANSACTIONS WITH CONSOLIDATED SECURITISATION STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nDuring the 2021 financial year, the Company changed its accounting policy relating to intragroup transactions with consolidated securitisation SEs in which it holds all of the issued securities of the SE. These internal securitisation transactions provide an additional source of liquidity for the Group by creating residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) which can be sold under repurchase agreements with relevant central banks. A distinguishing feature of these transactions is that all of the RMBS issued by the SE are held by the Company, rather than purchased by third parties. By holding all of the RMBS issued by the SE, the Company retains all of the risk and rewards of the mortgages transferred to the SE which cannot be derecognised for accounting purposes. Furthermore, because the intragroup transactions with the SE fully offset each other, they do not alter the cash position, assets or future cash flows of the Company. Accordingly, under this policy change, these transactions will no longer be recorded on a gross basis. Rather, the Company will recognise a net nil position with the SE in order to better reflect the economic substance of the intragroup transactions.\n\nThis accounting policy change has no impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements given the previously recorded intercompany balances were eliminated in consolidation. Comparatives have been restated in the financial statements of the Company as follows:\n\n| The Company            | 2020  $m   |\n|------------------------|------------|\n| Income Statement       |            |\n| Interest income        | (2,377)    |\n| Interest expense       | 2,929      |\n| Net interest income    | 552        |\n| Other operating income | (552)      |\n| Net profit after tax   | -          |\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nDue from controlled entities\n\n(76,637)\n\nTotal assets\n\n(76,637)\n\nDue to controlled entities\n\n(76,637)\n\nTotal liabilities\n\n(76,637)\n\nNet assets\n\n-\n\n## 36. EVENTS SINCE THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR\n\nOn 22 October 2021, a Group fund that owns 19% of the shares in Cashrewards Limited announced it would make an off-market takeover offer to acquire the remaining 81% of the shares, for ~$80 million. The offer is subject to a number of conditions and completion remains uncertain.\n\nOther than the matter above, there have been no significant events from 30 September 2021 to the date of signing this report.\n\n243",

These models are reliant on data and a number of estimates including the impact of multiple economic scenarios and other assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk (SICR).\n\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments requires the Company and Group to measure ECLs on a forward-looking basis reflecting a range of economic conditions, of which gross domestic product (GDP) and unemployment levels are considered key assumptions. Post-model adjustments are made by the Company and Group to address known ECL model limitations or emerging trends in the loan portfolios. We exercise significant judgement in challenging the economic scenarios used and the judgmental post model adjustments the Company and Group applies to the ECL results.\n\nThe Company and Group's criteria selected to identify a SICR, such as a decrease in customer credit rating (CCR), are key areas of judgement within the Company and Group's ECL methodology as these criteria determine if a forward-looking 12 month or lifetime allowance is recorded.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has meant that assumptions regarding the economic outlook are more uncertain which, combined with varying government responses, increases the level of judgement required by the Company and Group in calculating the ECL, and the associated audit risk.\n\nAdditionally, allowances for individually assessed wholesale loans exceeding specific thresholds are individually assessed by the Company and Group. We exercise significant judgement in challenging the assessment of specific allowances based on the expected future cash repayments and estimated proceeds from the value of the collateral held by the Company and Group in respect of the loans.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nOur audit procedures for the allowance for ECL and disclosures included assessing the Company and Group's significant accounting policies against the requirements of the accounting standard. Additionally, our procedures included:\n\nTesting key controls of the Company and Group in relation to:\n\n- \uf0b7 The ECL model governance and validation processes which involved assessment of model performance;\n- \uf0b7 The assessment and approval of the forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings through challenge applied by the Company and Group's internal governance processes;\n- \uf0b7 Reconciliation of the data used in the ECL calculation process to gross balances recorded within the general ledger as well as source systems;\n- \uf0b7 Customer credit rating (CCR) for wholesale loans (larger customer exposures are monitored individually). This covered elements such as: approval of new lending facilities against the Company and Group's lending policies, monitoring of counterparty credit quality against the Company and Group's exposure criteria for internal factors specific to the counterparty or external macroeconomic factors, and accuracy and timeliness of CCR and security indicator (SI) assessments against the requirements of the Company and Group's lending policies and regulatory requirements; and\n- \uf0b7 IT system controls which record retail loans lending arrears, group exposures into delinquency buckets, and re-calculate individual allowances. We tested automated calculation and change management controls and evaluated the Company and Group's oversight of the portfolios, with a focus on controls over delinquency monitoring.\n\nWe tested relevant General Information Technology Controls (GITCs) in relation to the key IT applications used by the Company and Group in measuring ECL allowances as detailed in the IT Systems and Controls key audit matter below.\n\nIn addition to controls testing, our procedures included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Re-performing credit assessments of a sample of wholesale loans controlled by the Company and Group's specialist workout and recovery team assessed as higher risk or impaired, and a sample of other loans, focusing on larger exposures assessed by the Company and Group as showing signs of deterioration, or in areas of emerging risk (assessed against external market conditions and in particular considering the impacts of COVID19 and climate change). For each loan sampled, we challenged management's assessment of CCR and SI, taking into account our assessment of the customer's financial position and, where relevant, the risk of stranded assets, and our overall assessment of loan recoverability, the valuation of security, and the impact on the credit allowance. To do this, we used the information on the Company's and Group's loan file, discussed the facts and circumstances of the case with the loan officer, and performed our own assessment of recoverability. Exercising our judgement, our procedures included using our understanding of relevant industries and the macroeconomic environment and comparing data and assumptions used by the Company and Group in recoverability assessments to externally sourced evidence, such as commodity prices, publicly available audited financial statements and comparable external valuations of collateral held. Where relevant we assessed the forecast timing of future cash flows in the context of underlying valuations and approved business plans and challenged key assumptions in the valuations;\n- \uf0b7 Obtaining an understanding of the Company and Group's processes to determine ECL allowances, evaluating the Company and Group's ECL model methodologies against established market practices and criteria in the accounting standards;\n\n246\n\n(\n\nc\n\nontinued)\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\n\n- \uf0b7 Working with our risk consulting specialists, we assessed the accuracy of the Company and Group's ECL model estimates by re-performing, for a sample of loans, the ECL allowance using our independently derived calculation tools and comparing this to the amount recorded by the Company and Group;\n- \uf0b7 Working with our economic specialists, we challenged the Company and Group's forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenarios incorporated in the Company and Group's ECL models. We compared the Company and Group's forecast GDP, unemployment rates, CPI and property price indices to relevant publicly available macro-economic information, and considered other known variables and information obtained through our other audit procedures to identify contradictory indicators;\n- \uf0b7 Testing the implementation of the Company and Group's SICR methodology by re-performing the staging calculation for a sample of loans taking into consideration movements in the CCR from loan origination CCR and comparing our expectation to actual staging applied on an individual account level in the Company and Group's ECL model; and\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the accuracy of the data used in the ECL models by confirming a sample of data fields such as account balance and CCR to relevant source systems.\n\nWe challenged key assumptions in the components of the Company and Group's post-model adjustments to the ECL allowance balance. This included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the requirement for additional allowances considering the Company and Group's ECL model and data deficiencies identified by the Company and Group's ECL model validation processes, particularly in light of the extreme volatility in economic scenarios caused by the current COVID-19 pandemic and government responses;\n- \uf0b7 Evaluating underlying data used in concentration risk and economic cycle allowances by comparing underlying loan portfolio characteristics to recent loss experience, current market conditions and specific risks in the Group's loan portfolios;\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the impacts on the modelled ECL and the requirement for out of model adjustments to account for the expected increase in delinquencies. We also assessed assumptions used to determine whether a SICR event has occurred; and\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the completeness of additional allowance overlays by checking the consistency of risks we identified in the loan portfolios against the Company and Group's assessment.\n\n## SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE:\n\n## GROUP\n\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 ASSET POSITIONS $1,497m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 ASSET POSITIONS $57,116m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 LIABILITY POSITIONS $30m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 LIABILITY POSITIONS $41,343m\n\n## COMPANY\n\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 ASSET POSITIONS $1,190m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 ASSET POSITIONS $55,533m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 LIABILITY POSITIONS $30m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 LIABILITY POSITIONS $39,146m\n\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures of fair values in Note 18 to the Financial Report.\n\n## The Key Audit Matter\n\nThe fair value of the Company and Group's Level 3 and 2 financial instruments is determined by the application of valuation techniques which often involve the exercise of judgement and the use of assumptions and estimates.\n\nThe valuation of Level 3 and level 2 financial instruments held at fair value is considered a Key Audit Matter due to:\n\n- \uf0b7 The high degree of estimation uncertainty and potentially significant range of reasonable outcomes associated with the valuation of financial instruments classified as Level 3 where significant pricing inputs used in the valuation methodology and models are not observable. Level 3 financial instruments represented 0.8% and 0.9% respectively of the Company and Group's financial assets and 0.07% and 0.06% of the Company and Group's financial liabilities carried at fair value; and\n- \uf0b7 The complexity associated with the valuation methodology and models of certain more complex Level 2 financial instruments leading to an increase in subjectivity and estimation uncertainty. Level 2 financial instruments represented 39% and 35% respectively of the Company and Group's financial assets and 88% and 89% of the Company and Group's financial liabilities carried at fair value.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n247",

This involved sourcing independent inputs from market data providers or external sources and using our own valuation models.\n- \uf0b7 In relation to the subjective valuation of Level 3 financial instruments, where appropriate, with our valuation specialists:\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions using comparable data in the market and available alternatives; and\n- \uf0b7 Comparing the Company and Group's valuation methodology to industry practice and the criteria in the accounting standards.\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the financial statements disclosures, including key judgements and assumptions using our understanding obtained from our testing and against the relevant accounting standard requirements.\n\n## CARRYING VALUE OF INVESTMENT IN ASIAN ASSOCIATES (Group $1,929m; Company $Nil)\n\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Notes 26 to the Financial Report.\n\n## The Key Audit Matter\n\nCarrying value of investment in Asian associates (PT Panin and AmBank) is a key audit matter as:\n\n- \uf0b7 The Group's impairment assessment of non-lending assets identified that two of the Group's associate investments (PT Panin and AmBank) had indicators of impairment.\n- \uf0b7 Significant judgement was required by the Group as a result of the business disruption and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, raising estimation uncertainty. These conditions and the uncertainty of their continuation increases the possibility of the investments in the associates being impaired, and the risk of inaccurate forecasts or a significantly wider range of possible outcomes in the cash flow models.\n- \uf0b7 Our evaluation of potential impairment involves critically evaluating the Group's judgement in relation to key forward-looking assumptions for the Group's Asian associates. Instances where the Group's judgement is evaluated include:\n- \uf0b7 Forecast earnings and terminal growth rates - The Group's models are highly sensitive to small changes in these assumptions, reducing available headroom or indicating possible impairment.  This drives additional audit effort specific to their feasibility and consistency of application; and\n- \uf0b7 Discount rates - These are complicated in nature and vary according to the conditions and environment the specific associate investments operate in.\n- \uf0b7 We involved our valuation specialists to supplement our senior team members in assessing this key audit matter.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nWorking with our valuation specialists, our procedures included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Considering the appropriateness of the value in use valuation method applied by the Group to perform their annual test for impairment against the requirements of the accounting standards;\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the integrity of the models used, including the accuracy of the underlying calculation formulas;\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the Group's key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model, such as, discount rates, growth rates, forecast earnings and terminal growth rate by comparing to external observable metrics, historical experience, our knowledge of the markets and current market practice;\n- \uf0b7 Independently developing a discount rate estimate or range considered comparable using publicly available market data for comparable entities, adjusted for factors specific to the Asian associates and the market and industry they operate in;\n- \uf0b7 Comparing the forecast cash flows contained in the models to recent broker consensus reports, reflecting the COVID-19 impacts;\n- \uf0b7 Considering and challenging the Group's assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on cash flows and assumptions as well as its assessment of the likely recovery period;\n- \uf0b7 Considering the sensitivity of the models by varying key assumptions, such as, forecast growth rates, terminal growth rates and discount rates, within a reasonable possible range, including specific analysis of reasonable possible impacts of COVID-19;\n\n248\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\n\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the recoverable amount at the reporting date against the recoverable amount of each investment when it was last impaired to assess if any reversal of previous impairment loss was required; and\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the disclosures in the financial report using our understanding obtained from our testing and against the requirements of the accounting standards.\n\n## PROVISIONS FOR CUSTOMER REMEDIATION (Group $886m; Company $791m)\n\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Notes 22 and 33 to the Financial Report.\n\n## The Key Audit Matter\n\nThe Company and Group have assessed the need to recognise provisions in relation to certain customer remediation activities arising from both internal and external investigations and reviews.\n\nThe provision for customer remediation activities is a key audit matter due to the judgements required by us in assessing the Company and Group's determination of:\n\n- \uf0b7 The completeness of the population of matters requiring remediation;\n- \uf0b7 The existence of a present legal or constructive obligation arising from a past event using the conditions of the event against the criteria in the accounting standards;\n- \uf0b7 Reliable estimates of the amounts which may be paid arising from investigations, including estimates of related costs; and\n- \uf0b7 The potential for legal proceedings, further investigations, and reviews from its regulators leading to a wider range of estimation outcomes for us to consider.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nOur audit procedures for customer remediation provisions included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Obtaining an understanding of the Company and Group's processes and controls for identifying and assessing the potential impact of the investigations into customer remediation activities;\n- \uf0b7 Enquiring with the Company and Group regarding ongoing legal, regulatory and other investigation into remediation activities;\n- \uf0b7 Conducting independent discussions on significant matters with external legal counsel;\n- \uf0b7 Reading the minutes and other relevant documentation of the Company's Board of Directors, Board Committees, various management committees, and attending the Company's Audit and Risk Committee meetings;\n- \uf0b7 Inspecting correspondence with relevant regulatory bodies;\n- \uf0b7 For a sample of individual customer remediation matters, we evaluate the basis for recognition of a provision and associated costs against the requirements of the accounting standards. We did this by obtaining an understanding of the matter, its status and independently assessing these against the recognition requirements of the accounting standard;\n- \uf0b7 For a sample of individual customer remediation matters, testing the valuation and accuracy of the provision by:\n- \uf0b7 Assessing and challenging the method, data and assumptions;\n- \uf0b7 Sample checking data accuracy to underlying systems; and\n- \uf0b7 Performing model integrity checks\n- \uf0b7 Testing completeness by evaluating where exposures may have arisen based upon our knowledge and experience of broader industry matters, the Group's documentation and the current regulatory environment. We also checked the features of these exposures against the criteria defining a provision or a contingency in the accounting standards;\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the appropriateness of the Company and Group's conclusions against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards where estimates were unable to be reliably made for a provision to be recognised; and\n- \uf0b7 Evaluating the related disclosures using our understanding obtained from our testing and against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n249",

Controls over access and changes to IT systems are critical to the recording of financial information and the preparation of a financial report which provides a true and fair view of the Company and Group's financial position and performance.\n\nThe IT systems and controls, as they impact the financial recording and reporting of transactions, is a key audit matter as our audit approach could significantly differ depending on the effective operation of the Company and Group's IT controls. We work with our IT specialists as a core part of our audit team.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nTesting the technology control environment for key IT applications (systems) used in processing significant transactions and recording balances in the general ledger, and testing the automated controls embedded within these systems which link the technology-enabled business processes. Our audit procedures included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the governance and higher-level controls across the IT Environment, including those regarding policy design, review and awareness, and IT Risk Management practices;\n- \uf0b7 Design and operating effectiveness testing of controls across the User Access Management Lifecycle, including how users are on-boarded, reviewed, and removed on a timely basis from critical IT applications and supporting infrastructure. We also examined how privileged roles and functions are managed across each IT Application and the supporting infrastructure;\n- \uf0b7 Design and operating effectiveness testing of controls to enable Change Management including how changes are initiated, documented, approved, tested and authorised prior to migration into the production environment of critical IT Applications. We assessed the appropriateness of users with access to release changes to IT application production environments across the Company and Group;\n- \uf0b7 Design and operating effectiveness testing of controls used by the Company and Group's technology teams to schedule system jobs and monitor system integrity;\n- \uf0b7 Design and operating effectiveness testing of controls related to significant IT application programs delivered per the ANZ Delivery Framework;\n- \uf0b7 Design and operating effectiveness testing of automated business process controls including those relating to enforcing segregation of duties to avoid conflicts from inappropriate role combinations within IT applications. Testing:\n- \uf0b7 Configurations in place to perform calculations, mappings and flagging of financial transactions, and automated reconciliation controls (both between systems and intra-system); and\n- \uf0b7 Data integrity of critical system reporting used by us in our audit to select samples and analyse data used by management to generate financial reporting.\n\n## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nOther Information is both financial and non-financial information in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited's annual reporting which is provided in addition to the Financial Report and the Auditor's Report. The Directors are responsible for the Other Information.\n\nOur opinion on the Financial Report does not cover the Other Information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Financial Report, our responsibility is to read the Other Information. In doing so, we consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with the Financial Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWe are required to report if we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other Information, and based on the work we have performed on the Other Information that we obtained prior to the date of this Auditor's Report, we have nothing to report.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF DIRECTORS FOR THE FINANCIAL REPORT\n\nThe Directors are responsible for:\n\n- \uf0b7 preparing a Financial Report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001\n- \uf0b7 implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a Financial Report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error\n- \uf0b7 assessing the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate. This includes disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n250\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\n\n## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL REPORT\n\nOur objective is:\n\n- \uf0b7 to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and\n- \uf0b7 to issue an Auditor's Report that includes our opinion.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial Report.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1\\_2020.pdf. This description forms part of our Auditor's Report.\n\n## REPORT ON THE REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nIn our opinion, the Remuneration Report of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited for the year ended 30 September 2021, complies with Section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.\n\n## DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with Section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.\n\n## OUR RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nWe have audited the Remuneration Report included in the Directors' report for the year ended 30 September 2021.\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKPMG\n\nMartin McGrath Partner\n\nMelbourne 27 October 2021\n\n251",

The scope of work comprised limited assurance over the material text and data claims as specified in the table below.\n\n| ESG information                             | Page       |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|\n| 2021 performance snapshot                   | 3          |\n| What matters most                           | 9          |\n| Our customers                               | 15 - 23    |\n| Becoming a fairer and more responsible bank | 24 - 25    |\n| Our people                                  | 29 - 33    |\n| Our community                               | 8, 34 - 36 |\n| Improving our approach to Human Rights      | 37         |\n| Our approach to climate change              | 38 - 39    |\n| Five year summary                           | 72         |\n\nThe ANZ 2021 Annual Report and ANZ 2021 Annual Review covers ANZ's global operations for the year ended 30 September 2021 unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## WHAT WAS THE REPORTING CRITERIA USED?\n\nThe ESG Information was prepared in accordance with the Management's Basis of Reporting, which draws upon the Integrated Reporting Framework published by the International Integrated Reporting Council ('the criteria').\n\n## WHAT WAS THE BASIS FOR KPMG'S CONCLUSION?\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Standard). In accordance with the Standard we have:\n\n- \u00b7 Used our professional judgement to plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance that we are not aware of any material misstatements in the ESG Information, whether due to fraud or error;\n- \u00b7 Considered relevant internal controls when designing our assurance procedures, however we do not express a conclusion on their effectiveness; and\n- \u00b7 Ensured that the engagement team possess the appropriate knowledge, skills and professional competencies.\n\n## WHAT DID KPMG DO TO SUPPORT THE SCOPE OF WORK - OUR PROCEDURES\n\nOur limited assurance conclusion is based on the evidence obtained from performing the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Enquiries of relevant management to understand ANZ's process for determining material ESG issues;\n- \u00b7 Interviews with relevant management concerning ANZ's ESG framework and policies for material ESG issues, and the implementation of these across the business;\n- \u00b7 Interviews with relevant staff responsible for developing the content (text and data) within the ESG Information to understand the approach for management, monitoring, collation and reporting of such information and the accuracy, completeness and existence of reported text and data;\n- \u00b7 Undertaking analytical review procedures to support the reasonableness of the data;\n- \u00b7 Identifying and testing assumptions supporting the calculations;\n- \u00b7 Comparing text and data (on a sample basis) presented to underlying sources;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the ANZ 2021 Annual Report and ANZ 2021 Annual Review in their entirety for consistency with the ESG Information; and\n- \u00b7 Reviewing other ANZ reporting including the ESG Supplement in its entirety to ensure it is consistent with our knowledge obtained through our assurance engagement.\n\n## WHAT IS LIMITED ASSURANCE AND MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT?\n\nA limited assurance engagement is restricted primarily to enquiries and analytical procedures. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The Standard requires our report to be worded around what we have not found, rather than what we have found.\n\nMisstatements, including omissions, are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence relevant decisions of the Directors of ANZ.\n\n## ANZ is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 Determining that the criteria is appropriate to meet their needs;\n- \u00b7 Preparing and presenting the ESG Information in accordance with the criteria; and\n- \u00b7 Establishing internal controls that enable the preparation and presentation of the ESG Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KPMG\n\n27 October 2021\n\n## Adrian King |  Partner\n\nMelbourne 27 October 2021\n\nKPMG, an Australian partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

The term 'AASB' is commonly used when identifying AASs issued by the AASB. In doing so, the term is used together with the AAS number.\n- ADI Authorised Deposit-taking Institution.\n- APRA Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\n- APS ADI Prudential Standard.\n- BCBS Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise coins, notes, money at call, balances held with central banks, liquid settlement balances (readily convertible to known amounts of cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) in less than three months.\n\nCash profit is an additional measure of profit which is prepared on a basis other than in accordance with accounting standards. Cash profit represents ANZ's preferred measure of the result of the core business activities of the Group, enabling readers to assess Group and Divisional performance against prior periods and against peer institutions. To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes noncore items from statutory profit as noted below. These items are calculated consistently period on period so as not to discriminate between positive and negative adjustments.\n\nGains and losses are adjusted where they are significant, or have the potential to be significant in any one period, and fall into one of three categories:\n\n- 1.  gains or losses included in earnings arising from changes in tax, legal or accounting legislation or other non-core items not associated with the core operations of the Group;\n- 2.  economic hedging impacts and similar accounting items that represent timing differences that will reverse through earnings in the future; and\n- 3.  accounting reclassifications between individual line items that do not impact reported results, such as credit risk on impaired derivatives.\n\nCash profit is not a measure of cash flow or profit determined on a cash accounting basis.\n\n## Collectively assessed allowance for expected credit loss\n\nrepresents the Expected Credit Loss (ECL), which incorporates forward-looking information and does not require an actual loss event to have occurred for a credit loss provision to be recognised.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness which was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. COVID-19 was characterised as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020.\n\nCovered bonds are bonds issued by an ADI to external investors secured against a pool of the ADI's assets (the cover pool) assigned to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. The primary assets forming the cover pool are mortgage loans. The mortgages remain\n\non the issuer's balance sheet. The covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool assets. The mortgages included in the cover pool cannot be otherwise pledged or disposed of but may be repurchased and substituted in order to maintain the credit quality of the pool. The Group issues covered bonds as part of its funding activities.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from the failure of ANZ's customers and counterparties to honour or perform fully the terms of a loan or contract.\n\nCredit risk weighted assets (CRWA) represent assets which are weighted for credit risk according to a set formula as prescribed in APS 112/113.\n\nCustomer deposits represent term deposits, other deposits bearing interest, deposits not bearing interest and borrowing corporations' debt excluding securitisation deposits.\n\nCustomer remediation includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation outcomes.\n\nDerivative credit valuation adjustment (CVA) Over the life of a derivative instrument, ANZ uses a model to adjust fair value to take into account the impact of counterparty credit quality. The methodology calculates the present value of expected losses over the life of the financial instrument as a function of probability of default, loss given default, expected credit risk exposure and an asset correlation factor. Impaired derivatives are also subject to a CVA.\n\nDividend payout ratio is the total ordinary dividend payment divided by profit attributable to shareholders of the Company.\n\nFair value is an amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm's length transaction.\n\nFunding for Lending Programme (FLP) refers to three-year funding announced by the RBNZ in November 2020 and offered to New Zealand banks, which aimed to lower the cost of borrowing for New Zealand businesses and households.\n\nGross loans and advances (GLA) is made up of loans and advances, capitalised brokerage and other origination costs less unearned income.\n\nGroup is Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (the Company) and the entities it controlled at the year end and from time to time during the financial year (together, the Group).\n\n- IFRS International Financial Reporting Standards.\n\nImpaired assets are those financial assets where doubt exists as to whether the full contractual amount will be received in a timely manner, or where concessional terms have been provided because of the financial difficulties of the customer. Financial assets are impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of a loss event that occurred prior to the reporting date, and that loss event has had an impact, which can be reliably estimated, on the expected future cash flows of the individual asset or portfolio of assets.",

The risk generally arises from:\n\n- 1.  Repricing and yield curve risk - the risk to earnings or market value as a result of changes in the overall level of interest rates and/or the relativity of these rates across the yield curve;\n- 2.  Basis risk - the risk to earnings or market value arising from volatility in the interest margin applicable to banking book items; and\n- 3.  Optionality risk - the risk to earnings or market value arising from the existence of stand-alone or embedded options in banking book items.\n\nInternationally comparable ratios are ANZ's interpretation of the regulations documented in the Basel Committee publications; 'Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems' (June 2011) and 'International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards' (June 2006). They also include differences identified in APRA's information paper entitled International Capital Comparison Study (13 July 2015).\n\nLevel 1 in the context of APRA supervision, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited consolidated with certain approved subsidiaries.\n\nLevel 2 in the context of APRA supervision, the consolidated ANZ Group excluding associates, insurance and funds management entities, commercial non-financial entities and certain securitisation vehicles.\n\nNet interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets.\n\nNet loans and advances represent gross loans and advances less allowance for expected credit losses.\n\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is the ratio of the amount of available stable funding (ASF) to the amount of required stable funding (RSF) defined by APRA. The amount of ASF is the portion of an ADI capital and liabilities expected to be a reliable source of funds over a one year time horizon. The amount of RSF is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of an ADI's assets and off-balance sheet activities. ADIs must maintain an NSFR of at least 100%.\n\nNet tangible assets equal share capital and reserves attributable to shareholders of the Company less unamortised intangible assets (including goodwill and software).\n\n- RBA Reserve Bank of Australia, Australia's central bank.\n\nRBNZ Reserve Bank of New Zealand, New Zealand's central bank.\n\nRegulatory deposits are mandatory reserve deposits lodged with local central banks in accordance with statutory requirements.\n\nRestructured items comprise facilities in which the original contractual terms have been modified for reasons related to the financial difficulties of the customer. Restructuring may consist of reduction of interest, principal or other payments legally due, or an extension in maturity materially beyond those typically offered to new facilities with similar risk.\n\nReturn on average assets is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average total assets.\n\nReturn on average ordinary shareholders' equity is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average ordinary shareholders' equity.\n\nRisk weighted assets (RWA) are risk weighted according to each asset's inherent potential for default and what the likely losses would be in the case of default. In the case of non-asset backed risks (i.e. market and operational risk), RWA is determined by multiplying the capital requirements for those risks by 12.5.\n\nSettlement balances owed to/by ANZ represent financial assets and/or liabilities which are in the course of being settled. These may include trade dated assets and liabilities, vostro accounts and securities settlement accounts.\n\nTerm Funding Facility (TFF) refers to three-year funding announced by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on 19 March 2020 and offered to ADIs in order to support lending to Australian businesses at low cost.\n\nTerm Lending Facility (TLF) refers to three to five-year funding offered by the RBNZ between May 2020 and July 2021 to promote lending to New Zealand businesses.\n\n186 years old and 70 years as ANZ\n\n70 years of ANZ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1835\n\nBank of Australasia was an Australian Bank in operation from 1835-1951.
