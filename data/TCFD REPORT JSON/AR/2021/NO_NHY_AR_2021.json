Our purpose is to create more viable societies by developing natural resources into products and solutions in innovative and efficient ways.\n\nHydro is present throughout the aluminium value chain, from energy to bauxite mining and alumina refining, primary aluminium, aluminium extrusions and aluminium recycling.\n\nHydro Energy is a major renewables producer, market operator and developer of businesses for the energy transition. Hydro Bauxite & Alumina represents the first two links of the aluminium value chain through bauxite and alumina refining. Hydro Aluminium Metal is a leading supplier of extrusion ingots, sheet ingots, foundry alloys, wire rods and high-purity aluminium with a global production network. Hydro Extrusions delivers tailored aluminium components and solutions to more than 30,000 customers around the world.\n\nDuring 2021, Hydro continued to deliver on its 2025 strategy, including further strengthening its low-carbon aluminium position as well as maturing business opportunities within new energy solutions. Hydro has long been recognized as a leader in sustainability, and the new sustainability ambitions on climate, environment and social responsibility launched in December 2021 will be a key driver for Hydro's competitive positioning going forward.\n\nHydro has the ambition of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 or earlier and is pursuing three decarbonization paths to reduce the carbon footprint of aluminium to net zero. Hydro will have the first commercial volumes of near-zero carbon product (defined as less than 0.5kg CO2 per kg aluminium) available in 2022 based on using 100 percent post-consumer scrap.\n\nWe have more than a century of experience and expertise, and we want to continue to lead the way in creating industries that matter.",

The Covid-19 pandemic has been distressful for our employees all over the world.\n\nSadly, we are mourning the loss of 35 good Hydro colleagues and contractors due to Covid-19 during the past two years. We commend the efforts of our plant managers, unions and all our employees that have been protecting the workplaces from the virus and keeping the wheels turning, and for supporting the local communities in which we operate.\n\nSafe operations are our first priority. There were no fatalities, nor life-changing injuries, in 2021. We have emphasized high-risk incidents during 2021 and we are pleased that the number of high-risk incidents declined by almost 14 percent from the year before. However, the total number of recordable injuries per million hours worked increased to 3.3 in 2021, up from 2.7 in 2020. The ultimate target is an injury-free work environment and to make sure that every employee returns home from work safely.\n\n## Profitability and sustainability\n\nOver the past two years we have worked with determination to implement our agenda Lifting profitability, Driving sustainability. We are impressed with our organization's ability to continuously focus on new improvement initiatives, even in times with strong markets. Through 2021 we have delivered NOK 6.3 billion of the total original improvement program of 7.4 billion.\n\nWith this momentum, we have now stretched the overall program to NOK 8.5 billion to be delivered by 2025.\n\nOne important lever for the strong performance in 2021 is that Alunorte and Paragominas in Brazil have been operating at full capacity utilization throughout the whole year, which is a result of the focus on improved asset integrity and increased robustness in both plants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Letter to stakeholders\n\nSustainable value creation - building industries that matter\n\nWe are pleased to report Hydro's strongest financial results since becoming a focused aluminium and energy company in 2007, in a year that was otherwise defined by volatility and uncertainty. We attribute the performance to strong sales in historically strong aluminum markets and firm progress on our improvement agenda - but first and foremost we take great pride in our 31,000 employees who managed to maintain solid performance and focus during a global health crisis.\n\nThe aluminium market has been strong during 2021, with global demand outpacing supply growth, reducing inventories and supporting LME prices above USD 3,000 per tonne. Along with the firm economic recovery, the business environment has been heavily impacted by the pandemic, energy shock and supply chain disruptions - and increasing expectations on climate and sustainability from customers, markets and regulators.\n\nWe expect a healthy demand growth for aluminium of around 4 percent annually this decade. As a building block of modern societies, aluminum plays an important role in the transition towards a carbon-free economy. Lightweight, durable and infinitely recyclable, aluminium is a catalyst for reducing emissions in several sectors of the economy. We experience increasing interest and demand for our low-carbon aluminum in the market. This gives confidence that our efforts until now, combined with our strengthened climate ambitions announced at our Capital Markets Day in December last year, build a strong foundation for long-term value creation.\n\nHowever, as a company we are not only defined by our climate footprint. Sustainability for Hydro goes beyond climate and the environment. Issues such as health, education and social development in the societies in which we operate will be even more important going forward as a basis for how we will deliver long-term value for our shareholders and society at large. This reflects Hydro's 116-year history and purpose, and how the success of Hydro has been closely and mutually interlinked with the societies we are a part of.",

One pathway is to use carbon capture and storage technology to produce carbon-free primary aluminium. A second pathway is our proprietary carbon-free electrolysis technology called HalZero. This technology will keep the CO2 in a closed loop and reuse it as a source of carbon in the electrolysis process. We are very enthusiastic about the prospects of both routes to carbon-free primary aluminium.\n\nA faster pathway to carbon-free aluminium is more recycling of post-consumer aluminium scrap. Our ambition is to deliver the first commercial volumes of near-zero carbon aluminium already in 2022, based on 100 percent recycled postconsumer scrap. Our network of recyclers and their proximity to scrap suppliers and customers are key competitive advantages to enable and capture value from more circular business models.\n\nThe second pillar of our strategy is to grow and diversify in new energy solutions. Access to abundant renewable energy is crucial to make our own aluminium value chain carbon free and for the world to drive the green transition and reach its climate targets. In 2021, we continued to execute on our strategy to grow in new energy areas that will support decarbonization and develop profitable businesses for Hydro. These areas include renewable energy, batteries and hydrogen.\n\nIn executing our strategy, people are at the heart of our success. We depend on attracting and retaining the best people to lead the way. Leadership to develop people, drive change and deliver results is crucial to fostering our Hydro culture and in achieving the business strategy. We aim to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrong demand, higher prices, robust operations with higher volumes and improved margins, in addition to determined improvement efforts, yielded a strong EBITDA result of 28 BNOK in 2021. We have lifted profitability across all our business areas, and we delivered a return on capital employed of 18.6 percent in 2021, which is well above our target of 10 percent over the cycle. In addition, Hydro ended 2021with a net cash position of NOK 3.2 billion, from a net debt position of NOK 7.8 billion the previous year.\n\nHaving a clear profitability agenda has guided our prioritization in terms of portfolio development and capital allocation. We have worked within a strict capital allocation regime and allocated return-seeking funds where returns are highest. To support this, we concluded the strategic review and subsequent divestment of Hydro Rolling in 2021, providing capital for further profitable growth.\n\nMoreover, we are satisfied that we have made the investment decision to switch fuel oil with natural gas at Alunorte which is a major enabler to reach our 30 percent CO2 target by 2030.\n\n## Driving the green transition\n\nIn 2021, we sold three times the volume of our low-carbon brands Hydro REDUXA and Hydro CIRCAL compared to the year before. It strengthens our belief that our investments in sustainability will not only improve our impact on climate and the environment, but also demonstrates that aluminium is part of the solution by lowering the footprint of our customers' products. Increased sales of our greener products will contribute to our profitability going forward in a world that is increasingly turning words into action in its response to climate change.\n\nThe specific pull we experience in the market for the lowcarbon aluminium products comes as a consequence of the decarbonization, electrification and circularity trends in sectors like automotive, building and construction, as well as renewable energy infrastructure.\n\nThe green transition will be challenging and require tremendous investments on a global scale. On the other hand, the green transition will also represent a lot of opportunities. We are determined to seize opportunities where Hydro's capabilities match global megatrends, enabling our company to take a leading position in the green transition.",

We believe that diverse and inclusive teams lead to higher levels of innovation, a learning culture, better customer understanding and cultural awareness, as well as higher financial results. It also makes a better place to work.\n\n## Industries that matter\n\nClimate, environment and social responsibility are deeply interconnected. Responsible business is a prerequisite for long-term value creation through access to new markets, lower cost of capital and access to best talent. Sustainability is also about creating value to society by improving lives and livelihoods where we operate.\n\nOur environmental ambition emphasizes protecting biodiversity and reducing our environmental footprint, with a particular focus on eliminating landfilling of waste in the long term. A significant contribution here, is our pioneer tailings dry backfill method at our Paragominas bauxite mine in Brazil, which will eliminate the need to establish new tailings dams\n\nWe believe that we can only be successful as a business if the societies where we operate are thriving. The pandemic has shed light on how rising inequality among people and regions amplifies the vulnerabilities and risks in today's interconnected, yet fragmented world. We want to do our part, and are progressing on by promoting education, just transition and a responsible supply chain.\n\nHydro is engaging with a range of international organizations, working to improve industry standards for human rights, transparency and responsible production. Hydro is also a signatory to the UN Global Compact and a committed member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI).\n\nHydro remains committed to driving long-term value and paying attractive dividends to our shareholders. We prioritize maintaining our investment-grade rating, and we are a stable dividend stock. We aim to pay out a minimum of 50 percent of adjusted net income over the cycle, with a floor of 1.25 NOK per share. In light of the strong financial performance last year, and reflecting our robust balance sheet, the Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of NOK 5.4 per share, equal to 80 percent of adjusted net income for 2021.",

Hydro continues to grow stronger in terms of profitability and sustainability, thereby increasing long-term value for our stakeholders and improving lives and livelihoods where we operate. Our main priority remains providing a healthy and safe work environment for our workers.\n\nHydro's 2025 strategy aims to strengthen our position in lowcarbon aluminium and explore growth opportunities in new energy. The strategy leverages our competitive advantages to seize opportunities within the current megatrends and the market's growing demand for low-carbon and renewable aluminium. Hydro has long been recognized as a leader in sustainability, and the new sustainability ambitions launched at Capital Markets Day 2021 will be key for the company's competitive positioning going forward.\n\nStrong demand driven by global recovery and fiscal stimulus positively impacted Hydro's financial performance in 2021. However, the year was also affected by uncertainty from the ongoing pandemic, high energy prices, supply chain constraints, and higher raw material prices. These factors helped drive aluminium prices up to record levels in 2021, with LME prices above USD 3,000 per mt. Premiums were also at record-high levels, indicating a tight physical market.\n\nHydro lifted profitability across all business areas and achieved its full-year improvement program target by the third quarter of 2021. The completion of the restart of Line B at the primary aluminium plant in Husnes, Norway, was important to meet the increased market demand. The strategic review and\n\nAdjusted RoaCE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n18.6%\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n28\n\ndivestment of Hydro Rolling was completed in June, releasing capital that will be allocated to profitable growth opportunities in Recycling and Extrusions, and to further strengthening the balance sheet. In addition, the strong results contributed to greater cash generation in 2021. Hydro's profitability and sustainability agenda continues to guide capital allocation.\n\n## Green transition requiring low-carbon aluminium and renewable energy\n\nThe demand for semi-fabricated aluminium products outside China is estimated to rise 4 percent annually until 2030, with similar overall growth rates in key sectors like automotive and building and construction. Recycled aluminium production is expected to grow 5 percent annually until 2030 and become a larger share of total aluminium production.\n\nAluminium with a lower carbon footprint is seen as an important enabler for the green transition. Since the launch of our low-carbon products Hydro CIRCAL and Hydro REDUXA, the market has embraced low-carbon aluminium, as it enables our customers to meet their CO2 abatement goals.\n\nHydro's customers across many sectors, including automotive, packaging, building and construction and electronics, are setting ambitious decarbonization targets. Low-carbon and recycled aluminium are key drivers toward reducing emissions in the supply chain for these industries.\n\nHydro expects a differentiation of the market, where demand for low-carbon and renewable aluminium will outpace the demand for aluminium from non-renewable energy sources. By 2030, the main demand segments are expected to require between 20 and 45 percent greener aluminium, with automotive customers at the top of that range.\n\nShareholder payout\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5.4\n\nHydro CIRCAL production volumes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n38\n\n## Semi-fabricated products demand\n\nMillion tonnes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Recycled aluminum production\n\nMillion tonnes\n\n<!-- image -->",

Hydro Extrusions continued to restructure their portfolio and implemented cost savings and productivity programs to improve profitability.\n\nRevenue growth through commercial activities is an important part of mid to long-term value creation, especially in the downstream divisions, namely Metal Markets and Extrusions. These are market-driven initiatives where Hydro will leverage its solutions and partnerships to increase market shares in key segments, and to increase margins. Hydro Extrusions\n\nWith renewables, energy efficiency and electrification, we can reduce 70 percent of global emissions. Renewable hydrogen can contribute toward the remaining 30 percent of emissions from hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy industry and the maritime sector.\n\n## Strengthen position in low-carbon aluminium\n\nOur 2025 strategy aims to strengthen Hydro's position in low-carbon aluminium. Cost reductions and operational excellence remain priorities across the business areas and are reflected in the improvement program. Hydro's operations in Bauxite & Alumina and Aluminium Metal are both in the first quartile of their respective cost curves. In 2021, Alunorte\n\n## Net-zero products: Market-paced approach\n\nCapitalize on market demand through circularity while decarbonizing primary value chain\n\n*CCS: Carbon capture and storage/DAC: Direct air capture\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nis positioned for further growth through key investments. The commercial potential also utilizes Hydro's sustainability position to shape demand for our greener product portfolio. Over the past year, Hydro has seen increased demand for its low-carbon brand products Hydro CIRCAL and Hydro REDUXA, and expects to double sales of these products by 2025.\n\nIn addition to incremental growth in Extrusions and increasing greener products sales, growth in recycling is a strategic priority for Hydro. In 2020, Hydro set a strategic ambition to double its recycling of post-consumer scrap, providing EBTIDA uplift of NOK 0.7 billion to NOK 1.1 billion. Key investments into additional post-consumer scrap recycling capacity of 85,000 tonnes were announced in 2021, increasing total casthouse production by 305,000 tonnes. Volumes from some of these projects are expected already in 2022.\n\n## Hydro's decarbonization path\n\nIn 2021, Hydro launched a new climate ambition, reaffirming the target of cutting our own carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030 and setting new ambitions of becoming net zero in terms of direct and indirect emissions from power generation (Scope 1 and 2) by 2050 or earlier.\n\nHydro's roadmap to net-zero emissions by 2050 for the upstream aluminium business includes planned activities to replace fuel oil with natural gas and electrify boilers at the Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil, where we also plan to pilot using hydrogen for calcination. Hydro made a final build decision to invest BRL 1.3 billion in the project to replace fuel oil with natural gas at Alunorte.\n\nAchieving near-zero emissions throughout the value chain also requires that our portfolio of primary aluminium plants has access to a higher share of renewable energy and that renewable hydrogen, electricity, or biogas is available for use in the casthouses and recyclers.\n\nHydro is pursuing three technology pathways toward nearzero aluminium. To secure the value of existing primary aluminium plants, Hydro is developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) solutions that can be retrofitted into the existing plants. Hydro has evaluated more than 50 CCS technologies and is planning to test and pilot the most promising, up to industrial scale by 2030. The most likely outcome will be a combination of off-gas capture and direct air capture.",

Hydro Rein's ambition is to supply significant amount of Hydro's energy needs, while also serving customers outside the company. In May 2021, Hydro Rein signed a collaboration agreement with Equinor and RWE Renewables regarding a joint application for the upcoming South North Sea 2 offshore wind licensing round in Norway. In June 2021, Hydro Rein invested in the 260 MW Stor-Sk\u00e4lsj\u00f6n project in Sweden, together with Swedish wind power developer Eolus. The project is expected to commence construction in the summer of 2022. In December 2021, Hydro Rein entered into an agreement with Eolus to acquire a 50 percent interest in nine early stage, wind power projects in Southern Sweden, with a combined potential capacity of up to 672 MW. In Brasil, Hydro Rein matured several large-scale, late-stage wind and solar opportunities, with the intention to sign one or more acquisitions in the first half of 2022. Hydro is contemplating a listing of the shares of Hydro Rein by way of an initial public offering in 2022.\n\n## Hydro Havrand\n\nHydro's green hydrogen unit, Hydro Havrand, was established in 2021. This unit will develop green hydrogen based on renewable energy to cut emissions in hard-toabate sectors. Hydro Havrand leverages Hydro's 4 GW potential offtake, industrial competence and energy expertise as a springboard to decarbonize industrial processes. The business unit will offer competitive hydrogen to 3rd party industries as well as evolving hydrogen markets such as heavy duty trucking and maritime. Hydro Havrand is now maturing its portfolio and is positioning to capture global opportunities. During 2021, the unit has developed a portfolio of projects. The portfolio includes Hydro's aluminium plant in \u00c5rdal, Norway, Speira's (former Hydro Rolled Products) plant in Holmestrand and at the extrusion facility in Vetlanda, Sweden, all of which hold potential for 3rd party hydrogen offtake. Important capabilities to switch fuel consumption from carbon-based fuels to hydrogen are being developed to safely introduce hydrogen into industrial processes.\n\n## Batteries\n\nHydro's Batteries unit continues to build a sustainable and competitive battery business. During 2021, Hydro's 50/50 joint venture Hydrovolt built Europe's first industry scale sorting and scaling pilot for sustainable recycling of EV\n\nbatteries. Hydrovolt is on track to commence operation in first quarter of 2022. The pilot's capacity is being filled fast, and Hydrovolt is preparing further expansions. Hydro increased its holding in the global marine battery systems leader Corvus and is now largest owner. Batteries explored several opportunities of varying size and maturity and built a strong pipeline of investment opportunities within recycling, cell and pack solutions, and battery anode materials. Hydro's battery portfolio value developed favorably in 2021. Further strengthening of the portfolio is targeted for 2022 in order to create a solid platform for industrial growth in the emerging European battery industry.\n\nAnother pathway more suited for greenfield aluminium plants is Hydro's proprietary HalZero technology. This technology converts alumina to aluminium chloride prior to electrolysis in a process where chlorine and carbon are kept in closed loops, resulting in a fully decarbonized process. Hydro has been working on lab-scale development of this technology for five years and has now developed a roadmap to bring this to an industrial scale before 2030.\n\nA third and faster pathway to zero-carbon aluminium is by recycling more post-consumer scrap. Using only postconsumer scrap, we will be able to produce a near-zero carbon product at a competitive cost. This will be made possible by Hydro's patented aluminium sorting technology and alloying expertise, in combination with replacing natural gas with renewable hydrogen or electrical heating at recyclers and casthouses. Near-zero carbon aluminium should be commercially available in small volumes during 2022.\n\n## Environment and social ambitions\n\nHydro is setting new ambitions in the areas of environment and social responsibility. Within environment, this includes protecting biodiversity and reducing the environmental footprint. For biodiversity, Hydro has set an ambition to achieve no net loss of biodiversity for all new projects, in addition to the existing 1:1 rehabilitation target for our mining operations. With regard to waste, we will continue to follow our existing 2030 targets for increased utilization of bauxite residue and reduced landfilling of spent pot lining. We will also aim to eliminate the need for new permanent bauxite residue storage by 2050 and to eliminate landfilling of all other recoverable waste by 2040.\n\nHydro's social ambition is to improve the lives and livelihoods of people wherever we operate. We have supplemented the existing target of empowering 500,000 people with education and skills development by 2030 with business-specific targets to support a just transition, and to ensure responsible business practices throughout Hydro's supply chain, providing traceability and transparency of key sustainability data for our products.\n\n## Growth in new energy\n\nIn 2021, Hydro continued to execute on its strategy to grow in new energy areas that can support the decarbonization of high-emitting industries. These areas include renewable energy, batteries and green hydrogen.",

Hydro's view is that this metric illustrates the return generated by operational activities before financing activities and shareholder service. Performance should be viewed over several years, due to industry cyclicality as well as other factors impacting balance sheet figures. The RoaCE target should be compared to our long-term nominal cost of capital of 9 percent. Cost of capital and RoaCE targets\n\nare differentiated for each business area, with the ambition to achieve a RoaCE above the respective cost of capital. The nominal long-term cost of capital for our business areas reflects the risk and volatility of earnings and cash flows in the underlying business activities.\n\nHydro's main efforts to realize targeted capital returns are summarized in the full value creation framework. The framework includes three levers all underpinned by Hydro's sustainability agenda: the improvement program, commercial ambitions, and strategic growth initiatives.\n\nOperational excellence is key when it comes to maximizing value creation from current assets; and relies on the culture\n\n## Full value creation potential\n\n## Commercial initiatives\n\n## Pursuing market and customerdriven growth opportunities\n\n- \u00b7  Low-carbon and circular product offerings\n- \u00b7  Margins and portfolio mix\n- \u00b7  Customer-driven incremental growth\n\nInitiatives within the current business portfolio, dependent on market conditions\n\nSUSTAINABILITY AGENDA\n\n## Financial ambitions\n\n## Lifting cash flow, delivering higher returns\n\nHydro's financial ambition is to lift cash flows and generate capital and shareholder returns through a combination of longer-term financial priorities supported by near-term financial targets. At the same time, Hydro aims to differentiate through its strong sustainability position and to develop businesses where megatrends match Hydro's capabilities.\n\nSupported by increasing interest from regulators, customers and financial markets, Hydro firmly believes that leading in sustainability is a strong foundation for long-term license to operate and a key driver for long-term profitability. By emphasizing climate, environment, integrity and social responsibility, as well as by developing greener business and product offerings, Hydro will reduce risks and create new profitable opportunities.\n\nHydro has developed a framework that establishes clear priorities for the use of cash to help guide the company's capital allocation decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improvement program\n\n## Maximizing value creation from current assets/operations\n\n- \u00b7  Commercial excellence in daily operations\n- \u00b7  Operational excellence\n- \u00b7  Raw material efficiency, procurement\n- \u00b7  Fixed cost optimization\n- \u00b7  Volume creep and capacity utilization\n\nInitiatives focused on influenceable parameters and continuous improvement\n\n## Growth and strategic initiatives\n\n## Major changes in business portfolio and/or stategic direction\n\n- \u00b7  Organic (greenfield) or inorganic growth\n- \u00b7  Entering new business segments/industries\n- \u00b7  Portfolio review and divestments/closures\n- \u00b7  Change in ownership structure\n\nInitiatives outside the current business portfolio or representing a significant strategic move",

A sizeable share of improvements comes from the Hydro-wide procurement initiative addressing measures within supplier management, demand and specification management, and process management across the company.\n\nThe commercial ambitions focus on market and customerdriven growth opportunities within the current portfolio. In 2021, Hydro has raised its  commercial ambition by 1 BNOK to 2.5 BNOK by 2025. Execution and success rely on market support and customer demand and are therefore less certain. The commercial initiatives include new product development in Aluminium Metal; market share gain and gross margin improvement in Extrusions through optimized product mix, increased sales of green products and higher production capacity; as well as commercial activities in Bauxite & Alumina to achieve higher premiums on alumina and hydrate. Hydro's greener product offerings - Hydro CIRCAL and Hydro REDUXA - are an important driver of commercial value and account for approximately 20 percent of the total ambition by 2025.\n\nGrowth initiatives represent larger changes in the business portfolio. Hydro's strategy is to diversify and grow within the areas of recycling, renewable energy and batteries (as described above). These areas are supported by the current megatrends as well as by Hydro's core industrial expertise.\n\n## Financial strength and flexibility\n\nHydro's main strategy for mitigating risk related to volatility in cash flow is to maintain a strong balance sheet, investment grade credit rating and strong liquidity, while at the same time reducing the average cost position of production assets and allocating capital in line with our strategic ambitions. Hydro considers this crucial to navigate the industry cycles, to be able to invest during cyclical downturns, and to be able to access the capital markets at attractive terms. In certain circumstances, derivatives may be used to mitigate financial risk in the business area or group levels.\n\nCurrently, Hydro has a BBB rating with S&P Global and a Baa3 rating with Moody's, both with a stable outlook.\n\nHydro uses the ratio Adjusted net (cash) debt to adjusted EBITDA as the key indicator of balance sheet strength and the ability to absorb volatility in the markets. The target is to stay below two times during the cycle, which supports our target to maintain an investment grade credit rating. Given historical industry cyclicality, this means that the ratio will be well below two times in the stronger parts of the cycle, to be able to absorb the impact from industry cycle downturns and maintain financial flexibility in periods of adverse market\n\nof continuous improvement and good control over the influenceable parameters. These initiatives are developed consistently throughout the cycle regardless of the macro and market situation. In 2021, Hydro further increased its improvement program target by NOK 1.1 billion to NOK 8.5 billion by 2025.\n\nThe Bauxite & Alumina improvement program mainly focuses on ramping up production at Alunorte and Paragominas to full capacity. This accounts for NOK 2.7 billion out of the total Hydro improvement target, and was achieved during 2021. Other elements include optimization of the energy mix and consumption as well as fixed cost reductions.\n\nAluminium Metal target improvements across many categories. These include the restart of the Husnes Line-B smelter and volume ramp-up at Albras in Brazil, debottlenecking, cost reduction including overhead costs, as well as digitalization of processes through soft sensor technology, advanced analytics, and automation.\n\nExtrusions has launched an extensive cost improvement program that includes SG&A cost reductions, portfolio reviews and restructuring as well as procurement initiatives. Operational excellence and efficiency improvements are reflected in the Extrusions Business System (EBS) initiative being implemented throughout the entire Extrusions organization.\n\n## 2025 accumulated improvement\n\n## 2025 accumulated improvement potential by year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The plan is to base the Hydro Rein and Hydro Havrand initiatives primarily on external equity, either through public listing or through private placement, and with limited capital contribution from Hydro.\n\nHydro continues to optimize net operating capital levels both in absolute terms and in days of revenue, with due consideration given to the balance between capital release and supply chain robustness.\n\n## Robust shareholder payout\n\nLong-term returns to shareholders should reflect the value created by Hydro, and consist of dividends and share price development. Hydro aims to provide its shareholders with a predictable dividend and a competitive return compared with alternative investments in similar companies. Hydro's ambition is to pay out a minimum of 50 percent of adjusted net income to majority shareholders over the cycle,\n\nwith a dividend floor of NOK 1.25 per share. Hydro may evaluate share buybacks and additional dividends with due consideration given to alternative investment opportunities, and our financial situation and earnings outlook.\n\n## Sustainability position\n\nTo benefit from the lower cost of capital enabled by sustainability performance, we are continuing to develop our financing framework. The framework will be directly linked to our medium to long-term sustainability strategy and will provide an advantage in access to and cost of capital.\n\nThe EU taxonomy is a welcome approach to providing comparable financial data on green activities in the sector. Hydro's activities are partly covered by this, such as the manufacturing of primary aluminium, secondary aluminium, recycling, and renewable power generation. More information is available in the Appendices.\n\n## Cost of capital differentiated based on risk profiles\n\nStrategic modes for business areas reflect global megatrends and high-return opportunities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexpected volatility\n\n10-11% Reflecting higher capital intensity and Sustain and improveSustain and improve\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSelective growth\n\nSelective growthReflecting higher capital intensity and expected volatility\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLower required capital, more stable margins\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSelective growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRecycling business with lower required capital, more stable margins\n\n6-7%\n\nStable cash flows from hydropower assets in Norway\n\n- * Energy Classic: Hydro power and commercial activities in Energy, excluding new growth areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconditions. Historically, cash generation has been the limiting factor for Hydro's credit rating. Our primary response has been to maintain a strong balance sheet. Hydro continues to evaluate the optimal capital structure and takes this into account when proposing shareholder distribution.\n\nA strong liquidity position is considered critical to support operations and investments through the industry cycle. In addition to a robust cash position, our liquidity is supported by a USD 1.6 billion revolving credit facility that expires in 2026. The margin on the facility is linked to Hydro's CO2 emission reduction target, thereby linking financing costs to the progress on Hydro's main climate target and highlighting the important connection between sustainability and profitability. Additional sources of liquidity include overdraft facilities and short-term liquidity lines.\n\nFor further details, see Note 7.1 Capital management to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nClear principles for capital allocation\n\nHydro has clear priorities and guidelines for capital allocation. This is critical to deliver on the company's strategic direction and to support long-term financial performance. Investments are evaluated using different scenarios for macro and market development to support robustness in investment decisions. Hydro also uses differentiated cost of capital rates to reflect the underlying risk and exposures in each project.\n\nHydro divides capital expenditures into three categories: sustaining, return-seeking, and growth. The strategy is to allocate more growth and return-seeking capital to the areas with higher value generation potential, both from a profitability and sustainability perspective. Historic returns on investments, earnings volatility, differentiation potential and improved sustainability position play key roles in the allocation process.\n\nAll the business areas have been grouped into different strategic modes. The focus in Bauxite & Alumina and Aluminium Metal is to sustain and improve the current asset base, while Extrusions and Energy are in selective growth mode. Business activities in recycling, renewables and batteries have been identified as strategic growth areas.",

We mine bauxite from Paragominas using stripmining technology. It is sorted and crushed for transportation as a slurry through a 240-kilometer-long pipeline, then refined into alumina at Alunorte. Bauxite from MRN is transported to Alunorte by ship. In addition to our equity interests in the MRN bauxite mine, we have volume offtake agreements for Vale's 40 percent interest in MRN, which amounted to 5.1 million mt in 2021. When operating at full production capacity, Hydro has a long position in bauxite of 3 million tonnes (assuming MRN produces 18 mt per annum) and 2-3 million tonnes of alumina.\n\n## Cost and revenue drivers\n\nThe main cost drivers for bauxite are labor, maintenance and consumables, electricity, and fuel for mining equipment. These account for around 75 percent of the cash cost of mining activities. Labor, the largest cost factor, accounting for about 30 percent, is influenced by Brazilian wage levels and productivity developments. Maintenance and consumables are influenced by inflation and operational efficiency.\n\nThe main cost drivers for alumina refining are bauxite, energy and caustic soda. These represent around 85 percent of cash costs. Energy costs are a mix of fuel, coal and electricity and account for about 30 percent of the total costs. Caustic soda represents around 15 percent of cash costs. Bauxite purchases from Paragominas, and those made under offtake agreements from MRN, are based on prices partly linked to LME prices and to alumina market prices.\n\nEnergy efficiency is an important part of Hydro's ongoing efforts to reduce air emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contribution to improve sustainability performance\n\nHydro's innovative Tailings Dry Backfill methodology at the Paragominas mine eliminates the need for new permanent tailings storage facilities, which, in turn, allows for the continuous rehabilitation of tailings as part of our ongoing mine rehabilitation process. In addition, Hydro Bauxite & Alumina participates in international collaborations, investigating possibilities to use bauxite residue as a resource for different applications. More information is available in the chapter on environmental impact management and innovation.\n\nEnergy efficiency is an important part of Hydro's ongoing efforts to reduce air emissions. In order to facilitate this reduction, Hydro Bauxite & Alumina will partly replace fuel oil consumption with natural gas, which has lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is an important enabler to reach our emission reduction targets.

The business area consists of wholly owned aluminium metal plants in Norway and partly owned plants in Slovakia, Qatar, Australia, Canada and Brazil. The plants produce value-added products, such as extrusion ingot, primary foundry alloys, sheet ingot, wire rod and standard ingot.\n\n## Cost and revenue drivers\n\nThe main cost drivers for the production of primary aluminium include alumina, power and carbon, which together comprised about 75-80 percent of the cash costs of electrolysis metal in 2021. We use approximately two tonnes of alumina to produce one tonne of aluminium, representing 35-40 percent of the cash cost of primary aluminium. Energy represents on average 25-30 percent of cash costs, and carbon anodes consumed in the smelting process account for 15-20 percent. Realized aluminium prices and casthouse product premiums are the most important revenue drivers. Aluminium Metal has a history of continuous improvements, covering all relevant earnings drivers.\n\nInternal supply contracts between our hydropower production operations and our aluminium metal business covered about half of the energy consumption of our wholly owned Norwegian metal plants in 2021. The remainder was mainly covered by new supply contracts, adding up to total annual supply of 8.6 TWh for the period 2021-2030, 5.6 TWh for the period 2021-2035, and 5.4 TWh for the period 2036-2039. This secures a significant part of the power consumption, in addition to our own hydropower production, required by our Norwegian plants for these periods. The new contracts comprise a mixture of hydropower and wind power.\n\nElectricity for the Qatalum aluminium plant in Qatar is provided by an integrated natural gas-fired plant supplied with gas by Hydro's joint-venture partner, Qatar Petroleum. The rest of the global joint ventures are covered by medium to long-term contracts, expiring between end-2022 and end2030.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contribution to improve sustainability performance\n\nMore than 70 percent of the electricity used in Hydro's production of primary aluminium is based on renewable power. Going forward, Hydro Aluminium Metal will lower our carbon footprint further through reducing the carbon footprint of raw materials and energy, in addition to developing new technologies to address hard-to-abate emissions from the electrolysis process. The electrolysis abatement program is based on two methods. The first is our own proprietary HalZero technology for carbon-free processes, while the second is based on carbon capture and storage in combination with direct air capture to decarbonize our existing primary aluminium facilities.

These plants have a total annual capacity of around 600,000 tonnes. It also operates the scrap shredding and sorting plant in Dormagen, Germany, with sorting capacity of 36,000 tonnes of post-consumer aluminium scrap per year. In addition, Recycling has several greenfield and brownfield projects under construction. The recyclers provide customers with flexible, energy-efficient and tailor-made metal supply with a low carbon footprint.\n\n## Commercial\n\nMetal Markets supplies value-added products globally and offers a wide range of products and services, including low-carbon aluminium products. Our portfolio of production plants allows for a flexible, multi-sourcing system that enables significant, rapid and cost-effective volume adjustments for customers. Hydro has leading research and development competence in value-added casthouse products, supporting customers in their improvement work and in developing new products. The commercial activities of Metal Markets include metal sourcing and trading activities, which source standard ingot from third parties for remelting in Hydro's recyclers and primary casthouses, and which provide operational risk management through LME hedging activities.\n\n## Cost and revenue drivers\n\nThe results in Metal Markets consist of the operating results of the recyclers, margins on sales of third-party products and results from ingot and LME trading activities. Revenues for our recyclers are influenced by volumes, the LME price and product premiums. Costs are driven by the cost of scrap and standard ingot premiums, freight costs to customers and operational costs, including energy consumption and prices. Our results can be heavily influenced by currency effects and ingot inventory valuation effects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contribution to improve sustainability performance\n\nHydro Metal Markets is a large remelter and recycler of aluminium. Aluminium can be recycled infinitely without degradation in quality, and recycling requires 95 percent less energy than primary aluminium production. To reach our ambitions and address industry challenges, we are improving our processes to combine clean scrap with post-consumer scrap recycling. The technology is being rolled out to Hydro's remelting and recycling plants.

The business area combines local expertise, a global network, and advanced research and development capabilities to offer everything from standard profiles to advanced solutions for most industries.\n\nExtrusions had a market share of 17 percent in Europe and 21 percent in North America in 2021, and maintained solid positions in South America and Asia. Extrusions has four business units: Extrusion Europe, Extrusion North America, Precision Tubing and Building Systems. The business units are responsible for their respective value chains, from casthouses, aluminium extrusion and value-adding operations to commercial activities such as product development and sales.\n\nAn integrated and vital part of the extrusion value chain is remelting and recycling, and Extrusions operates 20 recycling facilities in total in Europe, North America and South America. About 200,000 tonnes of post-consumer scrap are used in the recycling operations, and Extrusions is aiming to increase this amount in the years to come.\n\n## Cost and revenue drivers\n\nThe extrusion industry is a margin business and the LME Aluminium cost element is passed on to the customer. Contracts are typically short to medium term. Hydro Extrusions will continue to shift its portfolio toward highermargin products.\n\nHydro Extrusions is working with customers across many industries to reduce their CO2 footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contribution to improve sustainability performance\n\nHydro Extrusions is also working with customers across many industries to reduce their CO2 footprint through its bespoke Hydro EcoDesign process, providing green certifications and Environmental Product Declarations and using low-carbon and recycled alloys. Examples include lighter transportation, better packaging to reduce cooling needs and food spoilage, and aluminium facades that lead to lower operating costs and enable buildings to generate as much energy as they use during operation.\n\nThrough initiatives to lower Hydro Extrusion's GHG emissions associated with energy and electricity consumption, some plants have entered into power purchase agreements with renewable power producers, while others are evaluating the possibilities of installing their own on-site renewable power generation.

Energy is one of Norway's top three largest operators of hydropower and is a large power market player in the Nordics and Brazil. Energy provides Hydro and other industrial clients with affordable renewable power, sourced from our portfolio of hydro, solar, wind energy and green hydrogen.\n\nIn Norway, Energy operates 39 hydropower plants, with combined installed capacity of 2.7 GW at the end of 2021. Adjusted for ownership shares, our captive production is 9.4 TWh in a normal year. Energy is an operator of 13.7 TWh renewable power production, in a normal year. In addition to the hydropower plants, Energy operates the Tonstad Windfarm (208 MW/0.7 TWh) in Norway, from which it purchases all volumes, balancing and optimizing production against its own hydropower production. Energy also purchases more than 9 TWh of renewable power annually in the Nordic market under long-term contracts.\n\nAs Hydro's energy competence center, Energy provides support to the company's business areas on large and complex industrial projects, power contracts, supply security and energy framework conditions.\n\n## Cost and revenue drivers\n\nProduction volumes and market prices are strongly influenced by hydrological conditions. Seasonal factors affect both supply and demand. Energy's cost base is relatively stable, although volatile spot volumes and prices may cause significant variations in quarterly revenues. Energy optimizes its power portfolio in the market and in cooperation with Hydro's aluminium plants.\n\nElectricity prices are influenced by fuel costs (including emission-allowance costs), meteorological parameters and exchange transmission possibilities with adjoining markets, as well as by fluctuations in demand. An increase in intermittent generation from solar and wind power capacity has had a significant effect on price volatility in Europe's continental markets and influenced price developments in the Nordic market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contribution to improve sustainability performance\n\nThe overall carbon footprint of primary aluminium is highly dependent on the source of energy used to produce the metal. Hydro Energy helps Hydro and other industrial companies succeed with the green energy transition. The new energy ventures Hydro Rein, Hydro Havrand and Batteries play an important role in enabling a net-zero society. For example, switching from gas to hydrogen produced with renewable energy, would enable Hydro's downstream and primary aluminium sites to cut their CO2 emissions by about 1.7 million tonnes, close to 15 percent of Hydro's baseline greenhouse gas emissions.

The license grants an exclusive right to explore an area, subject to various requirements including compensation to the landowner and payment of an annual exploration fee to the National Mining Agency.\n\nIf the exploration identifies viable resources, a mining concession is granted, including an obligation to pay royalties to the government and landowners.\n\n## Aluminium regulations\n\nHydro's aluminium operations are subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations, both inside and outside the EU. These laws and regulations impose stringent environmental protection standards related to air emissions, water management, hazardous materials and waste management.\n\n## Environment\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe aluminium industry is included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The aluminium industry is affected by the scheme directly and indirectly by the pass-through of CO2 allowance costs by power producers into the power prices ('indirect effects').\n\nAluminium production is qualified as an industrial sector exposed to a significant risk of 'carbon leakage' (i.e. risk of European operations losing market share to less carbonefficient installations outside the EU). Aluminium producers therefore receive a higher percentage of free emission allowances compared to sectors not exposed to carbon leakage.\n\nIn July 2021, the Commission released a proposal for amendments of the ETS to make the scheme better aligned with Europe's new European Green Deal ambition with a total emission cut of 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, up from 40 percent under present regulation. The final outcome of the proposal for amendments to the ETS regulation is expected to be finalized towards the end of 2023.\n\n## Trade and Tariffs\n\nThe international trade framework has a significant impact on Hydro's business through political developments (EU-USChina relations), the strategic agenda of key trading blocs (regional and bilateral free trade agreements, developments at the WTO, etc.), and technical instruments such as tariffs, anti-dumping duties and other trade measures.\n\nThe EU tariff rates on imports of alumina and primary and semi-finished aluminium products vary (from 3 to 7.5 percent), excluding aluminium metal produced in the EEA. Since 2020, the EU has in place anti-dumping duties on aluminium extrusions from China, currently in the range of 21.2-32.1 percent. The EU also has specific anti-dumping duties on certain aluminium products such as foil, wheels and radiators imported from China.\n\nThe US currently has a tariff of 10 percent on aluminium imports, excluding imports from Australia, Argentina, Canada and Mexico. In October 2021, the EU and the US agreed to pause an ongoing steel and aluminium trade dispute by replacing duties with a tariff-rate quota from January 1, 2022. This agreement covers imports from the EU to the US. Exports from Norway and Qatar will still be exposed to the tariffs unless a similar agreement is reached.\n\n## Energy regulations\n\nHydro's main production assets are hydropower-based and situated in Norway. The ownership and utilization of large Norwegian waterfalls for hydropower production is subject to various laws and regulatory requirements, including a requirement for concession from the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy. EU regulations of power markets as well as the EU Water Framework Directive are by and large implemented in Norwegian law.\n\nApproximately one-third (3 TWh) of Hydro's normal annual production is subject to concession terms requiring Hydro to transfer ('revert') the production assets to the Norwegian state when the concession expires. The majority of concessions will expire around 2050. Reversion can be avoided if the power plants, or two-thirds or more of the shares of the entity that owns the power plants, are sold to a public entity prior to reversion.\n\n## Regulations\n\nHydro is subject to a broad range of laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations impose stringent standards and requirements and potential liabilities relating to the construction and operation of our plants and facilities, air and water pollutant emissions, the storage, treatment and discharge of waste waters, the use and handling of hazardous or toxic materials, waste disposal practices, and the remediation of environmental contamination, among other things. Some of the laws and regulations deemed most material to Hydro's type of operations are elaborated below.\n\n## Bauxite & Alumina - regulation\n\nHydro's operations in Brazil are subject to strict license and environmental regulations requirements.\n\nEnvironmental Regulation\n\nUnder Brazilian law, an environmental license is required for any activity that has the potential to pollute, which is often made subject to conditions to ensure regulatory compliance or to mitigate effects on the environment or local communities. Hydro's Brazilian operations hold several environmental licenses.\n\nParticular regulations apply to our operations in the Minerac\u00e3o Paragominas S.A. (Paragominas) mine, due to its location in the Amaz\u00f4nia region. The Brazilian Forest Code requires that 80 percent of a rural property with native forest in the Amaz\u00f4nia region must be preserved as an Environmental Legal Reserve, implying that a mine cannot be developed without a sustainable forest management plan. However, within states that have an Economic-Ecological Zoning, for the purpose of environmental restoration, the legal reserve requirement is set to 50 percent, applicable for our operations in Paragominas.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nIn 2020, Brazil reaffirmed the commitment to a 37 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and 43 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, as first submitted as targets at the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris. An indicative long-term goal of climate neutrality (zero net emissions) by 2060 has also been established.",

The offshore wind and hydrogen industries are fairly new and regulations are currently under development in several jurisdictions.\n\n## EU taxonomy\n\nThe Taxonomy Regulation, in force from 2020, introduced an EU-wide classification system of environmentally sustainable activities for investment purposes. The regulation mandates certain companies to report on the extent to which their business activities are aligned with the taxonomy's definition of sustainable activities and sets disclosure requirements for financial institutions' investments.\n\nHydro's primary aluminium, recycling and hydropower activities are subject to the taxonomy under certain conditions. The delegated acts on the various climate-related objectives apply from January 1, 2022 (climate change mitigation and climate change adoption) and January 1, 2023 (the remaining objectives).

While global economic activity rebounded relatively quickly in the first half of the year, supported by strong policy responses and low interest rates, significant uncertainty remains. Supply disruptions led to shortages and inflationary pressures on a range of key inputs, exerting downward pressure on growth rates in the second half of 2021.\n\n## Bauxite & Alumina\n\nThe World ex-China alumina market was oversupplied in 2021 with China absorbing the excess production as imports to balance the global market. Production increased during the year as new capacity started in Indonesia and India. Chinese alumina production growth was stable and demand growth for imported bauxite slowed.\n\nThe Platts alumina price index started the year at USD 305 per mt, ranging from USD 269 - 484 per mt during 2021.  The price was relatively stable in the USD 270 - 300 per mt range for the first half of the year before increasing to its annual high of USD 484 per mt at the end of October, driven by higher Chinese alumina prices. Power supply shortages threatened to reduce alumina supply in Southern China and raw material prices increased significantly driving Chinese alumina prices to all-time highs. Prices decreased rapidly towards the end of the year as China's power supply shortages were alleviated. Unplanned production curtailments in Brazil and Jamaica also contributed to tighter global alumina markets.\n\nThe Platts alumina price index averaged USD 329 per mt for the year, a 21 percent increase compared to 2020. Prices as a percentage of LME varied, averaging 13.2 percent for the year compared with 15.7 percent in 2020. The price index at the end of 2021 represented 12.3 percent of the three-month LME.\n\nChina imported 3.3 million mt (3.1 million mt net of exports) of alumina in 2021 compared to net imports of 3.6 million mt in 2020. Australia accounted for 67 percent of imports followed by Vietnam and Indonesia with 13 percent and 12 percent, respectively.\n\nChina imported 107.4 million mt of bauxite in 2021, 4 percent lower than the previous year and the first annual decrease\n\nsince 2016.  Imports from Guinea increased 4 percent from 2020 to 54.8 million mt, offset by decreases of 8 percent and 4 percent of imports from Australia (to 34.1 million mt) and Indonesia (to 17.8 million mt), respectively.  These three countries accounted for 99 percent of China's bauxite imports, compared to 97 percent in 2020.  In Guinea, bauxite mining and shipping operations were not impacted by a military coup in September.\n\nThe price of bauxite imported into China in 2021 increased to an annual average of USD 48 per mt CIF China compared to USD 45 per mt CIF China in 2020.\n\n## Primary Aluminium\n\nGlobal primary aluminium demand increased 9.2 percent in 2021 due to a strong global recovery supported by fiscal stimulus, with World ex. China experiencing a 14.2 percent demand increase. Global supply increased by 4.3 percent, resulting in a global deficit of around 1.2 million mt. Primary production growth in China increased 5.2 percent yearon-year in 2021 on high smelter profitability due to high aluminium prices but was limited by smelter closures in the second half of the year following power supply shortages. Demand in downstream segments increased throughout 2021 supported by strong end-user demand, especially in building and construction and packaging.\n\nThree-month LME prices started the year around USD 1,980 per mt and ended the year at USD 2,808 per mt. Prices recovered throughout the year and reached their peak in midOctober at USD 3,149 per mt, fueled by a strong recovery and supply cuts across China as well as all-time high energy prices. After an initial correction to USD 2,533 in November prices increased again as rising gas and power prices in Europe resulted in the curtailment of several European smelters.\n\nEuropean and US standard ingot premiums started the year at USD 150 per mt and USD 323 per mt respectively. European standard ingot premiums improved throughout the year ending at USD 405 per mt as European smelters curtailed production. The US Midwest standard ingot premium peaked at USD 772 per mt in October but subsequently decreased in line with LME prices ending the year at USD 665 per mt.\n\n## Platts PAX development\n\nUSD/mt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## LME price (3 month aluminium)\n\nUSD/mt\n\n<!-- image -->",

Demand for primary foundry alloys, though higher than 2020, saw only modest growth as persistent semiconductor shortages restricted production of automobiles and light trucks.\n\n## Extruded Products\n\nDemand for extrusions rebounded strongly in both Europe and North America throughout 2021 as economic activity picked up in both regions following the severe slowdown in 2020 amid Covid-19. The demand growth was particularly strong in transport and industrial segments such as electrical and machinery and equipment. The building and construction segment saw a more stable development throughout the year, supported by strong residential demand driven by refurbishing. However, the pandemic continued to influence the extrusion industry in 2021, particularly related to supply chain constraints. A predominant example was the lack of semiconductors in the transport sector which subdued automotive production and negatively impacted extrusion shipments in the second half of the year.\n\nEuropean demand is estimated to have increased by 12 percent compared to 2020. CRU estimates that European extrusion demand will increase by 3 percent in 2022 compared to 2021 but is dependent on improved automotive demand in the second half of 2022. North American demand is estimated to have increased 17 percent over compared to 2020. CRU estimates that North American extrusion demand will increase by 6 percent in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\n## Energy market developments\n\nNordic electricity prices increased significantly during 2021, primarily due to weaker hydrology, a colder than normal winter season and lower than normal wind power production. High fuel prices affected continental power prices and resulted in stable export from the Nordic region, which gave further support to Nordic prices. Drier conditions and export capacity to the UK and the continent supported higher prices in southern Norway compared to the rest of the Nordic area. Significant price area differences in the Nordic region during the second half of the year have continued into early 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Premiums\n\n## Energy spot price NOK/MWh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- n System price\n- n NO2 price (Kristiansand)\n- n NO3 price (Molde, Trondheim)\n\nGlobal primary aluminium consumption increased by 9.2 percent to 68.7 million mt in 2021. Global supply increased by 4.3 percent to 67.5 million mt resulting in global deficit of around 1.2 million mt. For 2022, global primary aluminium demand is expected to increase by 2-3 percent and aluminium production is expected to increase by 1-2 percent, resulting in a global deficit in 2022.\n\nDemand for primary aluminium outside China increased by around 14.2 percent in 2021, while corresponding production increased by 3.1 percent. Overall, production outside China exceeded demand by around 0.3 million mt in 2021. However, strong primary imports into China led to a substantial deficit outside China. Demand for primary aluminium outside China is expected to increase by around 4-5 percent in 2022. Corresponding production is expected to be up about 2-3 percent, leaving the world outside China in a balance in 2022. China is expected to continue importing primary metal in 2022, therefore the world outside China is expected to be in a deficit in 2022 after accounting for primary exports to China.\n\nDemand for primary metal in China increased around 6.0 percent to 40.0 million mt in 2021. Chinese production increased by 5.2 percent in 2021, resulting in a large deficit for the year. Production growth was first supported by high prices but then restricted by insufficient power supply. Chinese primary production is expected to increase by 0-1 percent in 2022. Primary demand is estimated to increase by around 0-1 percent, resulting in a deficit in 2022.\n\nLME stocks decreased in 2021 on the back of a global deficit market, from 1.31 million mt at the end of 2020 to 0.93 million mt at the end of 2021. Stocks decreased to a 15-year low of 0.88 million tonnes during December 2021. Total global inventories, including unreported inventories, are estimated to have decreased by 1.1 million mt in 2021. The total stock level is estimated to be around 9.7 million mt at the end of 2021.\n\nThe European demand for extrusion ingot, sheet ingot and wire rod increased in 2021 after declining in 2020. The consumption of primary foundry alloys was negatively affected by the ongoing shortage of semiconductors which lead to reduced demand in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nIn Asia, the market continues its recovery path with robust demand in extrusion ingot. However, the recovery for primary foundry alloys stalled in second half 2021 due to the",

Higher all-in metal and alumina prices, improved volumes upstream, improved margins and volumes in Hydro Extrusions, and record high annual results from Hydro Energy, contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. These positive elements were partly offset by higher raw material and fixed costs and negative currency effects.\n\n## Net income\n\nNet income from continuing operations amounted to NOK 13,930 million compared to NOK 3,886 million. In addition to the factors described above, Net income from continuing operations included a net foreign exchange gain of NOK 1,404 million, a NOK 3,083 million unrealized gain on power and raw material contracts and a NOK 5,088 million unrealized loss on LME related contracts.\n\n## Divestments\n\nOn March 5, 2021, Hydro entered into an agreement to sell its Hydro Rolling business to KPS Capital Partners, and the sale was completed on June 1, 2021. The total enterprise value for Hydro Rolling, including the Bonn property sold to Cube\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA/Free cash flow\n\nNOK million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- n Adjusted EBITDA\n- n Free cash flow\n\nReal Estate, was EUR 1,407 million. The sale strengthens Hydro's ability to deliver on its strategic direction. See Note 1.5 Significant subsidiaries and changes to the financial statements for further information.\n\n## Return on average capital employed (RoaCE)\n\nIn 2021, Hydro achieved an adjusted return on average capital employed of 18.6 percent, significantly higher than the 3.7 percent achieved in 2020, and above the ambition to deliver 10 percent over the cycle. The main driver behind the high returns was the strong aluminium demand and pricing environment, following strong macroeconomic conditions due to the Covid-19 rebound. Aluminium Metal achieved the highest returns of the business areas at 28.3 percent. The other four business areas also achieved returns at or above the target level during 2021. Energy RoaCE more than doubled from 2020 to 2021, mainly driven by portfolio changes and expiry of legacy contracts.\n\n## Cash effective change in net operating capital 1)\n\nCash effective change in net operating capital from continuing operations amounted to NOK (8.6) billion during 2021,\n\n- 1) For further details, see the Alternative Performance Measures (APM).\n\n## 5-year dividend development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1) Pending approval from the AGM on May 10, 2022.\n- 3) Average dividend per share divided by average adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations.\n- 2) Based on share price at year end.\n\n## Adjusted Return on average Capital Employed (RoaCE)\n\n| Hydro             | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n|                   | 18.6%  | 3.7%   |\n| Bauxite & Alumina | 12.0%  | 5.9%   |\n| Aluminium Metal   | 28.3%  | 2.9%   |\n| Metal Markets     | 23.9%  | 21.6%  |\n| Extrusions        | 10.3%  | 6.2%   |\n| Energy            | 25.4%  | 8.7%   |\n\ncompared to NOK 1.6 billion during 2020, mainly driven by the increasing aluminium prices and strong customer demand seen during the year.\n\n## Capex 1)\n\nTotal capex in 2021 ended up at NOK 6.9 billion. Projects prioritized in 2021 include critical maintenance activities needed to safeguard Hydro's production assets in every business area. Examples also include smelter relining in Aluminium Metal, bauxite pipeline section replacement in Paragominas, power plant rehabilitation and upgrades in Energy, various upgrades of presses in Extrusions and recyclers in Metal Markets. Growth and return-seeking capex was mainly related to restart of Husnes line B in Aluminium Metal, customer-driven investments in Extrusions, and investments in Hydro Rein and Batteries in Energy.\n\n## Free cash flow 1)\n\nFree cash flow from continuing operations ended up at NOK 10.5 billion in 2021, up from NOK 7.7 billion in 2020. Cash generation was supported by the high aluminium prices and strong customer demand through the year, partly offset by capex and negative cash effective change in net operating capital. Free cash flow excludes the impact from the Rolling business area, which is reported as net cash provided by discontinued operations.\n\n## Dividend\n\nHydro's Board of Directors proposed an annual dividend of NOK 5.4 per share for 2021. This represents an average fiveyear payout ratio of 71 percent of net income from continuing",

Aluminium Metal with their cost and efficiency agenda are a large contributor to the overall achievement, although running somewhat behind their plan as a result of operational challenges at Albras following a period of production curtailments. Hydro's target for 2022 is to achieve NOK 7 billion in accumulated improvements.\n\n## Commercial ambition\n\nHydro realized NOK 1.5 billion in commercial initiatives by the end of 2021 out of the total NOK 2.5 billion ambition by 2025.The majority of these came from Extrusions reflecting regained market shares post the cyber-attack in 2019 and a faster than expected market and margin recovery following weak demand in the midst of the global covid pandemic in 2020. Bauxite & Alumina achieved higher premiums on their alumina sales compared to their performance benchmark. Finally, Aluminium Metal has also contributed positively with increasing greener product sales as well as new launch of new products, such as HyForge. In total, 286 kt of CIRCAL and REDUXA were sold externally in 2021, which is around three times more than in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noperations attributable to equity holders, including proposed dividend, and a dividend yield of 7.8 percent at the end of 2021.\n\n## Net cash (debt) 1)\n\nHydro's net cash was NOK 3.2 billion at the end of 2021, compared to a net debt of NOK 7.8 billion at the end of 2020. The strong development was impacted by positive free cash flow and the sale of the Rolling business area, partly offset by dividend payments as well as currency and lease effects.\n\n## Adjusted net cash (debt) 1)\n\nHydro's adjusted net cash (debt) was NOK (7.0) billion at the end of 2021, an improvement from NOK (23.3) billion at the end of 2020. The positive development was driven by the change in net cash (debt) as well as lower pension obligations following the divestment of the Rolling business area, partly offset by increasing cash collateral.\n\n## Adjusted net (cash) debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 2)\n\nHydro's adjusted net (cash) debt to adjusted EBITDA was 0.4, well below the targeted maximum ratio of 2.0 over the cycle.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nHydro held NOK 22.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, NOK 1.0 billion in time deposits and NOK 1.4 billion in money market funds, included in short-term investments, at the end of the year. Short-term bank deposits and money market funds are normally available at short notice. Norsk Hydro ASA has a USD 1.6 billion revolving multi-currency credit facility with a syndicate of international banks, maturing in December 2026. The facility was undrawn per year-end 2021. Overdraft facilities and liquidity lines also provide access to additional short-term liquidity.\n\n## Improvement program\n\nBy the end of 2021 Hydro realized NOK 6.3 billion in improvements, exceeding the original target of NOK 5.1 billion for the year. This represents ~75 percent of the total NOK 8.5 billion target by 2025, in line with the frontloaded profile of the program. Higher than expected fixed cost savings and restructuring gains in Extrusions combined with the Extrusions Business System (EBS) launched earlier in the year are the main reason for the over-performance.",

The share of women in the top three organizational levels increased from 32 to 36 percent at the end of 2021.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nThe number of total recordable injuries rates deteriorated from 2.7 in 2020 to 3.3 in 2021. The majority of injuries were relatively minor, with no life-threatening nor life-changing injuries reported during the year.\n\nThe deployment of fatality prevention procedures and associated life-saving rules and behaviors continued in 2021, which contributed to a continued reduction in the number and rates of high-risk incidents with the potential to be fatal or life changing. There were no fatalities in our operations in 2021\n\n## Compliance\n\nIn 2021, training was provided e.g. on the topics of anticorruption, Hydro's Code of Conduct, competition law, data privacy, trade sanctions and market regulations. Hydro employees completed around 26,000 compliance awareness and training modules.\n\nSee the section on Environmental and social responsibility and associated statements for further details on the metrics below\n\n* From Hydro's ownership equity (Million tonnes CO2e)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental performance 1)\n\nHydro's direct greenhouse gas emissions increased by around 10 percent while indirect emissions increased by almost 12 percent. The increase was mainly driven by increased Alumina and Primary Aluminium production volumes for 2021 compared with 2020.\n\n## GHG emissions from consolidated operations (million mt CO2e)\n\nEmissions per ton of alumina produced remained stable. Production at Alunorte reached nameplate capacity during 2021, increasing by around 15 percent from 2020.\n\nEmission per ton of primary aluminium produced remained stable. Primary aluminium production volumes increased by around 7 percent mainly due to the restart of aluminium production at line B at the Husnes primary plant in Norway\n\n## Recycling\n\nAluminium Metal increased the utilization of post-consumer scrap by approximately 35 percent during 2021. The increase was mainly driven by Covid-19 related production curtailments in 2020 and the increase in post-consumer scrap usage in Azuqueca after investment in increased production.\n\nTotal recycled metal production increased around 10 percent in 2021 from 2020.\n\n## Bauxite residue (red mud)\n\nBauxite residue increased by around 10 percent in line with increased alumina production volumes.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nIn 2021, 427 hectares of land were cleared, and 389 hectares mined. In total Hydro has disturbed around 7,000 hectares of land for our mining operation in Paragominas.\n\nThe accumulated area under rehabilitation was 2,646 hectares, adding approximately 160 hectares of land rehabilitated in 2021. Furthermore, we succeeded in our 1:1 rehabilitation of available mined areas within two hydrological seasons.",

To mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, long-term debt is mainly maintained in currencies reflecting underlying exposures and cash generation.\n\nThe table shows sensitivities regarding aluminium prices and foreign currency fluctuations for 2022. The table illustrates the sensitivity of adjusted earnings, before tax, interest and depreciation to changes in these factors and is provided to supplement the sensitivity analysis required by IFRS, included in Note 8.2 Financial instruments to the financial statements. These sensitivities are on an adjusted basis, and do not consider revaluation effects of derivative instruments, which may influence earnings. The sensitivities include the impact from financial risk management contracts per December 31, 2021\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nThe Group is engaged in a large number of legal proceedings and disputes around the world. As of the date of this Annual Report, based on the Company's current assessment, neither the Company nor any other company in the Group are, nor have during the course of the last 12 months, been involved in any governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings, which may have, or have had in the recent past significant effects on the Company and/or the Group's financial position or profitability.\n\nSensitivities with 100% production\n\n## Commodity price sensitivity +10%\n\n| NOK million                 |       |       | Adj.

The third line comprises Group Internal Audit & Investigation. This department independently evaluates whether Hydro's risk management, control and governance processes, as designed and represented by management, are adequate and contribute to the achievement of the organization's objective.\n\nThrough the 3LoD model, major risks are analyzed and managed according to Hydro's risk appetite through the annual strategy process, with a status update provided in the business planning process, while mitigating actions progress on an ongoing basis.\n\nAn overview of Hydro's key risks, including developments during the last 12 months and related mitigating actions, is included below. Overall, we have seen an evolution of the company's risk profile rather than a material change, with emphasis on the challenges of protectionism, regionalization and the company's new strategic direction. Despite Hydro's best efforts, our risk-mitigating initiatives may fail or prove to be inadequate to mitigate all risks. As our risks increase, decrease and change, and as new risks emerge over time, the information contained in this section should be carefully considered by investors.\n\n## Risk process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk review\n\nEnterprise risk management in Hydro\n\nRisk management is an integral part of all our business activities and decisions.\n\nThe Board of Directors (BoD) sets expectations, oversees Hydro's risk management framework and monitors key risks through biannual updates which serve as an important foundation for the strategy and business planning processes. In addition, specific areas will be subject to more frequent updates. Progress on risk mitigation is reflected in the remuneration schemes of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Corporate Management Board (CMB). The Board Audit Committee supports the BoD's supervisory role, primarily with respect to strategic and financial reporting risks. The CMB is responsible for Hydro's risk management framework at group level and assists the CEO in its execution.\n\nRisk management is an integral part of all our business activities and decisions.\n\nThe further attribution of risk management roles in Hydro is supported by the development of a three lines of defense (3LoD) governance model.\n\nThe first line of defense resides with managers at all levels in business areas and corporate functions. They have the responsibility for and ownership of incident and HSE risks. Business areas and corporate functions ensure that risks within their respective areas of accountability are identified, assessed, adequately mitigated, documented and regularly updated.\n\nThe second line comprises governance owners and subject matter experts in different risk areas. They develop policies and procedures for managing risk and coordinate an annual risk assessment with a biannual status update. More broadly,",

They could have a significant upside and are characterized by their large scale and potential long-term impact on sustainability and profitability. They are generally influenced by structural shifts in the external business environment.\n\n## Incident risks\n\nIncident risks are mainly operational or influenced by operational processes. They will often, but not always, materialize suddenly and with immediate impact. Short-term mitigation is typically within Hydro's control. Hydro's main incident risks could impact several parts of the value chain with a broad range of consequences.\n\n## HSE risks\n\nHSE risks relate to health, safety, security and/or environmental events. They are often operational or influenced by operational processes. Hydro's main HSE risks could influence multiple parts of the business. In addition to their HSE-related consequences, these risks may also result in major legal, social, reputational and financial impacts.",

Meeting opportunities and challenges arising from sustainability trends\n\n## Description\n\nThe expectations from internal and external stakeholders continue to evolve with regard to our sustainability performance. While our CO2 footprint is among the lowest of aluminium producers, the production process remains energy and carbon-intensive. In addition, key stakeholders are increasingly looking beyond carbon and focusing on the overall sustainability footprint, including environmental and social factors.\n\n## Consequences\n\nA failure to deliver on expectations could negatively impact our license to operate, damage our reputation and increase the risk of substitution away from aluminium.\n\n## Developments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal awareness and attention toward sustainability continues to trend upwards. To a large degree, this is positive for Hydro compared to peers. In addition to current climate change targets, the focus on biodiversity and social aspects is expected to increase as decarbonization roadmaps become more mature. Customers' expectations reflect this across all aspects of sustainability and along the entire value chain.\n\nRegulations are tightening, especially in Europe. Investments in research and development toward greener solutions are growing, which increases the drive to deliver sustainable materials. In general, all geographies, industries and companies are expected to come under increased scrutiny.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nIn 2020, Hydro established a new strategic direction, building on our profitability and sustainability agenda, with an aim to strengthen our position in low-carbon aluminum and grow within renewable energy. Hydro is committed to reduce its GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030, with projects to reduce CO2 emissions in the value chain such as a fuel switch to LNG and the electrification of boilers at Alunorte, while research on the use of hydrogen in the casthouses is being developed. A longerterm technology roadmap to decarbonize main processes such as primary smelting and recycling has been developed, with an ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nAlongside decarbonization, progress is made across key sustainability areas including stronger community relationships and the focus on environmental impacts such as biodiversity, waste and water in Brazil. Initiatives to improve our social and environmental impact are monitored, communicated and reported on a regular basis. Within primary aluminium production, Hydro is working on various methods to reduce direct emissions, while also targeting increased use of post-consumer scrap, thereby reducing total energy usage and metal waste.\n\nIn 2021, both Hydro's long-term sustainability ambitions and short-term targets have been updated based on technological and commercial developments, reinforcing Hydro's industry position.",

Systematic Corporate Social Responsibility efforts are ongoing, including the Sustainable Barcarena initiative and commitments stemming from the agreement with the Government of Par\u00e1 and Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico. Both in Brazil and globally, Hydro is engaged in a systematic dialogue with political, governmental, non-governmental and local communities regarding the social and regulatory challenges facing our operations and the communities in which we operate.\n\nThe physical adaption of assets and supply chain robustness are important mitigating factors against the risk posed by climate change related incidents, such as flooding, landslides, droughts, and the implications these may have on the local environment, and to our ability to continue safe operations and access to raw materials and markets.\n\nCommercial activities within alumina and other raw materials provide access to key markets and other sources as a tool in managing supply disruption risk.\n\n## 2. Value chain concentration\n\n## Description\n\nWe receive almost all our alumina from Hydro-owned operations in Brazil, whereby the bauxite mine at Paragominas supplies the majority of raw materials to the Alunorte alumina refinery through a pipeline.\n\nOver the last few years, we experienced several challenges to the stability of our operations in Brazil due to a combination of factors involving physical climate incidents, asset integrity and a complex political and social environment. In response, we have made significant efforts to enhance the robustness of our operations in the region.\n\n## Consequences\n\nHydro's integrated aluminium production chain poses risks related to value chain concentration, where disruptions in the bauxite and alumina production located in one region in Brazil could negatively impact metal production in other parts of the company.\n\n## 3. Geopolitical tensions, protectionism and trade disruptions\n\n## Description\n\nProtectionism is the process by which countries impose barriers to free trade with the intention of protecting national interests. This reduces the free flow of goods and services, raising costs and reducing quality. Geopolitical tensions are often the underlying cause of such actions.\n\nTrade and supply chain disruptions can impact the access to and cost of raw materials.\n\n## Consequences\n\nProtectionism can harm trade and activity, as reversed trade integration can lower economic growth. Higher import duties and the introduction of other trade barriers increase costs, impact both the quantity and price of internationally traded goods and can further affect financial flows and credit conditions.\n\n## Developments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn March 2021, the European Union (EU) imposed anti-dumping duties on certain extrusions from China for a period of five years. The UK has also opened an anti-dumping investigation on certain Chinese extrusions, with a decision expected in 2022. The US and EU reached a temporary agreement regarding US Section 232 tariffs and EU retaliatory measures, resulting in suspension of WTO cases against each other.\n\nSupply chain disruptions are impacting the supply of certain raw materials to our operations as well our customers' ability to receive goods for which they are dependent to run their operations. This has been further exacerbated by shipping constraints.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nIn general, Hydro is well positioned to handle challenges arising from protectionism and regionalization. The majority of our network of aluminium metal plants is located within large well-established markets, and our downstream operations have strong local presence in both Europe and North America. Hydro also actively participates in organizations aiming to promote and foster fair trade, such as European Aluminium and the U.S. Aluminum Association.\n\nThe supply chain risk is managed through a combination of physical inventory build-ups for key raw materials, selective hedging, long-term agreements with approved suppliers and commercial activities in the marketplace.",

Among these, the carbon border adjustment mechanism and concurrent changes to existing carbon leakage legislation have the most consequences for the aluminium industry. The US is also considering the introduction of a similar mechanism.\n\nThe requirements for the first phase of the EU's common classification system for sustainable activities, EU Taxonomy, were formally adopted in June 2021 with the ultimate aim of strengthening capital flows toward sustainable activities. The first phase covers climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro continues to actively engage with regulators and industry associations, where appropriate, to ensure that aluminium's position is taken into consideration. Hydro has been involved in the development of international frameworks on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, supporting the establishment of a level playing field for the industry.\n\nFor power industry regulations, Hydro engages in various activities to support and promote sustainable energy policies in the regions in which we operate, in addition to securing competitive energy supplies for our own operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe increasing focus on sustainability is part of a long-term trend and expected to increase going forward. Many other industries and competing materials are researching CO2-free production methods, including the production of steel using hydrogen.\n\n## Developments\n\nWithin the aluminium industry, several research initiatives are looking into inert anode technology to reduce direct process emissions.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro views technology as a key enabler in delivering on the dual profitability and sustainability strategy. We conduct R&D inhouse, and we participate in joint partnerships and projects with other leading industrial companies, universities, and research institutions. We also follow external developments closely.\n\nWe have identified a number of technology-based roadmaps to producing aluminium with near-zero to zero footprint, including recycling of post-consumer scrap, carbon capture, and CO2-free primary production through a chloride-based process.\n\nWithin renewable energy, the technology risk is mitigated through selective partnerships and by taking limited positions to gain experience while limiting the downside.\n\n## 4. Regulatory & policy framework uncertainty\n\n## Description\n\nThe aluminium industry is subject to multiple local and global regulatory frameworks, including mining regulations, tariffs, labor laws and power industry regulations. Hydro thrives under competitive and predictive framework conditions.\n\nClimate-related regulations in the EU such as the implementation of national and regional CO2 taxes are at the forefront of the current uncertainty, with the US also increasing its focus.\n\n## Consequences\n\nThe sustainability driven developments in regulatory frameworks largely represent an opportunity for Hydro. There might however be unintended consequences arising from the complexity and uneven impact of legislation, potentially impacting aluminium's competitiveness versus other materials, the economic viability of our operations and/or our ability to conduct business in certain markets.\n\n## 5. New strategic direction\n\n## Description\n\nHydro is exposed to disruptive technological developments by our direct competitors or by other competing materials and industries. Materials produced with technologies giving lower sustainability footprints could have a significant advantage and could challenge aluminium in key application areas.\n\n## Consequences\n\nSuccessful industrialization of competing metals with lower sustainability footprints could increase the risk of substitution and potentially lower demand for aluminium.\n\nSuccessful commercialization of breakthrough technological developments such as inert anodes would impact Hydro's comparative advantage as an aluminium producer with one of the lowest CO2 footprints.\n\nOur new business ventures into growth markets such as hydrogen, batteries, and solar energy expose Hydro to the increased risks associated with immature technologies, such as sudden breakthroughs rendering existing investments obsolete.",

A new short-term agreement valid through June 2022 has been signed with the Brazilian port authorities while negotiations for the concession of port operations are ongoing.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe replacement of the Paragominas bauxite pipeline continues to progress according to plan with 42 kilometers completed in 2021, while a similar scope of work is scheduled for 2022. A back-up power line is also being built for Paragominas and the pipeline. Meanwhile, the reliability of the pipeline is further secured through emergency diesel generators.\n\nWe have completed major improvements to Alunorte's water management systems, including new basins and water treatment facility upgrades, enhanced pumping systems and water pipes, instruments for automation and control and cameras for basin monitoring. Hydrological studies were also carried out in 2021.\n\nHydro Aluminium Metal made good progress on projects to replace or update critical equipment such as rectifiers, control pot systems and baking furnaces.\n\nWe perform regular inspections and maintenance activities, conduct comprehensive emergency-preparedness training with key personnel and maintain a range of business continuity plans across sites to best prevent and mitigate operational disruptions. Our resilience against power outages is ensured, where appropriate, by automated substations, power generating facilities and back-up facilities.\n\n## Incident risks\n\n## 6. Insufficient asset integrity\n\n## Description\n\nHydro is exposed to a range of risks and hazards that could result in disruptions to operations across our business areas through critical equipment breakdowns and power failures.\n\n## Consequences\n\nOperational disruptions might reduce or interrupt production at key plants for significant periods of time, materially affecting our financial results and cash flows.\n\nSome operations are located close to sizable communities where operational events could also result in significant and potentially lasting impacts on the environment as well as the health and safety of employees, contractors and nearby communities. Hydro might also be subject to claims, fines and further damage to our profitability or reputation.",

New business units within renewable energy, batteries and hydrogen require specific focus, while the divestment of the rolling business slightly reduced the overall risk footprint. Risks arising from regulatory developments within the various compliance areas are mitigated by continuous improvements of Hydro's compliance structures and processes.\n\nOne legal case involving a US subsidiary is in progress. There is a pending criminal investigation involving alleged violations of the Clean Air Act by Hydro's casthouse in The Dalles, Oregon. In 2021, The Dalles site resolved civil matters involving air and water environmental compliance requirements. In addition, Hydro Extrusion USA, LLC remains under a deferred prosecution agreement, the term of which is scheduled to end in April 2022.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro's Code of Conduct requires adherence to laws and regulations as well as global directives and procedures. It is systematically implemented and maintained through our compliance system, which is based on a clear governance structure defining roles and responsibilities to manage the relevant compliance risks. While the system includes controls and activities to prevent, detect, report and respond to compliance failures, the core focus is on the prevention of material non-compliance incidents. In addition to policies, guidelines and procedures, Hydro maintains an extensive training program adapted to the company's risks and profile to continuously build and maintain a strong culture of compliance and integrity.\n\nAs part of Hydro's social responsibility strategy, we have defined priorities and overall goals and implemented these through specific directives, policies and procedures to manage social risks and opportunities throughout the company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe underlying cyber security risk remains high as malicious actors innovate and evolve their techniques to increase their success rate.\n\n## Developments\n\nThreats related to the cyber security of IT and industrial control systems have developed rapidly over the past year, supporting the overall assessment that our global risk remains high.\n\nContributing factors include the shift to remote work for relevant engineering and maintenance activities as well as the increasing trend of external incidents, including ransomware and supply-chain attacks. In response, Hydro continues to strengthen its defenses.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nProgress continues to be made on delivering prioritized security capabilities based on best practice standards and frameworks for information technology and industrial control systems to protect the central IT infrastructure and industrial control system across business areas.\n\n## 7. Material social, legal or compliance incident\n\n## Description\n\nWhile Hydro has a strong commitment to act in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be negatively affected by criminal or civil proceedings or investigations related, but not limited to, alleged anti-competitive or corrupt practices, product quality, environment, health and safety, data privacy, market regulation or trade sanctions. We could also be exposed to allegations or perceived failures to act in an ethical or socially responsible manner, particularly related to human rights breaches.\n\n## Consequences\n\nPotential consequences range from fines or penalties, contractual, litigation and reputational risk, withdrawal of licenses, and suspension or operational shutdowns.\n\n## 8. Major cyber-attack\n\n## Description\n\nHydro's Information Systems (IS) and Information Technology (IT) infrastructure is critical to all our operations, ranging from process control systems at production sites to central personnel databases and systems for external financial reporting.\n\nCyber crime is increasing globally, exposing Hydro to a range of threats to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of our systems. Threats may include attempts to access information, ransomware attacks, destructive installation of viruses, denial of service and other digital security breaches.\n\n## Consequences\n\nA cyber breach could result in a broad range of impacts including HSE events, operational disruptions and the leakage of private or confidential data.",

Hydro is pursuing alternative measures to protect its financial interest in this matter.\n\nRegulatory changes such as the OECD/EU initiatives pertaining to the Global Tax Reform, and tax transparency, together with multiple changes in local tax regulations, constantly shift a global tax landscape that is challenging to predict and navigate.\n\nSince the approval last year of the state tax deferral by the Brazilian National Council of Finance Policy (CONFAZ), the risk of an immediate removal is still present but has been reduced. Risks related to the portfolio of open tax cases and Brazil's tax reform remain stable.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro is engaged in a systematic dialogue with local, state and federal politicians, industry associations, non-governmental organizations and local communities regarding the regulatory challenges facing our operations. The focus of this dialogue is on Hydro's contribution to a sustainable aluminium value chain and underlines the need for competitive and predictable framework conditions for our operations.\n\nWe continuously monitor and respond to global regulatory changes, including the development and implementation of Mandatory Disclosure Rules (MDR) guidelines as a response to the EU MDR Directive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic continued to evolve throughout 2021 with the successful rollout of major vaccination programs being partially mitigated by more contagious variants. Tragically, we lost the lives of 33 employees and contractors since the start of the pandemic.\n\n## Developments\n\nHydro operated throughout this challenging period without any major disruptions through the strict adoption of rules set by relevant local authorities together with Hydro-specific measures. In addition, emphasis has been given to the mental health state of our staff impacted by long-standing social distancing rules, and we continue to encourage vaccination according to the guidelines set by authorities in countries where we operate.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOur strategy to minimize the operational impact of Covid-19 and prepare for future pandemics continues to be based on full compliance with rules complemented by a flexible range of Hydro-specific responses and robust emergency preparedness.\n\nWhere applicable, guidelines and regulations from national authorities such as those pertaining to travel restrictions, social distancing, home office or complete societal lockdowns, have been reflected in our internal policies and procedures. We evaluate our key pandemic-related risks and vulnerabilities through annual security and business-resilience assessments, which support the preparation and review of business-continuity plans.\n\nAdditional measures that have been used and could be reinstated include stock level increases for raw materials to reduce our exposure to supply chain disruptions as well as cash-preservation measures to reduce cost, capital expenditures and to ensure adequate liquidity to face the financial impact of potential shutdowns.\n\n## 9. Material tax change\n\n## Description\n\nHydro is committed to pay equitable taxes where the economic value is created. Our global reach involves complexity and potential volatility linked to regulatory changes on direct and indirect taxes as well as to OECD/EU initiatives, including Mandatory Disclosure Rules and the Global Tax Reform. In addition, multiple changes often occur in local tax regulations.\n\nIn Brazil, the tax system is complex and volatile, with a broad range of direct and indirect taxes levied at federal, state and municipal levels, including our ICMS tax framework from 2015. A tax reform is under discussion and a large portfolio of cases pertaining to Hydro's business in Brazil is disputed by tax authorities, of which close to half are covered by tax indemnification stemming from acquisitions.\n\n## Consequences\n\nChanges to tax regulations can occur suddenly and materially impact Hydro's financial results as well as influence decisions with regard to future investment.\n\n## 10. Global pandemic\n\n## Description\n\nHydro's vertically integrated value chain and global footprint are exposed to rapidly evolving and spreading communicable diseases.\n\nThe actions we take in anticipation of and response to a pandemic may affect our ability to maintain stable operations across business areas and corporate functions.\n\n## Consequences\n\nHigh transmission rates among employees, contractors, stakeholders and communities may lead to the prolonged shutdown of operations, either due to government-imposed restrictions, insufficient manning, social unrest or our inability to provide a safe environment. Our suppliers and customers may also be inhibited from receiving raw materials, which could further disrupt production and sales.\n\nOn a broader scale, a global pandemic may significantly impact the demand for our goods as well as our ability to deliver to the market.",

However, we have experienced a small increase in injury-free but potentially fatal incidents with machinery-related safety near misses, and in Brazil, where several armed events targeting contractors involved in pipeline maintenance have occurred.\n\nThere were no life-threatening or life-changing injuries in 2021.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro's approach to HSE and Security covers leaders who are committed to safety and who are highly visible on the factory floor with well-developed and robust HSE management systems, and employees and contractors who are engaged in HSE activities.\n\nControl measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of fatal and life-changing incidents occurring have been developed and implemented in all business areas. Hydro's fatality-prevention procedures are well established and showing good progress. High-risk actions and completion rates are critically reviewed to ensure robust processes and learning across all sites. Quarterly health, safety, security and environment network meetings connect specialists from all business areas, who discuss preventative control measures following high-risk incidents and who share best practices and innovative solutions.\n\nMachinery safety and asset-integrity incidents are receiving attention to further prevent failures, and constitute an improvement area for 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nViolence in Barcarena and surrounding areas continues to trend at concerning levels. Several firearms related incidents and robberies have occurred in relation to the pipeline replacement program. Additionally, recent armed hijacks of trucks used to carry extrusion materials in S\u00e3o Paulo have added to the concern.\n\n## Developments\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro's Bauxite & Alumina security team closely monitors security risks and maintains close contact with security authorities in operational areas. Security training for security teams based in Brazil is ongoing, and weekly security calls incorporate all Hydro locations in the country.\n\nWe monitor closely the performance of our security providers, one of which has achieved international accreditation and recognition.\n\n## HSE risks\n\n## 11. Fatal or life-changing accident\n\n## Description\n\nHydro's operations are varied, from mining in Brazil, aluminium smelting in Norway to extrusions in Europe, the US, SouthAmerica and China. Each activity poses serious safety risks that, if not controlled, could cause serious injuries or fatalities.\n\nDespite Hydro's best efforts, high-risk incidents do occur. All such incidents are treated seriously and investigated to their root causes to prevent recurrence.\n\n## Consequences\n\nWorkplace-related loss of a life has a traumatic and longlasting psychological effect on loved ones and colleagues. In addition, police or health and safety agencies might impose sanctions, including imprisonment and fines. Civil action could result in compensation claims.\n\nLife-changing injuries affect the quality of life of the injured person and often require significant adjustments at home and work. This could be associated with long-lasting psychological impacts on the injured person and family, together with the need for ongoing financial support. In addition, Hydro might need to shut down its operations and may be subjected to fines, legal disputes, sanctions and reputational damage.\n\n## 12. Security incident\n\n## Description\n\nHydro is exposed to security risks such as public violence, robbery or theft. This risk is particularly relevant in the Barcarena region in Brazil.\n\n## Consequences\n\nThe outcome of security incidents could be psychological impact, a serious injury or in single or multiple fatalities. The risk of kidnapping and subsequent ransom demands is also present.\n\nSecurity incidents could potentially be associated with environmental incidents through attacks on the pipeline or business interruptions.",

Aluminium Metal and Bauxite & Alumina are the business areas most exposed to a spill or leakage with significant HSE impact, due to the volumes of hazardous materials used and locations of large sites.\n\nThere has been a considerable reduction in severe and major incidents reported in 2021, compared to previous years.\n\nThere has been increased focus at the Schwandorf legacy site in Germany, with increased monitoring of ground work and remedial action to on-site chemical storage structures.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nAll Hydro sites are required to have action plans in place for known legacies. These are agreed with relevant regulatory bodies. Legacy remediation plans are suitable for known risks, but investigations may uncover unknown risks, while there is also an increased scrutiny of Brazil operations.\n\nIn order to reduce the risks for our operations, Hydro performs extensive risk assessments. These include the modelling of future weather patterns and their impact on Hydro's facilities based on existing climate models and scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and scenarios for policy and legal risk, technology, market and reputation risk. Environmental studies are underway in Barcarena and Norway, both due for completion in 2022. The rehabilitation plan for Paragominas is in place.\n\nAll sites are required to follow Group standards on chemical and waste management to mitigate the inherent risk of storing, handling and disposing of hazardous materials. We have increased our inspections on the integrity of storage areas across Business Areas, nonetheless some deficiencies still exist.\n\n## 13. Impact on the environment\n\n## Description\n\nThe nature of Hydro's mining and industrial operations implies a potential climate and environmental risk exposure. Hydro is also exposed to risks related to the effects of known and unknown historical and current emissions to air, water and soil around large assets. These risks are usually long- term, and to a large extent related to our Bauxite & Alumina operations in Brazil.\n\nMany operational sites in Hydro have some form of environmental legacy that will need to be remediated prior to site closure.\n\nHydro is focused on the prevention of spills and the unlicensed release of effluents or liquids.\n\n## Consequences\n\nSuch events could have a significant and potentially lasting impact on the aquatic life, flora, fauna and they may pose health risks to nearby communities if, for example, ground water becomes contaminated.\n\nA significant spill of hazardous materials in a sensitive area such as a Norwegian fjord, river or the Brazilian rainforest would also cause a significant financial and reputational impact.\n\nIn addition, Hydro might need to shut down its operations and be subjected to fines or legal disputes.",

The laboratory analysis and interpretation are still ongoing and the stability of the landfill has therefore not yet been established. This risk has remained stable over the past 12 months, with no new incident reported. Extensive repairs and maintenance to the pipeline took place in 2021 and is ongoing. There have been no incidents with crane failures or other significant defects in other structures during the year.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro is continuously seeking to reduce the likelihood of major incidents with risk-mitigating activities through the commitment to comply with the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management within the applicable deadlines. Other initiatives include Tailings Dry Backfill technology that will eliminate the long-term risk of failure at Paragominas.\n\nHydropower dams are highly regulated. At closed tailings facilities, the risk of failure under varying conditions, including extreme weather and seismic events (defined as events with a statistical return period of 1:10000), is under investigation. The Bauxite & Alumina pipeline repair and replacement program is ongoing, although there are security concerns associated with this activity due to the location of the pipeline and its access for maintenance, which we are addressing through our fatal risk management approach. Frequent contact with the port administration continues with improvements in maintenance and inspections regimes.\n\n## 14. Structural collapse or other major accident\n\n## Description\n\nAlthough the likelihood is considered to be low, there is a risk of major accidents such as the collapse of a hydropower dam, an incident at our tailings storage or bauxite residue storage facilities, the collapse of the entire port structure at the Alunorte alumina refinery, or a rupture of the bauxite slurry pipeline.\n\nWe consider in particular the potential failure of tailings storage facilities (Paragominas, MRN), bauxite residue storage facilities (Alunorte, Schwandorf), the bauxite slurry pipeline (Paragominas, Alunorte) and hydropower dams.\n\n## Consequences\n\nIf such accidents occur, they could have a significant and potentially lasting impact on the environment as well as the health and safety of employees, contractors and nearby communities. In addition, Hydro might need to shut down its operations and may be subjected to fines, legal disputes and reputational damage.",

The return ex. dividend for 2021 was NOK 29.66, or 74 percent. Hydro paid its 2020 dividend in May 2021. Hydro's Board of Directors proposes to pay a dividend of NOK 5.4 per share for 2021, for approval by the Annual General Meeting on May 10, 2022, reflecting Hydro's strong financial position. The proposed payment demonstrates the company's commitment to provide a predictable dividend to shareholders.\n\nThe average five-year payout ratio is 71 percent. There were 2,068,998,276 issued shares at the end of 2021. A total of 1.3 billion Hydro shares were traded on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE) during 2021 at a value of NOK 74 billion, making Hydro the eighth-most traded company on the OSE. The average daily trading volume for Hydro shares on the OSE during 2021 was 5.3 million shares. Hydro's shares are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange, while our American Depositary Shares (ADSs) trade on OTCQX International in the US, the premium over-the-counter market tier.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nLong-term return to shareholders should reflect the financial value created by Hydro over time. Total shareholder return consists of dividends and share price development. Hydro's dividend policy is in the long term to pay out minimum 50 percent of adjusted net income as ordinary dividend over the cycle to our shareholders. The dividend policy has a floor of NOK 1.25 per share. In setting the dividend for a specific year, Hydro will take into consideration expected earnings, future investment opportunities, the outlook for world commodity markets and our financial position. Share buybacks or extraordinary dividends may supplement ordinary dividends during periods of strong financials, due consideration being given to the commodity cycle and capital requirements for future growth. The total payout should reflect Hydro's aim to provide its shareholders with competitive returns benchmarked against alternative investments in comparable companies. Hydro's Board of Directors normally proposes a dividend per share in connection with the publication of our fourth quarter results. The Annual General Meeting then considers this proposal in May each year, and\n\n-\n\nNHYDY index\n\n-\n\nLME 3M\n\n-\n\nOSEBX index",

Shares registered with a nominee account must be re-registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depositary, Verdipapirsentralen (VPS), before the Annual General Meeting in order to obtain voting rights. This requirement also applies to our US-traded ADSs. Hydro cannot guarantee that beneficial shareholders will receive the notice for a general meeting in time to instruct their nominees to affect a re-registration of their shares. Hydro is organized under the laws of the Kingdom of Norway. It may be difficult for investors to effect service of process outside Norway upon Hydro or its directors and executive officers, or to enforce against Hydro or its directors and executive officers judgments obtained in other jurisdictions. Norwegian courts are unlikely to apply other than Norwegian law when deciding on civil liability claims under securities laws.\n\n## Information from Hydro\n\nCommunicating with the stock market is given high priority, and Hydro aims to maintain an open dialogue with market participants. Our objective is to provide sufficient information on a timely basis to all market participants to ensure a fair valuation of our shares. Information that is considered price sensitive is communicated by news releases and stock exchange announcements. We host regular meetings for investors in Europe and the US. The major brokers in Oslo and London publish equity research reports on Hydro. Previous annual and quarterly reports are available on www. hydro.com.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Annual General Meeting will be held at the company's offices at Drammensveien 260, Oslo, Norway, on Tuesday, May 10, 2022, at 10:00 CET. Shareholders who wish to attend are asked to inform the registrar by 16:00 CET on Thursday, May 5: DNB Bank ASA Registrar's Department P.O.Box 1600 Sentrum N-0021 Oslo, Norway. You may also register electronically on our website www.hydro.com/register or via VPS Investor Services. Any shareholder may appoint a proxy with written authority to attend the meeting and vote on his or her behalf. Voting rights are discussed under 'Major shareholders and voting rights'. It will also be possible to follow the meeting online.\n\n## Change of address\n\nShareholders registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository should send information on changes of address to their registrar and not directly to Hydro.\n\n## Financial calendar 2022 1)\n\n| May 3      | First quarter results   |\n|------------|-------------------------|\n| May 10     | Annual General Meeting  |\n| July 22    | Second quarter results  |\n| October 25 | Third quarter results   |\n\n- 1) Hydro reserves the right to revise these dates.\n\nSee updated calendar on Hydro website.\n\n## Funding and credit quality\n\nMaintaining a strong financial position and an investment grade credit rating are viewed as important risk mitigating factors, supporting Hydro's possibilities for strategic development of its businesses. Access to external financial resources is required in order to maximize value creation over time, balanced with acceptable risk exposure. To secure access to debt capital on attractive terms, we aim at maintaining an investment grade credit rating from the leading rating agencies. Contributing toward this ambition to retain our credit rating, Hydro's targets, over the business cycle, a ratio of average Adjusted net cash (debt) to adjusted EBITDA below 2x. For further information, see Note 7.1 Capital Management in the Financial Statements section of this report.\n\n## American Depository Shares\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank NA, as depositary of the ADSs through its nominee company, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, held interests in 13,040,512 ordinary shares, or 0.64 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares as of December 31, 2021. The interests are on behalf of 264 registered holders of ADSs.\n\n## Major shareholders and voting rights\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Hydro had 56,562 registered shareholders as per the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS). The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries of Norway was the largest of these with a shareholding of 34.26 percent of the total number of ordinary shares authorized and issued, and 34.55 percent of the total shares outstanding. As of the same date, the Government Pension Fund - Norway (Folketrygdfondet) owned 6.91 percent of the total number of ordinary shares issued and 6.97 percent of the total shares outstanding. There are no different voting rights associated with the ordinary shares held by the state. The Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries represents the Norwegian government in exercising the state's voting rights. The state has never taken an active role in the day-to-day management of Hydro and has for several decades not disposed of any of the ordinary shares owned by it, except when participating in the share buyback programs. All shares carry one vote. It is, however, a requirement of Norwegian legislation that a shareholder can only vote and have preferential subscription rights for shares",

It's an approach that has existed within Hydro since 1905 and guided our development over the years. The Hydro Way originates from our company's identity - our unique set of characteristics and constitutes a way of doing things that differentiates us from other companies.\n\nThe Hydro Way explains how we run our business through:\n\n- \u009f Our values\n- \u009f Our purpose\n- \u009f Our operating model\n\nThese principles help us set priorities and serve as a reference point when questions arise. Our purpose is supported by our values and defines how we conduct our business:\n\nHydro's purpose is to create a more viable society by developing natural resources into products and solutions in innovative and efficient ways.\n\nIn order to ensure a uniform high standard, Hydro's constituting documents and global directives lay down requirements for our operations, see Corporate governance for more information.\n\nAll elements of Hydro's environmental and social performance are integrated in Hydro's overall group strategy. In addition, we have specific support strategies, e.g. on climate change, environment and people - as described in the Environment and social responsibility section.\n\nHydro has been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) each year since the index series started in 1999. We are also listed on a number of other environmental, social and governance (ESG) indices including FTSE4Good, and the UN Global Compact 100 stock index.\n\n## Our reporting approach\n\n- \u009f Integrity and compliance\n\nWe have based our environmental, social and governance reporting on The Hydro Way since 2004. Together with risk analysis and an extensive stakeholder dialogue we have defined the main elements of our reporting:\n\n- \u009f Climate change\n- \u009f Innovation\n- \u009f Environmental impact management\n- \u009f Organization and work environment\n- \u009f Responsible supply chain\n- \u009f Human rights\n- \u009f Local community value creation\n\nWe use the GRI Standard 101 (2016) in defining which lower-level topics and indicators that are material to report on. The analysis is also based on our continuous stakeholder dialogue with key stakeholders as collected and evaluated by relevant specialists and leaders. Learn more about our stakeholder dialogue. The materiality analysis is updated annually, to reflect internal and external developments, and approved by Hydro's Corporate Management Board.\n\nThe most material aspects related to our environmental and social issues are all included in the Introduction to the Environment and social performance section, which gives a high-level overview of Hydro's strategic direction, strengths and challenges. This information is further elaborated in other parts of this Annual Report. Our report is in accordance with the 'Core' option as described by GRI 101 (2016). Hydro's GRI index can be found at hydro.com/gri.\n\nThe information has been reviewed by Hydro's Corporate Management Board and has been approved by the Board of Directors. We comply with the Norwegian legal requirements on country by country reporting. The report has also been approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe underlying details in the reporting are based on different reporting frameworks that are important to us, including the UN Global Compact, the GRI Standards, the International Council on Mining and Metals' (ICMM) 10 principles and Position Statements and the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative's (ASI) 11 principles and underlying criteria. The GRI index at hydro.com/gri also shows Hydro's adherence to the\n\nUN Global Compact, ICMM and how we relate to ASI, UN Sustainable Development Goals and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights - and shows how the different frameworks connect with each other.",

However, information on the same material topic may also be covered elsewhere in the report.\n\n- 1) The topics are prioritized in four quadrants, but not prioritized internally in each quadrant.\n- 2) Topics marked (HD) are defined by Hydro in addition to the GRI defined topics.\n\nMaterial changes from 2020\n\n- \u009f Split the previous topic Energy, GHG and other emissions into the topics Climate change and Renewable energy transition. Other emissions has been included in Waste, effluents and other emissions. The changes have been made to better reflect Hydro's relative impact on the topics\n- \u009f Closure planning now includes the term legacy impact to emphasize long-term impacts of closure planning and Hydro's ongoing work in rectifying this through its legacy work\n- \u009f Ethics and compliance has replaced Anticompetitive behavior, anti-corruption and data privacy to ensure a broader scope\n\nWe have chosen to merge and rename certain topics, compared to the GRI Standards, to make the titles more relevant to Hydro's operations and thus more intuitive to our stakeholders. An overview of these changes can be found on hydro.com/gri.\n\n## Influence on stakeholder assessment and decisions",

In order to maintain uniformly high standards, we set common requirements in the form of constituting documents and global directives. Constituting documents are approved by Hydro's Board of Directors, the corporate assembly or the general meeting of shareholders, while global directives are approved by the President and CEO.

Information that Hydro must provide in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act, Section 3-3b is also included. This overview should be seen in context with the general corporate governance report provided in Hydro's annual report for 2021.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Norsk Hydro ASA actively supports sound management principles of corporate governance, and places emphasis on Hydro's compliance with the Norwegian code of practice for corporate governance and on explaining any deviations.\n\n## Deviations from the Norwegian code of practice for corporate governance\n\nIn the Board of Directors' assessment, we have three deviations, two from Section 6 and one from Section 14:\n\n## Section 6, General Meeting of Shareholders:\n\nHydro has two deviations from this section: 1) 'Ensure that the members of the Board of Directors ... are present at the General Meeting': The entire Board of Directors has normally not participated in the general meeting. Matters under consideration at the general meeting of shareholders have not previously required this. The chairperson of the Board of Directors is always on hand to present the report and answer any questions. Other board members participate as needed. The Board of Directors considers this to be adequate.\n\n- 2) 'Making arrangements to ensure an independent chair for the general meeting': Section 9 in Hydro's articles of association states that the general meeting is chaired by the chairperson of the corporate assembly, or, in his or her absence, by the deputy chair. This arrangement has been approved by the company's shareholders through resolutions at the general meeting.\n\nSection 14, Takeovers:\n\n'The Board of Directors should establish guiding principles for how it will act in the event of a takeover bid': The Board\n\nHydro has one deviation from this section:\n\nof Directors has chosen not to prepare explicitly formulated general principles for handling takeover bids. The reason for this is that the Norwegian state, represented by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, owns 34.26 percent of the Hydro shares (as of 31.12.2021) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries has by virtue of the Active Ownership Report (Report to the Storting no. 8 (2019-2020)) expressed a long-term ownership perspective in the company for the purpose of retaining a leading technology and industrial company with head office functions in Norway.\n\n## 1. Statement of corporate governance\n\nHydro follows the most recent edition of the Norwegian code of practice for corporate governance from 2021. Hydro seeks to comply with international best practice standards when preparing its constituting documents and global directives. The Board of Directors monitors the subject of corporate governance actively and continuously. The Board of Directors approved this statement on the meeting of February 21, 2022 through the signing of the Annual Report.\n\n## 2. Hydro's business\n\nHydro is a global aluminium and energy company with production, sales and trading activities throughout the value chain, from bauxite, alumina and energy generation to the production of primary aluminum and extruded products as well as recycling. Based in Norway, the company has approximately 31,000 employees involved in activities in 40 countries on all continents. Rooted in more than a century of experience in renewable energy production, technology development and partnerships, Hydro is committed to strengthening the viability of the customers and communities we serve.\n\nThe company's purpose, as stated in Section 2 of its articles of association, is to engage in industry, commerce and transport, to utilize energy resources and raw materials, and to engage in other activities connected with this purpose. Hydro is committed to creating value by taking a lead role in the green transition. Through this, we work to strengthen local community relations, communities and business partners through education and empowerment. Hydro's target is to ensure the safety of our employees and have an injury-\n\nfree work environment. Its business activities may also be conducted through participation in or in cooperation with other companies.\n\nThe Hydro Way represents our framework for leadership, organization and culture and is the foundation for our governance system, including Hydro's Code of Conduct which is approved by the Board of Directors. The board also oversees that Hydro has appropriate global directives for, among other things, risk management, HSE, people management and social responsibility. Sustainability, including environment and climate change, social responsibility, diversity, health, safety and work environment and compliance is integrated into the group's risk management and strategy processes and are at the center of applicable board considerations and decision-making throughout the year. The approach is discussed in more detail in the group's annual report as applicable.\n\nThe Board of Directors has an annual plan for its work. It includes recurring topics such as strategy review, business planning, risk and compliance oversight, financial reporting, people strategy, succession planning as well as health and safety, social responsibility, climate change and environment. The Board of Directors is closely following the market and macroeconomic developments relevant for the aluminium and energy industries.\n\nHigh on on the board's agenda was health and safety, including the Covid-19 situation, and implementation of the Hydro 2025 strategy 'Lifting profitability, driving sustainability. Extraordinary meetings have been held to handle critical matters.\n\nThe Board of Directors conducts an annual self-assessment of its work competence and cooperation with management, including an assessment of the chairperson. Further, the Board Audit Committee performs a self-assessment. The review was facilitated by the corporate advisory firm Egon Zehnder. The main conclusions of the assessment were submitted to the nomination committee, which in turn assessed the board's composition and competence.",

Equal treatment of shareholders\n\nHydro has one share class. All the shares have the same rights.\n\nTransactions involving own shares are normally executed on the stock exchange. Buybacks of own shares are executed at the current market rate.\n\nShareholders who are registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS) may vote in person or by proxy at the general meeting of shareholders. Invitations are sent to the shareholders or to the bank/broker where the shareholder's securities account is held.\n\nSales of shares to employees in Norway are conducted at a discount to market value. See also Item 6.\n\nContact between the Board of Directors and the investors is normally conducted via company management. Under special circumstances the board, represented by the chairperson, may conduct dialogue directly with investors.\n\nRegulation of share issues and preemptive rights are described in the company's articles of association.\n\n## State ownership\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 the Norwegian state, represented by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, owned 34.26 percent of Hydro's total issued shares. Hydro holds regular meetings with the Ministry, where topics discussed include Hydro's economic and strategic development, sustainability, and the Norwegian state's expectations regarding results and returns on investments. These meetings are comparable to what is customary between a private company and its principal shareholders. The meetings comply with the provisions specified in Norwegian company and securities legislation, not least with respect to equal treatment of shareholders. As a shareholder, the Norwegian state does not usually have access to more information than what is available to other shareholders. If state participation is imperative and the government must seek approval from the Norwegian parliament (Stortinget), it may be necessary to provide the Ministry with insider information. In such cases, the state is subject to the general rules that apply to the handling of such information.\n\nReferences: Learn more about major shareholders in the Shareholder information and sale of the Hydro share to employees\n\nin Note 9.2 Employee remuneration to the consolidated financial statements.

It is among the most traded shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange and is subject to efficient pricing. As of December 31, 2021 the Norwegian state, represented by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, owned 34.26 percent of Hydro's shares, while the Government Pension Fund Norway owned 6.91 percent. Shareholding is based on information from the Norwegian Central Securities Depositary (VPS) as of December 31, 2021. Due to lending of shares, an investor's holdings registered in its VPS account may vary.\n\nReferences: Learn more about Hydro's equity and dividend policy under Shareholder information.\n\n## 6. General meeting of shareholders\n\nThe annual general meeting, to which all shareholders are invited, is the company's highest governing body. The company's articles of association are adopted here.\n\nIn 2021, the annual general meeting was held on 6 May and 57.67 percent of the total share capital was represented.\n\nThe annual general meeting was conducted digitally due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with a live webcast and electronic voting on each item.\n\nNotice to a general meeting with supporting information is normally published on hydro.com more than three weeks in advance and is sent to the shareholders at least three weeks prior to the meeting.\n\nNotice to a general meeting provides information on the procedures which shareholders must follow to participate in and vote at the meeting. Such notice also details:\n\n- \u009f the right of shareholders to propose resolutions for consideration by the general meeting of shareholders\n- \u009f the procedure for representation by proxy, including the use of a form of proxy\n- \u009f the website where the notice of the meeting and other supporting documents will be made available\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA has purchased and maintains a Directors and Officers Liability Insurance on behalf of the members of the Board of Directors and the CEO. The insurance also covers any employee acting in a managerial capacity and includes controlled subsidiaries. The insurance policy is issued by a reputable insurer with an appropriate rating.\n\nReferences: Hydro's articles of association are available at hydro. com/governance. Learn more about The Hydro Way and Hydro's corporate directives at hydro.com/principles.\n\n## 3. Equity and dividend\n\nIn the opinion of the Board of Directors, Hydro's equity capital is appropriate to the company's objectives, strategy and risk profile.\n\nHydro's dividend policy was revised in 2021, reflecting Hydro's ambitions to lift performance and cash returns to shareholder over the cycle. The revised dividend policy is to pay out a minimum of 50 percent of adjusted net income over the cycle with a NOK 1.25 per share dividend floor.\n\nThe dividend per share is proposed by the Board of Directors, based on Hydro's dividend policy, and approved by the general meeting of shareholders.\n\nThe Board of Directors may obtain authorization from the general meeting of shareholders to buy back Hydro shares in the market. In such cases, the board will normally request that the shares are acquired in the open market, and that the authority lasts no longer than until the next general meeting.\n\nWhen the general meeting of shareholders considers whether or not to authorize the Board of Directors to carry out share capital increases for different purposes, each purpose must be considered separately by the meeting. Such authorization will be limited in time and will last no longer than until the date of the next general meeting. Authorization granted to the Board of Directors is restricted to specific purposes. Such authorization was last given in 2010 in connection with the Vale transaction.\n\nSee also item 4.\n\nReferences: Learn more about Hydro's equity and dividend policy in Shareholder information.",

Nomination committee\n\nThe nomination committee is comprised of minimum three members, maximum four, who are either shareholders or shareholder representatives. The committee's chairperson and members are appointed by the general meeting of shareholders. At least two, including the chairperson, must be elected from the shareholder-elected representatives in the corporate assembly. If the chairperson resigns as member of the nomination committee during the electoral period, the nomination committee shall elect among its members a new chairperson for the remainder of the new chairpersons electoral period.\n\nAll members of the nomination committee are independent of the Board of Directors. In accordance with Section 5A of Hydro's articles of association, the company must appoint a nomination committee. The main task is to provide a recommendation to the company's general meeting on the election of members to the corporate assembly, and a recommendation to the corporate assembly on the election of the shareholders' representatives on the BoD. In addition, the nomination committee submits proposals for remuneration to the members and deputies of the BoD and the corporate assembly and carries out an annual evaluation of the board's work.\n\nThe guidelines for the nomination committee have been approved by the annual general meeting, which also determines the remuneration to the committee members. All shareholders may propose candidates for the nomination committee at any time. In order to be considered at the next ordinary election, proposals must be submitted by the end of November in the year before the election year.\n\nThe recommendations of the nomination committee include details on the candidates' background and independence.\n\nThe nomination committee ensures that due attention is paid to the interests of the shareholder community and the company's requirements for competence, capacity and diversity. The nomination committee also takes account of relevant statutory requirements regarding the composition of the company's governing bodies.\n\nAccording to its mandate, the nomination committee shall be receptive to external views and shall ensure that any deadlines for proposals regarding members of the corporate assembly, the nomination committee and the BoD are\n\npublished well in advance on the company's website. In carrying out its duties the nomination committee should actively maintain contact with the shareholder community and should ensure that its recommendations are anchored with major shareholders.\n\nAll members of the nomination committee are independent of Hydro's Board of Directors, CEO and other executive management staff. As the largest shareholder, the Norwegian state is represented on the nomination committee by Morten Str\u00f8mgren from the Ministry of Industry and Fisheries and the Government Pension Fund Norway (Folketrygdfondet) by Nils Bastiansen.\n\nReferences: Information on Hydro's articles of association, the nomination committee and its members can be found on hydro.com/ governance. This is also where nominations to the committee can be submitted electronically.\n\nDeviations: See the first page of this section.\n\n## 8. Corporate assembly and Board of Directors composition and independence\n\nDetailed information about each board member can be found in the corporate governance chapter.\n\nAll board members, members of the board committees and members of the corporate assembly are independent of the company's executive management and material business relationships. One member and one deputy member of the corporate assembly are dependent of one of Hydro's largest shareholders: Kjetil Houg is CEO of the Government Pension Fund Norway (Folketrygdfondet) and was elected as a member of the corporate assembly in 2020. Nils Bastiansen, who is also an employee of the Government Pension Fund Norway, is a deputy member of the corporate assembly. Board member Liselott Kilaas is a board member of the Government Pension Fund Norway.\n\nThomas Schulz was, as of December 31, 2021 the CEO of the listed company FLSchmidt. Sales and purchases between FLSchmidt and fully owned Hydro subsidiaries totaled EUR 74,000 and BRL 7,094,000 in 2021. Schulz was not directly involved in these transactions.\n\nTwo-thirds of the corporate assembly and their deputies are elected by the general meeting of shareholders. The nomination committee nominates candidates with a view to\n\nThe following information is available at Hydro's website:\n\n- \u009f how to make proposals for resolutions for consideration by the general meeting or how to comment on matters for which no resolution is proposed\n- \u009f information on the right of shareholders to propose matters for consideration by the general meeting of shareholders\n- \u009f form of proxy\n\nOur aim is that resolution proposals and supporting information that are distributed are sufficiently detailed and comprehensive to enable shareholders to reach decisions on the matters to be considered at the meeting.\n\nThe notification deadline for shareholders wishing to attend the general meeting is no more than five days prior to the meeting.\n\nShares registered in a nominee account must be reregistered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS) and be registered in the VPS on the fifth working day before the general meeting in order to obtain voting rights Shareholders who are unable to attend in person may vote by proxy. Hydro will nominate a person who will be available to vote on behalf of shareholders as their proxy.\n\nThe general meeting votes for each candidate nominated for election to the company's corporate assembly and nomination committee.\n\nTo the extent possible, the form of proxy will facilitate separate voting instructions for each matter to be considered by the meeting and for each of the candidates nominated for election. It is possible to vote electronically in advance.\n\nThe general meeting is led by the chairperson of the corporate assembly, or, in his or her absence, by the deputy chair.\n\nThe chairperson of the Board of Directors, minimum one nomination committee representative, the President & CEO, the CFO and the company's auditor attend the general meeting.\n\nReferences: Learn more about the general meeting of shareholders at hydro.com/investor.\n\nDeviations: See the first page of this section.",

The work of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors (BoD) has established procedures for its own work and that of the company's management, with particular emphasis on clear internal division of responsibilities whereby the board has responsibility for supervising and administrating the company, and the company's management has responsibility for the general operation of the group.\n\n## Conflicts of interests and disqualification\n\nHydro's Code of Conduct contains guidelines for, among other things, how conflicts of interests that may arise should be handeled with. The code applies to all of Hydro's board members and employees. It is the opinion of the Board of Directors that there were no transactions that were material between the group and its shareholders, board members, Corporate Management Board or related parties in 2021, except those described under Item 8.\n\nIf the chairperson of the BoD is or has been actively involved in a given case, for example in negotiations on mergers, acquisitions etc., another board member will normally lead discussions concerning that particular case.\n\nThe board's rules of procedures also contain provisions that any board member holding a key position in a company with competing activities may not participate in the discussion of or decision on matters where competition-sensitive issues are addressed. Further, the rules of procedures state that each board member has a duty to continually assess whether there are any circumstances which could undermine the general confidence in his or her independence, and also how the Board of Directors shall handle transactions with closely related parties.\n\nThe BoD has an annual work plan, with particular emphasis on objectives, strategy and implementation. It includes recurring topics such as strategy review, business planning, risk and compliance oversight, financial reporting, people strategy, succession planning as well as health and safety, and sustainability, including social responsibility, climate and environment. The BoD is closely following the market and\n\nmacroeconomic developments relevant for the aluminum industry. Since 2001, Hydro has had an audit committee and a compensation and people committee. The audit committee has four members and the people and compensation committee has three members. The shareholder-elected members are all independent of the company. In the opinion of the Board of Directors, the audit committee meets the Norwegian requirements regarding independence and competence.\n\nThe BoD conducts an annual self-assessment of its work, competence and cooperation with management and a separate assessment of the board's chairperson. In addition, the audit committee performs a self-assessment. The review was facilitated by the corporate advisory firm Egon Zehnder. The assessment results are submitted to the nomination committee, which in turn assesses the board's composition and competence.\n\nReferences: Information about the Board of Directors and its committees, and the board members' competence can be found in the chapter Corporate Governance in Hydro's Annual Report 2021. The Board of Directors' mandate can be found at hydro.com.\n\n## 10. Risk management and internal controls\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for sound internal controls and appropriate risk management systems through, for example, an annual review of the key risk areas through the ERM system and the company's internal controls. The head of internal audit reports directly to the Board of Directors but is for administrative purposes placed under the purview of the chief financial officer (CFO).\n\nGroup Accounting and Reporting (GAR) has, on behalf of the CFO, the governing responsibility for processes across Hydro related to periodic financial reporting, and internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), and is primarily designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements.\n\nHydro's ICFR framework is based on the COSO 2013 Internal Controls Integrated Framework, which consists of five interrelated components and 17 relevant principles that must be present and functioning. The five elements are: Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Control activities, Information and Communication, and Monitoring activities.\n\nobtain a broad representation by the company's shareholders and other relevant stakeholders with competence in, for example, technology, finance, research, and corporate social responsibility. The corporate assembly elects the Board of Directors, including its chairperson and deputy chair.\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA has entered into an agreement with its unions to discontinue the company's corporate assembly. Hydro was in dialogue with the unions through the fall of 2021 regarding employee democracy in a wider context and as part of this dialogue has agreed with the unions that the Corporate Assembly shall be discontinued. The agreement will be subject to the annual general meeting's approval in May. The dissolution of the corporate assembly will be effective as of such approval. If the agreement is approved by the annual general meeting, the number of employee representatives on the Board of Directors of Norsk Hydro ASA will be increased from three to four.\n\nThe corporate assembly is a distinctively Norwegian governing body, which according to the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act exercises supervision of the Board of Directors. If the corporate assembly is discontinued, the authority to elect the shareholder-elected board members of Norsk Hydro ASA and to determine the board remuneration will pertain to the general meeting.\n\nIn compliance with Section 5A of Hydro's articles of association, the Board of Directors consists of between nine and 11 members. These are elected for a period of up to two years.\n\nThe nomination committee aims to achieve a board composition that protects the interests of the shareholder community and the company's need for expertise, capacity and diversity. Emphasis is placed on the members complementing each other professionally and on the board's ability to function as a collegiate body.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the 10 members of the Board of Directors owned a total of 89,346 shares in Norsk Hydro ASA. Hydro does not have a share purchase program for board members, with the exception of the employee representatives, who are entitled to buy shares through the Norwegian employee share purchase scheme. All share purchase transactions are conducted in compliance with the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.",

Remuneration of the Board of Directors\n\nThe shareholder-elected board members perform no duties for the company other than their board duties.\n\nRemuneration is determined by the corporate assembly, based on the recommendation of the nomination committee. The nomination committee recommends compensation with the intention that it should reflect the board's responsibility, competence and time commitment as well as the company's complexity and global activities compared with the general level of directors' fees in Norway. Remuneration of the Board of Directors is based neither on performance nor on shares or share options.\n\nReferences: All aspects of remuneration of the Board of Directors are described in Note 9.3 Board of Directors and corporate assembly to the consolidated financial statements. See also Hydro's articles of association.\n\n## 12. Remuneration of the executive management\n\nThe Board of Directors has established a remuneration policy for remuneration of members of the executive management. The remuneration policy states that Hydro shall pay members of the executive management a compensation package that is competitive, but not market leading, and in line with good industry standards locally.\n\nWhere appropriate, compensation packages should also include a performance-based component. The performancebased incentive schemes shall support Hydro's business strategy and long-term interests and shall also contribute to ensuring that the company is run in a sustainable manner. Performance-based compensation has been capped in accordance with the Norwegian government's guidelines on executive remuneration.\n\nThe company's long-term incentive program is share-based with a lock-in period of three years. Hydro has no share option scheme.\n\nThe remuneration policy was approved by the shareholders at the general meeting in 2021. A revised policy will be presented for a binding vote at the general meeting in 2022. The approved policy will be available on Hydro's website. A new management remuneration report for 2021 will be presented to the general meeting in 2022 for an advisory vote. The remuneration report will be available on April 8, 2022 on hydro.com.\n\nReferences: Hydro's remuneration policy is available on Hydro's website. All aspects of remuneration of management are described in Note 9.1 Management remuneration as well as in the remuneration report for 2021. The employee share purchase plan is described in Note 9.2 Employee remuneration.\n\n## 13. Information and communication\n\nHydro's corporate culture embodies the principles of transparency and respect for others. Our ability to operate efficiently in the Norwegian market and internationally requires consistent and professional communication. We therefore adhere to the principles of transparency, honesty and accountability when interacting with our stakeholders.\n\nHydro has established guidelines for the company's reporting of financial and extra-financial information - requirements that go beyond financial reporting, such as the environment, social conditions and corporate governance. These guidelines are based on transparency and consideration of the requirement for equal treatment of all players in the securities market. This also pertains to contact with shareholders outside of the annual general meeting.\n\nShareholder information is available on hydro.com. The financial statements and Annual Report are sent free of charge to shareholders on request. Notice of general meeting of shareholders is sent directly to shareholders with known addresses unless they have consented to receive these documents electronically. All information sent to the shareholders is made available on hydro.com when distributed. Presentation of the quarterly reports as well as the annual general meeting are simultaneously broadcasted through webcasts. All relevant information is sent to the Oslo Stock Exchange electronically for public storage.\n\nOur overall control environment for financial reporting is governed by our ICFR Global Directives, and reflects the tone set by the common attitudes, ethics, and values, and competence of top management and management, and all the rest of our employees.\n\nThe ICFR framework is implemented through a risk-based and top-down approach, to provide appropriate organization of the financial reporting, ensuring that Hydro's activities, accounts and management are subject to adequate control.\n\nHydro's disclosure committee assists the CEO and the CFO in ensuring fairness, accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of Hydro's public reports and disclosures. The disclosure committee is also an integral component of Hydro's disclosure controls and procedures, and assesses Hydro's effectiveness and compliance initiatives pertaining to ICFR. The disclosure committee reports quarterly a summary of its activities to the board audit committee. Through reporting from the disclosure committee, the audit committee takes an active role in ensuring the functioning of the ICFR framework. The Board of Directors meets regularly with the external auditor without members of the corporate management present.\n\nThe audit committee has established a pre-approval policy governing the engagement of Hydro's primary external auditors for audit and non-audit services to Hydro or any entity within the group. Under this pre-approval policy, the audit committee has defined and pre-approved subcategories of audit and non-audit services. The audit committee's preapproval policy includes annual monetary frames for each of the following categories of services:\n\n- \u009f Audit-related\n- \u009f Audit\n- \u009f Tax\n- \u009f Other - not related to financial audit and tax\n\nWithin the scope of the pre-approval policy, all services shall be pre-approved. The reported amounts for audit, auditrelated, tax and other non-audit-related services are within the monetary frames established by the audit committee.\n\nHydro's internal control system includes all parts of Hydro's corporate directives, including our code of conduct and HSE and corporate social responsibility requirements.

It is also included as a separate agenda item to be approved by the annual general meeting of shareholders.\n\nThe new Public Audit Act entered into force on January 1, 2021. Extended tasks related to selection of an external auditor, purchase of audit services and follow-up of the external auditor are handled by the audit committee.\n\nIn 2020, the annual general meeting chose to retain KPMG as external auditor for the group, in accordance with a tender process. KPMG has been the auditor for Hydro since 2010. Lead Audit Partner has been part of the audit team since 2017. The lead Audit partner rotates every 7 years.\n\nReferences: See Note 10.4 Auditor's remuneration to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nHydro has emergency plans in place at the relevant levels in the organization. These plans are exercised regularly. Rules for who can speak on behalf of the company are regulated through Hydro's Code of Conduct.\n\nReferences: A financial calendar is available in Hydro's annual reports and at hydro.com/investor where also more information about webcasts and the Hydro share can be found, including key legal information for shareholders in Norsk Hydro ASA. Hydro's code of conduct is available on hydro.com/principles.\n\n## 14. Takeovers\n\nThe Board of Directors will handle takeover bids in accordance with Norwegian law and the Norwegian code of practice for corporate governance. There are no defense mechanisms against acquisition offers in our articles of association or in any underlying steering document. We have not implemented any measures to limit the opportunity to acquire shares in the company. See also Item 5.\n\nDeviations: See the first page of this section.\n\n## 15. Auditor\n\nThe external auditor annually presents the main features of the audit plan to the audit committee.\n\nThe external auditor participates in all meetings of the audit committee. The minutes from these meetings are distributed to all board directors. This practice is in line with the EU audit directive. Each year the auditor presents the main elements of the audit, including uncorrected audit misstatements and internal control weaknesses.\n\nThe external auditor meets with the Board of Directors when the company's annual financial statements are approved. In the meeting, the auditor provide overview over the main elements of the audit, identified weaknesses in and suggestions for improvements to Hydro's internal controls. The Board of Directors holds meetings with the external auditor without members of the corporate management present.\n\nHydro places importance on independence and has clear guidelines regarding the use of services from external auditors. All services from the external auditor, including non-audit services, are subject to pre-approval as defined by the audit committee. The external auditor provides the audit committee with an annual written confirmation of",

We are committed to applying ethical business practices and compliance throughout our organization and supply chain. Hydro's board-sanctioned Code of Conduct creates the foundation that supports our efforts to do the right things and to always act with integrity throughout our global organization wherever we operate and conduct business on behalf of Hydro.\n\n## Our approach\n\nIn Hydro, compliance is defined as adherence to applicable laws and regulations as well as Hydro's constituting documents and global directives. Specific policies and procedures as well as guidelines have been established to assist line management to adhere to Hydro's compliance requirements. Special emphasis is made on reducing the risk of non-compliance within finance, anti-corruption, competition, health, security, safety and environment.\n\nOur compliance system is based on a clear governance structure defining roles and responsibilities regarding compliance and all compliance-related activities undertaken throughout the company.\n\nFor legal entities where Hydro holds less than 100 percent of the voting rights, we are working through their boards of directors to promote the principles in Hydro's Code of Conduct and our corporate directives. This includes, but is not limited to, HSE, anti-corruption and human rights.\n\nThe management of compliance risks, including risks related to corruption and human rights violations, are integrated in our business planning, enterprise risk management and follow-up process, including relevant risk-mitigating actions and key performance indicators. The progress of actions as well as any non-compliance matters are addressed in the quarterly internal board meetings that each business area has with the CEO, and an annual compliance report is submitted to the board of directors. The head of group compliance reports to the board of directors through the board audit committee at his own discretion and meets with the board of directors periodically and participates in all board audit committee meetings. Read more about Hydro's human rights management in the Human Rights section.\n\nCombating corruption and respecting human rights are integral to our supplier requirements, see Responsible supply chain for more information. Procedures are in place to assess the integrity risk of business partners and detecting fraud. Regular transaction-based screening of customers and suppliers is also carried out, see Note S10.5 Screening of business partners and supplier audits to the social statements. In 2021, Hydro continued to evaluate its integrity risk management approach to ensure adequate management of relevant risks.\n\nAn integrity culture index was introduced in Hydro's employee engagement survey in 2020, benchmarking the employee perception of our integrity culture. The overall score of the index was within the first quartile of the defined external benchmark, which was one of the KPIs of the CEO scorecard. The results, which identified strengths and weaknesses, provided us with a good basis for specific and tailored compliance activities which were undertaken in 2021.\n\nHydro's global data protection procedure constitutes the company's binding corporate rules for data protection (BCR) and ensures compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It was approved by the relevant EU data protection authorities in 2018. Designated data privacy coordinators for all business areas and staff functions form part of the data privacy network chaired by the head of data privacy. In 2021, we continued to work on the robustness of the data privacy network. Following the 'Schrems II' judgement by the European Court of Justice in July 2020, Hydro set up a project to follow up on the recommendations by the European Data Protection Board on transfer of personal data from the EU/EEA to third countries.\n\nWe are committed to building a culture of trust where employees are comfortable to ask questions, seek guidance, raise concerns, and report suspected violations. Normally, concerns and complaints should be raised with the employee's superior. However, if the employee is uncomfortable with that, he or she may raise the issue with Human Resources, HSE (health, safety and environment), a union/safety representative, compliance, legal or internal audit. The employee can also use Hydro's whistle-blower channel, AlertLine, where concerns can be reported anonymously. All employees and on-site contractors can use the AlertLine in their own language at all times via toll-free phone numbers, Hydro's intranet or on hydro.com. In certain countries, e.g. Spain, there are, however, legal restrictions\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are also a founding member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI).\n\nThe ongoing loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystems represent long-term risks for the industry and society at large. We see a need for more sustainable frameworks and participate in several initiatives, including the WBCSD's Ecosystem Program.\n\nTo increase our knowledge and secure a science-based approach to rehabilitation, the Biodiversity Research Consortium Brazil-Norway (BRC) was established in 2013. BRC consists of the University of Oslo and its Brazilian partners Museu Paraense Em\u00edlio Goeldi, Federal University of Par\u00e1 and Federal Rural University of the Amazon, in addition to Hydro. The scope of the consortium is to create a research program connected to our mining operations. The aim is to strengthen Hydro's ability to preserve natural biodiversity and to better rehabilitate the areas where we mine bauxite. Seventeen research projects are progressing, and more projects are in the pipeline.\n\nJoining forces in collective action is critical in the fight against corruption. Hydro has had a partnership with Transparency International for many years. Hydro is also a member of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN), which provides valuable insight into the maritime industry - an important part of our supply chain. Through Alunorte, Albras, Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Paragominas and Norsk Hydro Brazil, Hydro has been a signatory of the Business Pact for Integrity and Against Corruption since 2018. The Pact is developed by the Ethos Institute in partnership with global organizations such as the United Nations and the World Economic Forum, seeking to unite companies with the objective of promoting a more ethical market and to eradicate bribery and corruption in Brazil.\n\nHydro has had a long-standing partnership with Amnesty International Norway since 2002. The partnership is based on human rights education and dialogue meetings on relevant human rights dilemmas. We have also cooperated for many years with the Danish Institute for Human Rights for external expertise to further develop, maintain and strengthen our approach to human rights, including important input to develop our human rights procedures related to internal operations as well as the supply chain. The partnership was concluded at the end of 2021, but Hydro is still a member of their Nordic business network. To contribute to the strengthening of human rights frameworks, we also participate in other relevant forums, such as ICMM, ASI and UN Forum on Business and Human Rights.\n\nHydro is a Signature Partner of UNICEF Norway to contribute to quality education for children and adolescents. For information about our community investments and social programs, see the Community investments and social programs section. In 2021, Hydro participated in the Global Child Forum's Business Sounding Board. UNICEF and the Global Child Forum have guided us in the development of Hydro's child rights program.\n\nIn addition, we cooperate with global and local industry organizations, NGOs and other organizations. See hydro.com for an overview of important partnerships. For information about how we collaborate with other institutions within research and development, please see the section on Innovation.\n\n## Alleged and confirmed cases of discrimination and harassment\n\nNumber of cases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Integrity and compliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non such reporting lines.

Every quarter, they inform the board audit committee and periodically the corporate management board about matters reported through the AlertLine. Hydro's internal audit has resources in Norway, Brazil and North America.\n\nFor more information about Hydro's performance on compliance, see Note S10 Compliance to the social statements in this report.\n\n## Transparency\n\nTransparency is key to creating a global level playing field as well as to safeguard the company's reputation. Hydro reports in accordance with the GRI Standards and supports the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Since 2005, we have reported payments to host governments related to exploration and extraction activities for bauxite. We also comply with the Norwegian legal requirements on country-by-country reporting. In accordance with the the Norwegian Transparency Act (valid from 2022), UK Modern Slavery Act and Australia Modern Slavery Act, we publish a transparency statement, see the human rights section.

As a global company, Hydro participates in a wide range of activities, from local community meetings to national and international multi-stakeholder and industry association discussions. We are committed to interacting with all our stakeholders in an ethical and transparent manner. We strive to demonstrate integrity in everything we do.\n\nOur dialogue and engagement covers a large number of stakeholders and individuals, such as unions, works councils, academia, customers, suppliers, business partners, authorities, industry associations, non-governmental organizations and local communities, including vulnerable groups. This is shown in the figure on the following page.\n\nWe consult with interested and affected parties in the identification, assessment and management of all significant social, health, safety, environmental and economic impacts associated with our activities. For more information regarding stakeholder dialogue and human rights, see our section on Rightsholder and stakeholder engagement.\n\nDialogue with affected groups gives input to plans, detailing our environmental and social responsibilities. We strive to act in an open and credible manner, and gather views from interested parties, aiming for a common understanding of the decisions that are made.\n\nAll business areas have a forum for dialogue between management and union or employee representatives. Hydro's Global Framework Agreement was last updated in 2016. While the negotiation of a new agreement was halted due to Covid-19, the parties are aiming to resume the negotiations in 2022.\n\n## Stakeholder dialogue in Hydro\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Society\n\n- \u00b7  Authorities\n- \u00b7  Academia\n- \u00b7  Industry associations\n- \u00b7  Local communities\n- \u00b7  Lobby groups\n- \u00b7  Media\n- \u00b7  NGOs\n- \u00b7  National and international unions\n- \u00b7  Politicians\n- \u00b7  R&D funding bodies\n- \u00b7  Public offices\n\n## Internal\n\n- \u00b7  Corporate Assembly\n- \u00b7  Board of Directors\n- \u00b7  Employee representatives\n- \u00b7  Employees\n\n## Market\n\n- \u00b7  Competitors\n- \u00b7  Commodity and stock exchanges\n- \u00b7  Customers\n- \u00b7  Insurers and banks\n- \u00b7  End users\n- \u00b7  Partners/joint ventures\n- \u00b7  Other business relations\n- \u00b7  Suppliers\n\n## Owners\n\n- \u00b7  The Norwegian government\n- \u00b7  Owners/ shareholders\n- \u00b7  Financial markets\n- \u00b7  Traders\n- \u00b7  Analysts\n- \u00b7  Brokers\n- \u00b7  Ratings agencies\n\n## Public affairs and lobbying\n\nHydro recognizes the value of engaging with public authorities and other stakeholders in relation to the development of various policy initiatives that impact our industry. We interact primarily with decision makers in countries where we have significant operations, such as Norway, Brazil and the US, as well as with regional structures like the European Union institutions. These interactions are mainly related to securing competitive, stable and predictable industry framework conditions, taxes and legislation that affect our activities.\n\nWe promote our views on issues of importance either through direct interaction with public authorities and other stakeholders, or through various industry associations. See GRI Standards 102-12 and 102-13 at hydro.com/gri.\n\nIn addition, we participate in think tanks, especially in Brussels, and engage regularly in discussions with various NGOs.\n\nMost resources are dedicated to advocacy activities within the EU, Brazil, the US and Norway, through business associations, and to direct dialogue with authorities and decision makers. When relevant, we are in dialogue with applicable tax authorities in Norway, the EU and Brazil. We may also discuss fundamental tax developments and issues with other enterprises.\n\nWe support the principles of free and fair trade, and efforts to create a global level playing field. In our advocacy, we also support the climate targets set in the Paris Agreement.\n\nHydro supports market-based solutions for pricing of carbon emissions, like the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). A decisive part of the EU regulation is the ability to compensate for the extra cost occurring within the EU, in order to maintain competitiveness for global industries like aluminium.\n\nThe European Green Deal was announced by the EU Commission in 2019, increased European climate protection targets 2030 were decided in December 2020, and the EU presented in July 2021 their Fit-for-55 proposal to enable greenhouse gas reductions in the next decade. It is a roadmap on policies to achieve carbon neutrality in the EU by 2050 and includes policies to develop markets for low-carbon and circular products, in combination with stricter targets for emission reduction. We see interesting opportunities in this roadmap as long as it is combined with competitive framework conditions.",

The following sections reflect the material topics identified in Hydro's 2021 Materiality analysis. We have an integrated approach to our reporting, and our Environment and Social sections should be seen in context with the other parts of Hydro's Annual Report 2021, in particular: Letter to shareholders, Introduction and Strategy section, Performance and Governance section.\n\nThis chapter is part of Hydro's reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards.\n\n## Environmental achievements in 2021\n\nIn 2021, Hydro's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decreased compared to our climate strategy's baseline, and we are still on track in to deliver on our target of total emission reductions of 10 percent by 2025. We met our biodiversity targets in rehabilitating land at our mining site in Paragominas, Brazil. We recycled 335,000 tonnes of postconsumer aluminium scrap last year, enabling the production of a record amount of our low-carbon Hydro CIRCAL product (38,000 metric tonnes). In our tailings management, we implemented the Tailings Dry Backfill methodology, developed in 2020. This allowed us to return the tailings to mined areas as part of our land rehabilitation, and eliminated the need to build new tailings storage facilities. We have set new ambitions toward 2050, and aim to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and no net loss of biodiversity in new projects.\n\n## Social achievements in 2021\n\nIn 2021, we made significant headway in managing our social impact. We educated almost 21,000 people as part of our ambition to provide quality education and capacity building to 500,000 people by 2030. Moreover, we contributed NOK 55 million in community investments, charitable donations and sponsorships around world. We set new social ambitions for 2050 in terms of managing our external social impact and aim to improve the lives and livelihood of people in the communities where we operate.\n\nA new diversity and inclusion strategy was established, and we met our 2021 gender targets for employees, with women comprising 20 percent of the Hydro worksforce. This was an increase of 2 percentage points compared to 2020. While our total recordable injury rate deteriorated from 2.7 in 2020 to 3.3 per million hours worked in 2021, the majority of injuries were classified as minor, with no life-threatening or life-changing injuries during the year. We recorded zero fatalities in 2021.\n\nMore quantitative information is included in the environmental and social statements with notes.\n\nHydro reports in accordance with the GRI Standards' 'Core' option. Please see our GRI index at hydro.com/gri.\n\n## Hydro and the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) embrace a universal approach to the sustainable development agenda. They explicitly call on business to use creativity and innovation to address development challenges and recognize the need for governments to encourage sustainability reporting.

In response to this, Hydro has set its own net-zero ambition by 2050 or earlier and believes low-carbon aluminium products can play an important role in reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Alumina refining and electrolysis of primary aluminium are energy-intensive processes and constitute the majority of Hydro's GHG emissions. The energy source is a decisive factor for total as well as specific emissions, i.e. emissions per tonne of product produced. On the other hand, aluminium can save significant amounts of energy and GHG emissions in the use phase due to its lightweight properties.\n\n## Our approach\n\nHydro's overarching ambition toward 2050 is to reduce the climate impact of our value chain through greener sourcing, greener production and greener products. A crucial step in this direction is to explore different paths toward achieving net zero goals emissions toward 2050 or earlier and reduce our own emissions by 30 percent by 2030. Combined with\n\ngreener sourcing, we aim to help our customers to reduce their emissions.\n\nHydro's climate strategy is an integral part of our overall business strategy, aiming at driving improvements and development within the company. Impact on the climate strategy is also a criterion for all significant investment decisions. The strategy includes reducing the climate impact of our operations as well as taking advantage of business opportunities by enabling our customers to do the same.\n\n## Greener production\n\nOur strategy emphasizes reducing our own emissions. We have established a roadmap toward our 2050 ambitions by reducing GHG emissions by 10 percent by 2025 and 30 percent by 2030, based on a 2018 baseline 1) . Changes in our production portfolio might influence these targets, but our aim is still to reduce our specific emissions, i.e. emissions per mt of aluminium produced.

Adjusted for ownership shares, our captive hydropower production is 9.4 TWh in a normal year. In addition, we operate a wind farm and purchase more than 9 TWh of renewable power annually in the Nordic market under long-term contracts.\n\nThe overall carbon footprint of primary aluminium is highly dependent on the source of energy used to produce the metal. Consequently, in recent years, the electricity grid mix has been a key factor in deciding the location of Hydro's investments. More than 70 percent of the electricity used in Hydro's production of primary aluminium is based on renewable power.\n\nThe Qatalum aluminium plant in Qatar uses natural gas as its energy source. The International Panel on Climate Change\n\nRolling in June 2021 1) , the baseline emissions currently equal 11.3 million tonnes CO2 equivalents (CO2e), including direct emissions and indirect emissions from electricity generation (Scope 1 and 2 emissions).\n\nInnovation and technology development are key enablers for reducing GHG emissions. We have initiated a significant R&D program toward 2030 with an ambition to assess alternative CO2-free processes across the aluminium value chain.\n\nWe are exploring three pathways to deliver zero-carbon aluminium:\n\n- \u009f Our own proprietary HalZero technology for carbon-free processes\n- \u009f Carbon capture and storage and direct air capture to decarbonize our existing primary aluminium facilities\n- \u009f Utilizing more post-consumer aluminium scrap. We aim to have the first commercially available volumes of aluminium with a near-zero footprint already in 2022.

We are now in the process of transferring Hydro's next generation of smelter technology, the Karm\u00f8y Technology Pilot, to our other primary aluminium metal plants, see the Innovation chapter for more information.\n\nIn Hydro Extrusions, our sites are working on different initiatives to lower their GHG emissions associated with energy and electricity consumption. As an alternative to purchasing the standard electricity mix from the grid, some plants have entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable power producers. Many plants are also working with partners and governments to evaluate the possibilities of installing their own on-site renewable power generation. The sites are also working to improve energy efficiency through benchmarking, process improvements and when investing in new equipment.\n\n## Increasing recycling of aluminium\n\nThe inherent properties of aluminium make recycling attractive. It can be recycled infinitely without degradation in quality, and recycling requires 95 percent less energy than primary aluminium production.\n\nHydro is a large remelter and recycler of aluminium. We remelt process scrap from our own production and from other companies, as well as post-consumer scrap from the market. Due to contamination and alloy identification, it can be challenging to maintain aluminium's high-quality properties when recycling post-consumer scrap.\n\nThe carbon footprint of recycled pre-consumer scrap or process scrap is dependent on its metal origin. Thus, process scrap from aluminium produced by coal power comes with a much higher footprint than process scrap from hydropowerbased aluminium.\n\nAfter the sale of Hydro Rolling, we no longer include the business in our reporting or ambition on recycling. However, starting from 2021, Hydro Extrusions is included in our figures. Reported volumes from Aluminium Metal and Hydro Extrusions are 335,000 tonnes of post-consumer scrap and 1,018,000 tonnes of pre-consumer scrap. Hydro has increased its ambition to recycle 660,000 tonnes of postconsumer scrap by 2025.\n\n## Post-consumer scrap\n\nPost-consumer scrap is defined as aluminium scrap that comes from products which have fulfilled the purpose for which they were produced. This scrap might range from aluminium cans with a lifetime of about 60 days to buildings with a lifetime of more than 50 years. When this scrap is recycled, it starts its second life as a recycled product, with no carbon footprint attached to it except from the remelting. As a result, postconsumer scrap has a carbon footprint of about 0.5 or less tonnes of CO2 per mt of aluminium. This footprint results from scrap collection, transportation, sorting and remelting.\n\n## Process scrap\n\nProcess scrap arises during processing of aluminium products, such as extruded profiles or rolled foil. During processing of aluminium, typically between 20 and 30 percent of the metal ends up as process scrap. This process scrap has high value, and its recycling rate is close to 100 percent. However, the process scrap has never fulfilled its purpose as a product, and thus carries the carbon footprint of the original primary aluminium from which it is produced. This means that the carbon footprint of recycled process scrap is equal to the metal origin plus direct emissions from the remelting process itself.\n\n## Rolling credit facility\n\nIn 2019, Hydro signed a USD 1.6 billion revolving multi-currency credit facility with the margin linked to Hydro's GHG emissions target. The margin under the facility will be adjusted based on Hydro's progress to meet its annual targets to reduce GHG emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2025. In 2021, Hydro's emissions decreased by 1.9 percent 1) compared to the climate strategy's baseline, adjusted for the Hydro Rolling divestment. Hydro did not expect emission reductions in 2021 due to higher production, but improved performance - especially at Alunorte - led to last year's reductions. Hydro is on track in delivering total emission reductions of 10 percent by 2025 compared to the 2018 adjusted baseline.\n\n(IPCC) recognizes natural gas as an important transition fuel that can help reduce global temperature increases. Hydro owns 50 percent of Qatalum. Our share of Qatalum's production represents about 15 percent of our total primary aluminium production capacity, while representing 35 percent of our total equity Scope 1 and 2 emissions.\n\nEnergy efficiency is an important part of Hydro's ongoing efforts to reduce costs and air emissions. Our alumina refinery in Brazil, Alunorte, is among the most energyefficient refineries in the world. Switching part of our fuel oil consumption at Alunorte to natural gas with lower GHG emissions is an important enabler to reach our emission reduction targets. The project is on track to reduce emissions by 700,000 tonnes of CO2e by 2025. In addition, we are planning to install three electrical boilers with a potential to reduce emissions by an additional 400,000 tonnes of CO2e by 2025.\n\nAverage electricity consumption at our consolidated production sites was 14.1 kWh per kilogram primary aluminium produced in 2021. The global average was 14.3",

To address this issue we have developed a 'screw extruder' to handle thin-gauge scrap such as chips, swarf or shredded material. The screw will compact the scrap and the larger metal pieces will reduce dross generation in the recycler.\n\n## Greener sourcing\n\nThe greener sourcing element in the climate strategy refers to Hydro's position as a purchaser of raw materials and energy. Hydro aims to source less carbon-intensive electricity and aluminium metal with a lower carbon footprint. We also aim to increase the use of post-consumer scrap in our metal production.\n\nScope 3 emissions refer to indirect emissions from purchased raw materials and services. While Scope 3 emissions constitute a minor part of total emissions from Hydro's own metal production, we purchase a significant amount of cold metal and aluminium scrap from external providers. As Hydro regards the carbon footprint of process scrap as equal to its metal origin, Hydro's Scope 3 emissions are significant when including externally sourced metal. In total, Hydro's Scope 3 emissions were 17 million tonnes of CO2e in 2021, a reduction of 18 percent since 2018. The reduction was due to conscious sourcing of metal with a lower carbon footprint. Industry players who do not take the inherent carbon footprint of process scrap into account will report significantly lower\n\nGHG emission intensity -\n\nalumina re/fining\n\nGHG emission intensity - alumina refining\n\nTonne CO2e per mt alumina\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope 3 emissions. Hydro believes that this method of accounting is inaccurate, as it accounts for process scrap being carbon-neutral, when in reality the process scrap has the same inherent carbon footprint as its metal origin. Hydro believes that we need to focus on what drives real change toward the green transition and we need to exercise our role as a responsible supplier and customer to influence the right development. If Hydro were to regard process scrap as carbon-neutral, Hydro's Scope 3 emissions would be 10 million tonnes CO2e in 2021.\n\n## Greener products\n\nAluminium has significant carbon footprint benefits in its use phase, especially due to its lightweight properties.\n\nWe work closely with customers to develop products that save energy and reduce emissions. Examples include lighter transportation, better packaging to reduce cooling needs and food spoilage, and aluminium facades that lead to lower operating costs and enable buildings to generate as much energy as they use during operation. As an example, replacing 1 kg of steel with aluminium in a car using fossil fuel or electricity from fossil sources reduces CO2 emissions by about 20 kg of CO2 due to aluminium's lightweight properties.\n\nWith 70 percent of Hydro's primary production using renewable electricity, and the low-carbon aluminium brands Hydro REDUXA and Hydro CIRCAL, we differentiate our\n\nGHG emission intensity -\n\nelectrolysis\n\nGHG emission intensity - electrolysis\n\nTonne CO2e per mt alumina\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo reach our ambitions, we are improving our processes to combine clean scrap with post-consumer scrap recycling. The technology is being rolled out to Hydro's remelting and recycling plants. These investments will increase our postconsumer scrap capacity by up to 20 percent at each plant.\n\nHydro's patented technology in scrap shredding and sorting is under further development, making it possible to produce high-quality products from post-consumer building and automotive scrap. Our Hydro CIRCAL product line offering aluminium with 75 percent post-consumer scrap has among the lowest carbon footprints in the aluminium industry.\n\nTo enable the sorting process of aluminium scrap by the different alloys to preserve the quality of the aluminium, we have developed a laser sorting technology, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). We have installed an industrial pilot line at Hydro's scrap sorting facility, St. Peter in Germany. We are now working on improvements of the pilot sorter to increase throughput and quality. Also, we have started development on a Hydro LIBS sorting machine that will be more flexible on the input of post-consumer scrap with a much higher throughput and more consistent quality of the sorted product. The ambition of the technology is to sort postconsumer scrap back into its original alloys for remelting in Hydro casthouses.\n\nOne of the challenges when recycling post-consumer scrap\n\nRecycling\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through our climate strategy, we aim to reach net-zero carbon emissions throughout Hydro by 2050 or earlier.\n\nHydro is a signatory to the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy has associated technology and market risks, refered to as transition risks in the TCFD framework. To understand the impact of climate change and the implications of the Paris Agreement for the aluminium industry, Hydro has taken part in the International Aluminium Institute's work to develop greenhouse gas pathways toward 2050 consistent with the Paris Agreement. These are in-line with the International Energy Agency's 1.5 degree scenario, combined with IAI's analysis of demand in the aluminum market and material flows. These pathways are integrated in Hydro's strategy.\n\n## IAI emission projection pathways toward 2050 2050 target\n\nTonnes CO2e/t primary aluminium\n\n2050 2030 2040 2045 2035 2005 2015 2010 2020 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Historic emissions of the aluminium industry\n- Below 2 degrees scenario\n- 1.5 degrees scenario\n- Range of CO2 emission intensities in the aluminium industry\n\nSource: International Aluminium Institute (IAI), Hydro analysis\n\nproduct portfolio from our peers, while supporting both margin and volume growth. Hydro earns additional premiums or volume commitments on its low-carbon products, and many customers choose Hydro's aluminium due to its low carbon footprint.\n\nReaching our 2030 climate ambition will result in an even lower carbon footprint from our products. By 2022, we aim to deliver the first commercial volumes of aluminium with 0.5-1 kg CO2/kg aluminium footprint. This is a significant improvement, compared with the current 2.3 kg CO2/kg aluminium in Hydro CIRCAL extrusion ingot based on 75 percent post-consumer aluminium scrap. Demand for lowcarbon aluminium products is increasing and it is expected to continue growing. Hydro will make key capacity investments over the medium term to ensure our recycling portfolio can facilitate the increasing demand for Hydro CIRCAL.\n\nThe production capacity for near-zero carbon aluminium will be developed in line with market demand for this near zero-carbon aluminium. This is also reflected in the ambition to deliver Hydro REDUXA 2.0 with a carbon footprint of less than 2 tonnes of CO2 per mt of aluminium by 2030. Read more about our pathways to delivering near-zero aluminium in the Innovation chapter.\n\n## Addressing risks related to climate change and adaptation\n\nOur operations and facilities are subject to risks arising from physical climate change that may impact our operations. Effects of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns, flooding, shortages of water or other natural resources, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. The changes may be acute and/or chronic. These changes could lead to operational and environmental incidents within our operations, for example by flooding of containment basins, increasing temperatures leading to increased emissions from processes, etc., that must be considered in our business strategy.\n\nIn order to reduce the risks for our operations and potential consequences related to climate change, we have performed extensive risk assessments. This includes modeling of future weather patterns and their impact on Hydro's facilities based on existing climate models and scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We have also assessed scenarios for policy and legal risk,",

If not correctly managed, land-use change, resource utilization, emissions of pollutants, and disposal of hazardous waste all have the potential to cause long-term, irreversible impacts to nature and human health. To minimize such detrimental effects, Hydro must ensure management practices are used to identify and address the environmental risks associated with its operations.\n\n## Our approach\n\nlonger-term ambitions to eliminate the need for permanent bauxite residue storage from 2050 and landfilling of all other recoverable waste by 2040. We also have the ambition to achieve no net loss of biodiversity in all new projects.\n\nAll of Hydro's sites shall follow our own internal policies and procedures, related to environmental management, supported by comprehensive health, safety and environment (HSE) management systems, audit programs, training and awareness initiatives. In addition, the large majority of our sites are ISO 14001 certified and many have received certification to ASI's Performance and Chain of Custody standards.\n\nThe goal of our 2050 environment strategy is to minimize our impact along the aluminum value chain by addressing the industry's key environmental challenges. We aim to do so by driving rehabilitation at our bauxite mine, developing and implementing viable management solutions for tailings and bauxite residue streams, while reducing waste to landfill from our downstream operations and significantly reducing our non-GHG emissions to air.

For more information, see our section on partnerships.\n\nThe Paragominas mine currently operates two tailings storage facilities. With the implementation of the Tailings Dry Backfill technology (see section Tailings and bauxite residue), the need for additional storage infrastructure is avoided and the need for expansion of existing facilities is minimized. However, the land occupied by the existing facilities will need to be rehabilitated in the future. When tailings storage facilities are closed, they need to settle for at least five years before rehabilitation can begin. This will be managed differently to the rehabilitation approach used in the mined areas due to the specific nature of tailings, and will require a tailor-made rehabilitation strategy.\n\n## Hydropower operations\n\nAll of Hydro's hydropower reservoirs are located within or in close proximity to national parks and other protected areas in mountainous regions in southern Norway, including Hardangervidda and Jotunheimen. In addition to potential impacts on biodiversity, including changes in aquatic and terrestrial habitats along the waterways, our hydropower activities may also have impacts on recreation and tourism.\n\nTo mitigate the effects of hydropower-related impacts on fish populations, we release fish spawn in almost 40 lakes and rivers according to concession requirements.

In 2021, we set an ambition to achieve no net loss of biodiversity in all new projects.\n\n## Mining\n\nHydro's only operated mine, the Paragominas bauxite mine, is located in the state of Par\u00e1 in northern Brazil. It requires the removal of vegetation, topsoil and overburden to extract bauxite deposits from 8 to 12 meters underground and disturbs relatively large areas. Paragominas is in an area that is recognized as the deforestation belt around the central Amazon region (Arc of Deforestation). In the municipality of Paragominas, there has been a reduction in forest area of more than 30 percent over a period of almost 20 years. Much of this occurred before the establishment of the mine, and the area had been exposed to selective logging and clear cutting before commencement of operations in 2007.\n\nWe want to rehabilitate impacted areas as soon as practically possible. The rehabilitation target is rolling, aiming to begin the rehabilitation of all available mined areas within two hydrological seasons after their release from operations. This definition takes into account the nature of the mining and rehabilitation cycles, and the time lag necessary to ensure quality rehabilitation to restore biodiversity. It also takes into account that land periodically needs to be set aside for temporary infrastructure, e.g. roads and tailings facilities, in order to safely operate the mine. This is what we refer to as our 1:1 rehabilitation target. This rolling target was again met in 2021, when we rehabilitated 100 percent of the mined areas released in 2019.\n\nWe use three different methods for the rehabilitation of mined areas, based on different needs:\n\n- \u009f Natural regeneration of vegetation\n- \u009f Traditional rehabilitation (plantation of local species)\n- \u009f Nucleation\n\nHydro has used nucleation in Paragominas since 2013.

As part of the two concession processes, we are assessing the environmental impacts on the regulated water resources according to input from local interests, relevant authorities and municipalities, in addition to our experiences. We are also carrying out environmental impact assessments and studies of mitigating actions for our hydropower operations in \u00c5rdal, based on a decision of the Norwegian Environment Agency (Milj\u00f8direktoratet) for the period 2019-2024.\n\nNew WMPs are expected to be approved by the Norwegian Government in 2022. We will launch necessary initiatives to comply with the WMPs to reach good ecological status, based on locally adapted solutions, cost benefit and dialogue with stakeholders.\n\n## Waste and efficient resource use\n\nOur goal is to first minimize the amount of waste produced in our operations, and then reuse or recycle it. When this is not possible, we shall deposit it in a secure way to minimize adverse effects to people and the environment.\n\n## Tailings and bauxite residue\n\nTailings from bauxite extraction consist of mineral rejects from the extraction process mixed with water and flocculants. The tailings at Paragominas are stored in dedicated tailings facilities, where the particles settle. Run-off water is collected in a separate water pond and reused. The water pond also prevents overflow to the river during heavy precipitation. The run-off water is monitored, and the water quality meets the requirements set by the authorities.\n\nHydro's Tailings Dry Backfill technology at the Paragominas mine allows tailings to dry in shallow areas before being excavated and returned to the mined strip from where they originated. The mined strip is then reshaped and rehabilitated with the ambition of returning it to original conditions. By continuously removing the tailings, the methodology eliminates the need for new permanent tailings storage facilities, including the need to raise existing facilities further. The operating license for this technology was received in December 2020, and it has now been fully adopted into operations at the mine.\n\nBauxite residue is a waste product of the alumina refining process. Its disposal is challenging due to large volumes and its alkaline nature. The residue is washed with water to lower the alkalinity and to recover caustic soda for reuse. Hydro uses an enhanced dry stacking technology for disposing of bauxite residue which allows for storage at steeper slopes, thus reducing the relative environmental footprint. The residue moisture content has been reduced to 22 percent.\n\nHydro participates in international collaboration projects investigating possibilities to use bauxite residue as a resource, for more information see the Innovation chapter. We aim to utilize 10 percent of bauxite residue generated from 2030.\n\nThe bauxite tailings facilities and bauxite residue deposits are regularly inspected by Hydro and the Brazilian authorities. They have also been reviewed against international standards by external international geotechnical consultants, NGI and Geomecanica, in 2016 and 2019. Based on the output of the 2016 audit, an action plan was created for tailings facilities at Paragominas, of which all 56 identified actions have now been completed. In addition, independent third-party audits are performed twice a year, to comply with Brazilian regulations and maintain the stability certifications for each tailings facility.\n\nHydro's bauxite tailings facilities and bauxite residue tailings facilities are operated in line with relevant regulations. For active facilities, we follow voluntary best practice and audits are conducted by international third parties. Hydro is committed to implement the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM), implying that tailings facilities operated by Hydro with 'Extreme' or 'Very high' potential consequences will conform to the standard by August 5, 2023, while other tailings facilities operated by Hydro not in a state of safe closure will conform to the standard by August 5, 2025.\n\nIn addition to the tailings facilities at Paragominas and the bauxite residue storage facilities at Alunorte, Hydro has closed tailings facilities in Schwandorf and Stulln in Germany that fall under the GISTM commitment. Hydro is a member of ICMM, which is one of the three co-conveners of GISTM alongside UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and PRI, an investor initiative in partnership with UNEP Finance Initiative and UN Global Compact.\n\nqualities. We also monitor the impact of our operations on aquatic life in rivers connected to catchment areas.\n\n## Water\n\nOur main impact on water bodies is caused by discharges to the external environment, primarily in Brazil (to rivers) and Norway (to rivers, lakes and fjords). Where the authorities deem it appropriate, these discharges are regulated by relevant permits. Withdrawal of surface water, groundwater and water through public water works may, in addition, have an effect on water availability at a catchment level or impact the ecological status of the water source.\n\n## Water stewardship\n\nThe use of water that is socially and culturally equitable, environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial, achieved through a stakeholder-inclusive process that involves site- and catchment-based actions.\n\nAlliance for Water Stewardship, 2019\n\nHydro uses the WRI Aqueduct water tool to perform an annual review of water withdrawal from water-stressed areas. The mapping of Hydro's sites in 2021 showed that less than 1 percent of our overall fresh-water input came from waterstressed areas, with regard to annual renewable water supply (according to the definition used by WRI).\n\nOperating in water-stressed areas is not considered a material risk for Hydro's key operations. Instead, the more material risks are linked to the management of excess water, and the quality of the external bodies into which Hydro discharges process water. Hydro is fully aligned with the International Council on Mining and Metals' (ICMM) current minimum water disclosure standard and we have started implementation of their new requirements, to be adopted by 2023.\n\nQatalum in Qatar relies on public water supply produced by desalination. Seawater is used for wet cooling towers at the power plant as well as for wet scrubbers at the potline fume treatment plants.\n\nOur hydropower operations, all in Norway, are covered by and categorized in the regional Water Management Plans (WMP). The water regulation in Norway is based on the EU",

Key air emissions from our operations include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, fluorides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and particulates. Emissions to the external environment are minimized through treatment of the effluent gases prior to their release into the environment.\n\nIn addition to reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Hydro's ambition is to halve non-GHG emissions from fossil fuels (i.e. NOx, SOx, and particulates) by 2030.\n\nFollowing a mass balance of mercury at Alunorte in Brazil, Hydro decided to install four mercury condensers on the digestor lines. The first condenser was installed in 2018, as a pilot, and its technical performance is being monitored prior to the installation of the remaining units. The initial timeline was to install the remaining units in 2020, but this has been rescheduled to allow for further performance optimization of the technology. Installation of the remaining three condensers is planned to start in 2023.\n\n## Tailings from bauxite production Tailings frombauxite residue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTailings production decreased significantly in 2018 due to the Paragominas curtailment, with a partial reversal in 2019 and 2020 due to the lifting of the embargo. 2021 production was back at 2017 levels.\n\n## Bauxite residue from alumina production Bauxite residue from alumina production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Tonnes of bauxite residue per tonne of alumina\n\nBauxite residue production decreased significantly in 2018 due to the Alunorte embargo. This was partly reversed in 2019 and 2020 due to the lifting of the embargo and ramp-up of production. Production in 2021 returned to normal levels\n\nHydro is also a 5 percent shareholder in Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Rio do Norte (MRN) 1) . MRN is the operator of the mine and is responsible for the management of its tailings system. Hydro works with MRN and the other shareholders through the board of directors and relevant technical committees to require the safe operation of MRN's tailings facilities in accordance with applicable laws and standards.\n\n## Other waste and by-products\n\nWaste is generated at all stages of the value chain. Our waste management approach is based on the mitigation hierarchy: finding ways to avoid, minimize and recycle waste rather than sending it to landfill.\n\nHydro has set a target to eliminate landfilling of all recoverable waste by 2040, and to landfill less than 35 percent of generated spent pot lining (SPL) by 2030.\n\nQatalum has a temporary solution for handling SPL in cooperation with local cement plants and they are working to find a permanent solution. The Albras aluminium plant in Brazil had a significant stock of SPL. This is being continually reduced according to an annual plan and target, and is delivered to the cement industry in Brazil.\n\nA large portion of the anode waste from our smelting activities in Norway is being used by Norcem cement plant in Brevik. The carbon material from Hydro is being used as an alternative fuel in the production process, which ensures safe treatment of any hazardous components. Hydro also has an agreement with a refractory supplier to recycle part of the bricks coming from relining the anode baking furnace.\n\nWe have initiated a research project in collaboration with Alcoa with the aim to material recycle first-cut SPL. SPL, or cathode waste, is generated from the electrolysis cells used in primary aluminium production.\n\nDross is a mixture of metallic aluminium, alloy components and metal oxides that is formed on the surface of liquid aluminium. Hydro's casthouses have treatment facilities to recover as much aluminium as possible from hot dross. Residual dross can then be sent to third parties for further treatment.",

Several pockets of contaminated soil, along with other waste that cannot be reused or recycled, will also be placed in the cell. The construction of the containment cell is ongoing and progressing as scheduled. The reuse of historic SPL as feedstock for cement production is also progressing according to the plan. Hydro has agreed to sell the site to a joint venture of local property and residential land developers Stevens Group and McCloy Group.\n\nThe Norwegian Environment Agency (NEA) has required Hydro to remediate historical contamination in the Gunneklev fjord through capping of the contaminated sediments with clean geologic materials. In May 2021, NEA accepted our application to extend the deadline from December 2022 to December 2023, to align it with the upcoming E18 road and tunnel construction project in the local area. Surplus geological materials from the road project can thus be used as capping material in the remediation project.\n\nAt former fluorspar mines in Stulln in Germany, security measures and rehabilitation have progressed as scheduled and according to the orders by the mining authorities. The management of tailings facilities at Schwandorf and Stulln is described in the Tailings and bauxite residue section.\n\nAt the Ashtabula legacy site in the US, demolition, environmental mapping, and assessment of alternative remediation solutions were key activities in 2021.\n\n## Spent potlining (SPL) from aluminium production\n\nThousand tonnes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- n Tonnes of SPL\n- -Tonnes of SPL per mt of aluminium (5-year rolling average)\n\nThe volumes of spent potlining (SPL) varies with the relining of smelter cells which is normally done every 4-7 years for established smelters. Furthermore, opening new production lines and closing down production lines will give fluctuations in the aluminium production, production, and due to the cyclical nature of SPL, a 4.7-year time lag in the SPL volumes. Hence SPL is normalilzed with aluminium production with a 5-year rolling average as the best estimate of a trend line. Increased production of SPL in recent years relates to higher relining frequency and restart of line B at the Husnes aluminium plant.\n\n## Closure planning and legacy impact\n\nOur 116 years of industrial activity has left us with some legacy assets and legacy sites. Managing these to protect the environment and human health is an important task for us. The ambition is to achieve viable remediation and restoration solutions and subsequently to return each site back to beneficial use. In the earlier days of our company history, rivers and fjords near our industrial sites became contaminated due to the release of waste products into the near waters. Some of these fjords remain contaminated and require our attention today, many decades after the pollution occurred.\n\nEven though environmental practices have been significantly improved throughout the years, today's operations have the potential to create new environmental or social legacies which we will have to manage beyond the lifespan of the industrial activity that created them. Examples are bauxite residue tailings facilities and rehabilitation of mining areas.\n\nThrough our closure and legacy management program, we aim to avoid or minimize the creation of new legacies and to minimize the impacts of legacies from the past. Our approach is to manage risks and opportunities throughout all phases of an asset's lifetime, including the investment phase (design/ construction or acquisition), the operational phase, and the end-of-life phase.\n\nIn 2021, we implemented a new policy on the treatment of closure and legacy costs in our investment analyses. Its aim is to reduce the risk of underestimating long-term closure and legacy costs, and subsequently reduce the risk of creating legacies which will have to be dealt with in the future at a disproportionate cost. We also initiated an internal project across our major operational sites to improve the way we work with proactive closure planning, legacy risks and legacy risk-reducing measures. The project will continue in 2022.\n\nThe Kurri Kurri aluminium metal plants in Australia was formally closed in 2014 and during the subsequent years, buildings and infrastructure were demolished. The proposal to remediate the site was approved in December 2020 after a rigorous assessment by the New South Wales' Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE). The project is primarily for construction of an onsite, engineered containment cell, to deposit the contents of an existing approved stockpile of mixed waste generated during the",

Our technology roadmap is our pathway to zero emissions and a more fair and circular economy. We aim to produce better and greener aluminium, and work closely with our customers early in the product cycle, to help them meet their goals for their market and the climate.\n\n## Our approach\n\nIn the mature aluminium industry, the development cycles are long, with a need for highly skilled technology competence. This includes smelter technology, new aluminium alloys with special properties, lighter transportation, better packaging to reduce cooling needs and food spoilage, and aluminium facades that lead to lower operating costs and enable buildings to generate as much energy as they use during operation. At the same time, our downstream activities are\n\ncontinuously developing new solutions with customers. More and more, this collaboration reflects design thinking, bridging the gap from idea to solution.\n\nTo promote innovation, Hydro has a technology board consisting of members from Hydro's Corporate Management Board. The technology board meets twice per year to set direction and priorities in the technology area. Business areas are responsible for their own technology development and for the execution of their respective technology strategies. A corporate technology office ensure a holistic and long-term approach to Hydro's technology strategy and agenda. The Chief Technology Officer leads an internal R&D network with representatives from the business areas and supports Hydro's technology board in developing overall research and technology priorities and strategies.\n\n## Ambitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n660\n\nThousand tonnes of recycled post-consumer scrap by 2025\n\nPerformance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n38,000\n\nTonnes produced of Hydro CIRCAL\n\n10%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUtilization of bauxite residue generation by 2030\n\n5,384\n\nThousand tonnes of bauxite residue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNet zero\n\nEmissions by 2050 or sooner\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEstablished toward net-zero GHG emissions",

The R&D unit in Bonn in Germany was part of the Hydro Rolling transaction.\n\nWe have three pathways to decarbonize our aluminium products:\n\n## 1. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) - decarbonizing existing smelters\n\nThrough capturing off-gases at smelters and relatively small amounts of direct air capture, we aim to reduce electrolysis emissions by 100 percent for existing smelters. We have evaluated more than 50 CCS technologies and developed a roadmap for testing and piloting the most promising up to industrial scale. The most likely outcome will be a combination of off-gas capture and direct air capture to eliminate 100 percent of emissions. Upstream emissions at the Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil will be reduced via fuel switch and electrification, and we will pilot hydrogen for calcination of alumina.\n\n## 2. HalZero chloride process - decarbonizing greenfield smelters\n\nThrough utilizing our proprietary HalZero chloride process, we can convert alumina to aluminium chloride prior to electrolysis in a process where chlorine and carbon are kept in closed loops, resulting in a fully decarbonized process. We have been working on lab-scale for five years on this\n\n## Emissions reduction pathway by HalZero Chloride process\n\nTonnes CO2e per tonne aluminium\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntechnology and have developed a roadmap for translating this to industrial scale before 2030. This way we can fully decarbonize the smelting process by eliminating emissions for both electrolysis and anode baking. Hydro's HalZero technology will be relevant for greenfield developments post2030.\n\n## 3. Zero aluminium through scaling up volumes of postconsumer scrap (PCS)\n\nWe plan to improve our recycling capacity to sort and utilize more difficult PCS aluminium. We already produce Hydro CIRCAL, a certified recycled and low-carbon product of more than 75 percent post-consumer scrap. To produce this with 100 percent post-consumer scrap in a profitable way requires utilizing greater amounts of difficult, unsorted and contaminated scrap, as well as electrifying or using hydrogen in our recyclers. Through utilizing screw extruders and laserbased sorting (LIBS), we will be able to process more scrap. You can read more about our recycling in the Climate Change chapter.\n\nFrom an innovation perspective, Hydro benefits from our broad knowledge and oversight of the entire value chain from bauxite mining, alumina refining, electrolysis of primary aluminium and alloy technology to finished products and recycling.\n\n## Emissions reduction pathway by Post-Consumer Scrap\n\nTonnes CO2e per tonne aluminium\n\n## Research and development (R&D) efforts\n\nOur R&D efforts are centered around the following:\n\n- \u009f Making products and solutions that promote the use of aluminium and sustainable development\n- \u009f Reducing energy consumption, waste, emissions and carbon footprint in line with Hydro's sustainability agenda\n- \u009f Improve productivity, energy consumption and emissions in our metal plants, e.g. by implementing technology elements from the Karm\u00f8y Technology Pilot in Norway\n- \u009f Improving environmental impact in Hydro Bauxite & Alumina, such as biodiversity, rehabilitation and utilization of bauxite residue\n- \u009f Using R&D and technology to ensure optimal operations in existing assets, including cost and HSE\n- \u009f Developing recycling technology and low-carbon products based on post-consumer scrap, e.g. Hydro CIRCAL. Increasing the share of value-added products and tailored solutions in collaboration with the customer\n- \u009f Building competence in batteries and hydrogen\n- \u009f Utilizing the opportunities of Industry 4.0 to improve process stability, productivity, cost and safety.\n\nThe greater part of our R&D expenses goes to our in-house research and application development organization, while the remainder supports work carried out at external institutions. Our main R&D centers are in \u00c5rdal (smelter technology) and Sunndal (alloys and casting) in Norway, Barcarena in Brazil\n\n## Emissions reduction pathway by Carbon Capture and Storage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* (Hydro CIRCAL)  2.3 kg CO2/kg aluminium",

This includes the Husnes line B in Norway, which started production in 2020, and as a part of the regular maintenance and relining of our electrolysis cells in all smelters, presently at Sunndal. Hydro has also started working on several initiatives to reduce direct CO2 emissions in primary aluminium production.\n\nIn the area of digital innovation we have developed digital twins; a digital simulation model of physical processes. In Hydro's digital twins we combine our physics-based models with sensor data from production and advanced analytics algorithms. Digital twins have successfully been implemented in the control systems of our smelters, providing more stable production at a higher performance, and we pursue this approach across other Hydro business areas. Exploring and piloting data science and robotization is done in Hydro Energy and Extrusions as well. Furthermore, throughout the development process of HalZero, we focus on automation and digitalization of significant processes to enable a viable commercial technology.\n\nToward 2050, we are exploring different paths for zero carbon technology in aluminium production. We are partnering with several start-ups and academic environments to explore\n\nand develop technology for low carbon concentrations, like direct air capture and the emissions from our own primary production facilities. We are looking into projects to replace fossil carbon in our anodes with bio carbon, and while it appears challenging, we are part of two R&D programs supported by the Norwegian Research Council looking into this. In addition, we are on track with our chloride feasibility project, supported by Gassnova, where we explore a new process based on aluminium chloride with zero CO2 emissions.\n\nTailings management and bauxite residue is a challenge in our industry. One example of our progress relates to the tailings dry backfill project which is described under Tailings and bauxite residue. Bauxite residue is a challenge in our industry due to its alkalinity and large volumes. Alunorte uses an enhanced dry-stacking residue disposal technology, which includes an improved residue filtration step and the in-situ mechanical compaction of the disposed residue. Alunorte is now using press filtration technology before transporting the residue to the disposal area. This technology produces a filtered cake with lower moisture content, which allows for the cake's further mechanical compaction and storage on steeper slopes, thus reducing disposal area requirements and environmental footprint.\n\nR&D\n\n## Research and development expenses\n\nNOK million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Current technology\n\nALUMINA\n\nCARBON\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInnovation and development initiatives are carried out in close collaboration between our production units, R&D organization and customers. We emphasize three main areas: the quality of our products, the efficiency of our production system and the development of new alloys. Our casthouse production process is based on our advanced proprietary casting technology, developed by the fully owned equipment producer Hycast and our R&D organization.\n\nQuality improvements are closely linked to our customer technical service, which addresses customer needs while improving our own casthouse process. We develop new alloys with distinct properties to support the development of new or enhanced applications within industries such as automotive, building and construction, and electronics. This work begins with developing an understanding of metallurgical processes that forms the basis for sample compositions and production methodologies carried out in laboratory or test production facilities. Full-scale testing is often completed with customers and/or end-users.\n\nOur 75,000-tonne-per-year technology pilot at Karm\u00f8y in Norway shows stable and excellent performance and produces the world's most climate- and energyefficient primary aluminium. We are now in the process of implementing technology elements from the Karm\u00f8y",

These include The Research Council of Norway, Enova, Innovation Norway and Prosessindustriens Milj\u00f8fond. The majority of the support from The Research Council of Norway is paid directly to projects administered or partnered by Hydro at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), SINTEF or Institute for Energy Technology (IFE). We are a partner in four centers for research-based innovation, supported by The Research Council of Norway: SFI Metal Production, SFI Center for Advanced Structural Analysis, SFI Manufacturing and SFI Physical Metallurgy. These are cross-disciplinary R&D programs with a frame of up to eight years. We are also a partner in similar centers for environment-friendly energy (FME). For more information, see Note S8 Financial assistance from governments to the Environment and Social statements about public funding.\n\nWe also participate in other national and EU-funded R&D projects on post-consumer scrap recycling technology, following market demand for products with a low carbon footprint. Our R&D program includes joint projects with external research institutes such as SINTEF, NTNU, IFE and the University of Oslo in Norway and the University of Auckland in New Zealand.\n\nSince 2016, Hydro has been a partner in NAPIC, the NTNU Aluminium Product Innovation Center. Its purpose is to develop new aluminium applications. A consortium that comprises several downstream industries has been established and five different faculties at NTNU are participating. To support and speed up the activity, Hydro has been sponsoring an NTNU professor in this area.\n\nHydro participates in international collaboration projects investigating the possibilities of using bauxite residue as a resource. An important example is with NTNU, SINTEF, Norcem/Heidelberg and Veidekke to develop a new type of concrete using bauxite residue as a resource to improve quality. We are also working with other aluminium companies\n\nthrough the International Aluminium Institute to solve this industry challenge. In Brazil, Hydro cooperates with the national Brazilian entity SENAI (National Service of Industrial Apprenticeship) mineral research area, UFPA (Federal University of Par\u00e1) and USP (University of S\u00e3o Paulo) on R&D projects connected to bauxite residue management.\n\nIn 2021, a consortium led by Hydro was awarded a grant for product development in green products connected to the product segments electric applications, automotive and large constructions. The Alugreen project will receive a grant of NOK 77 million over three years under the Green Platform program initiated by the government and managed by the Research Council, SIVA and ENOVA. The consortium counts more than 20 partners from industry and academia.\n\n## Product stewardship\n\nHydro engages in dialogue with customers and other stakeholders regarding the environmental impact of our processes and products. We perform life-cycle assessments (LCAs) for all major product groups to identify improvement potential. With other aluminium producers, we have developed a pan-European network of national initiatives to promote and recycle aluminium packaging. Many of these national activities emphasize education and have developed projects with primary and secondary schools and universities to stimulate the next generation to make their contribution to a better environment.\n\nIn 2021, we ran a blockchain pilot with the Hydro REDUXA and Hydro CIRCAL low-carbon brands. The pilot aimed at providing certificates and product passports with a unique digital identity that allows our customers and end-consumers to easily trace the origin of the product to check data, validity and authenticity. The digital product passport contains product characteristics and selected sustainability claims. Traceability and transparency are key enablers to build more-responsible supply and value chains. We know that more customers and stakeholders expect this to make informed decisions, and we aim to provide key sustainability data by 2025 at the latest.\n\nHydro is an active member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative. As of publication of this report, 61 of our production sites have been certified, covering Hydro's value chain from bauxite to finished products.\n\n## Aluminium in automotive\n\nThe growing use of aluminium in the automotive industry is being driven by emissions regulations, electrification and passenger safety requirements. Aluminium is well suited for automotive due to low weight, good strength and formability, corrosion resistance, recyclability and its energy-absorption properties that can increase safety. Lightweighting is particularly important for electric vehicles with heavy battery packages.\n\nThis is creating new opportunities for Hydro as an established supplier to the automotive industry in Europe, North America and Asia. Applications include extruded aluminium frames and sub-frames, body-in-white (BIW) components and battery casings.\n\nIn the Extrusion Europe and Extrusion North America business units, innovation, R&D and application development is predominantly targeted toward the growth in automotive and especially the e-mobility BIW structural markets. The commercial transportation market is another key area. For our Precision Tubing unit, innovation targets new aluminium applications, such as fuel and brake lines, with aluminium replacing copper and steel, resulting in lighter products with comparable performance. Moreover, Hydro develops aluminium-based material concepts for battery components and integrated solutions for thermal management and battery modules.\n\n## High level of expertise\n\nAn important part of Hydro's technology strategy is to utilize our researchers, operators and other experts in optimizing the operations at our plants. The competence base in Hydro's technology environments is on a high level in general and world-class in several core areas. As a result, we emphasize using this competence in operational improvements. Examples include reduced energy consumption in casting furnaces, new cathode solutions for relining of electrolysis cells, improved blending tools for utilization of recycled materials, reduced emissions, and improvement projects related to quality and productivity.\n\nUpstream, we prioritize our R&D and innovation efforts toward technology development and operational efficiency, while downstream, we concentrate on application and product development. Part of our work downstream is conducted together with customers, reflecting design thinking from idea to solution. In 2021, we prioritized more resources",

We have to consider our impact on society and on people's rights, spanning from construction to closure, in our own operations, the local communities we are part of, and in the supply chain. Hydro recognizes that businesses have a responsibility to respect, support and promote human rights.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe respect the human rights of all individuals and groups that may be affected by our operations. As an employer, owner and purchaser, an important way to respect human rights is to secure decent working conditions in our organization, in minority-owned companies and with our suppliers.\n\nWe do not tolerate any form of harassment or discrimination, including but not limited to gender, race, color, religion, political views, union affiliation, ethnic background, disability, sexual orientation or marital status. And we do not tolerate any form of forced or compulsory labor, human trafficking or child labor abuse. We support the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining.\n\nHydro supports the principles underlying the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Global Compact and ILO's eight core conventions, and we expect our suppliers to do the same. We are a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and are committed to following their principles and position statements. Hydro's approach to human rights is based on key frameworks that define\n\n## Ambition\n\n## Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupport a just transition by contributing to social and economic development\n\nhuman rights principles for businesses, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. For a full overview, see GRI Standards general disclosure 102-12 and 102-13 at hydro.com/gri.\n\nHydro's social ambition for 2050 is to improve lives and livelihoods wherever we operate. We will do this in at least three ways:\n\n- \u009f Support a just transition: Contribute to economic and social development in communities where we operate. Read more about Local community value creation.\n- \u009f Invest in education: Equip people with essential skills for future economy. By 2030, our target is to empower 500,000 people with education and skills development. Read more about this in Local community value creation.\n- \u009f Responsible supply chain: Ensure transparency and responsible business practices in our supply chain. Read more about this on in Responsible supply chain.\n\nRespecting, supporting and promoting human rights is the fundament of our social ambition.\n\n## Modern slavery transparency statement and Norwegian transparency act\n\nThe sections Human rights and Responsible supply chain have been developed to comply with the legal requirements as stated in the Norwegian Transparency Act 2021 (valid from 2022), the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, and the Australia Modern Slavery Bill 2018.

Rightsholder and stakeholder engagement\n\nWhen relevant, we consult parties that might be significantly impacted by our activities.\n\nWe engage and collaborate with stakeholders internally and externally to help inform us about and evaluate the effectiveness of our human rights management. This includes NGOs, unions, local associations, authorities, etc. as applicable. For more information, see the section on our partnerships\n\nWe are committed to the principles of non-discrimination and to respecting the rights of vulnerable individuals and groups. We aim to include vulnerable individuals and groups in our dialogues and to pay particular attention to these groups in terms of impact and remediation.\n\nHydro does not own any mining and/or exploration concessions in indigenous lands. Hydro respects the rights of indigenous people and traditional communities and acts in alignment with ILO 169 in engagement with indigenous people and traditional communities.\n\nDialogue with employee representatives includes involvement at an early stage in all major processes affecting employees, and we have a tradition for open and successful collaboration between management and unions.\n\nWhere relevant, and in line with our risk-based approach, we have regular dialogue with communities, and more frequent and structured dialogue in communities with higher risk of facing adverse human rights impacts. We develop and plan community dialogues in collaboration with affected communities, based on their needs and expectations. Community members close to our sites in Brazil and at several other major sites are invited to plant visits on a regular basis. See our section on Managing human rights risks for more information\n\nFor more information about our broad approach to stakeholder dialogue please see Integrity and compliance chapter.\n\nIndigenous peoples and traditional communities\n\nWe support the principles underlying the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples as well as the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention (ILO Convention 169). We recognize their rights to self-determination, to lands which they traditionally occupy, to their customs, traditions and institutions, and to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC). Below is an overview of indigenous peoples and traditional communities in the area of influence of our own operations and joint ventures. Please see our section on Managing human rights risks human rights risks in Human Rights chapter] for more information about actions and initiatives related to indigenous peoples and traditional communities. Please see Responsible supply chain for cases related to our supply chain.\n\n## Brazil\n\nIn Par\u00e1 state, in Brazil, several traditional Quilombola communities reside in the local communities next to our operations. There is no indigenous peoples' land in proximity of our operations.\n\n## Canada\n\nIn Canada, Hydro's part-owned primary aluminium producer Alouette is the vicinity of the Innu First Nation community.\n\n## Sweden\n\nThe wind farm project Stor-Skj\u00e4lsj\u00f6n is located near Sundvall in the northern part of Sweden where there is a Sami community.\n\n## Hydro's human rights management\n\nHydro's human rights management is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. The figure below summarizes how we manage human rights, and in particular the prioritized human rights areas, through four steps. An explanation for each of the steps is provided. Read more about our risk-based approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Policy commitment and governance\n\nHydro's Human Rights Policy was last updated in 2020 and outlines the company's commitment to respecting, supporting and promoting human rights. The commitment is integrated in key procedures, including supply chain management, new projects, portfolio management, and risk management. The policy is approved by the Corporate Management Board and is available at www.hydro.com/principles. Information pertaining to Hydro's human rights policies and compliance is regularly discussed with the Board of Directors, the Corporate Management Board, business area management teams, and relevant parties such as union representatives.\n\nFor more information on policy and governance across our business and with our suppliers, see Hydro's human rights policy.",

Please see Note S10.1 Reported and confirmed cases of non-compliance for more information.\n\n## 4. Due diligence: Identifying, assessing, acting,\n\nmonitoring and communicating risks and impacts Human rights due diligence is integrated in relevant business processes including the enterprise risk management process. Mitigating actions or activity plans are developed and included in business plans in the business areas where relevant. Business plans are monitored, followed up and evaluated through the year in regular internal board meetings. Human rights and other sustainability-related issues are discussed when relevant.\n\nIn line with our risk-based approach, we aim to conduct more thorough stand-alone human rights impact assessments with mitigating action plans where there is a higher risk for adverse impacts.\n\nBefore new projects, major developments or large expansions\n\n## 3. Grievance mechanisms and remediation\n\nGrievance, or complaint, mechanisms are important to better understand the impact of Hydro's operations on the rights of individuals and groups affected by our operations. Grievances may be of any kind, including social and environmental issues. In situations where we identify adverse human rights impact that we have caused or contributed to, we work to cooperate in, promote access to and/or provide fair remediation. See Managing human rights risks for more information concerning remediation cases.\n\nTo help facilitate informed and effective participation with people who are potentially affected by our operations, we establish or facilitate access to grievance mechanisms where relevant. We encourage, and will not retaliate against, individuals who in good faith ask a question, raise a concern, report a suspected violation or participate in an internal company investigation. Hydro is committed to not interfere, retaliate or hinder access to external or internal, judicial or non-judicial grievance mechanisms.\n\nWe have several grievance mechanisms depending on stakeholder groups. The whistle-blower channel AlertLine can be publicly accessed through www.hydro.com to report concerns involving illegal, unethical or unwanted behavior. See Integrity and compliance for more information. Grievance\n\n## Risk-based approach\n\nIn line with UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and with OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, we prioritize due diligence according to the following framework:\n\n| Factors for prioritization         | For own operations and joint  ventures this translates to                                        | For suppliers and contractors  translates to 1)                                                 |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Size of business                   | Number of employees and/or  cornerstone employer                                                 | Expenditure                                                                                     |\n| Nature of operations               | Footprint on environment, including  water resources, emissions, etc.                            | Suppliers industry.

We are guided by The IFC Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability in doing so.\n\n## Training and capacity building\n\nHuman rights responsibilities are part of Hydro's Code of Conduct, which is translated into 19 languages.\n\nTraining on the Code of Conduct is provided to employees. The Code of Conduct includes our opposition to all forms of modern slavery. In addition, more specific training on relevant human rights topics is provided to relevant functions and locations. E-learning on Hydro's Social responsibility, including human rights, is available to all employees. For more information, see Note S10.4 Compliance training. For more information about capacity building for external stakeholders, please see our chapters on local community value creation and responsible supply chain.\n\n## Improving human rights management\n\nWe seek to continuously learn and improve the management of human rights. The corporate coordination group,\n\n## Country human rights risk levels\n\nWe use country human rights risk levels in the countries where Hydro is present to help guide our human rights management. The risk levels are based on a range of independent human rights sources, such as Global Slavery Index, Heidelberg Conflict Barometer and Human Development Index. The following countries where Hydro has operations or joint ventures were in 2021 considered high risk: Brazil, China, Bahrain, India, Mexico, Qatar and Turkey. We use a more extensive list of country human rights risk levels for our suppliers and for other relevant procedures, including investment decisions.

We will also seek to develop targets on living wage in 2022. Improvements in 2021 to responsible supply chain and our procurement processes can be found in the section on Hydro's supply chain.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to build capacity on human rights due diligence and engage on business and human rights with external stakeholders. For instance, we participated and shared our learnings in a large number of seminars and webinars in 2021, such as the Global Child Forum and the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights. We also supported Amnesty International Norway in the development of a new e-learning course for businesses on human rights.\n\n## Managing human rights risks\n\nWe monitor Hydro's prioritized human rights areas and recognize that there are potential risks of adverse impacts concerning our operations. According to our human rights risk-based approach looking at the size, nature, context, severity and probability of impact, the main risks are:\n\n- \u009f Adverse impact to migrant workers at our joint venture in Qatar\n- \u009f Adverse impact on local communities in northern Brazil\n- \u009f Adverse impact in our supply chains for raw materials, hazardous waste services and agents and intermediaries for intervention with public officials. See Responsible supply chain for more information about Hydro's supply chain.\n\nWe have included below the most significant risks and actual adverse impacts that we are aware of through our due diligence processes, including grievance mechanisms. We have also described how we are working to mitigate or remediate these potential or actual adverse impacts. Hydro did not detect severe human rights impacts in our own operations in 2021.",

The baseline was conducted in early 2020 and in the last survey from the end of 2021, we see a positive trend in the perception of Hydro's social actions across all communities surveyed. Two communities reported a decline in perception between end of 2020 and end of 2021, highlighting the growing expectation for more strategic, long-term social actions to help mitigate economic impacts from Covid-19.\n\nWe have made progress in legacy issues related to identifying individuals directly impacted by the construction of a 244-km-long bauxite pipeline that crosses areas inhabited by traditional Quilombola groups in the Jambua\u00e7u Territory in Par\u00e1. The former owner of the pipeline is still the legal party.\n\nAs part of an integrated plan to remedy impacts along the pipeline, several agreements with families directly impacted by the construction, but not covered under the legal agreement with the former owner, have been reached. In order to reach further agreements with additional community associations, Hydro is conducting a mapping and consultation process with Quilombola communities to better understand the local cultures, traditions and heritages. This is being carried out in close alignment with the relevant communities and related stakeholders, including Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Cultural Palmares, State of Par\u00e1 and INCRA. INCRA is the Brazilian agency in charge of land certifications, including Quilombola matters, as part of the environmental licenses.\n\nHydro is also seeking to establish and contribute to a fund for social investments for the Jambua\u00e7u Territory. The program supports local associations along the pipeline to strengthen their legal, administrative and governance structure. We also\n\nhave social programs and other income generation initiatives, including traditional farming.\n\nSince 2020, a major project to replace the pipeline has been underway, taking place in stages along the pipeline. Efforts have been made to ensure good dialogue, information and participation, respecting local customs and norms, with those living close to the pipeline, including with Quilombolas communities. In 2021, impacts from the project related mainly to dust, increased traffic and clouded water. Continuous measurements of the water and air in collaboration with the local communities showed no material environmental impact.\n\nIn the municipality of Oriximin\u00e1 in Par\u00e1, where the MRN 1) bauxite mine is located, there is an ongoing dispute between Quilombola communities and Brazilian authorities regarding title to land owned by the federal government. The territory claimed by these communities encompasses certain areas that are planned to be mined by MRN in the future, but MRN is not a legal party in this conflict. Hydro has requested through MRN's board of directors and committees that the scope of the planned environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) complies with local, national and international standards.\n\nMRN is part of the Sustainable Territories Program, a social program to promote long-term development of traditional communities in Oriximin\u00e1.\n\nIn Itu, in S\u00e3o Paolo, where one of our Extrusions plants is located, there are irregular settlements next to the plant's perimeter. A safety assessment has been conducted, and no further necessary mitigating actions were identified. Nevertheless, we have been engaging with local authorities to find resettlement solutions for families that live in houses closest to the plant wall. The process has been delayed due to Covid-19.\n\nHydro Rein is considering minority investments in a number of wind and solar projects in Brazil, some of which would require relocation of a few households impacted by the projects. Investment decisions have not been made at this time. Studies to identify and assess potentially impacted households continue. We work with our business partners to ensure the implementation of IFC Performance Standards on\n\nHuman Rights in security providers' contracts\n\n- \u009f Strengthening effectiveness criteria for grievance mechanisms\n\nIn January 2022, our external auditor KPMG was engaged to make an assessment of the maturity and implementation level of the action plan. The assessment is expected to be completed within the first half of 2022.\n\nRegarding the lawsuit made in the Netherlands by Cainquiama and nine individuals linked to Alunorte and Albras, please see Note S10.2 Legal claims to the Social statements.\n\nIn an area surrounding Hydro's operations in Barcarena and which is regulated for industrial purposes, illegal logging and irregular settlements have accelerated since 2016. We realize that we need to better understand the situation in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders, the municipality and civil organizations. In addition, allegations have been made by local groups about potential environmental impacts. see Note S10.2 Legal claims for more information.\n\nWe recognize the importance of respecting community health rights and promoting community health initiatives. In Barcarena, we are engaged with governmental organizations and civil society, in a comprehensive environmental and social assessment to better understand any links between potential historical emissions to air, water and soil, accumulated over time, and community health. Alunorte will also perform an updated socioeconomic study to assess if there were any significant impacts of the installation of the new\n\n<!-- image -->",

An adjacent Sami community will be impacted by the wind farm, as the areas are in some periods used for reindeer herding. Legal agreements on cooperation between the Sami community and the wind farm during construction and operation have been signed. The impacts of the wind farm will be minimized through mitigative actions proposed by the community.\n\nWe also have more limited operations in other countries where there is an increased human rights risk, including China, Hungary and Mexico.

These are described in our approach earlier in this chapter.\n\n## Qatar\n\nAt the primary aluminium producer Qatalum, a joint venture where Hydro holds 50 percent, close to 75 percent of the workers are employed directly by Qatalum. The remaining 25 percent are contracted workers that, for the most part, have a Qatalum-employed manager. Qatalum strives to secure good working conditions for all employees, and especially the conditions of the contracted workers. GIEK (Norwegian Export Credit Guarantee Agency) has conducted reviews of the social responsibility performance, most recently in 2019. Qatalum has followed up on the recommendations identified. While some recommendations were delayed due to travel and movement restrictions during Covid-19, several of the processes resumed in 2021.\n\nQatalum became a member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) in 2021. In December, DNV audited Qatalum against both the Performance and Chain of Custody standards with the conclusion to recommend the metal plant for certification. In 2022, we aim to work with Qatalum in addressing findings and recommendations made by DNV.\n\n## Workers' rights in Qatar\n\nThe FIFA 2022 World Cup has led to increased international scrutiny of the migrant worker situation in Qatar. The increased attention has led to a range of new government initiatives aimed at improving worker rights for migrant workers in Qatar. For example, the introduction of a legal minimum wage for all employees across all sectors in Qatar in early 2021 continues to help improve the worker conditions in the country. Improvements are still needed, and Hydro will continue to work to strengthen frameworks for working conditions in Qatar.\n\n## Other countries\n\nThe wind farm project Stor-Skj\u00e4lsj\u00f6n is located near Sundsvall in Sweden. Hydro Rein owns 49 percent of the project. A review of environmental and social risks has been conducted. No known non-compliances with regulatory requirements",

We also believe businesses have an important role in supporting and promoting responsible social and environmental behavior. We engage, influence and work with our suppliers for continuous improvement and to mitigate potential negative impacts to people and the environment in our supply chain.\n\n## Our approach\n\nA responsible supply chain is part of our sustainability ambitions. We will ensure transparency and traceability of key sustainability data for our products by 2025 or earlier. In 2022, we will establish a methodology, plan and time frame for implementation of this. Read about Hydro's social ambitions for 2050 in our chapter on Human rights. Our approach to responsible sourcing is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, and can be summarized in three steps:\n\n## 1. Mapping of risks\n\nAll suppliers are subject to a qualification process, including mapping of risks related to business practice, human rights, working conditions and environment. If we identify any concerns related to such issues, we conduct a more comprehensive review or audit of the potential suppliers to clarify if the supplier meets our requirements before any agreements are signed. The mandatory due diligence process for all suppliers is described in the company-wide procedure, Sustainability in the supply chain, and is based on three levels of inherent sustainability risk levels. See illustration on our supplier due diligence process.\n\n## Ambitions\n\n## Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransparency and traceability of key sustainability data for our products by 2025 or earlier\n\n851 due diligence processes carried out\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n40% of existing counterparties screened\n\n## 2. Clear expectations\n\nHydro's Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the minimum sustainability requirements for all our suppliers. The code is based on international recognized standards such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN Global Compact and the ILO Core Conventions, among others, to our suppliers.\n\n## 3. Support and development\n\nWe build our relationship with our suppliers on mutual trust and development. We actively discuss and promote ethical business practice, safe working conditions, human rights and environment issues.\n\nHydro's social ambition for 2050 is to improve lives and livelihoods in the communities where we operate. For more information, see Human rights chapter.\n\n## Hydro's supply chain\n\nHydro has more than 25,000 active suppliers globally. Most are located in the same countries as our production facilities.\n\nThe Hydro Supplier Code of Conduct was last updated in 2020 to be more specific on several requirements, especially on human rights, conflict minerals, working conditions, environmental and climate impact. The changes are based on international standards to which Hydro is committed, including the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI).\n\nThe principles set out in Hydro's Supplier Code of Conduct are made binding through contractual clauses to ensure suppliers and business partners reflect the values and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Responsible supply chain\n\nMaterial topics covered in this chapter:\n\n## Supply chain\n\nHuman and workers' rights\n\nLocal workforce and wage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEstablish methodology for key sustainability data in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

More details on these criteria can be found in the Hydro global procedure Sustainability in the supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprinciples that Hydro promotes. Standard contracts also include clauses on auditing rights and the supplier's responsibility to actively promote the principles with its own suppliers/contractors and sub-suppliers/sub-contractors of any tier that have a material contribution to the supply of goods and services to Hydro under the contract. Failure to comply with the principles may result in a termination of the contract.\n\nIn 2021, we finalized a new procedure on sustainability in the supply chain to ensure a company-wide implementation and follow-up on the sustainability principles set out in the new Supplier Code of Conduct. The documents are available on www.hydro.com/principles.\n\nSuppliers, customers and other business partners registered in our main accounting systems are screened weekly against recognized international sanction lists. We have also developed a spend cube to measure the impact of procurement initiatives and manage supply chain risk.\n\nFurthermore, supplier audits and site visits are performed by Hydro personnel and external auditors based on risk analyses. See Note S10.5 Screening of business partners and supplier audits for more information.\n\nThrough regular reviews, audits and other tools, we contribute to continuous development among our suppliers. Due to Covid-19 restrictions, we were not able to visit our suppliers as frequently as planned. We conducted 49 supplier audits in 2021, all including topics related to HSE, human rights and working conditions. We are an active member of the ASI and promote ASI's certification program to our aluminium suppliers for the sustainable development of their operations. We also cooperate with other external stakeholders, such as unions and industry associations, to develop and implement supplier development programs.\n\nWe engage and collaborate with stakeholders internally and externally when relevant, to help inform and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach to responsible sourcing.

Hydro has a complex and diverse supply chain. By utilizing the intelligence and performance improvement tools provided by EcoVadis, we believe we will be in a good position to streamline sustainability risk management, and to help us promote and monitor positive development of our supply chain.\n\n## Supplier development\n\nHydro works to strengthen and improve our suppliers' sustainability performance through dialogue, sharing of knowledge, innovation processes, incentives or supplier development programs.\n\nIn Brazil, suppliers can apply to participate in a comprehensive, year-long supplier development program. In 2021, 21 supplier companies participated in the third edition of the program totaling 127 participants. Since the program started in 2018, 69 local companies have participated in the program.\n\n## Managing risks\n\nThe prioritized human rights areas monitored in the supply chain are related to safe and decent working conditions, health, discrimination, freedom of association and collective bargaining. The risk of incidents of child labor abuse, compulsory or forced labor is also monitored. There have been very few findings of these severe risks in our supply chain in recent years. We do, however, recognize a risk of forced or compulsory labor among suppliers in the Middle East, South America and Asia. This is addressed in our supplier screenings, supplier audits and regular dialogue with the suppliers.\n\n## China\n\nIn early 2021, several countries introduced sanctions on officials in China over alleged human right violations against the mostly Muslim Uighur minority group, mainly in the Xinjiang region. Hydro has confirmed that we do not source material and alloys from the Xinjiang region. We continue to monitor the situation.\n\n## Guinea\n\nIn 2021, we closely monitored potential human rights and environmental violations related to bauxite mining in Guinea. Hydro does not source bauxite directly from Guinea, but some of the alumina Hydro sources in Europe and a part of the primary metal sourced externally have their bauxite origin in Guinea. We followed closely the complaints process related to the expansion of the CBG mine raised to the Compliance Officer in CAO (the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman for the International Finance Corporation). We have requested more information from both parties in the complaints case, the mine operator and the NGOs representing the impacted villagers.\n\n## Norway\n\nIn Norway, Hydro has an offtake agreement with Statkraft on power from the new Fosen wind power installation. The projects on the Fosen peninsula are located within Sami reindeer grazing land. Agreements on mitigating measures and compensation for extra costs during the construction phase were previously entered into with the two affected reindeer herding groups. In August 2021, the Norwegian supreme court determined that the construction of the wind park had not sufficiently taken into account the rights of the Sami population. The consequences of the verdict are being assessed by the responsible ministry. Hydro is monitoring the situation and following up with Statkraft.",

Through offering jobs, buying services, paying taxes and fees, and by trying to be good neighbors, we contribute to the society to which we belong. We constantly strive to make a positive difference in these communities. This is integrated into our purpose, values and business strategy.\n\n## Our approach\n\nA key element in Hydro's approach to local community value creation is to strengthen the societies and communities where we operate. The way we do this differs from country to country and from community to community. The main contribution is generated from our operations through production and purchase of goods and services, direct and indirect job creation, and tax payments. We engage in capacity building through targeted programs, to develop the competence of groups as well as individuals, and we have partnerships aiming to further enhance the public's knowledge about Hydro and its operations. Hydro has corporate requirements on management of community investments, charitable donations and sponsorships. Read about Hydro's social ambitions for 2050 in our chapter on Human rights.\n\nEducation and skills development target\n\nIn this area, we have developed a methodology to measure the target to ensure consistency across the company. The methodology can be accessed here. The insight from measuring the people reached and the impact of our\n\n## Ambition\n\n## Performance\n\n## 500,000\n\nPeople equipped with essential skills for the future economy through education and skills development by 2030\n\n21,000\n\nPeople educated or trained in 2021 as part of target\n\ninitiatives make us better equipped to select and execute future initiatives with a positive impact.\n\nIn 2021, we reached more than 20,000 people, which implies that we have reached close to 130,000 in total since 2018. In 2020, we saw an exceptional result with close to 59,000 people reached. Roughly 50 percent were reached through a project with UNICEF in India. Furthermore, with the divestment last uear of our business area Rolling, the 2021 result was expected to be lower than in previous years. We are still on track to reach 500,000 by year-end 2030. Continuous improvement of current initiatives and the development of new high-impact initiatives are important going forward.\n\n## Community investments and social programs\n\nWe have a magnitude of social programs based on local needs and customs. Some of our community investments and programs are linked to mining license requirements, while others are voluntary commitments. The programs target education, economic growth, decent work, capacity building and strengthening of institutions.\n\nMany social programs have been transferred to digital platforms due to Covid-19 and will continue with digital offering also after the pandemic to reach more people.

The programs support quality education, income generation, access to and the strengthening of public services, and they place emphasis on enabling stakeholders to drive change and development. For each program we have an external implementation partner. By establishing contact between the partners, synergies have been identified. In 2021, the partners introduced several joint initiatives to contribute toward the common goal of local development. We also continued training for community leaders in leadership and administration in the communities where we operate, and technical training for community members along the bauxite pipeline from Paragominas to Alunorte (see managing human rights risks in Human rigths chapter) to strengthen their job opportunities. We also work to establish social programs and income generation initiatives, including traditional farming and livelihoods, along the pipeline.\n\nWe initiated the Sustainable Barcarena Initiative (SBI) in 2018. This is an independent platform for sustainable development in Barcarena in Par\u00e1 state. The overall aim is to bring local stakeholders together to discuss challenges and opportunities, strengthen capabilities and ultimately invest in the social initiatives they plan and develop together. In 2021, about 120 people participated in meetings, dialogues or programs organized by the initiative. In 2019, we established the Hydro Sustainability Fund, which serves as a financing\n\n## Breakdown of 2021 results by region\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmechanism for SBI. Hydro is contributing BRL 100 million to the fund over a 10-year period.\n\nThe fund launched its first round of financing in 2019 for projects supporting local associations to increase community businesses' knowledge and to promote cultural events. Due to Covid-19, the implementation of the projects was delayed until 2021, but the projects are now underway. A second round of financing of more than BRL 7.1 million is under development together with USAID. SBI coordinates the financing rounds.\n\nIn response to Covid-19, the fund and these partners are financing income generation projects for local production of face masks, as well as strengthening of existing social projects for local farmers through the pandemic. In addition, a partnership between the fund, the Mitsui Fund and Instituto Peabiru invested BRL 1.3 million to microfinance local familybased manioc processing in 2021. A further BRL 1.8 million investment is planned for the next two years to upgrade and expand the microfinance initiative.\n\nTo support the preservation of the Amazon region, we run several programs that emphasize entrepreneurship and strengthening of traditional livelihoods. This includes environmental efforts and collaborations such as the Biodiversity Research Consortium Brazil-Norway.

The volunteer activities are based on local customs and needs. Many sites also support local communities through a range of sponsorships and charitable donations. Hydro Extrusions has a broad range of sponsorships and support programs. Another important contribution is the transfer of competence that takes place through our cooperation with universities and research institutions. This includes the cooperation with three academic institutions in Par\u00e1, Brazil, and the University of Oslo through the Biodiversity Research Consortium BrazilNorway. See partnerships for more information. In addition, we provide scholarships to selected PhD candidates doing research relevant for our business areas. Hydro is also the sponsor of a professorship in Norway and has several adjunct professors among its own employees. See also collaborating with other parties for more information.\n\n## Brazil\n\nThe Barcarena region, where Hydro's Alunorte alumina refinery and the Albras metal plants are located, ranks low on the Human Development Index (measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and with a decent standard of living), and has one of the highest levels of vio lence in the world. There are high levels of unemployment and general poverty with a lack of access to basic services, with the share of people with access to sanitation at less than 30 percent.\n\n## Breakdown of 2021 results by type of support provided\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* Education refers to initiatives within the traditional educational system, and Capacity building covers training outside the educational system.",

The volunteers organized over 70 different activities, including organizing food baskets, fundraising, seed planting and training for community leaders.\n\n## India\n\nIn Kuppam, India, we finance two local learning labs using tablets and physical games that give children at two schools in the community access to enhanced learning opportunities. Due to Covid-19, students have been given access to the learning apps for use on private tablets and phones so that the training and development can continue despite closed schools. Although our extrusion plant in India has been sold, the project is still funded for another one and a half years.\n\n## Italy\n\nWe continued supporting UNICEF's 'Upshift' program, a youth social innovation and social entrepreneurship program designed primarily for marginalized or at-risk young people. In 2021, Hydro supported 'Upshift' for migrant and refugee youth in Italy.",

We want every employee, contractor and visitor to return home healthy and safe every day. Hydro is committed to the principles of non-discrimination and does not tolerate any form of harassment or bullying in the workplace. We believe that diverse and inclusive teams lead to higher levels of innovation, a learning culture, better customer understanding and cultural awareness, as well as greater financial results. This is crucial for our business and directly linked to our profitability and sustainability agenda.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe have a responsibility to provide a safe work environment and believe that this also promotes efficiency and lower operating costs. We drive safety improvements by systematically reducing risks, training personnel and regularly following up by line management and safety delegates. All injuries and high-risk incidents are investigated to find root\n\ncauses and to share lessons learned between our sites.\n\nThrough Hydro's global people processes, we ensure the right competence, capabilities and organizational culture to be able to deliver on our overall strategic agenda.\n\nHydro's current people strategy was launched in 2020, setting global strategic priorities and activities, in addition to a defined process for annual updates and revisions. The global priorities cover learning and competence development, leadership and succession, as well as diversity and inclusion. These priorities are supported by the business areas with targets and activities based on their specific needs, addressing challenges in regions where they operate.\n\nHydro's common process for people performance and development includes an appraisal dialogue, individual development plan and follow-up, as well as talent planning and succession management.\n\nIn Hydro, our goal is to have a culture of continuous learning and competence development to ensure current\n\n## Ambitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrganization and work environment\n\nMaterial topics covered in this chapter:\n\nOrganizational capabilities and culture\n\nDiversity, inclusion and belonging\n\nHealth, safety and security\n\nEmergency preparedness\n\nZero\n\nFatal accidents and life  changing  injuries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3.3\n\nTotal recordable injury rate (per million hours worked)\n\n25%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWomen employees in permanent and temporary positions by 2025\n\n25%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWomen leaders in permanent and temporary positions by 2025\n\n## Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n20%\n\nWomen employees in permanent and temporary positions\n\nFoster\n\nAn inclusive work environment\n\n76%\n\nInclusion index baseline\n\n18%\n\nWomen leaders in permanent and temporary positions",

Through the succession and talent processes, we work with the leadership and specialist pipeline and identify required development. We have a portfolio of learning programs that supports development for leaders as well as specialists.\n\n## Occupational health and safety\n\nHydro shall be a leading company in our industry in the area of occupational health and safety. This will be achieved through consistent implementation of the management system, with committed and visible leadership, and full engagement of all employees and others who work with us.\n\nOur ambition is to prevent all injuries and ill health to avoid human suffering.\n\nWe will work continuously to avoid damage to property and loss of production. Hydro has developed a comprehensive health and safety management system and our manufacturing sites are certified to internationally recognized health and safety standards. We embrace digital tools where possible and have developed an advanced incident management system, self-assessment tools, risk management processes, e-learning training modules, etc., all easily accessible to employees. In addition, we have strengthened our behavioral\n\n## Total recordable injuries Total Recordable Inuires\n\nPer million hours worked\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntools using human performance techniques and the consistent use of peer-to-peer job observations.\n\nThe number of total recordable injuries and associated rates deteriorated over 2020 levels, from 2.7 to a total recordable injury rate of 3.3 per million hours worked in 2021. The majority of injuries were relatively minor, with no lifethreatening or life-changing injuries reported during the year.\n\nThe deployment of fatality-prevention procedures and associated life-saving rules and behaviors continued in 2021 which contributed to a continued reduction in the number and rates of high-risk incidents with the potential to be fatal or life changing. A few of our initiatives include:\n\n- \u009f Monthly deep-dive incident data analyses to support continuous improvement through root cause identification, and defining actions to prevent incidents from recurring.\n- \u009f Understanding the root causes of high-risk incidents within 30 days and having more than 85 percent of the incidents closed. In 2021, we reached 90 percent.\n- \u009f Quarterly health, safety, security and environment network meetings to connect specialists from all business areas to discuss findings and actions taken from high-risk incidents, and sharing best practice and innovative solutions.\n\nOur approach to continual improvement of physical and chemical occupational health is based on work environment risk assessments (WERA) and implementation of risk-\n\nFatal accidents\n\n## Fatal accidents\n\nNumber\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand future workforce readiness. We believe that learning and competence development is best achieved through a combination of on-the-job training, social learning (i.e. networking, mentoring and peer-to-peer), and formal learning initiatives (both digital and in the classroom). A new people platform supports these learning and competence development processes.\n\nLearning is thus more visible, accessible, and easier to follow up for leaders and employees. We offer new employees introductory training related to the organization and to their individual work tasks. This includes required knowledge in health, security, safety and environment. The most important development takes place locally, primarily with on-thejob training. We also offer a more in-depth course, Hydro Fundamentals, to leaders and specialists. A digital version has been developed to significantly extend the reach of the program.\n\nSuccession planning for critical positions in the company is one of the strategic people priorities towards 2025. The contiuous development of candidates to the succession pipelines aim to ensure a continuous supply of high-quality leaders. We firmly believe that this is key to secure our future strategic returns. The strong emphasis on gender and nationality diversity has resulted in an increased number of women and non-Norwegian candidates.\n\n## High-risk incidents\n\n<!-- image -->",

The committee is led by President & CEO Hilde Merete Aasheim and consists of the members of the Corporate Management Board and the head of HSE.\n\n## Security and emergency preparedness\n\nHydro is committed to the protection of people, environment, physical assets, data and information. We anticipate and prepare for potentially adverse incidents with crisis potential in order to maintain business and operational continuity.\n\nTo prepare for and respond to intentional, unintentional and/ or naturally occurring disasters, and to protect people and critical assets, we adapt and initiate security measures depending on the evolving risk picture. Our emergency preparedness plans enable effective response to highrisk incidents and crises, ensuring an effective, cohesive, integrated and timely response to any business disruption, regardless of origin, scale or complexity.\n\nSecurity in Hydro includes a proactive security risk management process, based on analysis, to enable appropriate mitigating actions and accurate and timely decision-making. Security guards are employed on a regular basis to protect our personnel and assets. No armed personnel are used in our operations.\n\nThere were several serious security incidents, with firearms involved in 2021. No personnel were injured in these events and resulting security-mitigation measures were employed to protect personnel and prevent further incidents.\n\nDuring 2021, the progression to achieve certification for ISO 18788, a management system for private security operations, requirements and guidance, continued. It is founded upon the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, helping to demonstrate an ethical approach to the delivery\n\nof security services, and it will benchmark Hydro's security management system against the international standards. The process of certification is progressing, with Hydro employed security teams achieving conformity in the US. Hydro has also supported our third-party security providers to achieve the same level of conformity in Brazil, one of which achieved accreditation and was certified to ISO 18788 in June 2021.\n\nHydro is responsible for infrastructure and functions on local and regional levels that might be critical to society's operability, and we operate large-scale production sites where a crisis could influence community interests and safety in general. Hence, we are subject to control and follow-up by relevant national authorities. We have emergency plans in place by site, business area and at group level, and we test these regularly.\n\nEight emergency and crisis management workshops, with risk mapping at their core, were held in 2021. These workshops were conducted at plant, business area and Corporate Emergency Team (CET) levels. They help to link the process of emergency response, crisis management and recovery from the plant through to business area level and above.\n\nCyber-risk assessment is an integrated part of Hydro's enterprise risk management system. This is to facilitate the business areas' awareness of how cyber risks relate to their critical assets and operations.\n\nSecure information handling is important to ensure Hydro's business continuity and reputation. Crucial computer systems are subject to surveillance and regulations. All personnel with access to sensitive information are bound to secrecy and required to handle information according to corporate guidelines and requirements.\n\nOur enterprise IT platform 1) is a critical element in all parts of our operations, covering areas such as digital collaboration, enterprise resource planning, central personnel databases and systems for external reporting. Cybercrime is increasing globally, and Hydro is exposed to threats to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of our information and systems. Threats may include attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other digital security breaches.\n\nreduction measures followed up through an associated key performance indicator. WERA is a tool to facilitate a more unified way of performing risk assessment, easier identification of improvement areas and sharing between similar processes.\n\nThe importance of mental health and wellbeing continued with numerous initiatives completed during the year to raise awareness, ranging from mental health webinars, stress management and sleep hygiene, to healthy eating and exercise. To ensure a similar systematic approach to the psychosocial work environment, we have established a new psychosocial risk indicator (PRI) as part of our employee engagement survey Hydro Monitor.\n\nHydro continues to closely monitor the development of Covid-19 and has implemented control measures to help prevent the risk of infection and spread and its impact on employees and operations.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic continued to evolve throughout 2021 with the successful rollout of major vaccination programs being partially mitigated by more contagious variants of the virus. Tragically, we lost 33 employees since the start of the pandemic.\n\nHydro operated throughout this challenging period without any major disruptions through the strict adoption of rules set by relevant local authorities together with Hydro-specific measures. In addition, specific emphasis has been given to the mental health state of our staff impacted by long standing social distancing rules, and we continue to encourage vaccination according to the guidelines set by authorities in countries where we operate.\n\nOur strategy to minimize the operational impact of Covid-19 and prepare for future pandemics continues to be based on full compliance with rules complemented by a flexible range of Hydro-specific responses and robust emergency preparedness.\n\nWhere applicable, guidelines and regulations from national authorities such as those pertaining to travel restrictions, social distancing, home office or complete societal lockdowns have been reflected in our internal policies and procedures. We evaluate our key pandemic-related risks and vulnerabilities through annual security and business resilience assessments, which support the preparation and review of business continuity plans.",

Hydro's employees and business areas shall only use merit, qualifications and other professional criteria as a basis for employee-related decisions, such as recruitment, training, compensation and promotion. We strive to develop programs and actions to encourage a diverse organization based on the principle of equal opportunities. Hydro is committed to the principles of non-discrimination and does not tolerate any form of harassment or bullying in the workplace.\n\nWe have different backgrounds, and we bring more collectively to the table than if we were all the same as each other.\n\n- Hilde Merete Aasheim, CEO\n\n## Identifying and managing risks\n\nWe use our employee engagement survey, Hydro Monitor, to understand the current state of inclusion in Hydro. Based on this, we form hypotheses on how to improve diversity, inclusion and belonging, and pilot projects to create sustainable change. We measure progress through annual surveys and establish actions for further improvements, using the results from Hydro Monitor 2020 as a baseline.\n\nWe use Hydro Monitor and the internal grievance mechanism AlertLine as tools to assess the risk level of discrimination in the organization. We also track relevant employee data from our core employee system. Cases of alleged and/ or confirmed discrimination and harassment are relevant indicators from AlertLine, while in Hydro Monitor we use combinations of gender, role and age differences in the employee engagement index and the psychosocial risk indicator as important indicators. From 2021, we will measure and track our inclusion index, consisting of eight questions related to diversity, inclusion and belonging.\n\nTo identify risks toward underrepresented groups and ensure that actions are implemented to lift these groups, different tools are provided. These include digital, anonymous focus groups to understand root causes and actions, unconscious bias testing and training, and group guidelines for employee\n\n## Diversity characteristics\n\nWe have a broad definition of diversity in Hydro. We believe it encompasses both primary characteristics (what you cannot influence) such as gender, race, color, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, affectional orientation, personality; and secondary factors (what you can influence) including education, work experience, skills, language, geography, communication style, and beliefs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Work  background   | Marital   status         | Parental   status                | Communication  style   |\n|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Talents            | Sexual  orientation      | Age                              | Culture                |\n| Skills             | Ethnicity Gender         | Personality Physical   abilities | Religious   beliefs    |\n| Experiences        | Geographical  background | Education                        | Language               |\n\n- n Secondary characteristics - can be influenced\n- n Primary characteristics - cannot be influenced\n\nHydro has launched several initiatives to increase the robustness of the enterprise IT platform against malicious attacks by improving system infrastructure and by educating employees to develop and improve secure work processes and routines, and to understand how these threats can be prevented. Additional protection is also implemented for the process control systems at Hydro's plants.\n\nCorporate Emergency Team crisis management training has been developed and crisis management workshops, with varying crisis scenarios, are programmed and have been held throughout 2021. Combined emergency and crisis management workshops incorporating business area management have been programmed for early 2022, which will involve training and exercising with the Cyber Crisis Team (CCT).\n\n## Diversity, inclusion & belonging\n\nIn order to advance in diversity, inclusion and belonging (DIB), Hydro continuously works to improve the approach, associated processes and governance. Our ambition is to have a high-performing and sustainable work environment, based on inclusion of our differences. We want employees to feel a sense of belonging where their voices are heard.\n\nThe following sections provide information on the current status of diversity and inclusion in Hydro, and the activities being undertaken to identify risks, and improve these, in accordance with the requirements on public disclosure in the Norwegian Equality and Anti-Discrimination Act (Likestillingsog diskrimineringsloven). This diversity and inclusion report, including its references to the notes to the social statement, is approved by the Board of Directors and included in their responsibility statement.\n\n## Our diversity, inclusion and belonging approach\n\nThe starting point in our approach to diversity, inclusion and belonging is to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. However, we value diverse perspectives as important when delivering on our long-term strategic agenda. Our diversity allows us to think differently, approach challenges differently and solve problems differently. Hence, building diversity leadership skills and fostering an inclusive culture is key in our approach.\n\nHydro is committed to providing equal employment opportunities and treating all employees fairly and with",

Our strategic approach to diversity, inclusion and belonging, is founded on our overall business strategy and our three core values: care, courage and collaboration. The ambition is to have a high-performing, inclusive and sustainable work environment based on inclusion of our differences.\n\nWith the overall opportunity of utilizing our diverse workforce for increased value creation, we aim to mature in diversity, inclusion and belonging across three pillars:\n\n- \u009f Equity: Promoting opportunities for everyone to contribute and succeed, adjusting for the fact that different individuals have different starting points\n- \u009f Inclusion: Fostering inclusive leadership and an inclusive culture for all employees to contribute with their full potential\n- \u009f Diversity: Seeking multiple perspectives and competencies when solving tasks and meeting customer needs. This includes increasing diversity across seniority levels\n\nOur aim is to foster an inclusive culture, strengthen inclusive leadership, lift underrepresented groups, improve team diversity, increase gender balance, and ensure a diverse talent pool.\n\nBusiness areas and corporate staff functions have developed roadmaps to ensure targeted actions are implemented across all three areas. Progress is reported at our internal board meetings in the first quarter of each year.\n\nEE\n\n## Hydro Monitor - Employee Engagement\n\nPercent engaged\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversity, inclusion and belonging\n\nInclusion Index developed and baseline set - eight anonymous questions about inclusive culture and leadership, against demographic characteristics, including categories where people can self-identify as a minority. This baseline will help track future performance in diversity, inclusion and belonging.\n\nResults show that 76 percent employees have a positive perception of inclusion in Hydro, and employees identifying themselves as minorities feel less included and score less than the majority on all main indicators in the survey. In 2022, we will work to further understand the results, root causes and identify mitigating actions.\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity, inclusion and belonging overall strategy approved by the Corporate Management Board\n- \u00b7 Roadmaps developed in each business area and corporate staff function to deliver on the overall strategy\n- \u00b7 Mandatory online diversity, inclusion and belonging training implemented for all white-collar workers\n- \u00b7 Integration of compensation data in our people master data system\n\nresource groups. Tools and guidelines for all pillars in our strategy are available for the organization to use. These will be further developed, and we also aim to enable employees to engage in fostering an inclusive society.\n\nWe have collected several hypotheses and conducted a range of analyses, research and benchmarking. These include:\n\n- \u009f What is the current demography and cultural context\n- \u009f Who joins Hydro and who leaves Hydro and when\n- \u009f How happy are the employees and what drives intent to stay\n- \u009f How is diversity and inclusion embedded in our people processes\n- \u009f What parental-leave benefits do we offer in different countries we operate in\n- \u009f How minorities perceive engagement and inclusion at Hydro\n\nThe analyses have provided us with insight and identified areas for improvement. These are being followed up by the different business areas and corporate staff functions. And these have fed into the setting of our strategy and ambitions.

We also host workshops and certification training with Seema (Norway's Centre for Diversity Management), and provide support to employees when coming back after a leave of absence. Employees at our headquarters can also during working hours act as mentors through the nonprofit organization 'Sammen om en jobb' (Together for a job) to support educated immigrants enter the Norwegian labor market.\n\nMore information on Hydro's goals and approach to diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity, can be found in the social and environmental statements.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\nWe have worked systematically to increase gender diversity in Hydro's operations for more than 20 years, and our first action plan to promote women employees and leaders was adopted in 1997. While we have seen successes in improving diversity at staff positions, challenges remain for operator positions.\n\nOur goal for the share of women in Hydro is 25 percent by 2025, including permanent and temporary employees. In 2021, we achieved 20 percent. This was reached in part due to the sale of the Hydro Rolling business area, which had a higher proportion of men than the Hydro average. In reaching our target, retention is as important as recruitment. For more\n\n## Share of women leaders\n\nPercent\n\ninformation about temporary employees see Note S1.2. Employees by employment type and part-time employees.\n\nThe share of women in Hydro's Board of Directors was 40 percent in 2021. With three women among the seven shareholder-elected members and one woman among the three employee representatives on the Board of Directors, Hydro complies with the Norwegian legal requirements on women representation. The proportion of women on Hydro's Corporate Management Board was 44 percent in 2021.\n\nWhile gender equality is a challenge among operators at most of Hydro's operational sites, women constitute 51 percent of the workforce in Hydro's corporate staffs and 43 percent in Global Business Services. Globally, about one-third of employees in staff positions are women.\n\nHydro recognizes the importance of a good balance between work and other aspects of life. For example, Aluminium Metal, which is Hydro's largest business area in Norway, has implemented procedures to ensure a predictable work schedule for operators, and opportunities for flexible working hours for white-collar employees.\n\n## Pay equality and compensation\n\nAll employees shall receive total compensation that is competitive and aligned with the local industry standard (not market-leading).

The learning process has started with the Corporate Management Board, on diversity competence and diversity management. Mandatory introduction training to diversity, inclusion and belonging was implemented in 2021 for all white-collar workers, in 17 languages, and recommended follow-up training provided. It is embedded in all people processes (e.g. recruitment, onboarding, succession) and part of our global leadership framework and included in all our global employee and leadership development programs. We are also developing diversity management competence among leaders.\n\nThere are several ongoing initiatives and programs in our major countries of operation. In Brazil, we have been running a comprehensive diversity, inclusion and belonging program since 2019 aiming to create an inclusive environment. In the US, we have initiated an inclusion project focused on improving relations with minority employees and providing diversity training for staff and managers. We have also started projects in the US focused on sponsorship and development programs for women and underrepresented groups. In Norway, example initiatives include identifying key drivers of gender diversity at our plants. We participate in the AFF 50-50 program dedicated to increasing recruitment of women into leadership positions and sponsor 'Kraftkvinnene' - a network\n\n## Share of non-Norwegian leaders Share of non-Norwegian leaders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPercent",

However, at the very highest specialist and management levels, men have higher compensation on average than women. Across all compensation categories and positions in Hydro's activities in Norway, women still earn on average 4 percent more than men as they have a higher representation at the higher position levels than at the lower levels.\n\nFor further information on Hydro's results in gender-related compensation, part-time work and parental leave, refer to Note S1.2 Employees by employment type and part-time employees and Note S1.5 Sick- and parental leave.\n\n## Opportunities for people with disabilities\n\nWe are continuously adjusting working conditions so that all employees have the same opportunities in their workplace. In Brazil, we are required to employ at least 5 percent employees with disabilities. At the end of 2021, 4.9 percent of the employees in Paragominas were disabled, at Alunorte 4.6 percent, and at Albras 4.6 percent. The absolute number for employees with disabilities increased in 2021, compared to 2020, and we are working to increase the share of disabled employees further. Just as important as achieving the legal requirements, Alunorte, Paragominas and Norsk Hydro Brasil are working on the career development of employees with disabilities. The Hydro Extrusions sites in southern Brazil fulfilled their legal requirements.\n\nDrawing from these experiences, part of our strategy work will cover the ways we can generate opportunities and become an attractive employer for employees with disabilities, across our global operations.\n\nFurther data on our diversity, inclusion and belonging work can be found in the social notes.\n\n## Gender and compensation reporting in Norway Gender proportion\n\n| Level   | Gender proportion   | Gender proportion   | Total   |\n|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------|\n| 1       | 22%                 | 78%                 | 195     |\n| 2       | 18%                 | 72%                 | 1,677   |\n| 3       | 19%                 | 81%                 | 119     |\n| 4-5     | 26%                 | 74%                 | 1,042   |\n| 6-7     | 24%                 | 76%                 | 518     |\n| 8-9     | 34%                 | 66%                 | 116     |\n| Total   | 22%                 | 78%                 | 3,667   |\n\nn Men\n\n- n Women\n\nCompensation di/fference\n\nAnnual salary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Level   | Compensation - women compared to men   | Compensation - women compared to men   |\n|---------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 1       | 105%                                   | 101%                                   |\n| 2       | 98%                                    | 93%                                    |\n| 3       | 99%                                    | 97%                                    |\n| 4-5     | 109%                                   | 99%                                    |\n| 6-7     | 102%                                   | 101%                                   |\n| 8-9     | 94%                                    | 92%                                    |\n| Total   | 111%                                   | 104% 1)                                |\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n- 1) As women at Hydro in Norway tend to hold more senior positions than men, their total compensation is higher on average.\n- n Annual salary (women vs men)\n- n Total compensation (women vs men)\n- -100 percent\n\n0,00000033,33333366,666667100,000000133,333333166,666667200,000000\n\n166,666667\n\n200,000000\n\n66,666667\n\n100,000000\n\n133,333333\n\nperformance-oriented, transparent, fair and objective. Relevant qualifications, such as performance, education, experience and professional criteria, shall be considered when providing training, settling compensation and awarding promotions.\n\nIn 2020, we started the integration of compensation data in our people master data system, and a global job architecture framework was developed enabling us to map all employees in Hydro in a consistent way. An initial mapping of all employees using this structure was completed in 2021. A calibration and governance process will be established during 2022. Hydro's global job architecture framework is built on Mercer's International position evaluation system IPE. Hence, Hydro's architecture consists of two main elements: a job family structure and a job level structure.\n\nThe activities and competency requirements determine which family a job belongs to and it is the job that an individual holds that is mapped, not the individual person. The jobs are mapped in the family structure. We map employee positions in a level structure based on the complexity of each job. The job level structure consists of nine levels from operators, specialists to managers. Levels 1 to 3 typically cover operators in our plants, levels 5 and 6 jobs require higher education, e.g. bachelor or master with typically 1-5 years of experience. Levels 6 and 7 are jobs that require extensive experience in their area of expertise and levels 8 and 9 cover our most senior specialist and management positions.\n\n## Gender-related compensation differences in Hydro's Norwegian activities in 2021\n\nIn order to look at gender-related compensation differences in Hydro's Norwegian activities, the global job architecture has been used to ensure that men and women in jobs with equal complexity have been compared. This includes all permanent and temporary employees in full-time and part-time positions. To ensure consistency and relevant comparison, 'on call' and summer substitutes are excluded from the analysis. 'On call' and summer substitutes are all operator positions and are paid tariff-regulated salaries. There are no differences in the compensation structure between men and women in this group.\n\nThe compensation comparison is split into annual salary (contractual fixed base salary) and total compensation (includes bonus, overtime, shift allowances and other cash based allowances).\n\n0,000000\n\n33,333333",

Hydro is headquartered in Oslo, Norway, and the group employs around 31,000 people in about 40 countries. Hydro is a global supplier of aluminium with operations throughout the industry value chain. Operations include power production, bauxite extraction, alumina refining, aluminium smelting, remelting and recycling, and extruded solutions. The Board of Directors and the President and CEO authorized these financial statements for issue on March 9, 2021.February 21, 2022. Hydro is listed on the Oslo stock exchange, Oslo B\u00f8rs.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain assets, liabilities and financial instruments, which are measured at fair value. Preparation of financial statements including note disclosures requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported. Actual results may differ.\n\nThe functional currency of Norsk Hydro ASA is the Norwegian krone (NOK). The Hydro group financial statements are presented in NOK.\n\nAs a result of rounding adjustments, the figures in one or more columns included in the financial statements may not add up to the total of that column.\n\nInterest rates used for calculating net present values are rounded to the nearest 10 basis points for post-employment benefits, to the nearest 25 basis points for other non-financial assets and liabilities.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgment\n\nThe application of accounting policies requires that management makes estimates and judgments in determining certain revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. The following areas involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity, and may result in significant variation in amounts.\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment of non-current assets, discussed in Note 2.5 Impairment of non-current assets\n- \u00b7 Uncertain assets and liabilities, discussed in Section 4 Uncertain assets and liabilities\n- \u00b7 Uncertain tax positions, discussed in Note 10.1 Income taxes\n- \u00b7 Business combinations, impacting such items as long-lived assets and uncertain assets and liabilities, discussed in Note 1.5 Significant subsidiaries and changes to the consolidated group\n- \u00b7 Financial instruments, discussed in Section 8 Financial risk and financial instruments\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\nThe following description of accounting principles applies to Hydro's 2021 financial reporting, including all comparative figures. The relevant accounting policies for relevant items are described in the specific notes in this set of financial statements.\n\n## Income statements and statements of comprehensive income\n\nHydro has elected to present a separate income statement and a separate statement of comprehensive income, rather than a combined statement. Further, Hydro presents an analysis of expenses based on their nature as a common analysis of expenses through Hydro's value chain. Hydro has elected to present a sub-total Earnings before financial items and tax (EBIT). This measure is also used as a segment profit measure. The share of the profit (loss) in equity accounted investments is included in this sub-total because the majority of such investments are operationally integrated with Hydro's businesses. Results from such investments are managed as part of Hydro's operating activities with significant transactions between the majority of these investments and Hydro. Return on other equity investments is not as closely related to the business activities in Hydro, and hence classification as finance income better reflects the way such investments are managed.\n\nGains and losses on disposal of non-current assets are presented net, as well as expenditures related to provisions that are reimbursed by a third party. However, insurance compensation and government grants are reported on a gross basis.\n\nHydro uses the indirect method to present cash flows from operating activities. Interest and dividends received as well as interest paid are included in cash flows from operating activities. Dividends paid are included in cash flows from financing activities.\n\n## Statements of cash flows\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include Norsk Hydro ASA and subsidiaries, which are entities in which Hydro has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity (control). Control is normally achieved through ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the voting power. Currently, Hydro has more than 50 percent of the voting power in close to all subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included from the date control commences until the date control ceases.\n\nIntercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Profit and loss resulting from intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent equity interests in subsidiaries held by other owners than Hydro. Non-controlling interests are reported as a separate section of the Group's equity in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. Results attributed to non-controlling interests are based on ownership interest, or other method of allocation if required by contract.\n\n## Transactions between non-controlling shareholders and the group\n\nSales and purchases of equity interests and equity contributions not resulting in Hydro gaining or losing control of a subsidiary are reported as equity transactions in accordance with IFRS 10. No gain, loss or remeasurement of values of recognized assets, liabilities or goodwill are recognized as a result of such transactions.\n\n## Assets held for sale and Income from discontinued operations\n\nAssets held for sale are reported separately in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, provided that the sale is highly probable, which includes the criteria that management is committed to the sale, and that the sale will be completed within one year. Assets held for sale are not depreciated but are measured at the lower of carrying value and the fair value less costs to sell for the asset group. Assets are not reclassified in prior period balance sheets. Immaterial disposal groups are not reclassified.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of Hydro that is held for sale or has been disposed of. A discontinued operation is a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. Related cash flows, results of operations and gain or loss from disposal are reported separately as Income (loss) from discontinued operations.\n\nAssets held for sale, liabilities in disposal groups and income and expense from discontinued operations are excluded from specifications presented in the notes unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the transacting entity by applying the rate of exchange as of the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. Currency gains or losses are included in Finance expense.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nFor consolidation purposes, the financial statements of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than Norwegian kroner (NOK) are translated into NOK. Assets and liabilities, including investment in associates, joint ventures and goodwill, are translated using the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date. Income, expenses and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rate for the reported period. Goodwill is recognized in the predominant functional currencies in the acquired businesses. Translation adjustments are recognized in Other comprehensive income and accumulated in Currency translation differences in Other components of equity. On disposal of such subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the cumulative translation adjustment of the disposed entity is recognized in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.",

Recurring fair value measurement is used primarily for financial instruments, see Section 8 Financial risk and financial instruments. Nonrecurring fair value measurement is used for transactions, such as business combinations, divestments with non-cash consideration and certain other non-routine transactions. Fair value is estimated using inputs which are to varying degree objectively observable. Certain items are valued on the basis of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 valuations), others are valued on the basis of inputs that are derived from observable prices (level 2 valuations), while certain positions are valued on the basis of judgmental assumptions that are to a limited degree or not at all based on observable market data (level 3 valuations).ns).\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nThe estimated fair value of Hydro's financial instruments is based on market prices and valuation techniques. Valuations are made with the objective to include relevant factors that market participants would consider in setting a price, and to apply accepted economic and financial methodologies for the pricing of financial instruments. References for less active markets are carefully reviewed to establish relevant and comparable data. Extrapolations and other accepted valuation techniques are employed in periods with few or no transactions, such as for long-term commodity contracts in markets with few observations beyond the short or mid-term period.\n\nHydro's estimated credit spread for similar liabilities is used when determining the fair value of financial instruments where Hydro is net liable. Hydro determines the appropriate discount factor and credit spread for financial assets based on both an individual and on a portfolio assessment.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nFair value for unlisted shares is based on commonly accepted valuation techniques utilizing significant unobservable data, primarily cash flow-based models. To the extent there are transactions in such shares, the transaction price is assessed and, to the extent comparable to rights embodied in the investment held by Hydro, used for reference. For investments where share holdings are associated with offtake rights and/or obligations or other specific clauses, those rights and obligations are included in the valuation of the equity securities. Fair value for listed shares or regularly traded shares is based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date.\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nFair value for unlisted debt instruments is estimated primarily through cash flow models using contractual cash flow where relevant, and discount rates reflecting the perceived credit risk and other relevant risks associated with the instrument. Fair value for listed instruments is based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nFair value of financial derivatives with a currency or interest rate as underlying is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, calculated by reference to quoted swap price curves and exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. For derivatives covering a period beyond the liquid period of price curves, the curves are extrapolated using unobservable data.\n\nFair value of commodity derivatives is measured as the present value of future cash flows, calculated using forward curves and exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Estimates from brokers and extrapolation techniques are applied for non-quoted products and periods to achieve the most relevant forward curve. In addition, when deemed appropriate, correlation techniques between commodities are applied. Options are revalued using option pricing models, and credit spreads are applied where deemed to be significant. Markets are assessed to determine whether they are active for the relevant instruments. Currency and interest markets are considered liquid for the periods used for price references, and thus applied unadjusted. For aluminium contracts priced to observations at the London Metal Exchange (LME), liquidity is considered good for the first few years, with fewer transactions for longer durations. For electricity contracts priced to the electricity exchange Nasdaq OMX, liquidity is considered good for the first two years. For longer durations there are fewer transactions and higher uncertainty. Similar assessment is made for other markets used for price references. For less liquid periods, adjustments to remove outliers and extrapolation techniques are applied.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nHydro measures embedded forward contracts that are separated from the host contract by comparing the forward curve at contract inception to the forward curve as of the balance sheet date. Changes in the present value of the cash flows related to the embedded derivative are recognized in the balance sheet with changes in the fair value recognized in the income statement. Forward curves are established as described above under Derivatives.\n\n## Note 1.3 Significant events\n\nThe following significant events have impacted Hydro in 2021, or are expected to impact Hydro in 2022:\n\nThe Covid-19 situation and its side effects continued to present a significant challenge to the global economy during 2021. While global economic activity rebounded relatively quickly in the first half of the year, supported by strong policy responses and low interest rates, significant uncertainty remains. Supply disruptions led to shortages and inflationary pressures on a range of key inputs, exerting downward pressure on growth rates in the second half of 2021. There is significant uncertainty surrounding the market outlook impacting estimates.\n\nAfter a strategic review of Hydro Rolling business initiated in May 2019, Hydro announced an agreement to sell the Rolling business to KPS Capital Partners in March 2021. On June 1, 2021, the transaction was completed. The criteria for reporting the business as Held for sale and Discontinued operations, as described in Note 1.1 Reporting entity, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies were reached short time before the transaction was agreed. The sold business comprises the Hydro Rolling segment, and related pension liabilities and certain support functions reported as part of Other activities. The transaction is further described in Note 1.5 Significant subsidiaries and changes to the group.\n\nAt the end of December 2021, the Board of Directors in the part-owned subsidiary Slovalco in Slovakia decided to further curtail production from 80 percent to 60 percent of capacity in the smelter in response to the high energy prices. The decision resulted in the existing power purchase contracts for delivery during 2022, which are at a fixed price, were recognized at their fair value of about NOK 2.8 billion. The fair value represents a gain on derivative purchase contracts included in the line item Raw material and energy prices. The value will be expensed during 2022 as the contract portfolio is realized through a combination of consumption and sale of power. Results will represent a combination of price variation in the power market and consumption of power recognized at the significantly higher current market price. The higher production cost represents an expected production loss as the majority of the power is planned to be used for smelter production, although planned volumes are not contracted as of year-end. The Slovalco smelter assets were written down as impaired at the end of 2021 as a result of the high production costs not supporting profitable production, even at the current aluminium prices.",

Operating segments are components of a business that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of assessing performance and allocating resources. Hydro's chief operating decision maker is the President and CEO. Generally, financial information is required to be disclosed on the same basis that is used by the CEO.\n\nHydro's operating segments represent separately managed business areas with products serving different markets, or distinct elements of the business separately followed up and reported to the chief operating decision maker. Hydro's reportable segments are the business areas Hydro Bauxite & Alumina, Hydro Aluminium Metal, Hydro Extrusions, and Hydro Energy, as well as the Hydro Metal Markets activities which are managed combined with Hydro Aluminium Metal.\n\nHydro Bauxite & Alumina activities includes bauxite mining activities, production of alumina and related commercial activities, primarily the sale of alumina.\n\nHydro Aluminium Metal includes primary aluminium production and casting activities. The main products are comprised of extrusion ingots, foundry alloys, sheet ingot and standard ingot.\n\nHydro Metal Markets includes all sales activities relating to products from our primary metal plants and operational responsibility for stand-alone recyclers as well as physical and financial metal trading activities.\n\nHydro Extrusions delivers products within extrusion profiles, building systems and precision tubing, and is operating several recycling facilities, both integrated with its extrusion plants and separate plants. Hydro Extrusions is present in about 40 countries. The products are delivered to such sectors as construction, automotive and heating, ventilation and air conditioning.\n\nHydro Energy includes operating and commercial responsibility for Hydro's power stations in Norway, a trading and wholesale business in Brazil, and energy sourcing for Hydro's world-wide operations. Energy is also responsible for Hydro's initiatives within other renewable energy production such as wind and solar, battery and hydrogen.\n\nOther consist of Hydro's captive insurance company Industriforsikring, internal service providers, and certain other activities. Unallocated corporate activities are reported as part of Other.\n\n## Operating segment information\n\nHydro uses two measures of segment results, Earnings before financial items and tax - EBIT and EBITDA. EBIT is consistent with the same measure for the group, considering the principles for measuring certain intersegment transactions and contracts described below. Hydro defines EBITDA as Income (loss) before tax, financial income and expense, depreciation, amortization and write-downs, less investment grants. Hydro's definition of EBITDA may be different from other companies. The two measures represent results with and without the charge for historic investments in production capacity and other fixed assets and are considered complementary.\n\nBecause Hydro manages long-term debt and taxes on a group basis, Income before tax and Net income is presented only for the group as a whole.\n\nIntersegment sales and transfers reflect arm's length prices as if sold or transferred to third parties at the time of inception of the internal contract, which may cover several years. Transfers of businesses or fixed assets within or between Hydro's segments are reported without recognizing gains or losses. Results of activities not considered part of Hydro's main operations as well as unallocated revenues, expenses, liabilities and assets are reported together with Other under the caption Other and eliminations.\n\n## The accounting policies used for segment reporting reflect those used for the group. The following exceptions apply for intersegment transactions:\n\n- \u00b7 Internal commodity contracts may meet the definition of a financial instrument in IFRS 9 or contain embedded derivatives that are required to be reported separately and valued at fair value under IFRS 9. However, Hydro considers these contracts as sourcing of raw materials or sale of own production, and accounts for such contracts as executory contracts.\n- \u00b7 Certain other internal contracts may contain a lease arrangement. However, the segment reporting reflects the responsibility allocated by Hydro's management for those assets, and no internal lease arrangement is identified.\n- \u00b7 Costs related to certain pension schemes covering more than one segment are allocated to the operating segments based either on the premium charged or the estimated service cost. Any difference between these charges and pension expenses measured in accordance with IFRS, as well as pension assets and liabilities are included in Other and eliminations.\n\nThe following tables include information about Hydro's operating segments.\n\n|                         | External revenue   | External revenue   | Internal revenue   | Internal revenue   | Share of the profit (loss) in equity  accounted investments   | Share of the profit (loss) in equity  accounted investments   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Amounts in NOK million  | 2021               | 2020               | 2021               | 2020               | 2021                                                          | 2020                                                          |\n| Hydro Bauxite & Alumina | 17,088             | 13,381             | 10,610             | 9,658              | -

The table includes investments in continuing operations only.\n\n## Note 1.5 Significant subsidiaries and changes to the group\n\n## Accounting policies for business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations. Consideration is the sum of the fair values, as of the date of exchange, of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. The fair value of Hydro's pre-existing ownership interest in an acquiree is included in the consideration, with any gain or loss recognized in Other income, net.\n\nThe acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognized separately at the acquisition date at their fair value irrespective of any non-controlling interest, and goodwill recognized to the extent the consideration exceeds identified net assets.\n\nThe interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the non-controlling interests' proportion of the fair value of the net assets recognized (partial goodwill method, see Note 2.3 Goodwill), or as the non-controlling interests' proportion of the fair value of the acquiree (full goodwill method, see Note 2.3 Goodwill). Non-controlling interests are subsequently adjusted for changes in equity of the subsidiary after the acquisition date.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for business combinations\n\nIn a business combination, consideration, assets and liabilities are recognized at estimated fair value, and any excess purchase price included in goodwill. Where Hydro had an existing ownership interest in the acquiree, that interest is also reassessed to determine its acquisition date estimated fair value, resulting in an acquisition date gain or loss. In the businesses Hydro operates, fair values of individual assets and liabilities are normally not readily observable in active markets. Estimation of fair values requires the use of valuation models for acquired assets and liabilities as well as ownership interests. Such valuations are subject to numerous assumptions and are thus uncertain. The quality of fair value estimates may impact periodic depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, and assessment of possible impairment of assets and/or goodwill in future periods.\n\n## Subsidiaries with significant non-controlling interests\n\nThe Hydro group consists of about 160 companies in about 40 countries. Most subsidiaries, including the large operating units in Norway, are 100 percent owned, directly or indirectly, by Norsk Hydro ASA. A list of significant subsidiaries is included in Note 7 Shares in subsidiaries to the separate accounts of Norsk Hydro ASA later in this report. Restrictions in the ability to transfer dividend based on reported results and/or equity in the relevant subsidiaries exist in most countries where we operate. In some countries, including Brazil, there are also legal restrictions in our ability to integrate cash holdings in subsidiaries in the group's cash pool. There are non-controlling interests in some subsidiaries. The more significant ones are described below.\n\n## Albras\n\nHydro holds 51 percent of the shares in the Brazilian aluminium smelter Alum\u00ednio Brasileiro S.A. (Albras), which is part of Hydro Aluminium Metal. The non-controlling owner has significant influence on certain decisions in the entity, including operational and investment budgets. The non-controlling interests in Albras amounted to NOK 1,933 million as of December 31, 2021 and NOK 1,687 million as of December 31, 2020. Funds held by the entity are not available to the group through cash pool arrangements. Dividends need to be approved by the shareholders jointly. The shareholder agreement supports transfer of dividend to the extent possible under statutory regulations. The smelter produces standard ingots, which are sold to its shareholders, or the entities appointed by the shareholders, in proportion to ownership interest at a price based on prevailing aluminium prices at the London Metal Exchange and product premiums. In response to the regime for sales taxes in Brazil, an increasing share of the production is sold to domestic customers rather than exported.\n\n## Slovalco\n\nHydro holds 55 percent of the total shares and 60 percent of the voting interest in the Slovac smelter Slovalco a.s, which is part of Hydro Aluminium Metal. The non-controlling owner has significant influence on certain decisions in the entity, including operational and investment budgets. The plant is partly written down as impaired, see Note 2.5 Impairment of non-current assets, and holds derivative contracts recognized at fair value, see Note 1.3 Significant events. The noncontrolling interests in Slovalco amounted to NOK 1,810 million as of December 31, 2021 and NOK 811 million as of December 31, 2020. Funds held by the entity are not available to the group through cash pool arrangements. Dividends need to be approved by the shareholders jointly. The shareholder agreement supports transfer of dividend to the extent possible under statutory regulations. The smelter produces metal products, of which the majority is sold to Hydro at a price based on prevailing aluminium prices at the London Metal Exchange and product premiums.",

(Alunorte), which is part of Hydro Bauxite & Alumina. The non-controlling owners have limited influence on the operational decisions. The non-controlling interests in Alunorte amounted to NOK 554million as of December 31, 2021 and NOK 597 million as of December 31, 2020. Funds held by the entity are not available to the group through cash pool arrangements. Dividends need to be approved by the shareholders jointly. The shareholder agreement supports transfer of dividend to the extent possible under statutory regulations.

The transaction was completed on June 1. The sold business comprises the Hydro Rolling segment, and related pension liabilities and certain support functions reported as part of Other activities. The transaction was subject to approval in the EU and certain other jurisdictions. The assets and liabilities in the divested business were reported as Assets held for sale and Liabilities in disposal groups as of the beginning of March 2021 until completion of the transaction. The results of operations in the divested businesses are reported separately under the caption Discontinued operations for the current and prior year. The gain on sale of the business is also reported in this line item. No interest expense related to loans has been allocated to discontinued operations. Cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately.\n\nSales from Hydro to the discontinued operations mainly represent aluminium sheet ingot and liquid aluminium as well as alumina and power delivered from Hydro's continued business to the rolling operations, priced with reference to observable market prices. These elements of cost are included in the result from discontinued operations as such costs are required to achieve the sales reported for the discontinued operations. Most of the supply arrangements continue under the same or similar terms. Further, Hydro has charged the discontinued business for certain shared services and other expenses incurred jointly, which remains charged to the discontinued operations, while shared administration costs and other corporate charges are not included in the discontinued operations. Depreciations stopped at reclassification to held for sale, i.e. early March, as required by IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.\n\nDepreciation expenses in the business held for sale has amounted to about NOK 90 million each month.\n\nAn impairment loss of NOK 1.9 billion for the asset group held for sale was recognized at the end of 2020. The asset group was assessed for possible further impairment at the end of the first quarter. The asset group was written down by an additional NOK 850 million to its estimated fair value less cost of disposal, primarily as a result of positive results in the interim period and positive remeasure effects for pension liabilities following the increased discount rates. As the transaction price was determined when the contract was entered into in March, results and value changes were for the risk of the acquiror. Direct costs related to the sales effort, completion of the transaction and separation of the business have been charged to discontinued operations. The gain on the sale was NOK 79 million including recycling of an accumulated currency gain of NOK 554 million. The final consideration is subject to certain potential adjustments, mainly related to transfer taxes for which Hydro has assumed the responsibility.\n\n## Summary of financial data for discontinued operations\n\n| NOK million                                         | 2021   | 2020    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Revenue                                             | 11,637 | 24,026  |\n| Depreciation, amortization and impairment           | 178    | 3,099   |\n| Other expenses                                      | 10,330 | 23,187  |\n| Earnings before financial items and tax             | 1,149  | (2,024) |\n| Financial income (expense), net                     | 40     | (171)   |\n| Income (loss) before tax                            | 1,189  | (2,195) |\n| Income tax expense                                  | 407    | 31      |\n| Income (loss) from discontinued operations          | 783    | (2,226) |\n| Impairment of discontinued operations               | 850    | -       |\n| Gain on disposal (net of tax)                       | 79     | -       |\n| Gain (loss) from discontinued operations            | 12     | (2,226) |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities | (902)  | 1,345   |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities | 4,563  | (718)   |\n| Net cash used in financing activities               | (13)   | (37)    |\n| Foreign currency effects on cash                    | 2      | -       |\n| Net cash provided by discontinued operations        | 3,650  | 590     |",

Long-lived assets\n\n## Note 2.1 Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Accounting policies for property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (PP&E) is recognized at acquisition cost. The carrying value of PP&E is comprised of the historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The carrying value also includes the estimated value of the asset retirement obligation upon initial recognition of the liability. Hydro uses the cost model for PP&E and investment properties.\n\n## Capitalized maintenance\n\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs applicable to production facilities are capitalized in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment when such costs are incurred on a scheduled basis with a time interval of greater than one year. Expenditures that regularly occur at shorter intervals are expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized and any assets replaced are retired.\n\n## Stripping cost\n\nStripping costs incurred during the mining production phase are allocated between cost of inventory produced and the existing mine asset. Stripping costs are allocated as a component of the mine asset in the event they represent significantly improved access to ore. Stripping costs include such activities as removal of vegetation as well as digging the actual pit for mining the ore.\n\n## Capitalized interest\n\nHydro capitalizes borrowing costs on qualifying assets in accordance with IAS 23 Borrowing Costs. Currency gains or losses related to Hydro's foreign currency denominated borrowings are not capitalized.\n\nThe main components of Hydro's property, plant and equipment is production related machinery and buildings in Hydro's more than 100 operating plants.

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value separately from goodwill when they arise from contractual or legal rights or can be separated from the acquired entity and sold or transferred.\n\n## Emission rights\n\nGovernment granted and purchased CO2 emission allowances expected to be used towards Hydro's own emissions are recognized as intangible assets at nominal value (cost). The amounts are not amortized but are tested for impairment. Actual CO2 emissions which exceed the level covered by emission rights are recognized as a liability. Any sale of excess emission rights is recognized at the time of sale at the transaction price. CO2 emission allowances purchased for trading are measured and classified as inventory.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditures are expensed as incurred. Development costs are capitalized as intangible assets at cost in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets when the recognition criteria are met, including probable future economic benefit and that the cost can be measured reliably.\n\n## Exploration cost\n\nExploration cost for mineral resources are expensed as incurred. Costs related to acquired exploration rights are allocated to the relevant areas and capitalized. An area represents a unit that may be utilized based on shared infrastructure and may include several licenses. Exploration rights are transferred to mine development cost when development starts. Amortization of transferred mineral rights starts when extraction of the resources starts. Exploration rights related to undeveloped areas remain on the balance sheet as intangible assets (mineral rights) until a development is decided or a decision not to develop the area is made.\n\n## Hydro's intangible assets\n\nHydro holds intangible assets mainly as complementary resources to its physical assets. Waterfall rights are fundamental for production of hydroelectrical power, however, a significant share of such rights was granted to Hydro rather than purchased. A significant share of acquired waterfall rights have indefinite life and are thus not amortized. Mineral rights are undeveloped rights related to Hydro's mining operations in Brazil. Other intangible assets include customer relations, technology and other intangible assets identified in acquisitions, in addition to proprietary technology developed internally, and certain other types of intangible assets.",

Mine property and development costs in extractive activities are depreciated using the unit-of-production method, using proved and probable reserves. Tangible and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not depreciated. Estimated useful life by category is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Machinery and equipment, initial investment 4-30 years, for power plants up to 75 years\n- \u00b7 Machinery and equipment, capitalized maintenance 1-15 years\n- \u00b7 Buildings 20-50 years\n- \u00b7 Intangible assets with finite lives 3-10 years, for rights related to hydroelectric power production up to 50 years\n\nA component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a significantly differing useful life and a cost that is significant in relation to the item is depreciated separately. At each financial year-end Hydro reviews the residual value and useful life of its assets, with any estimate changes accounted for prospectively over the remaining useful life of the asset.\n\n## Specification of depreciation and amortization by asset category\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                         | 2021   | 2020    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Buildings                                                      | 1,362  | 1,438   |\n| Machinery and equipment                                        | 6,221  | 6,460   |\n| Intangible assets                                              | 439    | 476     |\n| Depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations     | (178)  | (1,199) |\n| Depreciation and amortization expense in continuing operations | 7,844  | 7,175   |\n\n## Note 2.3 Goodwill\n\n## Accounting policies for goodwill\n\nGoodwill is recognized as a part of business combinations. Goodwill is initially measured either as the excess of the consideration over Hydro's interest in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets (partial goodwill), or as the fair value of 100 percent of the acquiree in excess of the acquiree's identifiable net assets (full goodwill). The method is elected on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Hydro has applied the partial goodwill method for all business combinations completed prior to December 31, 2021. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually, and more frequently if indicators of possible impairment are observed, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units or groups of cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and that are monitored for internal management purposes.\n\n## Hydro's goodwill\n\nGoodwill allocated to Hydro Extrusions was recognized in the acquisition of Sapa AS in 2017. Goodwill allocated to Hydro Bauxite & Alumina was recognized in the acquisition of certain aluminium businesses, mainly in Brazil, in 2011. Goodwill allocated to Hydro Metal Markets was recognized in acquisitions undertaken more than 20 years ago.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million              | Hydro  Extrusions   | Hydro Bauxite  & Alumina   | Hydro Metal  Markets   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Cost                                |                     |                            |                        |         |\n| December 31, 2019                   | 3,897               | 2,247                      | 407                    | 6,551   |\n| Foreign currency translation effect | 35                  | (538)                      | (2)                    | (505)   |\n| December 31, 2020                   | 3,932               | 1,708                      | 405                    | 6,045   |\n| Foreign currency translation effect | (16)                | (96)                       | 4                      | (108)   |\n| December 31, 2021                   | 3,916               | 1,612                      | 409                    | 5,937   |\n| Accumulated impairment              |                     |                            |                        |         |\n| December 31, 2020                   | (1,017)             | -                          | -                      | (1,017) |\n| Foreign currency translation effect | (25)                | -                          | -                      | (25)    |\n| December 31, 2021                   | (1,042)             | -                          | -                      | (1,042) |\n| Carrying value                      |                     |                            |                        |         |\n| December 31, 2020                   | 2,915               | 1,708                      | 405                    | 5,029   |\n| December 31, 2021                   | 2,874               | 1,612                      | 409                    | 4,895   |",

Credit spreads are based on Hydro's credit spreads, while country risk is based on the premiums published by the Swedish Export Credit Agency EKN. The post-tax rates are converted to pre-tax rates using the nominal tax rates in the relevant countries. For Hydro's businesses the pre-tax nominal discount rate is estimated at between 5.5 percent and 15.0 percent (2020: 4.75-14.25 percent).

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite life are required to be tested for impairment annually, in addition to any tests required when impairment indicators are determined to be present. Hydro has elected to do the annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter. Exploration cost for undeveloped mining areas are assessed for impairment under IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.\n\nWhen a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or an asset is tested for impairment, the recoverable amount is estimated as the higher of the CGU's fair value less cost of disposal, or its value in use. The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized in the amount that the carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. Losses are reversed in the event of a subsequent increase in the recoverable amount of an impaired asset, however, impairment of goodwill is not reversed.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for impairment of non-current assets\n\nIAS 36 requires that Hydro assess conditions that could cause an asset or a CGU to become impaired. The identification of CGUs involves judgment, including assessment of where active markets exist, and the level of interdependency of cash inflows. For Hydro, the CGU is either the individual plant, a group of plants that forms an integrated value chain where no independent prices for the intermediate products exist, a group of plants that are combined and managed to serve a common market, or a group of assets where circumstances otherwise indicate significant interdependencies. Assessing which indicators that may cause a CGU to be impaired includes such conditions as Hydro's market capitalization, significant changes in Hydro's planned use of the assets or a significant adverse change in the expected sales volumes or margins, i.e. the combination of product prices, raw material cost and energy cost. Expected or reasonably possible climate and environmental changes, whether physical or regulatory, impacts the assessment of financial viability and remaining useful life. Such factors are assessed in the same way as uncertain market prices for input factors and products, impacting cash flow estimates used for the tests.\n\nDirectly observable market prices rarely exist for our assets. However, fair value may be estimated based on recent transactions on comparable assets, internal models used by Hydro for transactions involving the same type of assets or other relevant information. Calculation of value in use is a discounted cash flow calculation based on continued use of the assets in its present condition, excluding potential exploitation of improvement or expansion potential, and including certain entity specific synergies or other positions.\n\nDetermination of the recoverable amount involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as commodity prices and their impact on markets and prices for upgraded products, development in demand, inflation, operating expenses and tax and legal systems. We use internal business plans, quoted market prices, external market and industry analysis and our best estimate of long-term development in commodity prices and production margins, currency rates, discount rates and other relevant information. A detailed forecast is developed for a period of three to five years with projections thereafter, reflecting our view of the business cycle. Hydro does not include a general growth factor to volumes for the purpose of impairment tests, however, cash flows are generally increased by expected inflation and, where market conditions are depressed, we consider whether full or partial market recovery towards previously observed volumes is justified. Estimated cash flows are discounted with a nominal risk adjusted discount rate specific for the business activity and country.\n\nUncertainty related to world economic development and its impact on demand and prices for Hydro's key products and input factors has been significant during the period, driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, financial rebound, supply chain disruptions as well as strive to reduce climate impact.\n\n## Tests performed in 2021 and 2020\n\nTests for impairment have been performed for all CGUs with mandatory annual tests and the CGUs where impairment indicators have been identified. The recoverable amounts for these units have been determined estimating the Value in Use (VIU) of the asset and/or, if appropriate, its fair value less cost of disposal (FV), and comparing the highest of the two against the carrying value of the CGUs. The calculation of VIU has been based on management's best estimate, reflecting Hydro's business planning process. The discount rates are derived as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a similar business in the same business environment, on an over-the business-cycle view, using 10 years government bond rates, a US equity risk premium, credit spreads and country risk premiums. Beta estimates are reviewed from time to time, considering actual Hydro share observations versus different market indices, analysis of selected peers and external",

Recoverable amount amounted to about NOK 20 billion. The value exceeds the carrying value of NOK 16 billion. The calculation used cash flow forecasts in BRL based on internal plans approved by management covering a five-year period. Production volumes have been assumed at a lower level than nameplate capacity reflecting a scenario incorporating the downside risk of production shortfalls. All significant price assumptions are internally derived based on external references, reflecting both price assumption used for planning purposes and updated market observations at year-end. Cash flows have been projected for the following 35 years based on the five-year detailed forecast period using Hydro's long-term assumptions for alumina prices and key raw material prices. The CGU is expected to remain in operation for at least the 40-year period. Improvements expected from certain planned equipment replacements are included, however, the approved investment facilitating the change in energy supply replacing coal with natural gas is not reflected. Further improvements are not included in the cash flow forecasts. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are inflated by the expected long-term inflation levels in Brazil and the main western economies.\n\nThe main assumptions to which the test is sensitive are shown in the table below:\n\nAssumptions\n\n|                                                                   | 2022   | Long-term   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|\n| Exchange rate BRL/USD                                             | 5.30   |             |\n| Alumina price, long-term price represent real terms 2021 (USD/mt) | 350    | 345         |\n| Production volume alumina (million mt)                            | 6.1    | 6.1         |\n| Discount rate nominal, pre-tax                                    | 15.00% | 15.00%      |\n\nSignificant cash flows are denominated in US dollars. These are translated to BRL at a rate of 5.30 for 2022 with a stronger BRL in the period 2023 to 2029, reaching a nominal rate of 5.24 in 2029. For future periods the exchange rate is projected with a rate development reflecting the inflation difference of 1.1 to 1.3 percentage points between international inflation and the higher expected Brazil specific inflation.\n\nThe parameters presented below represent a stress test, identifying changes in each parameter which would result in a recoverable amount equal to the carrying amount of the CGU, while keeping all other parameters unchanged. The changed parameter is applied for the entire period, including the terminal value. The decrease in annual cash flows does not represent a reasonably possible scenario developed by Hydro. As the key parameters are interdependent, a change in the range indicated would not be expected to continue for the entire period of operation. If one of the key parameters were changed with no changes to the other assumptions, the estimated recoverable amount for the CGU would equal the carrying amount with the following long-term real 2021 assumptions over the entire 40-year period:\n\n% change\n\nValue\n\n| Exchange rate BRL/USD                 | 5%   |        |\n|---------------------------------------|------|--------|\n| Alumina price, real term 2021(USD/mt) | (2%) | 337    |\n| Discount rate (% point)               | 14%  | 17.25% |\n\n## Annual mandatory impairment tests\n\n## Hydro Extrusions\n\nGoodwill in Hydro Extrusions is allocated to four groups of CGUs reflecting the way the business is managed to serve the relevant markets. The groups of CGUs are as follows:\n\nExtrusion North America covers production plants, marketing and product development in the US and Canada. The operation consists of 22 production plants, recognized intangible assets and goodwill from Hydro's acquisition.\n\nExtrusion Europe covers production plants, marketing and product development in Europe, mainly within the EU. The operation consists of 34 production plants, recognized intangible assets and goodwill from Hydro's acquisition.\n\nBuilding Systems covers production plants, product warehouses, marketing and product development facilities, mainly in Europe, and sales and marketing offices covering a wider presence. The operation is present at 58 locations in 26 countries. The asset base consists of a limited number of production plants, several warehouses of differing size and complexity, three brands, other intangible assets and goodwill from Hydro's acquisition.\n\nPrecision Tubing covers production plants, marketing and product development on four continents. The operation consists of 10 production plants in South America, Asia, Europe and North America, recognized intangible assets and goodwill from Hydro's acquisition.\n\nThe impairment tests for all of the groups of CGUs described above are cash flow models expressed in nominal terms using forecasts for the first five years based on internal business plans approved by management. Margins, volumes and investments are considered highly correlated, as high margin above the metal value is achieved through production of more complex products, requiring higher cost and/or more expensive equipment. We have thus not considered development in margins, cost and volume separately. Cash flows have been projected as terminal values beyond the fiveyear forecast period with a zero nominal growth assumed. Key assumptions are development in annual net cash flows, comprising volume and cost development in relevant market segments, as well as the discount rate.\n\nThe main assumptions and sensitivities are shown in the tables below. The sensitivities represent a stress test, identifying changes in each parameter which would result in a recoverable amount equal to the carrying amount of the CGU, while keeping all other parameters unchanged. The changed parameter is applied for the entire period, including the terminal value. The decrease in annual cash flows does not represent a reasonably possible scenario developed by Hydro, as changes in the market resulting in significantly reduced cash flows for individual plants or the whole business unit is likely to be mitigated with measures to reduce costs, including sale or closure of production lines or plants similar to what is currently ongoing.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                         | Extrusion North  America   | Extrusion  Europe   | Building  Systems   | Precision  Tubing   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Carrying value of goodwill                     | 1,427                      | 779                 | 521                 | 147                 |\n| Carrying value of other assets                 | 6,491                      | 6,452               | 2,727               | 2,331               |\n| Carrying value of CGU                          | 7,918                      | 7,231               | 3,248               | 2,478               |\n| Recoverable amount                             | 9,274                      | 15,217              | 12,135              | 9,275               |\n| Recoverable amount in excess of carrying value | 1,356                      | 7,986               | 8,887               | 6,797               |\n| Key assumptions                                |                            |                     |                     |                     |\n| Terminal value growth                          | 0.0%                       | 0.0%                | 0.0%                | 0.0%                |\n| Discount rate                                  | 7.25%                      | 6.00%               | 6.00%               | 8.50%               |\n| Stress test                                    |                            |                     |                     |                     |\n| Discount rate - % change                       | 19%                        | 127%                | 286%                | 257%                |\n| Discount rate - % point                        | 8.60%                      | 13.60%              | 23.10%              | 30.40%              |\n| Annual reduction in net cash flow all years    | 16%                        | 55%                 | 72%                 | 68%                 |",

This CGU is tested for impairment using a FV approach based on observed transaction values for power production assets in the Nordic region. The recoverable amount, estimated as a post-tax fair value, exceeds the carrying amount significantly.\n\n## Impairment tests based on indications of loss in value\n\nHydro Aluminium Metal\n\nThe primary aluminium plant Slovalco was tested for impairment as of the end of 2021 following the decision to curtail the production further, resulting in recognizing the contracts for fixed price power purchases in 2022 at their market value. The test, reflecting power cost at current high market prices, resulted in an estimated negative VIU for the primary production, resulting in an impairment loss of NOK 286 million.\n\nSlovalco was also tested for possible impairment in the second quarter of 2020. The recoverable amount was determined as VIU based on Hydro's internal assumptions for production volumes, aluminium prices, raw material prices including energy, currency exchange rates and timing of cash flows. Contract prices were used for raw materials and energy for periods covered by specific contracts with external suppliers. For periods where such consumption was not yet contracted, or where internal supply of such items as alumina was expected, estimated market prices were used. The value in use was calculated as an expected value including a full restart of curtailed capacity, or a partial or full curtailment of the plant for an extended period. The cost position, including energy cost beyond the contract which expired at the end of 2021, was considered unfavorable. The estimated value in use amounted to NOK 292 million using a discount rate of 9.5 percent. The resulting impairment loss amounted to NOK 504 million.\n\nAll other aluminium plants were tested for impairment at the end of June 2020 with the conclusion that the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount.\n\nHydro's investment in the joint venture Qatalum was tested for impairment in 2020. The assumptions and method used were similar to what was used for Hydro's aluminium plants, as the underlying business risks are similar. Additional risks relevant for the joint venture includes the regulatory and business climate in Qatar and the Middle East, including trade relations to the rest of the world, and the uncertain tax situation for the company described in Note 3.1 Investments in joint arrangements and associates.\n\n## Hydro Extrusion\n\nSome assets related to plants and activities which are sold or closed have been written down to estimated selling price during 2021, in total NOK 150 million, mainly in Europe.\n\nThe uncertainty in the world economic development led us to conclude that impairment indicators existed for several of our Cash Generating Units (CGUs) as of the end of June 2020. As of July 2020, it was highly uncertain when and to what level economic activity would return. About 75 percent of the carrying values in the Hydro Extrusions segment were tested for impairment. A conclusion that a write-down was required was reached for Extrusion North America, where goodwill was partly impaired. The recoverable amount was estimated at NOK 9.1 billion. Assumed sales volumes and the discount rate were less favorable at the end of June compared to the market conditions in later periods, reflecting the recovery in the market. The recoverable amount was estimated as a value in use discounted with a pretax discount rate of 7.25 percent. The test is sensitive to volumes and margins, which are interdependent, and also to the cost level, which is adjusted in response to market conditions and thus fixed over limited periods, however, no restructuring measures beyond what were committed at the time of testing were included in the estimated cash flows.\n\nIn addition, three CGUs in Extrusions Europe, and one CGU in Precision Tubing were determined to be impaired. Further, some assets related to one plant in India which was closed in June 2020 and some operations where closure or downsizing was ongoing were written down by a combined amount of about NOK 500 million.\n\nAdditional CGUs in Hydro Extrusions with a total carrying amount of about NOK 9 billion were tested for impairment with the conclusion that the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount and thus no impairment was present.\n\nThe CGU consisting of the Alunorte alumina refinery, the main bauxite source Paragominas and certain related activities, including goodwill, was tested for impairment at the end of the second quarter 2020. The test resulted in a marginal coverage over the carrying amount.\n\n## Hydro Bauxite & Alumina\n\n## Reversal of impairment\n\nA previous impairment write-down of NOK 161 million related to an industrial park in Germany was reversed during 2020. The property, which was classified as investment property, was sold in July 2020.",

Leased assets with a remaining lease period of less than 12 months at inception are excluded from lease accounting. Further, leases of assets of a low value (small asset leases), mainly such items as PCs, office equipment and similar, are excluded from lease accounting. When measuring leases, Hydro include fixed lease payments for extension periods reasonably certain to be used. As a practical expedient, non-lease components are not separated from lease contracts for most asset classes. For production facilities and transportation assets, such as vessels used for transportation of material, the operating cost is a significant non-lease component, and is excluded from lease accounting. Variable lease payments, including service elements related to leases which are fully variable amounts, are recognized as operating expenses in the periods incurred.\n\nRight-of-use assets are included in property, plant and equipment, see Note 2.1 Property, plant and equipment. Lease liabilities are included in debt, see Note 7.4 Short and long-term debt.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for leasing\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine whether some service contracts conveys the right to control an asset to Hydro, and thus is, or contains, a lease. Hydro has a limited number of such contracts; however, they do exist in some arrangements with service providers for maintenance services, transportation services, and some operational subcontractors. In assessing whether such contracts are leases, Hydro assesses both the share of the supplier's capacity for relevant assets that is available for Hydro as well as how decisions are made.\n\nJudgment is also applied in assessing whether renewal options are reasonably certain to be utilized. In assessing such issues, Hydro considers such factors as the level of operational integration and dependency as well as historic practices for renewals.\n\nFor some contracts where all, or close to all, produced products are purchased by Hydro with no or very limited fixed payments, the contract may be deemed a lease with fully variable payments. Currently, Hydro has no significant such contracts.\n\n## Hydro's leases\n\nHydro uses lease contracts primarily where lease or rental contracts provide operational benefits or flexibility compared to owning assets. Leased land and buildings are used for warehouses, office space and certain other arrangements where the need for such space is of a temporary nature or where land and/or buildings are not available for purchase. This is the case in some countries, and also in co-locations with certain other businesses such as in port areas. Further, Hydro has a lease arrangement for its head office in Oslo, Norway, and certain other office locations where the location is independent of production facilities. Production equipment is leased or rented where the access to the specific assets is combined with significant services, for instance seaborn transport operated by the supplier/lessor. Operational services in combination with leasing of assets is also used for such services as maintenance activities, earth-moving operations, and certain other non-core services. Leasing or rental is in some instances also used for equipment operated by Hydro, often under contracts significantly shorter than the assets' useful life.\n\nHydro determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources, and makes adjustments for currency and duration to reflect the terms of the lease.",

Special voting rights may extend control beyond what is conveyed through the owners' proportional ownership interest. Such rights may take the form of a specified number of board representatives, the right of refusal for important decisions, or the requirement of a qualified majority for important decisions which effectively results in joint control with the specific ownership situation. Joint ventures are joint arrangement which represents a residual interest in the arrangement rather than an interest in assets and responsibility for liabilities.\n\nAn associate is an equity investment in which Hydro has the ability to exercise significant influence, which is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity. Significant influence is assumed to exist when Hydro owns between 20 and 50 percent of the voting rights unless other terms and conditions affect Hydro's influence.\n\nHydro accounts for investments in associates and participation in joint ventures using the equity method. This involves recognizing Hydro's interest based on its proportional share of the entity's equity, including any excess values and goodwill. Hydro recognizes its share of net income, including depreciation and amortization of excess values and any impairment losses, in Share of the profit (loss) in equity accounted investments. Other comprehensive income derived from associates and joint ventures is included in Hydro's Other comprehensive income. Hydro's proportional share of unrealized profits resulting from transactions with associates and joint ventures, including transfer of businesses, is eliminated. Accounting policies used by associates and joint ventures may differ from the accounting policies adopted by Hydro. Differences in recognition or measurement are adjusted for prior to equity accounting.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are tested for impairment when there are indications of a possible loss in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount, estimated as the higher of fair value less cost of disposal or value in use, is below Hydro's carrying value. Impairment losses are reversed if circumstances change and the impairment situation is no longer deemed to exist.\n\nHydro is involved in one associate for which the results of operations is taxable profit or loss for the owners rather than the associate, a tax transparent company. Hydro provides for deferred tax on temporary differences in the associate to the extent such temporary differences are expected to reverse within the foreseeable future, or such reversal is not controlled by Hydro. Deferred tax on other temporary differences is not recognized.\n\nLoans to associates and joint ventures are measured under IFRS 9 Financial instruments. Loans where contractual cash flows are only payments of principal and interest on specific dates are measured at amortized cost with expected credit losses provided for. Other loan arrangements are measured at fair value. Loans and receivables to associates and joint ventures are presented as part of other similar loans to unrelated parties. Income and expenses related to loans are included in finance income and expense.\n\n## Investments in joint operations and jointly owned assets\n\nJoint operations are arrangements under contractually joint control where the joint operators have an interest in the assets; or benefits from the service potential of the assets; as well as have a direct obligation for the liabilities of the joint arrangement. Joint operations can result from the legal form of the arrangement or other facts and circumstances resulting in an interest in the service potential of the asset and obligation for liabilities. Jointly owned assets are arrangements where Hydro and the other partners have a direct ownership in specifically identified assets, but where joint control is not established. Hydro recognizes its share of assets, liabilities, revenues, if any, and expenses of joint operations and jointly owned assets on a line-by-line basis in the group financial statements.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for joint arrangements and associates\n\nHydro is engaged in various arrangements on a joint basis with other companies. In assessing whether joint control exists for these arrangements we evaluate the legal framework and contracts governing the arrangement combined with an assessment of which decisions that significantly influence the return from the arrangement. Arrangements owned on a 50/50 basis and/or governed by unanimous decisions constitute the majority of our joint arrangements.\n\nMost of our joint arrangements are joint production facilities supplying metal and other products for Hydro's value chain. Hydro assesses whether joint arrangements are joint operations where Hydro has a direct interest in the assets and direct liability to settle obligations, directly or indirectly, or a joint venture where we have an interest in the net assets of the joint arrangement. In this assessment we evaluate the contracts governing the arrangement and the legal framework for the type of entity in which the arrangement is operated. Hydro is engaged in both joint arrangements that are considered joint ventures, and arrangements that are concluded to be joint operations.\n\n## Hydro's joint operations\n\nOf our joint operations, two are classified as joint operations based on the legal form of the operations. These are Tomago, an aluminium smelter in Australia, and Skafs\u00e5 ANS, a power producer in Norway. Another arrangement is classified as joint operations based on the contractual arrangement whereby all output is sold to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership interest at a cost based price formula. The major or sole sources of cash inflows for the joint arrangement is the owners, who are legally obliged to cover production costs. This is Aluminium & Chemie Rotterdam B.V., Aluchemie, an anode producer in the Netherlands which was closed at the end of 2021.\n\n## Hydro's joint ventures\n\nThe following joint venture is considered material for Hydro:\n\nQatar Aluminium Ltd. (Qatalum) is a primary aluminium smelter with a dedicated power plant located in Qatar. Qatalum has an annual production capacity of about 600,000 mt of liquid metal. Qatalum is owned by Hydro and Qatar Aluminium Manufacturing Company Q.P.S.C. (50 percent each). Qatar Energy, previously Qatar Petroleum, controls Qatar Aluminium Manufacturing Company, which is listed on the Qatar Stock Exchange. Qatalum was at the outset granted a ten-year income tax holiday, expiring in 2020. There has been a long period of uncertainty with regards to the applicable tax rate for Qatalum after the expiry of the tax holiday in 2020. It has been Hydro's consistent position that the generally applicable tax rate, currently at 10 percent, should apply to Qatalum after the expiry of the tax holiday. However, the joint venture partners have not been able to agree on a common interpretation of the applicable tax law, and Qatalum filed its 2020 tax return applying a 35 percent tax rate on 30 June 2021. Hydro is pursuing alternative measures to protect its financial interest in this matter.\n\nHydro is committed to sell fixed quantities of alumina and purchase all products from Qatalum at market prices. Purchases of metal from Qatalum amounted to NOK 14,172 million in 2021 and NOK 11,055 million in 2020. Related payables amounted to NOK 1,360 million in 2021 and NOK 921 million at the end of 2020. Sales from Hydro to Qatalum amounted to NOK 2,031 million in 2021 and NOK 1,944 million in 2020, primarily alumina. Related receivables amounted to NOK 0 million and NOK 73 million at the end of the periods. Qatalum is part of Hydro Aluminium Metal\n\n## Hydro's associates\n\nThe following associate is considered material for Hydro:\n\nLyse Kraft DA is a power producer with head office in Stavanger, Norway operating several power plants in the southwest of Norway, and having ownership interests in two other part-owned arrangements in nearby areas. In total Lyse Kraft DA has an annual production of about 9.5 TWh, which is contributed in kind to the owners. The owners are responsible for paying all costs in the partnership, both for operating costs and future investments. The company was established on December 31, 2020 by contribution of power production assets. Hydro owns 25.6 percent of the company, while Lyse AS owns a controlling 74.4 percent.\n\nHydro contributed the R\u00f8ldal Suldal assets as a contribution in kind to Lyse Kraft DA on December 31, 2020 and received a 25.6 percent ownership interest in the company as consideration. The gross value of the ownership interest was valued at NOK 7.8 billion, resulting in a gross gain of NOK 7.1 billion. The valuation includes significant unobservable inputs, i.e. a level 3 valuation. According to Hydro's accounting policy, the relative share of ownership in the acquiring company, Lyse Kraft DA, is eliminated as an unrealized gain. The recognized gain was thus NOK 5,308 million in 2020. The carrying value of Hydro's ownership in Lyse Kraft DA was NOK 6,768 million as of December 31, 2021 and NOK 6,805 million as of December 31, 2020. Related recognized deferred tax liability was NOK 915 million as of December 31, 2021 and NOK 831 million as of December 31, 2020, related to temporary differences for which reversal of the differences are not controlled by Hydro. These temporary differences are mainly related to depreciable assets recognized at estimated fair value.",

Such estimates may vary from the ultimate outcome as a result of differing interpretations of laws and facts.\n\nThe main judgmental assessments falls into two categories; whether a liability exists, and the amount of a possible liability. The existence or non-existence of a liability is a legal and/or factual assessment. The measurement of a possible liability is more challenging for requirements to remediate or rectify alleged wrong-doing than for monetary claims of compensation. In relation to perceived non-compliance with laws and regulations, authorities, nongovernmental organizations, or others may claim that Hydro is responsible for mitigating actions and compensation. The legal basis for such claims as well as cost calculation and other aspects can be difficult to assess.\n\nHydro's industrial and mining activities are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations, including endof-life remediation regulations. The extent of site and off-site contamination, the remediation methods, and requirements that relevant environmental authorities may impose, are uncertain. The long-term use of sites, with increasing awareness of effects of contamination in society, and generally lower acceptance of contamination in communities over time impacts the content of legal standards and the responsibility of companies involved in such activities. Further, changes in remediation methods and requirements and the uncertainty of cost levels for actions to be performed years and decades into the future contribute to the uncertainty in assessing and measuring such obligations. Remediation and closure activities expected to be conducted far into the future are less accurately measured than near-term planned activities. Consequently, there is significant uncertainty inherent in the estimates.\n\nIndirect tax regimes are complex in many jurisdictions and cross-border. Basis for such taxes may differ from actual transaction prices. Tax authorities may challenge Hydro's calculation of taxes and credits from prior periods. Such processes may lead to changes to prior periods' operating or financial expenses to be recognized in the period of change.\n\n## Provisions\n\n|                                                                | 2021       | 2021      | 2021   | 2020       | 2020      | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|--------|------------|-----------|--------|\n| Amounts in NOK million                                         | Short-term | Long-term | Total  | Short-term | Long-term | Total  |\n| Environmental clean-up and asset  retirement obligations (ARO) | 535        | 3,670     | 4,205  | 695        | 3,767     | 4,461  |\n| Employee benefits                                              | 1,417      | 387       | 1,804  | 1,056      | 685       | 1,741  |\n| Indirect taxes                                                 | 5          | 209       | 215    | 8          | 249       | 257    |\n| Rationalization and closure cost                               | 167        | 45        | 212    | 511        | 329       | 840    |\n| Other                                                          | 1,003      | 460       | 1,464  | 665        | 576       | 1,242  |\n| Total provisions                                               | 3,128      | 4,772     | 7,899  | 2,935      | 5,605     | 8,541  |\n\nThe following table includes a specification of changes to provisions for the year ending December 31, 2021.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                   | Environmental  clean-up and ARO   | Employee  benefits   | Indirect taxes   | Rationalization  and closure cost   | Other   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Specification of change in  provisions                   |                                   |                      |                  |                                     |         |         |\n| December 31, 2020                                        | 4,461                             | 1,741                | 257              | 840                                 | 1,242   | 8,541   |\n| Additions                                                | 1,018                             | 1,672                | 15               | 132                                 | 772     | 3,608   |\n| Used during the year                                     | (531)                             | (1,011)              | (12)             | (445)                               | (391)   | (2,390) |\n| Reversal of unused provisions                            | (14)                              | (90)                 | (31)             | (7)                                 | (97)    | (240)   |\n| Accretion expense and effect of  change in discount rate | (35)                              | 7                    | -                | -                                   | 50      | 22      |\n| Reclassified to assets held for sale                     | (554)                             | (462)                | -                | (283)                               | (58)    | (1,357) |\n| Foreign currency translation                             | (141)                             | (54)                 | (13)             | (24)                                | (55)    | (286)   |\n| December 31, 2021                                        | 4,205                             | 1,804                | 215              | 212                                 | 1,464   | 7,899   |\n\nProvisions for environmental clean-up and asset retirement obligations relate to production facilities currently in operation and facilities that are closed.

Uncertain outcomes are measured as the expected value of reasonably possible outcomes. Provisions are based on the current legal framework and remediation standards. The provision is measured as the present value of the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation. Expected cash flows are discounted with a risk-free interest rate, usually a government bond rate for the duration to expected settlement.\n\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from a past event, with the resolution of the contingency dependent on uncertain future events, or a present obligation where no outflow is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognized on the balance sheet, the existence of such contingent liabilities and, if estimable the approximate size, are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is remote.\n\n## Asset retirement obligations\n\nHydro recognizes liabilities for the estimated fair value of asset retirement obligations (ARO) relating to assets where such obligations exists, in the period incurred in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. The provision is estimated as the present value of costs relating to the restoration or rehabilitation of industrial or mining sites and/or dismantlement or removal of buildings or other assets. The liability is recognized when an asset is constructed and ready for use or when the obligation is incurred if imposed at a later date. Related asset retirement costs are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Accretion expense is recognized for the change in the present value of the liability and classified as part of Financial expense. Other changes to estimated fair value of ARO are recognized when identified. The increase or reduction to the liability is recognized as an increase or reduction of the value of the asset unless the asset is no longer in use, in which case the change is recognized in operating expenses. Liabilities that are conditional on a future event (e.g. the timing or method of settlement) are recognized when the value of the liability can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Exit and disposal costs\n\nHydro recognizes a provision in the amount of the direct costs associated with an exit and/or disposal activity when a formal commitment to a detailed exit plan is made and communicated to those affected. A provision for termination benefits to employees is recognized as of the date of notification to individual employees or their representatives.\n\n## Accounting policies for uncertain assets\n\nAssets where the existence of an asset or Hydro's control with the resources is less than virtually certain are contingent assets. Contingent assets are not recognized.",

The provision represents the present value of expected outflows at the times of expected payments. There is significant uncertainty both in the timing and amount of these remediation actions, as they are linked to future business decisions as well as decisions and approval by authorities in the jurisdictions we operate. Provisions are based on the current legal framework and remediation standards. Hydro is in the process of assessing whether the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM), issued by ICMM 1) , PRI 2) and UNEP 3) , will require additional effort and costs. Currently, no significant additional liabilities have been identified. The GISTM framework may not be fully reflected in the remediation standards used for estimating actions and cost. No significant changes in cost estimates have been identified.\n\nThe most significant provisions relate to the following sites and issues. For Hydro Bauxite & Alumina's mine in Brazil we have obligations to remediate the tailing areas and mining sites, including reforestation of the area and monitoring and maintenance of the site after initial remediation. The process for depositing of mining tailings were changed during 2020. Such tailings are now brought back to the mine and permanently deposited rather than remaining in dedicated tailing areas. The new method is intended to reduce the cost and risks associated with care and maintenance after the mining activity. For Hydro Bauxite & Alumina's alumina refinery in Brazil we have obligations to remediate bauxite residue deposits, including monitoring the contamination levels and other aspects after initial remediation. Some activities related to these obligations are currently performed as integrated processes with ongoing deposit of residues produced in the alumina production. For Hydro Aluminium Metal's closed Kurri Kurri smelter site in Australia we have obligations to remediate certain contaminated areas at the site and have now secured approval for the appropriate long-term containment of historical spent pot lining and certain other waste material. The work is progressing and is expected to be completed during 2023. Once completed, and following a monitoring period of five years, the containment cell will transfer to state ownership. Further, Hydro has provided for various remediation obligations in Hydro Extrusions related to both closed sites, whether previously operated or not, and for some currently active sites. Hydro also has obligations for remediation of contamination on site and in areas related to historic industrial activities, mainly in Germany and Norway, reported in Other and eliminations. The more significant of these sites are the sites in Schwandorf in Germany and the Grenland area in Norway. The GISTM may impact remediation requirements for some of these sites. For many of these provisions, there are no standard remediation methods available and cost is therefore uncertain. The provision also includes remediation of spent pot lining and certain other process related waste in all active smelters, remediation of certain known landfills and removal of limited contaminated material as well as site clearance for certain leased land. Provisions also exist for certain liabilities related to Norwegian power plant concessions to be reverted to the Norwegian Government.\n\nProvisions for employee benefits relate to expected short-term performance bonus payments and short and long-term provisions for expected bonus payments that are based on the number of years of service, primarily for our European operations. Such bonuses are expected to be paid in periods between 10 to 50 years of service, or upon termination of employment.\n\nIndirect taxes include taxes not related to taxable income, such as value added taxes, duties and property taxes. Provision for indirect taxes is mainly related to operations in Brazil.\n\nRationalization and closure cost included provisions for the improvement program in the Hydro Rolling business, which was divested in 2021. Further, Hydro Extrusions has provided for costs related to plant closures and employee reductions to reduce their footprint in response to challenging market conditions. The provision also includes costs related to the closure of Hydro's joint operation Aluchemie.\n\nOther includes insurance provisions related to insurance contracts issued by Hydro's captive insurance company, Industriforsikring AS, to external parties including associates and joint arrangements, provisions for legal and other disputes, community donations and other contributions committed, certain liabilities related to representation and warranty provisions related to sale of businesses.\n\nHydro has entered into several agreements with authorities at local and state levels in Par\u00e1, Brazil, requiring Hydro to improve operational security and to make additional efforts and investments related to local societies close to the plants and to the social development of communities in Barcarena. The most significant agreements were entered into in 2018 related to the alumina refinery, Alunorte. Total remaining provisions related to these obligations are about NOK 590 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nHydro is involved in or threatened with various legal and tax matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Where Hydro considers an obligation to be possible, i.e. not probable yet not remote, it is disclosed as a contingent liability.\n\nHydro is involved in a significant number of tax cases related to various types of taxes. Hydro's businesses in Brazil have a large portfolio of cases disputed by tax authorities, of which the majority relates to indirect taxes. Disputes include cases in the administrative and legal dispute systems with various background and risk of loss. In total known cases amount to about NOK 3 billion, of which losses are considered possible in cases amounting to about NOK 2.5 billion. A significant share of those amounts is covered by tax indemnifications from acquisition. The final outcome of these cases is not expected until several years into the future, and is highly uncertain. Additional cases may be raised by tax authorities based on tax declarations for periods not yet assessed, or when interpretation of tax regulations change. Hydro has provided for individual tax cases where the risk of loss is considered above 50 percent. Provisions for indirect taxes are included in provisions disclosed above, while provisions for income tax expenses are included in Taxes payable.\n\nHydro has environmental liabilities related to several sites and issues. Where remediation is acknowledged as Hydro's responsibility or a legal obligation is deemed to exist, a provision for the best estimate of costs to be incurred is established. For many of our industrial sites, in particular sites where operation is expected to continue indefinitely, remediation costs are difficult to assess. The precise need for remediation actions, their method, timing and cost has not yet been planned, and hence the cost is uncertain. For some impacted areas it is not yet known whether remediation will be required. This may depend on the pace of any natural attenuation, and development in what the environmental authorities judge to be reasonable remediation requirements. For some areas, the exact extent of pollution may be uncertain. If an environmental risk assessment has concluded that the current risk is acceptable, a detailed sampling program may not have been carried out. Obligations for historic contamination of sites and surrounding areas in addition to areas provided for may be identified and deemed Hydro's responsibility in the future, whether related to currently owned or used sites, or sites we previously have owned and/or used. The cost of remediation of any additional contamination deemed Hydro's responsibility is uncertain.\n\nAuthorities and non-governmental organizations have filed several lawsuits related to the Alunorte incident, claiming a combination of mitigating actions and financial compensation. The argumentation, cost calculation and legal basis for these claims is still highly uncertain. Further claims may still be received. Given the limited information about claimed physical and moral damages to be compensated, and the extent and cost of mitigating actions claimed, or the extent or content of other potential claims and lawsuits, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposure for Hydro. It is further not possible to estimate the timing of when such claims may be determined or when any payments may arise.\n\nHydro is also exposed to increased product warranty and product liability responsibilities, both as result of contractual commitments and caused by liability under background law. Product warranty and product liability may impose significant costs depending amongst other things on the application of the product sold. Similarly, disputes over whether failure to deliver products under contract are related to force majeure or not occur from time to time, both for Hydro's delivery obligations and rights. Such disputes may involve significant amounts and outcomes may be difficult to assess.\n\nHydro is exposed to legal cases based on contractual or other basis, including related to contract delivery or purchase obligations or warranties and representations given in relation to sale of businesses. Where a payment is probable, a provision for the likely amount is recognized.",

Contracts covering a fixed, committed volume at fixed or determinable prices are relevant for this assessment. Delivery period for such contracts can cover a period of a few weeks, and up to one year. Some few contracts cover more than one year. Prices are usually a combination of fixed elements and market references such as the aluminium price at the London Metal Exchange or other market references, at, or prior to, delivery. Revenue related to products that are not made to the customers' specification is recognized at delivery of products to customers. Such contracts accounts for the majority of sales in the segments Hydro Bauxite & Alumina, Hydro Aluminium Metal and Hydro Metal Markets, and a significant share of sales in Hydro Extrusions. Some of these contracts include an element of freight services, which is considered a separate performance obligation under IFRS 15, and related revenue is recognized over the time of journey.\n\nFor products made to customer specifications and orders, we have assessed whether the finished product has an alternative use to Hydro, and whether Hydro at all times has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. For contracts where both of these conditions are fulfilled, revenue shall be recognized over time from commencement of production of the specialized product until completion of delivery to the customer. For Hydro's products, the alternative use of customer designed products would, in most cases, be as an input to the production of other products rather than for sale of the product unchanged. We have assessed whether Hydro has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable margin, throughout the production period. The assessment is primarily related to the segment Hydro Extrusions. The main assessment is related to which compensation Hydro would be entitled to in a situation where firm orders are canceled or amended by the customer. Our conclusion is that for close to all contracts we do not have an enforceable right to payment as described in IFRS 15, and revenue is thus recognized at a point in time. However, as our conclusions depends both on legal assessment of a large number of contracts in many countries, and on the understanding of what constitutes an enforceable right to payment under IFRS 15, we might reach a different conclusion in the future for some contracts, or for new contracts covering similar products and customer segments entered into in the future. Also for these contracts, prices are fixed at the time of delivery.\n\n## Payment and warranty terms\n\nPayment terms for products vary between customer segments and regions. The predominant terms vary between 30 to 90 days, and up to 180 days in some markets.\n\nHydro's warranty terms vary by product and business segment. Generally, Hydro provides warranty that product complies with specification, and offer repair, replacement or refund of consideration paid for breaches. Such warranties are limited in time, for most products not exceeding 12 months. Individual contracts may include more extensive warranty clauses where Hydro takes responsibility also for some consequential damages, mainly related to more complex products such as certain automotive parts. Warranty liability is to some degree influenced by legal requirements, which may extend the time period for Hydro's liability.",

Sale of energy from other segments represent excess energy purchased under contracts exceeding the operational needs, and relate to periodic maintenance stops or curtailment. Revenue from sale of energy includes the revenue from sale of concession power, a legal requirement to deliver a certain part of volume produced in Norway to local authorities at a reduced price. Revenue from concession power amounted to NOK 70 million and NOK 75 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Other information\n\nRealized and unrealized changes in fair value of commodity derivatives are also presented as part of revenue. These amounts are measured at fair value as required by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The instruments are mainly aluminium and power contracts used for risk management purposes, and are included in Other revenue in the table below.\n\nHydro's revenue divided by segment and geographic location of the customer is shown in Note 1.4 Operating and geographic segment information.

This includes gains and losses resulting from the disposal of PP&E and intangible assets, investments in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures as well as government grants, insurance compensation, and rental revenue. Other income, net also includes revenue from utilities, which is revenue from contracts with customers accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized in accordance with IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. Grants are recognized when there is a reasonable assurance that Hydro will comply with relevant conditions and that the grants will be received. Government grants are deferred in Other non-current liabilities until the associated activity is performed or expenses recognized.

Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and selling costs. Inventory cost includes direct materials, direct labor and a portion of production overhead (manufactured goods) or the purchase price of the inventory. Abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials are recognized as expense in the current period. Inventory write-downs to net realizable value occurs when the cost of the inventory is not recoverable, and is reversed in later periods if there is clear evidence of an increase in the net realizable value.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million        | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Spare parts and raw materials | 6,896  | 5,995  |\n| Work in progress              | 2,624  | 4,062  |\n| Alumina                       | 1,883  | 1,349  |\n| Aluminium casthouse products  | 7,250  | 4,771  |\n| Fabricated products           | 3,139  | 3,315  |\n| Inventories                   | 21,791 | 19,492 |\n\nRaw materials include purchased raw materials such as bauxite, caustic soda, oil, coal and other input factors used in the production; however, excluding alumina and aluminium intended for use in Hydro's production of other products. All amounts are net of any write-downs.\n\n## Note 6.2 Trade and other receivables\n\n## Accounting policies for trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognized at transaction price, subsequently accounted for at amortized cost and are reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis. Individual accounts are assessed for impairment taking into consideration indicators of financial difficulty and management assessment. Portfolios of trade receivables where expected losses are more than insignificant are reduced for those expected losses. Discounting generally does not have a material effect on trade receivables, however, in special cases discounting may be applied. Hydro's business model for most trade receivable is to hold the receivables to collect the contractual cash flows. For some portfolios of trade receivables, factoring is applied.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for receivables\n\nIn some jurisdictions, including Brazil, significant tax credit amounts are generated for use against future indirect and/ or income tax payments. Repayment in cash is made subject to a set of conditions, including availability of funds at the tax authorities, and cannot be expected on a regular basis. The value of such credits depends on future generation of taxes. Economic conditions and tax regulations may change and lead to a different conclusion regarding recoverability.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million      | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Trade receivables           | 17,350 | 15,753 |\n| VAT and other sales taxes   | 726    | 723    |\n| Other current receivables   | 2,891  | 2,367  |\n| Allowance for credit losses | (388)  | (478)  |\n| Trade and other receivables | 20,579 | 18,364 |\n\nOf total trade receivables at year end 2021, about 9 percent were past due, with the majority within 30 days.

During 2021 net cash provided by continuing operating activities exceeded net cash used in continuing investing activities plus dividends paid.\n\n## Credit rating\n\nTo secure access to capital markets at attractive terms and remain financially solid, Hydro aims to maintain an investment grade credit rating from the leading agencies, S&P Global (current rating BBB, stable outlook) and Moody's (current rating Baa3, stable outlook). Hydro's key targets for financial solidity are described below.\n\n## Funding and liquidity\n\nHydro manages its funding requirements centrally to cover group operating requirements and long-term capital needs. Hydro has an ambition to access national and international capital markets as primary sources for external long-term funding.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Hydro held NOK 22.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, NOK 2.4 billion were held as time deposits and money market funds, classified as short-term investments. These instruments are managed as part of Hydro's liquidity management, aiming to optimize the return on cash positions. Hydro's policy is that the maturity of such positions shall be shorter than 12 months. Time deposits are normally available at shorter notice, subject to bank approval and potential break costs. Hydro has a syndicated USD 1,600 million revolving credit facility maturing in December 2026, including a USD 1,500 million swingline as a sub-facility to cover short-term liquidity needs. The facility was undrawn per year-end 2021. In addition, Hydro has access to overdraft facilities and liquidity lines which provide additional short-term liquidity.\n\n## Funding of subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities\n\nNormally the parent company, Norsk Hydro ASA, extends loans or equity to wholly-owned subsidiaries to fund capital requirements. All financing is executed on an arm's length basis. To the extent Hydro offers loans to part-owned subsidiaries and investments in associates and joint arrangements, the policy is to participate according to Hydro's ownership share, on equal terms with the other owners. Project financing is used for certain funding requirements mainly to mitigate risk while also considering partnership and other relevant factors.\n\nTrade finance products such as factoring and reverse factoring are used to some extent by subsidiaries, mainly to facilitate risk mitigation in specific trade relations or markets. Hydro has internal guidelines limiting the use of such instruments to where it adds commercial value, as these instruments should not be used as a source for funding. Hydro has set a total limit for such arrangements including any type of sales of receivables. The limit is currently NOK 3.6 billion but was not fully utilized at year-end.\n\n## Shareholder return\n\nLong-term return to shareholders should reflect the value created by Hydro, and consists of dividends and share price development. Hydro aims to provide its shareholders with a competitive return compared with alternative investments in similar companies. Hydro's ambition is, in the long term, to pay out, on average, minimum 50 percent of adjusted net income as ordinary dividend over the cycle, with a dividend floor of NOK 1.25 per share. Dividends for a particular year are based on expected future earnings and cash flow, future investment opportunities, the outlook for world markets and Hydro's current financial position. Share buybacks or extraordinary dividends may be used to supplement ordinary dividends during periods of strong financial results after considering the status of the business cycle and capital requirements for future growth.\n\n## Hydro's capital management measures\n\nHydro's management uses the Adjusted net cash (debt) to adjusted EBITDA ratio to assess the group's financial solidity and ability to absorb volatility in the markets. Hydro targets, over the business cycle, a ratio of average Adjusted net cash (debt) to adjusted EBITDA below 2. Historically, weak cash generation has been the main challenge for Hydro and the aluminium industry in general. Given historical industry cyclicality, this means that the ratio will be well below 2x in the stronger parts of the cycle, to be able to absorb the impact from industry cycle downturns and maintain financial flexibility in periods of adverse market conditions. As a result, capital structure has not represented a credit constraint. Hydro continuously evaluates the efficiency of the capital structure and takes this into account when proposing shareholder distribution.\n\nHydro amended some financial metrics during 2021. Adjusted EBITDA, which includes realized currency gains and losses from risk management contracts and embedded currency derivatives in sourcing contracts for power and raw materials, replaced underlying EBITDA. Hydro considers this to be a better performance measure as it includes all effects related to risk management contracts.\n\nFollowing the significant increase in Hydro's use of long-term derivatives in risk management activities, the impact of collateral for such contracts on relevant metrics was reassessed. Net cash (debt) is defined as Hydro's cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and cash collateral for long-term liabilities, less short- and long-term interestbearing debt. The previous definition of Net cash (debt) did not include cash collateral for long-term liabilities, which over a long period had been insignificant. Adjusted net cash (debt) excludes net cash (debt) positions regarded as unavailable for servicing debt, collateral for short- and long-term liabilities, pension liabilities and other obligations which are considered debt-like in nature. The previous definition of Adjusted net cash (debt) did not adjust for cash collateral, as these amounts have previously been limited. With the amended definition, increases or decreases in cash collateral will not impact Hydro's Net cash (debt) but will be reflected in Adjusted net cash (debt). Information for previous periods have been restated accordingly.\n\nHydro considers the amended definition of Net cash (debt) to be a better metric for valuation purposes, while the amended Adjusted net cash (debt) definition is a better indicator of Hydro's financial position at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe tables below present the calculation of Net cash (debt), Adjusted net cash (debt) and the Adjusted net cash (debt) to adjusted EBITDA ratio. For 2020, the latter ratio is presented as reported in the 2020 annual report to ensure consistency in the calculation, as the divestment of the Rolling business area leads to a re-presentation of adjusted EBITDA but not the balance sheets items included in Adjusted net cash (debt).",

Hydro operates cash pools in several currencies where wholly owned subsidiaries participate, to the extent permitted by country legislation. Such cash pool arrangements facilitate netting of cash positions within the group, thereby reducing the requirement for external financing, and centralizing management of aggregated positions. At the end of 2021, NOK 4.7 billion of Hydro's cash position of NOK 22.9 billion was outside such group arrangements, mainly in Brazil.\n\n## Note 7.3 Short-term investments\n\n| Amounts in NOK million        | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity securities             | 1,749  | 324    |\n| Debt securities               | 655    | 589    |\n| Time deposits 1)              | 1,000  | 2,500  |\n| Collateral accounts and other | 3,359  | 677    |\n| Total short-term investments  | 6,763  | 4,091  |\n\n- 1) Time deposits in banks with a maturity of three months or more at inception.

The Annual General Meeting considers this proposal, normally in May, and the approved dividend is then paid to the shareholders. Dividends are paid once each calendar year, generally occurring in May. For non-Norwegian shareholders, Norwegian withholding tax will be deducted at source in accordance with the applicable Norwegian tax regulations.\n\nFor fiscal year 2021 the Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of NOK 5.40 per share to be paid in May 2022. The Annual General Meeting, scheduled to be held May 10, 2022, will consider this dividend proposal. If approved, this would be a total dividend of approximately NOK 11,078 million. In accordance with IFRS, the fiscal year 2021 proposed dividend is not recognized as a liability in the 2021 financial statements.\n\nDividends declared and paid in 2021 and 2020 for the prior fiscal year, respectively, are as follows:\n\n|                                   | Paid in 2021 for fiscal  year 2020   | Paid in 2020 for fiscal  year 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Dividend per share paid, NOK      | 1.25                                 | 1.25                                 |\n| Total dividends paid, NOK million | 2,564                                | 2,561                                |\n| Date proposed                     | February 11, 2021                    | February 6, 2020                     |\n| Date approved                     | May 6, 2021                          | November 12, 2020                    |\n| Dividend payment date             | May 19, 2021                         | November 25, 2020                    |\n\nDividends to non-controlling shareholders in Hydro's subsidiaries are reported as dividends in Consolidated statements of changes in equity.\n\n## Section 8 - Financial risk and financial instruments\n\n## Note 8.1 Financial and commercial risk management\n\nHydro is exposed to market risks related to the prices of products produced and sold, and the input factors purchased and used, as well as currency risk. The risks are managed based on the margin between sales prices and cost of raw materials and energy cost. Margin risks are managed partly at segment level and partly combined for the group.\n\nHydro's main strategy for managing volatility in the markets is to maintain strong liquidity, a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating. In addition, a combination of financial and physical contracts, including derivatives, is used to manage margin risk.\n\nHydro's sales contracts mainly cover periods for up to one year, supplemented with frame arrangements that can cover several years. Prices are usually determined with reference to observed market prices or fixed, negotiated prices determined no more than one year prior to delivery. Raw materials are purchased at variable terms, with prices fixed for periods varying between a few months up to three years. Some key raw materials, including bauxite and alumina, is purchased under long-term contracts with prices linked to observable market prices. Energy, in particular electricity for use in aluminium smelters, is purchased at long-term contracts with duration up to 20 years, mainly at fixed prices. Energy for other production facilities, including natural gas, fuel oil and coal, is purchased under contracts where prices are fixed for shorter intervals. Hydro secure access to most key input factors through contracts covering at least four months, for many raw materials longer periods. Price risks for raw materials and energy are managed mainly through price clauses in the relevant contracts, supplemented with derivatives where considered beneficial. The main purpose is to manage risks related to market volatility in a period of up to four years.\n\nPrices for products sold and raw material and energy are denominated in various currencies which exposes Hydro to currency risk. Where production margin is subject to significant currency risks, and such risks are not offset across the group, currency derivatives are to some extent used to mitigate unwanted risks\n\n## Commodity price risk exposure\n\nAluminium\n\nRegional market-places for aluminium sold as standard ingot exists several places. London Metal Exchange (LME) is the most important to Hydro, and is the point of reference in many contracts, both for sale and purchase of products and for derivatives. Hydro produces and recycles aluminium, which are partly sold as casthouse products and partly consumed in production of upgraded industrial products in Hydro Extrusions. Hydro also purchase aluminium for use in Extrusions and for recycling. Hydro engages in limited trading activities to optimize capacity utilization, reduce logistical costs and strengthen the market positions, in addition to some speculative trading activities within strict volume and risk limits.\n\nShort-term price risk for aluminium relates to time difference in pricing of purchases of aluminium for use in production of upgraded product or for resale, compared to sale of aluminium. Hydro enters into aluminium future contracts on LME with a maturity of mainly one to three months to mitigate unwanted price risk short term. The main purpose is to achieve an average LME aluminium price on smelter production. In addition, Hydro seeks to mitigate timing risk in the pricing patterns for sale of upgraded products, purchase of aluminium for recycling, and purchase of third-party products (back-to-back hedging). Hydro manages these exposures on a portfolio basis, taking derivative positions based upon net exposures.\n\nLong-term price risk for aluminium is managed with the aim to achieve a reasonable production margin measured as the difference between the aluminium price and the prices of key raw materials alumina, pitch, petroleum coke, anodes, and energy. Prices for raw materials and energy are to a limited extent linked to, or correlated with, the aluminium price. Hydro enters into derivative forward sale contracts both on the LME and with banks to secure prices on parts of the planned aluminium production as part of securing a margin level for periods up to about three years when considered beneficial, whether based on the market situation or to secure cash flow for specific projects.\n\nHydro's sales of primary aluminium and aluminium casthouse products include a premium above the quoted price on LME. The pricing of these premiums can be volatile, and is related to physical demand and supply, with regional and product-related differences. There are limited possibilities for hedging future premiums, except for standard ingot premiums, for which a forward market exists. Hydro has from time to time entered into contracts for standard ingot premiums to mitigate risk in sales contractss.",

In addition, Hydro has long-term agreements to purchase alumina from third parties. The majority of purchase and sale contracts are priced with reference to alumina spot price indexes, however, some long-term contracts with links to the aluminium price on LME exists. Prices for aluminium and alumina have historically been correlated over longer periods, however, price development may differ significantly short term. Alumina forward markets are considered to have limited liquidity.\n\n## Bauxite and alumina\n\nHydro is a producer and consumer of bauxite. Hydro's need for bauxite is secured through own production as well as by long-term contracts. The purchasing contracts have links to the LME aluminium price and to the alumina spot price development with a certain time-lag.\n\n## Energy\n\nHydro is a large consumer of energy in several countries. Energy is consumed as electrical power, natural gas, fuel oil and coal, with power as the main energy carrier. Hydro also has significant power production in Norway. Hydro's power consumption is mainly secured through long-term contracts with power suppliers and through Hydro's own production. Energy prices are to an increasing degree volatile, both from the increased volume of renewable energy from solar and wind for which available volume fluctuates with weather conditions, and from initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions through market mechanisms such as cap-and-trade schemes and other regulatory initiatives.\n\nHydro's own electricity production is influenced by hydrological conditions which can vary significantly, and where production short-term is managed to match physical need and market prices. The net power position in Norway is balanced out in the Nordic power market through hourly sales and purchases.\n\nIn order to manage risks related to price and volume fluctuations, Hydro utilizes mainly physical contracts securing purchase of power at fixed prices or with relevant price links, for some contracts to the aluminium price. Physical sourcing contracts are supplemented with derivatives such as future contracts, forwards and options. For one smelter, Slovalco, a portfolio of energy contracts for physical deliveries during 2022 has been subject to partly net settlement at the end of 2021 and is therefore recognized at fair value with a significant valuation gain in 2021. Hydro also participates in trading activities within strict volume and risk limits.\n\n## Foreign currency risk exposure\n\nThe prices of Hydro's upstream products bauxite, alumina and primary aluminium, are mainly denominated in US dollars, while sale of mid- and downstream products are mainly priced in US dollars and Euro. Further, the prices of major raw materials used in Hydro's production processes are quoted in US dollars in the international commodity markets, while power is predominantly priced in Euro in Europe, including Norway. Hydro also incurs significant local costs related to the production, distribution and marketing of products in a number of different currencies, mainly Norwegian Krone, Brazilian Real, Euro and US dollar. Hydro's primary operational foreign currency risk is consequently linked to fluctuations in the value of the US dollar and Euro, and in these currencies versus the currencies in which significant costs are incurred. In addition, Hydro's results and equity are influenced by value changes for the functional currencies of the individual entities and the Norwegian Krone as the Group's presentation currency.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, long-term debt is mainly maintained in currencies reflecting underlying exposures, liquidity management and cash generation, while considering attractiveness in main financial markets. To reduce the effects of fluctuations in the US dollar and other exchange rates, Hydro also uses foreign currency swaps and forward currency contracts. Commodity derivatives are entered into in various currencies, mainly US dollar, Euro and Norwegian Krone, to reflect currency exposures in the relevant unit.\n\n## Foreign currency risk exposure in receivables, payables and loans\n\nShort-term receivables and payables are often held in currencies other than the functional currency of the unit, predominantly in US dollars and Euro. Borrowings and deposits may be denominated in other currencies than the functional currency of the unit. The majority of exposure in financing arrangements exists in the parent company in Norway and in the part-owned subsidiaries, mainly in Brazil.\n\nEmbedded currency derivatives in non-financial contracts, including the Euro priced electricity contracts in Norway, contains a currency exposure which is separately recognized.\n\n## Interest rate exposure\n\nHydro is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of financing its business operations and managing its liquidity in different currencies. Cash and other liquid resources, as well as debt, are currently mainly held in Norwegian Krone, Euro, US dollars and Brazilian real, and carries short-term interest rates.\n\nFinancial instruments and provisions are also exposed to changes in interest rates in connection with valuation and discounting of positions to present value.\n\n## Credit risk management\n\nHydro manages credit risk by setting counterparty risk limits and establishing procedures for monitoring exposures and timely settlement of customer accounts. Credit risk is further limited through use of credit insurance, and, in some markets, sale of receivables to banks. Prepayments or guarantees are required where credit risk is outside the limits set for the relevant counterpart. Hydro is also monitoring the financial performance of key suppliers in order to reduce the risk of default on operations and key projects. Our overall credit risk exposure is reduced due to a diversified customer base representing various industries and geographic areas. Enforceable netting agreements, guarantees, and credit insurance, also contribute to a lower credit risk.\n\nCredit risk arising from derivatives is generally limited to net exposures. Exposure limits are established for financial institutions relating to current accounts, deposits and other obligations. Credit risk related to commodity derivatives is limited by settlement through commodity exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange, Nasdaq OMX, Intercontinental Exchange, and banks, and through margin arrangements. Current counterparty risk related to the use of derivative instruments and financial operations is considered moderate.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nVolatile commodity prices and exchange rates as well as fluctuating business volumes and inventory levels can have a substantial effect on Hydro's cash positions and borrowing requirements.\n\nMargin calls for derivative contracts increased during 2021 from the increased use of such instruments. The risk is managed at group level to balance the commodity price risk and liquidity risk, and secure that sufficient funding to meet contractual obligations are available.\n\nTo fund cash deficits of a more permanent nature Hydro will normally raise equity, long-term bond or bank debt in available markets. Some suppliers have access to supply chain finance facilities, which allows those suppliers to benefit from Hydro's credit profile. The use of such products is limited and does not extend Hydro's credit period beyond normal commercial terms. Further, all other financial liabilities, such as trade payables, with the exception of derivatives, have a final maturity date within one year.\n\nA summary of Hydro's total contractual obligations and commercial commitments to make future payments is presented below:\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                           | Less than 1 year   | 1-3 years   | 3-5 years   | Thereafter   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------|\n| Long-term debt including interest (note 7.4)                     | 6,792              | 8,806       | 8,786       | 6,229        | 30,613  |\n| Unconditional purchase obligations 1)                            | 56,316             | 70,323      | 58,276      | 227,169      | 412,084 |\n| Contractual commitments for PP&E                                 | 4,851              | 2,504       | 363         | 2            | 7,720   |\n| Total contractual and non-contractual  obligations, undiscounted | 67,958             | 81,633      | 67,426      | 233,401      | 450,418 |\n| Present value of short-term and long-term  provisions (note 4.1) | 3,128              | 1,615       | 669         | 2,487        | 7,899   |\n\nHydro has long-term contractual commitments for the purchase of aluminium, raw materials, electricity, and transportation.

Financial assets include financial derivatives and commodity derivative contracts, receivables and equity interests, as well as financial instruments used for cash-flow hedges.\n\nFinancial assets are recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Classification depends on the contractual terms, the business model and, for some instruments, the company's choice. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash from the asset have expired or when Hydro has transferred the asset.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognized at transaction price, subsequently accounted for at amortized cost and are reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis. Individual accounts are assessed for impairment taking into consideration indicators of financial difficulty and management assessment. Portfolios of trade receivable where expected losses are more than insignificant are reduced for those expected losses. Discounting generally does not have a material effect on accounts receivable, however, in special cases discounting may be applied. Hydro's business model for most trade receivable is to hold the receivables to collect the contractual cash flows. For some portfolios of trade receivables, factoring is applied.\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nDebt instruments other than trade receivables include bank deposits and all other monetary instruments with a maturity above three months at the date of purchase, investments in debt securities, and certain other receivables. These instruments are measured at amortized costs, with the exception of instruments where cash flows are not contractually fixed and/or consists of other elements in addition to interest and repayments; and thus required to be measured at FVTPL.\n\nShort-term debt instruments are included in Short-term investments. Long-term debt instruments are included in Other non-current assets.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nHydro's portfolio of trading securities is measured at FVTPL and included in Short-term investments. Other equity investments in companies that are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity method are classified as either FVTPL or FVOCI on an individual investment basis. Hydro classifies investments in other entities with strategic or operational purposes, such as getting access to raw materials or in other ways cooperating with those entities, primarily as FVOCI, as Hydro considers this classification to be more relevant. Any dividend received from such investment is recognized in Finance income. On disposal of these investments, no gain or loss will be recognized in the income statement, however, any related accumulated value change will be reclassified from Other components of equity to Retained earnings.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities represent a contractual obligation by Hydro to deliver cash in the future and are classified as either short- or long-term. Financial liabilities include financial derivatives, commodity derivative contracts and other financial liabilities as well as financial instruments used for cash-flow hedges. Financial liabilities, with the exception of derivatives, are initially recognized at fair value, including transaction costs directly attributable to the transaction, and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are derecognized when the obligation is discharged through payment or when Hydro is legally released from the primary responsibility for the liability.\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\nDerivative instruments are marked-to-market with the resulting gain or loss reflected in the income statement, except when the instruments meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting and are designated as hedge instruments. Derivatives, including hedging instruments and embedded derivatives with expected cash flows within twelve months from the balance sheet date, or held solely for trading, are classified as short-term. Instruments with expected cash flows more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified as short and long-term based on the timing of the estimated cash flows.",

The ability to settle net is conditional on simultaneous offsetting cash-flows.\n\nPhysical contracts for commodities that are readily convertible to cash are evaluated on a portfolio basis. Portfolios are defined based on business purpose, internal mandates and internal responsibilities. If a portfolio of contracts contains contracts of a similar nature that are settled net in cash, or the underlying products are not intended for own use, the entire portfolio of contracts is recognized at fair value and classified as derivatives. Physical commodity contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the commodity in accordance with Hydro's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (own use) are not accounted for at fair value. Commodity purchase contracts are generally considered to be the primary source for usage requirements. Hydro's own production of such commodities, for instance electricity, alumina and primary aluminium, is considered to be available for use or sale at Hydro's discretion unless relevant concessions contains restrictions for use.\n\nDerivative commodity instruments are marked-to-market with their fair value recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities. Adjustments for changes in the fair value of the instruments are reflected in revenue and/or raw material cost. Forward currency contracts and currency options are recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with the resulting gain or loss recorded in Finance expense. Interest income and expense relating to swaps are netted and recognized as income or expense over the life of the contract.\n\nHedge accounting is applied when specific hedge criteria are met, including documentation of the hedge relationship. The changes in fair value of the hedging instruments are offset in part or in full by the corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying hedged exposures. Gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments are recognized in Other comprehensive income and deferred in the Hedging reserve in Other components of equity until the underlying transaction is recognized in the income statement. Deferred gains and losses relating to forecasted hedged transactions that are no longer expected to occur are immediately recognized in the income statement. Any amounts resulting from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in the current period's income statement.\n\nAn embedded derivative is accounted for as a separate financial instrument, provided that the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the host contract is not accounted for at fair value. Embedded derivatives are classified both in the income statement and on the balance sheet based on the risks in the derivatives' underlying.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for financial instruments\n\nDetermining whether contracts qualify as financial instruments at fair value involves evaluation of markets, Hydro's use of those instruments and historic or planned use of physically delivered products under such contracts. Determining whether embedded derivatives are required to be separated and accounted for at fair value involves assessing price correlations and normal market pricing mechanisms for relevant products and marketplaces. Where no directly observable market prices exist, fair value is estimated through valuation models which rely on internal assumptions as well as observable market information such as forward curves, yield curves and interest rates. Market stability impacts the reliability of observed prices and other market information, and consequently, the extent of judgment necessary to estimate appropriate market prices for valuation purposes. Volatility also impacts the magnitude of changes in estimated fair value, which can be substantial, in particular on long-term contracts. Historically, financial and commodity markets have been highly volatile.\n\nFinancial instruments, and contracts accounted for as such, are in the balance sheet included in several line items and classified in categories for accounting treatment.",

The sensitivity analysis depicted in the tables below reflects the hypothetical gain/loss in fair values that would occur assuming a 10 percent increase in rates or prices and no changes in the portfolio of instruments held in Hydro's continuing operations as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Effects shown below are largely also representative of reductions in rates or prices by 10 percent, but with the opposite sign convention.

Trade payables and trade receivables are also included.\n- 4) Includes all contracts with commodities as underlying, both financial and physical contracts, such as LME contracts and NASDAQ Nordic Power contracts, which are accounted for at fair value.\n\nThe above sensitivity analysis reflects sensitivities for the instruments held at the balance sheet dates only. Related offsetting physical positions, contracts, and anticipated transactions are not reflected. The calculations do not take into consideration any adjustments for potential correlations between the risk exposure categories, such as the effect of a change in a foreign exchange rate on a commodity price.\n\nThe above discussion about Hydro's risk management policies and the estimated amounts included in the sensitivity analysis relates to the balance sheet position as of December 31. Outcomes at other dates could differ materially based on actual developments in the global markets and Hydro's positions. The methods used by Hydro to analyze risks discussed above should not be considered as projections of future events, gains or losses.",

Certain items are valued on the basis of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), others are valued on the basis of inputs that are derived from observable prices (level 2 inputs), while certain positions are valued on the basis of judgmental assumptions that are to a limited degree or not at all based on observable market data (level 3 inputs). Bilateral contracts with reference to observable prices are considered to be level 2 inputs. The level in this fair value hierarchy within which measurements are categorized is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million    | 2021    | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | 2020    | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   |\n|---------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assets                    |         |           |           |           |         |           |           |           |\n| Commodity derivatives     | 3,845   | 163       | 3,375     | 307       | 229     | 60        | 155       | 14        |\n| Currency derivatives      | 53      | -

For accounting purposes, these embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and recognized at fair value for links not closely related to the product in the host contract. Which price links that are closely related requires judgment, assessing common pricing patterns and market development over time. Hydro has separated and recognized at fair value embedded derivatives related to currency and aluminium links from the underlying contracts, mainly in energy contracts.\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\nThe following types of commodity derivatives, including embedded derivatives, were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Contracts that are designated as hedge instruments in cash flow hedges are not included. Hydro's risk management, including use of derivative instruments, is discussed in Note 8.1 Financial and commercial risk management.\n\nFair values for derivative instruments in the table below includes traditional derivative instruments such as futures, forwards and swaps, physical contracts accounted for at fair value, as well as embedded derivatives.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                  | 2021    | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Assets                                  |         |        |\n| Electricity contracts                   | 3,221   | 25     |\n| Aluminium futures, forwards and options | 479     | 203    |\n| Other                                   | 146     | -      |\n| Total                                   | 3,845   | 229    |\n| Liabilities                             |         |        |\n| Electricity contracts                   | (403)   | (34)   |\n| Aluminium futures, forwards and options | (5,739) | (613)  |\n| Other                                   | (10)    | (5)    |\n| Total                                   | (6,152) | (652)  |\n\nEmbedded derivatives are classified based on the underlying in the contract feature constituting a separable embedded derivative in the table above. Where there is more than one embedded derivative in the same host contract, those embedded derivatives are offset in settlement and thus presented net on the balance sheet.\n\nChanges in the fair value of commodity derivatives are included in operating revenues or cost of goods sold based on classification of underlying risk for embedded derivatives and on the purpose of the instrument for freestanding derivatives. Currency derivatives, whether embedded derivatives or separate instruments, are classified as Finance expense.\n\nHydro has to a limited extent used cash flow hedge accounting for its risk management positions. Gains and losses on the hedge derivatives are recognized in Other comprehensive income, and accumulated in the hedging reserve in equity and reclassified into operating revenues or cost when the corresponding forecasted sale or consumption is recognized. In 2020 and 2021, Hydro entered into hedge arrangements for currency in the Alunorte plant and the Albras plant, both in Brazil, to secure the exchange rate between Brazilian Real and US dollar for the period 2021 to 2024. As of 31 December 2021, an amount of USD 840 million is sold forward for 2022-2024 at an average rate of 5.90 Brazilian Real to US dollar. In 2012 Hydro entered into a hedge arrangement for parts of the power consumption in the Rheinwerk smelter in Hydro Rolling, Germany. The price differential between the German and the Nordic power market was secured through derivative contracts for 150 MW for the period 2013 to 2020, managed by Hydro Energy as part of an internal supply arrangement.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nNo ineffectiveness was recognized in the income statement in 2021 or 2020.\n\nThe table below gives aggregated numbers related to the cash flow hedges for 2021 and 2020.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                               | 2022   |   2021 | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Expected to be reclassified to the income statement during the year  | (176)  |     75 | (38)   |\n| Reclassified to the income statement from Other components of equity |        |     41 | (38)   |\n\nA liability of NOK 431 million and an asset of NOK 135 million were recognized as the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments for December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nHydro performs trading operations to reduce currency exposures on commodity positions. The effect of such operations is recognized as a part of Financial expense in the income statement.\n\nFor the after tax movement in Hydro's equity relating to cash-flow hedges for 2021 and 2020, see Note 7.6 Shareholders' equity.\n\n## Fair Value of Derivative Instruments\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments such as currency forwards and swaps are based on quoted market prices. The fair market value of aluminium and electricity futures/forwards and option contracts is based on quoted market prices obtained from the London Metals Exchange and NASDAQ Nordic Power/EEX (European Energy Exchange) respectively. The fair value of other commodity over-the-counter contracts and swaps is based on quoted market prices, estimates obtained from brokers and other appropriate valuation techniques. Where long-term physical delivery commodity contracts are recognized at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9, such fair market values are based on quoted forward prices in the market, and assumptions of forward prices and margins where market prices are not available. Hydro takes credit-spread into consideration when valuating positions when necessary.\n\nFor further information on fair values, see Note 1.2 Measurement of fair value. See Note 8.2 Financial instruments for a specification of the classification of derivative positions according to a fair value hierarchy.",

Amounts paid by subsidiaries outside Norway have been translated to NOK at average rates for each year.\n- 2) Annual base salary per December 31, or per the date of stepping down from the Corporate Management Board. Maximum bonus potential is for the year presented, and for the period as corporate management board member.\n- 3) Salary is the amount paid to the individual during the year presented, and includes vacation pay with the exception of vacation pay on bonus earned in 2019 and payed in 2020 (see footnote 6 for more information).\n- 4) Other benefits is the total of all other cash and non-cash related benefits received by the individual during the year presented and includes such items as the taxable portion of insurance premiums, car and mileage allowances and electronic communication items.\n- 5) For most individuals compensation pension is the amount paid to compensate for future pension shortfall estimated at the time of transition from Hydro's defined benefit pension plans to the defined contribution plan in line with an arrangement applicable to all affected employees in Norway. In addition, compensation pension is for P\u00e5l Kildemo and Hilde Vestheim Nordh the amount paid to compensate for the loss of 12G earnings (G is the base amount in the national insurance scheme) that were suspended while they are members of the Corporate Management Board. For John Thuestad, compensation pension is the amount paid to compensate for lower pension benefits in Hydro compared to those of former employer Sapa AS (now Hydro Extruded Solutions AS).\n- 6) Bonus is the amount earned in the year presented based on performance achieved as corporate management board member, excluding vacation pay. Vacation pay on bonus earned will be reported as salary paid the in the following year of the bonus pay-out. For bonus earned in 2021, vacation pay on bonus earned will be reported as salary paid in 2023. Hydro's practice has so far been to reduce the bonus payment with calculated holiday pay and to include the net amount (bonus minus holiday pay) in the holiday pay basis for the following year. As of the earning year 2021, this will be changed in line with the practice for bonus payments to other employees with a Norwegian employment agreement in that calculated holiday pay will no longer be deducted from the bonus amount before payment.\n- 7) The LTI plan benefit reflects gross (pre-tax) amounts earned in the year presented, and results in LTI shares allocated in the following year. For corporate management board members on net salary employment contracts, LTI plan benefits have been converted to estimated gross (pre-tax) amounts.\n- 8) Pension benefits include the estimated change in the value of defined pension benefits, and reflects both the effect of earning an additional year's pension benefit and the adjustment to present value of previously earned pension rights (interest element). It is calculated as the increase in the Defined Benefit Obligations (DBO) calculated with stable assumptions. Pension benefits also include contributions to defined contribution plans.\n- 9) LTI-shares allocated are shares allocated in the reporting year based on LTI earned in the previous year (2020). In 2020, the CEO and CMB waived the right to LTI and no LTI shares were allocated in 2021.\n- 10) Hydro share ownership is the number of shares held directly by the corporate management board member and any shares held by close family members and controlled entities. Hydro share ownership is as of December 31, or per the date of stepping down from the Corporate Management Board.\n- 11) Thuestad has a retention agreement that vests progressively over a 60-month period.

These amounts are included in column 'Salary paid' in the table above. Moss remains in his position as EVP and Head of Hydro Energy business area. Moss has not used his right to retire from age 62, contributing to a net negative change in pension benefits for 2021 and 2020.\n- 14) Paul Warton  became a member of the Corporate Management Board as of February 1, 2021. He received a sign on bonus of 1 MNOK. The sign-on bonus is included in column 'Other benefits paid' in the table.

Share-based compensation expense is measured at fair value over the service period and includes social security taxes that will be paid by Hydro at the settlement date. All changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nPayments to employees, such as wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and bonus agreements are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by the employee.\n\n## Employee share purchase plan\n\nHydro has established a share purchase plan for employees in Norway. The plan payout is based on whether the share price (adjusted for dividend paid) increases with at least 12 percent or not during the performance period. Employees are eligible to receive an offer to purchase shares under this plan if they were 1) employed by Norsk Hydro ASA or a more than 90 percent owned Norwegian subsidiary, and 2) employed as of December 31 through the final acceptance date of the share purchase offer. Employees are invited to purchase shares with a rebate of 50 percent for a value of NOK 15,000 or NOK 30,000, depending on shareholder return. The share purchase is financed through a non-interest bearing loan from the company with a repayment period of 12 months.\n\nCompensation expense related to the 2020 performance measurement period was accrued and recognized over the service period of December 31, 2020 through March 31, 2021, the final acceptance date of the offer. Details related to the employee share purchase plan are provided in the table below.\n\n## Performance measurement period\n\n|                                                      | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total shareholder return performance target achieved | \u226512%   | \u226512%   | <12%   |\n| Employee rebate offered, NOK                         | 15,000 | 15,000 | 6,250  |\n\n## Share purchase plan compensation\n\n|                                                         | 2021      | 2020      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Award share price, NOK                                  | 54.70     | 21.10     |\n| Number of shares issued, per employee                   | 648       | 422       |\n| Total number of shares issued to employees              | 2,350,944 | 1,432,690 |\n| Compensation expense related to the award, NOK thousand | 74,208    | 9,012     |\n\n## Employee benefit expense\n\nThe average number of employees in Hydro's continuing operations for 2021 and 2020 was 30,982 and 31,007, respectively. As of year-end 2021 and 2020, Hydro's continuing operations employed 31,264 and 30,412 people, respectively. The average number of employees in Hydro's operations in 2020 was 34,896, with 34,240 people employed as of year-end 2020. Employees in joint operations are not included.

Travel compensation is paid to members living outside Norway who attend meetings in person, with an amount of NOK 30,000 (2020: NOK 23,000) per meeting. Board members do not have any incentive or share-based compensation. Hydro has not provided any loans to, or made any guarantees on behalf of, any of the board members.\n\nFees are based on the position of the board members and board committee assignments. Annual fees for 2021 for the chairperson of the board, deputy chairperson and directors are NOK 707,000 (2020: NOK 686,000), NOK 426,000 (2020: NOK 413,000) and NOK 373,000 (2020: NOK 362,000), respectively. The chairperson of the audit committee and the chairperson of the compensation committee receive an additional NOK 215,000 (2020: NOK 209,000) and NOK 124,000 (2020: NOK 120,500) annually in fees, respectively, and audit and compensation committee members receive NOK 140,000 (2020: NOK 136,000) and NOK 93,000 (2020: NOK 90,500) annually, respectively, for their participation on these committees. No fees are paid to the board observer.\n\n## Corporate Assembly\n\nCorporate Assembly members owned 48,841 shares as of December 31, 2021. Hydro has not provided any loans to members of the Corporate Assembly as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Note 9.4 Employee retirement plans\n\n## Accounting policies for post-employment benefits\n\nPost-employment benefits are recognized in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. The cost of providing pension benefits under a defined benefit plan is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the income statement. The interest component of the periodic cost is included in Finance expense. Remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in Other comprehensive income.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they accrue. Multiemployer defined benefit plans where available information is insufficient to use defined benefit accounting are accounted for as if the plan were a defined contribution plan.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for post-employment benefits\n\nMeasurement of pension expense and obligations under defined benefit plans requires numerous assumptions and estimates that can have a significant impact on the recognized pension cost and obligation, such as discount rates, mortality, and future pension increases and salary levels.\n\n## Employee retirement plans in Hydro\n\nHydro provides post-employment benefits covering a substantial portion of employees. Plans and benefit levels vary between companies and countries. In recent years, there has been a shift from traditional final salary defined benefit plans to defined contribution and contribution-oriented plans. Many defined benefit plans have been closed for new entrants, and in some defined benefit plans, large groups of employees have converted to defined contribution arrangements. Still, a declining number of employees continues to earn benefits under defined benefit plans.\n\n## Pension expense\n\n|                                                          | 2021    | 2021    | 2021   | 2021    | 2020   | 2020    | 2020   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|---------|--------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Amounts in NOK million                                   | Norway  | Germany | Other  | Total   | Norway | Germany | Other  | Total  |\n| Defined benefit plans                                    | 105     | 18      | 48     | 172     | 108    | 21      | 63     | 193    |\n| Defined contribution plans                               | 198     | -       | 318    | 516     | 175    | -       | 329    | 504    |\n| Multiemployer plans                                      | 46      | -       | -      | 46      | 46     | -       | 2      | 48     |\n| Termination benefits and other                           | 121     | 12      | 22     | 155     | 50     | 14      | 55     | 119    |\n| Social security cost                                     | 54      | -       | 22     | 76      | 47     | -       | 35     | 82     |\n| Pension expense                                          | 525     | 30      | 410    | 965     | 426    | 35      | 484    | 944    |\n| Interest expense (income)                                | (23)    | 16      | 14     | 7       | (29)   | 28      | 20     | 19     |\n| Remeasurement (gain) loss in  other comprehensive income | (2,462) | (16)    | (333)  | (2,811) | 71     | 747     | 198    | 1,015  |",

The defined benefit plans are both funded and unfunded. The main funded plan is managed by Norsk Hydros Pensjonskasse, a separate, regulated legal entity. Hydro's pension plans complement the public pension schemes in Norway.\n\n## Norway\n\nHydro participates in a tariff-based pension plan that entitles the majority of its Norwegian employees life-long supplementary benefits. The benefits are financed through a pooled arrangement by private sector employers (avtalefestet pensjon, AFP) where also the Norwegian state contributes. The plan is a defined benefit plan with limited funding and where plan assets are not segregated. The information required to calculate the share of the plan and account for the plan as a defined benefit plan is not available from the plan administrator. Hydro therefore accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution plan. The employer contributions are included in Multiemployer plans.\n\nSignificant actuarial assumptions for the main Norwegian defined benefit plans include:\n\n| Assumptions               | Benefit obligation 2021   | Benefit expense 2021   | Benefit obligation 2020   | Benefit expense 2020   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|\n| Discount rate             | 1.9%                      | 1.7%                   | 1.7%                      | 2.3%                   |\n| Expected salary increase  | 2.5%                      | 2.0%                   | 2.0%                      | 2.0%                   |\n| Expected pension increase | 1.25%                     | 1.25%                  | 1.25%                     | 1.25%                  |\n| Mortality basis           | K2013                     | K2013                  | K2013                     | K2013                  |\n\nThe discount rate is based on the yield on covered bonds (debt securities backed by cash flows from mortgages) issued in Norway. The market for covered bonds has developed in size and liquidity, and we deem this market to be sufficiently deep to serve as reference for the discount rate for our post-employment benefit plans in Norway.\n\nThe sensitivities shown in the table below have been calculated for the main Norwegian plans illustrating the effects of changing one assumption while keeping the other assumptions unchanged. Possible correlation between assumptions is not reflected in the calculations.\n\n## Sensitivities decrease (increase) benefit obligation year end\n\n| Amounts in NOK million, except percent   | 2021   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rate increase 0.5% point        | 5.8%   | 740    |\n| Salary increase 0.5% point               | (0.5%) | (70)   |\n| Pension increase 0.5% point              | (6.0%) | (764)  |\n| One year longer life all members         | (4.6%) | (590)  |\n\nThe plan assets in the funded plans provided through Norsk Hydros Pensjonskasse were invested as follows at the end of 2021 and 2020:\n\n| Amounts in NOK million, except percent   | 2021   | 2021   | 2020   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                | 3.3%   | 526    | 4.8%   | 700    |\n| Equity instruments Norway                | 21.5%  | 3,406  | 20.8%  | 3,057  |\n| Equity instruments other countries       | 23.5%  | 3,728  | 22.3%  | 3,282  |\n| Debt instruments                         | 25.3%  | 4,005  | 27.6%  | 4,051  |\n| Investment funds                         | 10.5%  | 1,657  | 8.2%   | 1,198  |\n| Real estate                              | 15.9%  | 2,509  | 16.4%  | 2,410  |\n| Total                                    | 100.0% | 15,832 | 100.0% | 14,698 |\n\nReal estate consists of office buildings in the Oslo area. A share of the buildings are leased and occupied by Hydro. Investment funds are primarily private equity funds investing in unlisted companies across various industries in Europe, the US and Asia, and infrastructure funds investing in the UK, continental Europe and the US. Equity instruments are held through liquid funds invested in listed companies in Norway and globally. Debt instruments are mainly bond issues with maturities up to 10 years and investment grade rating.\n\nIn Germany, the majority of plan members are covered by defined benefit plans that offer benefits based on final salary level and the number of years in service. The main plans are unfunded. Hydro's main plans are closed for new entrants, and all new employees are now offered benefits under defined contribution-oriented plans. These plans are unfunded and treated as defined benefit plans for financial reporting purposes. Following Hydro's sale of its Rolling business in 2021, the impact of these benefit plans was reduced significantly.\n\n## Germany\n\nSignificant actuarial assumptions for the main German plans include:\n\n| Weighted-average assumptions   | Benefit  obligation 2021   | Benefit  expense 2021   | Benefit  obligation 2020   | Benefit  expense 2020   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Discount rate                  | 1.1%                       | 0.5%                    | 0.6%                       | 0.9%                    |\n| Expected salary increase       | 2.5%                       | 2.3%                    | 2.5%                       | 2.3%                    |\n| Expected pension increase      | 1.5%                       | 1.5%                    | 1.5%                       | 1.5%                    |\n| Mortality basis                | RT2018G                    | RT2018G                 | RT2018G                    | RT2018G                 |\n\nThe sensitivities shown in the table below have been calculated for the main German plans illustrating the effects of changing one assumption while keeping the other assumptions unchanged.

In addition, Folketrygdfondet, which manages the Government Pension Fund - Norway held 7.0 percent (2020: 7.8 percent). There are no preferential voting rights associated with the shares held by the Norwegian State. Hydro has concluded that the Norwegian state's shareholding represents a significant interest in Hydro, and that the State thus is a related party.\n\nThe Norwegian state has ownership interests in a substantial number of companies. The ownership interests in 70 companies are managed by the ministries and covered by public information from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries . We have not assessed which of these companies that are controlled by the State. Hydro has business transactions with a number of these companies, including purchase of power from Statkraft and bank services from DNB. Generally, transactions are agreed independently of the possible control exercised by the State.\n\nA significant share of Hydro's defined benefit post-employment plans is managed by the independent pension trust, Norsk Hydros Pensjonskasse. Employees managing and operating the pension trust are employees of Norsk Hydro ASA. Their salaries and other benefits are reimbursed by the pension trust on a monthly basis, in total NOK 10 million for 2021 and 2020. Further, the pension trust is located in Hydro's head office. Office costs, including heating and administrative services, are charged with a total of NOK 1 million for 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe pension trust owns some of the office space rented by Hydro. The current rental arrangement was entered into in 2015 representing a partial continuation of a rental agreement from 2006, and priced based on market price benchmarks at the time of the agreement in 2006. Hydro has paid a rental of NOK 70 million and NOK 67 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The current term of the rental contract expires in February 2027. In addition, compensation related to cancellation of a previous contract was paid with NOK 87 million for 2020. The compensation arrangement expired in February 2021. Hydro also sold electricity to the pension trust for its operational needs at the same office site for a total amount of NOK 8 in 2021 and NOK 1 million 2020. As of the end of 2021, Hydro's outstanding payables to Norsk Hydros Pensjonskasse was NOK 4 million, receivables amounted to NOK 3 million, all settled during January 2022.\n\nThe members of Hydro's Corporate Management Board during 2021 and 2020 are stated in Note 9.1 Management remuneration, and the members of Hydro's board of directors during 2021 and 2020 are stated in Note 9.3 Board of Directors and Corporate Assembly. Their remuneration and share ownership is outlined in these notes. Some of the board members or their close members of family serve as board members or executive directors in other companies. In addition, some members of Hydro's corporate management board or their close members of family serve as board members in other companies. Hydro has transactions with some of those companies; however, have not identified any transactions where the relationship is known to have influenced the transaction. Some close family members of members of Hydro's management are employed in non-executive positions in Hydro.\n\nHydro's significant joint arrangements and associates; and transactions with those entities are described in Note 3.1 Investments in joint arrangements and associates. Hydro's relationship with partners in joint arrangements are generally limited to a combined effort within a limited area. Hydro considers the joint venture partners as competitors in other business transactions, and do not see these relationships as related party relationships.\n\nTransactions with related parties are at arm's length principles.\n\n- 1) Shareholding is based on information from the Norwegian Central Securities Depositary (VPS) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Due to lending of shares, an investor's holdings registered in its VPS account may vary.\n- 2) According to information on the Government web site www.regjeringen.no, state ownership.\n\n## Section 10 - Other information\n\n## Note 10.1 Income taxes\n\n## Accounting policies for income taxes, current and deferred\n\nTaxes payable is based on taxable profit for the year, which excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years. Taxable profit also excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. Hydro's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted as of the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax expense is calculated using the liability method in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current in the balance sheet and are measured based on the difference between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and their tax basis when such differences are considered temporary in nature. For items recognized as an asset and a liability at inception, such as an asset retirement obligation or a lease, temporary differences related to the asset and liability are considered in combination, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on changes to the temporary differences through the life of the items. Temporary differences related to intercompany profits are deferred using the buyer's tax rate. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability every balance sheet date, and the amount probable of recovery is recognized.\n\nDeferred income tax expense represents the change in deferred tax asset and liability balances during the year, except for the deferred tax related to items recognized in Other comprehensive income or resulting from a business combination or disposal. Changes resulting from amendments and revisions in tax laws and tax rates are recognized when the new tax laws or rates become effective or are substantively enacted. Uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements based on management's expectations.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nDeferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the timing of the reversal of this temporary difference is controlled by Hydro and is not expected to happen in the foreseeable future. This is applicable for the majority of Hydro's subsidiaries.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for income taxes\n\nHydro is involved in a significant number of tax cases related to various types of taxes. Hydro's widespread business operations expose us to several tax regimes and their interaction. We see that tax authorities challenge transfer prices to an increasing degree. Although Hydro currently has no significant transfer price disputes with tax authorities, the long value chain with a large number of internal transactions and business operations covering multiple tax jurisdictions expose us to such disputes, both related to prior and future transactions.\n\nValuation of deferred tax assets is dependent on management's assessment of future recoverability of the deferred benefit. Expected recoverability may result from expected taxable income in the future, planned transactions or planned tax optimizing measures, all of which may be uncertain. Economic conditions may change and lead to a different conclusion regarding recoverability. Tax authorities in different jurisdictions may challenge Hydro's calculation of taxes payable from prior periods. Such processes may lead to changes to prior periods' taxable income, resulting in changes to income tax expense in the period of change, as well as interest and fines.",

Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance costs, are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Research and development in 2021 and 2020\n\nTotal expensed research and development cost for Hydro's continuing operations was NOK 512 million in 2021 and NOK 510 million in 2020. The objective of research and development activities is to facilitate more efficient production of aluminium including further improvement of the operational and environmental performance of Hydro's electrolysis technology. A significant share of research and development funding is also used for further developing the production processes and products within casting and alloy technology as well as extruded products and alumina.\n\n## Note 10.3 Cash flow information\n\n## Cash disbursements and receipts included in cash from continuing operations\n\n| Amounts in NOK million   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income taxes paid        | 2,862  | 1,561  |\n| Interest paid            | 904    | 885    |\n| Interest received        | 194    | 208    |\n| Dividends received       | 1      | 25     |\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, non-cash investing activities for asset retirement costs amounted to NOK 616 million and NOK 393 million, respectively.

Actual results may differ from estimates. Interest rates used for calculating net present values are rounded to the nearest 10 basis points for post employment benefits, to the nearest 25 basis points for other non-financial assets and liabilities. As a result of rounding adjustments, the figures in one or more columns included in the financial statements may not add up to the total of that column.\n\n## Shares in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nShares in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are presented according to the cost method. Group relief received is included in dividends from subsidiaries. Dividend from subsidiaries is recognized in the year for which it is proposed by the subsidiary to the extent Norsk Hydro ASA can control the decision of the subsidiary through its share holdings. Shares in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value of the investment. An impairment loss is reversed if the impairment situation is deemed to no longer exist.\n\n## Employee retirement plans\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA accounts for employee retirement plans in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, see Note 9.4 Employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nThe functional currency of the company is the Norwegian krone, NOK. Realized and unrealized currency gains or losses on transactions denominated in other currencies than NOK, as well as currency gains or losses on assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than NOK, are included in Financial income, net.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash, bank deposits and all other monetary instruments with a maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase.\n\n## Short-term investments\n\nShort-term investments include bank deposits and all other monetary instruments with a maturity between three and twelve months at the date of purchase and current listed equity and debt securities held for trading and valued at fair value. The resulting unrealized holding gains and losses are included in Financial income, net. Investment income is recognized when earned.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. According to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, such assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment of long-lived assets is recognized when the recoverable amount determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell or value in use of the asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed if the impairment situation is deemed to no longer exist.\n\n## Leased assets\n\nLeased assets are recognized as right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases, with contractually fixed future payments recognized as lease liabilities. When measuring leases, fixed lease payments for extension periods reasonably certain to be used are included. As a practical expedient, non-lease components are not separated from lease contracts. Leases of assets of a low value, manly such items as PCs, office equipment and similar, are excluded from lease accounting. See Note 2.6 Leases to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired individually or as a group are recognized at fair value when acquired, in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life and tested for impairment whenever indications of impairment are present.\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA accounts for CO2 emission allowances at cost as an intangible asset. The emission rights are not amortized, impairment testing is done on an annual basis. Sale of CO2 emission rights is recognized at the time of sale at the transaction price.\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\nForward contracts and options for purchase or sale of currency or commodities that are considered readily convertible to cash are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with the resulting unrealized gain or loss recorded in Financial income, net.\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA has decided to utilize the option in the regulation to exclude embedded derivatives and contracts deemed to be derivatives based on the underlying product being readily convertible to cash and not for own use when the contract is with a subsidiary.\n\n## Loans and other financial liabilities\n\nLoans and other financial liabilities include issued bonds, bank loans and similar. Loans are measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when Norsk Hydro ASA has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable (more likely than not) that Norsk Hydro ASA will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount, taking into account the risks and uncertainties. The provision is measured at the present value of the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation. Uncertain outcomes are measured as the expected value of reasonably possible outcomes.\n\n## Contingencies and guarantees\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA recognizes a liability for the fair value of obligations it has undertaken in issuing guarantees. Contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when probable of occurrence and reliably estimable.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA accounts for share-based payment in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment. See Note 9.2 Employee remuneration to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Risk management\n\nFor information about risk management in Norsk Hydro ASA see Note 8.1 Financial and commercial risk management to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nDeferred income tax expense is calculated in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes. Under IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and their tax basis which are considered temporary in nature. Deferred income tax related to remeasurements of pension obligations are recognized through Other comprehensive income. The tax effect of equity transactions, excluded transfers to owners, is recognized as a part of the equity transaction and do not affect the income tax expense. Other changes in deferred income tax asset and liability balances during the year represent the deferred income tax expense. Changes resulting from amendments and revisions in tax laws and tax rates are recognized when the new tax laws or rates are enacted.",

For additional salaries, employees earn retirement benefits in an unfunded contribution based plan. The remaining employees are covered by defined benefit plans that offer benefits based on final salary level and the number of years in service, and include benefits for dependents. The plan providing benefits based on salaries up to a maximum level is funded; all vested benefits are required by law to be funded for such plans. Benefits based on salaries above this level are covered by unfunded plans. The main funded plan is managed by Norsk Hydros Pensjonskasse, an independent pension trust. Hydro's pension plans supplement the public pension schemes in Norway. The plans comply with legal requirements for pension plans in Norway. Plans providing benefits for salary levels above the tax deductible level have been closed for new members from January 1, 2017.\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA participates in a pension plan that entitles the majority of its employees life-long benefits in addition to other pension benefits. The benefits are financed through a pooled arrangement by private sector employers (avtalefestet pensjon, AFP) where also the Norwegian state contributes. The plan is a defined benefit plan with limited funding and where plan assets are not segregated. The information required to calculate the share of the plan and account for the plan as a defined benefit plan is not available from the plan administrator. Hydro therefore accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution plan.

The result reflects increased dividends from subsidiaries in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nHydro's Board of Directors proposes to pay a dividend of NOK 5.40 per share for 2021, for approval by the Annual General Meeting on May 10, 2022. The proposed payment demonstrates the company's commitment to provide a predictable dividend to shareholders. Hydro's dividend policy reflects our ambitions to lift performance and cash returns to shareholders over the cycle. The dividend policy is to pay out a minimum of 50 percent of adjusted net income over the cycle with a NOK 1.25 per share dividend floor.\n\nAccording to section 3-3a of the Norwegian Accounting Act, the board of directors confirms that the financial statements have been prepared on the assumption of a going concern.\n\nOslo, February 21, 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDag Mejdell Chair\n\nIrene Rummelhoff Deputy chair\n\nArve Baade Board member\n\nRune Bjerke Board member\n\nLiselott Kilaas Board member\n\nPeter Kukielski Board member\n\nSten Roar Martinsen Board member\n\nEllen Merete Olstad Board member\n\nThomas Schulz Board member\n\nMarianne Wiinholt Board member\n\nHilde Merete Aasheim President and CEO",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company and the Group as required by laws and regulations and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited non-audit services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided.\n\nWe have been the auditor of the Company for 12 years from the election by the general meeting of the shareholders on 4 May 2010 for the accounting year 2010 with a re-election in the general meeting on 11 May 2020.\n\nTelephone +47 45 40 40 63\n\nFax\n\nInternet www.kpmg.no Enterprise 935 174 627 MVA\n\nIndependent Auditor's Report -Norsk Hydro ASA\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Provisions for environmental clean-up costs and asset retirement obligations\n\nRefer to Note 1.1 Reporting entity, basis of preparation and significant accounting policies, and Note 4.1 Uncertain assets and liabilities.\n\n## The key audit matter\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nThe Group is involved in operations such as bauxite mining, alumina refining, primary aluminium production and extrusion activities.\n\nThere is an inherent risk that these operations may generate significant obligations related to site restoration, reforestation and other remediation work. Such potential obligations are dependent on the jurisdictions in which the Group operates and changes in the relevant political and legislative environments.\n\nManagement decisions to expand, curtail or terminate operations in specific locations can impact obligations as described above.\n\nEstimating and calculating such environmental obligations require significant management judgement. The risk of inaccurate estimates is increased due to the uncertainty of scope and timing of such obligations and the limited amount of historical data available.\n\nThe Group has recognized provisions for environmental clean-up and asset retirement obligations of NOK 4,205 million as explained in note 4.1 Uncertain assets and liabilities.\n\n- Our audit procedures in this area included: \u00b7 Assessing the estimated cost and timing of activities applied in the calculations by comparing management forecasts with prior year estimates.\n- \u00b7 Comparing management's assumptions to relevant market data to test the reasonableness of discount rates, inflation rates, foreign exchange rates and other key assumptions used in the calculations.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the accounting treatment for compliance with IFRS and consistency of application, in particular related to the extent to which obligations are capitalized or expensed and the amortization period for capitalized assets.\n- \u00b7 Testing, with assistance from our valuation specialists, the mathematical accuracy of the models used to calculate provisions and asset retirement obligations.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the adequacy of the disclosures pertaining to estimation uncertainty, provisions and contingent liabilities.\n\nImpairment assessment of goodwill, intangible and non-current assets\n\nRefer to Note 1.1 Reporting entity, basis of preparation and significant accounting policies, Note 2.1. Property, plant and equipment, Note 2.2 Intangible assets, Note 2.3 Goodwill, Note 2.4 Depreciation and amortization expense, and Note 2.5 Impairment of non-current assets\n\n## The key audit matter\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nThe Group's operations are sensitive to certain commodity prices and other factors, including aluminum and alumina prices, energy prices, inflation rates, relevant foreign exchange rates and production volumes which impact key assumptions in cash flow forecasts and can give rise to impairment indicators.\n\nOur audit procedures in this area included:\n\n- \u2022 Assessing management's process and results for identification and classification of CGU's and assessing whether they were appropriate and in accordance with relevant accounting standards\n- \u2022 Evaluating management's assessment",

Impairment indications could also arise from transactions in which the agreed consideration is below the carrying value of the asset or CGU.\n\nCertain plants are also sensitive to the uncertainty related to renewal of power contracts expiring within 1 to 5 years.\n\nImpairment charges of NOK 437 million were recognized in 2021, consisting of:\n\n- \u00b7 NOK 286 million in relation to the business area Hydro Aluminium Metal\n- \u00b7 NOK 150 million in relation to the business area Hydro Extrusions\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group has goodwill of NOK 4,895 million, Property, plant and equipment of NOK 54,605 million and other intangible assets of NOK 3,830 million.\n\n## Independent Auditor's Report -Norsk Hydro ASA\n\n## of impairment indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Performing retrospective reviews of the accuracy of management's estimates in terms of timing of cash outflows and other assumptions such as long-term pricing where historical data is available\n- \u00b7 Evaluating and challenging the forecasted cash flows including timing of future cash flows applied in the models with reference to historical accuracy and approved business plans\n- \u00b7 When impairment is caused by a sales transaction, confirming the agreed consideration to the sales and purchase agreement, as well as re-calculating the impairment charge and relevant adjustments\n- \u00b7 Testing the sensitivity of movements in key assumptions\n- \u00b7 Evaluating, with assistance from our valuation specialists, key assumptions such as aluminium and alumina prices, inflation rates, energy and fuel prices, relevant foreign exchange rates and discount rates by reference to external sources and relevant benchmarks\n- \u00b7 Testing the mathematical accuracy of the models used to calculate value in use\n- \u00b7 Assessing the adequacy of the disclosures related to impairment\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management) are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises information in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information, and in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nBased on our knowledge obtained in the audit of the financial statements, it is our opinion that the information presented in the annual report required by the Norwegian Accounting Act sections 3-3a, 3-3b, 3-3c and 3-3d (the Board of Director's report, the statements on Corporate Governance and Environment and Social Responsibility and the report on payments to governments), is consistent with the financial statements and contains the information required by applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Independent Auditor's Report -Norsk Hydro ASA\n\n## Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with simplified application of international accounting standards according to the Norwegian Accounting Act section 3-9, and for the preparation and true and fair view of the consolidated financial statements of the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's or the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting, and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.",

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nReport on compliance with Regulation on European Single Electronic Format (ESEF)\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have performed an assurance engagement to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements with file name '549300N1SDN71ZZ8BO45-2021-12-31-en' have been prepared in accordance with Section 5-5 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act (Verdipapirhandelloven) and the accompanying Regulation on European Single Electronic Format (ESEF).\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements have been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of ESEF.\n\n## Management's Responsibilities\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing, tagging and publishing the financial statements in the single electronic reporting format required in ESEF. This responsibility comprises an adequate process and the internal control procedures which management determines is necessary for the preparation, tagging and publication of the financial statements.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on whether the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with ESEF. We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 - 'Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information'. The standard requires us to plan and perform procedures to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the European Single Electronic Format.\n\nAs part of our work, we performed procedures to obtain an understanding of the company's processes for preparing its financial statements in the European Single Electronic Format. We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the iXBRL tagging and assessed management's use of judgement. Our work comprised reconciliation of the financial statements tagged under the European Single Electronic Format with the audited financial statements in human-readable format. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOslo, 21 February 2022 KPMG AS\n\nLars Inge Pettersen State Authorised Public Accountant\n\nNote: This translation from Norwegian has been prepared for information purposes only.",

Financial APMs are intended to enhance comparability of the results and cash flows from period to period, and it is Hydro's experience that these are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties. Management also uses these measures internally to drive performance in terms of long-term target setting and as basis for performance related pay. These measures are adjusted IFRS measures defined, calculated and used in a consistent and transparent manner over the years and across the company where relevant. Operational measures such as, but not limited to, volumes, prices per mt, production costs and improvement programs are not defined as financial APMs. To provide a better understanding of the company's underlying financial performance for the relevant period, Hydro focuses on adjusted EBITDA in the discussions on periodic underlying financial and operating results and liquidity from the business areas and the group, while adjusting effects to adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and net income (loss) are discussed separately. Financial APMs should not be considered as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with the IFRS. Disclosures of APMs are subject to established internal control procedures.\n\n## Hydro's financial APMs\n\n- \u00b7 EBIT: Earnings before financial items and tax.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBIT: EBIT +/- identified adjusting items to EBIT as described below.\n- \u00b7 EBITDA: EBIT + depreciation, amortization and impairments, net of investment grants.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA: EBITDA +/- identified adjusting items to EBITDA as described below.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations: Net income (loss) from continuing operations +/- adjusting items to net income (loss) as described below.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations: Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Hydro shareholders divided by weighted average of outstanding shares (ref.: Note 7.6 Shareholders' equity to the consolidated financial statements).\n- \u00b7 Investments: Additions to property, plant and equipment (capital expenditures) plus long-term securities, intangible assets, long-term advances and investments in equity accounted investments, including amounts recognized in business combinations for continuing operations.\n- \u00b7 Net cash (debt): Short- and long-term interest-bearing debt adjusted for Hydro's liquidity positions.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net cash (debt): Net cash (debt) adjusted for liquidity positions regarded unavailable for servicing debt, pension obligation and other obligations which are considered debt-like in nature.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net cash (debt) to adjusted EBITDA ratio: Adjusted net cash (debt) / adjusted EBITDA\n- \u00b7 (Adjusted) RoaCE: (Adjusted) RoACE is defined as (Adjusted) 'Earnings after tax' divided by average 'Capital employed'. (Adjusted) 'Earnings after tax' is defined as (adjusted) 'Earnings before financial items and tax' less 'Adjusted income tax expense'. Since RoaCE represents the return to the capital providers before dividend and interest payments, adjusted income tax expense excludes the tax effects of items reported as 'Finance income (expense), net' and in addition, for adjusted figures, the tax effect of adjusting items. 'Capital employed' is defined as 'Shareholders' Equity', including non-controlling interest plus long-term and short-term interest-bearing debt less 'Cash and cash equivalents' and 'Short-term investments'.\n- \u00b7 Capital expenditure (Capex): 'Purchase of property, plant and equipment' plus 'Purchase of other Long-term investments', adjusted for elements that are not considered cash effective.\n- \u00b7 Cash effective change in net operating capital: Changes to 'Trade and other receivables' plus/minus changes to 'Inventories' plus/minus changes to 'Trade and other payables' as reported in the statements of cash flows.\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow: 'Net cash provided by operating activities' less 'Net cash used in investing activities', adjusted for 'Purchases of short-term investments, 'Sales of short-term investments' and net cash received or paid for short- and long-term collateral.\n\n## Adjusting items to EBITDA, EBIT, net income (loss) and earnings per share\n\nHydro has defined two categories of items which are adjusted to results in all business areas, equity accounted investments and at group level. One category is the timing effects, which are unrealized changes to the market value of certain derivatives. When realized, effects of changes in the market values since the inception of the instrument are included in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT. Changes in the market value of the trading portfolios are included in adjusted results. The other category includes material items which are not regarded as part of underlying business performance for the period, such as major rationalization charges and closure costs, effects of disposals of businesses and operating assets, major impairments of property, plant and equipment, as well as other major effects of a special nature, and realized effects of currency derivatives entered into for risk management purposes. Materiality is defined as items with a value above NOK 20 million. All adjusting items to results are reflecting a reversal of transactions recognized\n\nin the financial statements for the current period, with the exception of realized foreign exchange gain (loss). Part-owned entities have implemented similar adjustments.\n\n- \u00b7 Unrealized derivative effects on LME related contracts include unrealized gains and losses on contracts measured at market value, which are used for operational hedging purposes related to future expected sales and purchase transactions, both fixed-price customers and supplier contracts and transactions at not yet determined market prices. Also includes elimination of changes in fair value of certain internal physical aluminium contracts.\n- \u00b7 Unrealized derivative effects on power and raw material contracts include unrealized gains and losses on embedded derivatives in raw material and power contracts for Hydro's own use and for physical and financial power contracts used for managing price risks and volume changes. Unrealized derivative effects on certain power contracts in a business model with the combined aim to manage hydrological risk in own production, differences in power needs in existing and new business activities in Hydro as well as supporting development of new renewable energy projects are also adjusted for. Adjustments also comprise elimination of changes in fair value of embedded derivatives within certain internal power contracts.\n- \u00b7 Significant rationalization charges and closure costs include costs related to specifically defined major projects, and not considered to reflect periodic performance in the individual plants or operations. Such costs involve termination benefits, dismantling of installations and buildings, clean-up activities that exceed legal liabilities, etc. Costs related to regular and continuous improvement initiatives are included in underlying results.\n- \u00b7 Significant community contributions Brazil refers to the provision recognized in relation to the TAC and TC agreements with the Government of Par\u00e0 and Minist\u00e8rio P\u00f9blico made in September 2018, including later cost adjustments and certain similar agreements.\n- \u00b7 Other effects include insurance proceeds covering asset damage, legal settlements, etc. Insurance proceeds covering lost income in the same or a previous period are included in adjusted results.\n- \u00b7 Pension includes recognition of pension plan amendments and related curtailments and settlements.\n- \u00b7 Transaction related effects reflect the (gains) losses on divestment of businesses and individual assets, the net remeasurement (gains) losses related to previously owned shares in acquired businesses as well as inventory valuation expense related to acquisitions.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted items in equity accounted investments reflects Hydro's share of adjusting items from adjusted net income in Qatalum and are based on Hydro's definitions, including both timing effects and material items not regarded as part of underlying business performance for the period.\n- \u00b7 Impairment charges (PP&E and equity accounted investments) relate to significant write-downs of assets or groups of assets to estimated recoverable amounts in the event of an identified loss in value. Gains from reversal of impairment charges are also adjusted for.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation relate to excess depreciation for assets with significantly reduced expected useful life related to a decision to close the plant or similar significant changes.\n- \u00b7 Realized foreign exchange gain (loss) on risk management instruments represents such items as foreign currency derivatives entered into and managed to mitigate currency risk in the production margin, i.e. the difference between sales price for products such as aluminium or alumina versus the cost of raw materials and energy used in production. Realized embedded currency derivatives in certain power contracts in Norway denominated in Euro are also adjusted for. Such currency effects are included in currency gains and losses in finance expense in the income statement, and included in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT.\n- \u00b7 Net foreign exchange (gain) loss: Realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and payable, funding and deposits, embedded currency derivatives in certain power contracts and forward currency contracts purchasing and selling currencies that hedge net future cash flows from operations, sales contracts and operating capital, with the exception of the realized foreign currency exchange gain (loss) on risk management instruments mentioned above.\n- \u00b7 Calculated income tax effect: In order to present adjusted net income on a basis comparable with our adjusted operating performance, the adjusted income taxes include adjustments for the expected taxable effects on adjusted items to income before tax.\n- \u00b7 Other adjustments to net income from continuing operations include other major financial and tax related effects not regarded as part of the underlying business performance of the period.",

The property sold in 2020 was previously impaired, and the impairment was reversed when the property was sold.\n- 15) Other effects include an environmental provision of NOK 66 million related to closed sites in Germany.\n- 16) Impairment charges in Hydro Aluminium Metal reflect write downs related to the Slovalco smelter.\n- 17) Impairment charges include impairments of various assets, including goodwill, in Hydro Extrusions.\n- 18) Excess depreciation related to the anode producer Aluchemie which closed in 2021.\n\n## Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations\n\n| NOK million                                                                              | Year   2021   | Year   2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Net income (loss) from continuing operations                                             | 13,930        | 3,886         |\n| Adjusting items to net income (loss) from continuing operations 1) 2)                    | 976           | (1,038)       |\n| Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations                                    | 14,905        | 2,848         |\n| Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interests | 1,017         | 150           |\n| Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to Hydro shareholders        | 13,888        | 2,698         |\n| Number of shares                                                                         | 2,051         | 2,049         |\n| Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations                                   | 6.77          | 1.32          |\n\n- 1) See Items excluded from adjusted net income (loss) in the section Financial results in Performance Review section\n\n## Adjusted net cash (debt) and adjusted net cash (debt) to adjusted EBITDA ratio\n\nHydro's capital management measures are described in Note 7.1 Capital management in the Financial statements, including reconciliations and comparable information",

Management views this measure as providing additional understanding of the rate of return on investments over time in each of its capital intensive businesses and in the operating results of its business segments. RoaCE is calculated as (Adjusted) EBIT after tax divided by average Capital employed for the respective period. The definition of capital employed was amended during 2021 to be consistent with the amended definition of Net cash (debt), and excludes long-term collateral.\n\n## Adjusted Return on average Capital Employed (RoaCE)\n\nCapital employed for 2021 excludes Assets held for sale and Liabilities in disposal groups, as results from the divested Hydro Rolling business is separately reported as Income (loss) from discontinued operations. Capital employed and RoaCE for 2020 includes the divested Rolling business as reported in the 2020 annual report. This is consistent with the classification of the business in the years reported for.\n\n## Earnings after tax\n\n| NOK million                    | 2021    | Reported 2020   | 2021    | Underlying 2020   |\n|--------------------------------|---------|-----------------|---------|-------------------|\n| EBIT                           | 17,887  | 7,332           | 20,786  | 6,051             |\n| Adjusted Income tax expense 1) | (4,314) | (2,366)         | (5,255) | (2,640)           |\n| Earnings after tax             | 13,572  | 4,966           | 15,531  | 3,411             |\n\n## Capital employed\n\n| NOK million  2)                                    | Dec  312021   | Sep  302021   | Jun  302021   | Mar  312021   | Dec  312020   | Sep  302020   | Jun  302020   | Mar  312020     |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Current assets in continuing operations 3)         | 46,027        | 39,689        | 36,952        | 48,508        | 38,326        | 40,109        | 39,984        | 48,122          |\n| Property, plant and equipment                      | 54,605        | 54,642        | 56,353        | 53,890        | 64,245        | 68,657        | 70,478        | 77,909          |\n| Other non-current assets 4)                        | 42,250        | 42,144        | 41,951        | 39,749        | 40,072        | 34,176        | 35,159        | 39,377          |\n| Current liabilities (in continuing  operations) 5) | (33,140)      | (27,277)      | (25,494)      | (33,764)      | (24,300)      | (21,524)      | (20,414)      | (26,329)        |\n| Non-current liabilities 5)                         | (24,574)      | (27,020)      | (24,643)      | (22,402)      | (33,104)      | (34,658)      | (33,179)      | (36,712)        |\n| Adjusted for Assets held for sale 6)               |               |               |               | (17,069)      |               |               |               |                 |\n| Adjusted for Liabilities in disposal group 6)      |               |               |               | 12,266        |               |               |               |                 |\n| Capital Employed                                   | 85,167        | 82,177        | 85,119        | 81,178        | 85,239        | 86,760        |               | 92,027  102,367 |\n\n## Return on average Capital Employed (RoaCE) 7)\n\n|       | Reported   | Reported   | Adjusted   | Adjusted   |\n|-------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|       | 2021       | 2020       | 2021       | 2020       |\n| Hydro | 16.3%      | 5.4%       | 18.6%      | 3.7%       |\n\n- 2) Previous periods have been restated following a change to the capital employed definition in 2021.\n\n- 6) Excluding Hydro Rolling, reported as Income (loss) from discontinued operations.\n\nCapex is a measure for the cash amount spent on investment activities related to property, plant and equipment and other long-term investments as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the period.

Hydro uses this measure to drive financial performance. Hydro has increased the use of financial derivatives for risk management purposes compared to previous periods. The definition of free cash flow was therefore amended in 2021 to exclude the impact from changes in collateral. In addition, an adjustment is made for the cash effect from net sales (purchases) of trading securities, as these are related to liquidity management activities and do not reflect the underlying cash generation from business activities. Hydro believes this is a better illustration of the underlying cash generation in the group. The values include continuing operations only.\n\n| NOK million                                                 | 2021    | 2020 Restated   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------|\n| Net cash provided by operating activities 1)                | 10,680  | 12,170          |\n| Adjusted for changes in collateral 2)                       | 4,582   | 617             |\n| Adjusted for Net (sales) purchases of trading securities 3) | 1,441   | 38              |\n| Net cash used in investing activities 1)                    | (4,684) | (7,607)         |\n| Adjusted for Purchases of short-term investments 1)         | 3,000   | 6,480           |\n| Adjusted for Sales of short-term investments 1)             | (4,500) | (3,985)         |\n| Free cash flow (continuing operations)                      | 10,519  | 7,713           |",

Hydro's global tax policy regulates the global framework for tax management and governance in the group and can be found at hydro.com. Hydro is committed to transparency and accuracy in its tax management and to pay taxes where the economic value is generated.\n\nIn addition to this section, tax related disclosures are found under non-financial reporting (See Note S7 Current income tax), here and in the Risk section.\n\n## Taxation of hydropower production in Norway\n\nProfits from Hydro's hydropower production in Norway are subject to ordinary income tax at 22 percent for the income year 2021. Revenue for ordinary income tax purposes is based on realized prices. Dams, tunnels and power stations are, for tax purposes, depreciated on a linear basis over 67 years, and machinery and generators over 40 years. However, such fixed assets are depreciated over the concession period if that is shorter. Transmission and other electrical equipment are depreciated at a 5 percent declining balance.\n\nA natural resource tax of NOK 13 per MWh is currently levied on water-generated electricity. The tax is fully deductible from the ordinary income tax.\n\nIn addition, a special resource rent tax, is imposed on hydropower production in Norway. For income year 2021 the tax rate is increased from 37 percent to 47,4 percent and all new investments and upgrade/maintenance cost can be expensed/excluded from the basis for the resource rent tax. The tax rate increase is offset by a corresponding deduction in the tax basis for the resource rent tax. Marginal tax rate remains unchanged at 59 percent.\n\nUnlike the ordinary income tax, financial costs are not deductible against the basis for the resource rent tax. Instead, uplift is granted as a special deduction in the net income, computed as a percentage of the average tax basis of fixed assets for the income year. The percentage, is determined\n\nannually by the Ministry of Finance, (0.3 percent for 2021), essentially provides for a certain resource rent tax free return on fixed assets.\n\n## Country-by-country report\n\nHydro's country by country report has been developed to comply with legal requirements as stated in the Norwegian Accounting Act \u00a73-3d and the Norwegian Security Trading Act \u00a75-5a, valid from 2014, and updated in 2017, and replaces our former reporting on payments to host governments according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Our reporting includes, and goes beyond, the EITI requirements. According to the Norwegian Accounting Act, the country-by-country reporting should be on a project level, and payments should be reported per public authority. Following a thorough evaluation, we have defined 'project' as legal entity in the report, and 'public authority' as the three levels federal; state(s); and municipality(-ies).\n\nThe reporting requirement applies to Hydro as a Norwegian listed company with exploration and extractive activities. Currently, this includes Hydro's consolidated operations in Brazil, through exploration and extractive activities in Paragominas, in the state of Par\u00e1. On a voluntary basis, and in line with our EITI reporting since 2005, we also include the alumina refinery Alunorte. Alumina is refined from bauxite and is the commercial product from Hydro's Bauxite & Alumina business area.\n\nHydro's primary aluminium production facility Albras is also closely linked to the extraction of raw materials in Par\u00e1. In order to better illustrate the tax contribution from Hydro's aluminium value chain in Par\u00e1, Albras is included on a voluntary basis in the country-by-country report. In addition, Hydro voluntarily report on indirect tax contributions not covered by the requirements in the country by country report.\n\nTo comply with the Norwegian country-by-country regulation, Hydro is required to report on certain information at corporate level related to legal entities, where they are registered, number of employees, and interest paid to other legal entities in Hydro within another jurisdiction. From 2017, it is also required to give a short description of each legal entity's activities, revenue, income before tax, tax accrued and paid in the reporting year, and accumulated earnings. For additional reporting in accordance with the GRI 207 Tax standard, please see Hydro's GRI index.\n\nThe Country-by-country report is approved by the board of directors and included in their responsibility statement.",

The property tax, IPTU, is a tax levied on the ownership or possession of urban land and property located in the urban area within the municipality. IPTU is due yearly based on the value of the property, according to rates and conditions foreseen in each municipality's legislation.\n\nThe following table includes Hydro entities involved in extractive activities as well as other Hydro entities in the state of Par\u00e1.\n\n## Other tax contributions to authorities in Brazil\n\nThe Brazilian tax system is complex and volatile. In addition to the direct taxes reported above on income, profit and production, Brazil has several indirect taxes levied at the federal and state levels, and other taxes levied at the municipal level.\n\nFor Hydro, there are three relevant indirect tax mechanisms not covered by the country-by-country requirements, i.e ICMS and PIS/COFINS.\n\nICMS is a Brazilian state tax on the sale of goods, freight and certain services, similar to VAT. ICMS is intended to be a noncumulative tax, which means that sales are generating ICMS debits with the seller, and purchases are generating ICMS credits with the buyer. However, as export transactions are exempt from ICMS and not generating ICMS debits, exporters accumulate ICMS credits that cannot be offset with any other taxes. As ICMS in an indirect tax, the amounts are reported as expenses in Hydro's financial statements rather than as income tax.\n\nIn the state of Par\u00e1, Hydro is subject to a tax regime that aims at preventing the accumulation of ICMS recognized credits, and reduces net payable ICMS. From our operations, we generate ICMS tax revenue to Par\u00e1 when purchasing diesel and fuel oil, when Albras acquires electricity, and also on sales of products to customers located outside the state.\n\nIn 2015, the state of Par\u00e1 granted a renewal of the ICMS (value added tax) deferral regime for Hydro Paragominas, Hydro Alunorte and Albras for a 15-year period, meaning that the companies are not entitled to book ICMS credits and the deferred ICMS tax is not due on the exports of goods. This regime is subject to Hydro being compliant with multiple conditions all related to verticalization of the aluminium value chain in the state of Par\u00e1, contribution to development in the region and enabling sustainable growth in the state.\n\nFor more information about ICMS, see risk review 9. Material tax change.\n\nPIS and COFINS are two social contribution taxes charged on gross income, in most cases at the rate of 9.25 percent. Hydro's group companies in Brazil are charged under a non-cumulative system that resembles VAT. Similar to ICMS, export transactions are not subject to this tax. As a result,",

In the table below both revenue streams are included per legal entity, but in Hydro's consolidated financial statements all internal transactions have been eliminated to arrive at Hydro's revenue. The sum of the different items for Hydro's subsidiaries will therefore not add up to the respective consolidated figures.\n\nIn order to present a Grand Total in the country by country report that is comparable to Hydro's consolidated financial statements, we have included all group eliminations as a separate line. These include, but are not limited to, eliminations of internal revenue and cost, internal receivables and payables, distributed profit such as dividends within the group, goodwill and excess values not attributable to individual legal entities, accumulated profits allocated to noncontrolling interests and all joint operations and joint ventures.\n\nAssets and liabilities in subsidiaries that have been acquired have been remeasured to fair value in Hydro's financial statements. This value adjustment, often referred to as excess value, represents the difference between the fair value of the company as paid by Hydro, and the carrying value of assets and liabilities as recognized by the subsidiary at the time of purchase. This premium is not reflected in the subsidiaries local statutory reporting. Due to this, figures reported in Hydro's country by country report are not necessarily comparable to the entities' local statutory reporting. Acquired entities are included from the date of acquisition. As a result of rounding adjustments, the figures in one or more of the columns in the table below may not add up to the total of that column.\n\nThe information is included in the independent auditor's assurance report.",

We believe that the reporting in total satisfies this purpose. Our reporting on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters is aligned with the main reporting principles of the GRI Standards, core option, and the requirements of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). The selection of elements reported is based on extensive dialogue with stakeholders. In addition, the reporting builds on processes that are part of our daily operations. Important stakeholders include authorities, investors and financial analysts, employees and their representatives, potential employees, customers, non-governmental organizations and local communities affected by major development projects or restructuring processes. Reporting is not necessarily the target of the dialogue process, but when relevant, we use the outcome to improve our reporting, see Stakeholder dialogue.\n\nWe have endeavored to provide information that is in accordance with the principles of sound reporting practice. The absence of generally accepted reporting standards and practices in certain areas may nevertheless make it difficult to compare results with reports compiled by other companies, without the availability of further data, analyzes and interpretations.\n\nThe information in the Governance and Environment and social responsibility chapters in the annual report have been approved by the Board of Directors, while the Environmental and social statements have been approved by the Corporate Management Board.\n\n## Reporting scope and limitations\n\nThe scope of ESG reporting as included in The Hydro Way, Integrity and compliance, Environment and social responsibility and Environment and social statements in Hydro's Annual Report 2021, is Hydro's global organization for the period January 1 to December 31, 2021.Operations sold or demerged during the year have in general not been included. Health and safety data for all previously consolidated operations are, however, included in the historical data for the period the unit was owned by Hydro. Regarding environmental data (emissions, energy consumption etc.), operations acquired during the reporting year are included for the complete year. Data from operations that have been closed down, are included for the part of the reporting period it was under operation unless otherwise stated. Minority-owned operations are not included in the reported data except from data based on ownership equity (certain greenhouse gas emissions data), certain qualitative information as well as additional data for 50/50-owned companies, see Note E8 Environmental data for 50/50-owned companies and Note S14 Social data for 50/50-owned companies.\n\nEnvironmental data relating to acquired operations are included in our statistics, and historical data have been recalculated to reflect current operations. Correspondingly, historical data of divested activities are taken out of our reported data. Employee, safety and work environment data are included from/to the closing date of acquisitions/ divestments unless otherwise stated.\n\nData have been prepared from individual reports in accordance with corporate procedures. Data compiled at each operational unit according to local management systems applicable at the respective operational units are typically based on process data systems, measurements, calculations and/or purchasing data. The data are then aggregated at corporate level, and is not intended to include detailed information that is primarily of significance for individual sites, processes, activities and products.\n\nThe reporting is based on input from many units and sources of data. Emphasis has been placed on ensuring that the information is neither incomplete nor misleading. However, the scope of the reporting, and varying certainty of data may result in some inherent uncertainties. Please see \"Reporting principles\" for the specific note to the environmental or social statements for more details.\n\n## Main reporting changes\n\nHydro's Annual Report 2021 has been restructured compared to previous reports. This includes avoiding duplication of content and more use of graphs and illustrations. Information related to Hydro's reporting approach and Integrity and compliance are now included in the Governance section. Other information related to environmental and social topics are\n\nincluded in the Environment and social responsibility section and the related Environment and social statements. These sections are to a large extent similar to the former sections Viability performance and Viability performance statements.\n\nOther main changes to the ESG reporting in Hydro's Annual Report 2021 compared to 2020 relate to the removal of environmental data, including historic emissions related to Hydro Rolling, which was sold in 2021. We have updated indirect emissions for our operations in Norway, Canada and the primary aluminium producer Albras in Brazil. These have been updated to reflect the location specific emission intensities of the grid of the country or stte they are located in, according to the location-based methodology of the GHG Protocol. In addition, we have adjusted our reporting on recycling to also include Hydro Extrusions from 2021 onwards. From 2020, reporting on equal opportunities and anti-discrimination has been collected in our Diversity, belonging and inclusion disclosures, to comply with new Norwegian legal requirements. This includes disclosing information on gender equality at Hydro, including a mapping of compensation differences between women and men in Norway. From 2021 we have also included further information to be in compliance with the Norwegian transparency act, valid from 2022. A statement on EU Taxonomy for sustainable economic activities has also been added.\n\n## Assurance principles and scope\n\nWe have requested our company auditor to review our ESP reporting 2021 in accordance with the international audit standard ISAE 3000 - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). For the underlying systems, the reader is referred to Hydro's steering documents as described in the Corporate governance section in Hydro's Annual Report 2021. The external auditor's limited assurance report is attached.",

Data reported to HERE should be based on specific environmental, energy and resource data reporting processes that have been established for management purposes at site, business unit, business area, and corporate level within Hydro. Data are reported on a 100 percent basis for all consolidated operational units if not otherwise stated. All environmental emissions include historical emissions from current operations and are recalculated annually to reflect Hydro's current portfolio, and secure comparability.\n\nData reported in HERE are in accordance with Hydro's corporate procedure 'GP-03-05-01 Environment Management'. Data are compiled at each operational unit according to local environmental management systems and typically based on process data, measurements, calculations and/or purchasing data.\n\nWhere applicable, we have indicated to which GRI Standards disclosure the different notes or parts of the notes are relevant.\n\n## Note E1 - Grennhouse gas emissions\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nGHG emissions have been calculated based on the principles of the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol. Direct emissions from production in Bauxite & Alumina, metal production and downstream operations as well as from the remelters, are comparable to Scope 1 emissions as defined by the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol.\n\nIndirect emissions, emissions from electricity generation, are calculated based on electricity consumption and emissions factors from the IEA CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion (2020) and are comparable to scope 2 emissions from purchased electricity.\n\nWe report indirect emissions according to the location-based method in the revised GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. For our operations in Canada and the primary aluminum producer Albras in Brazil, indirect emissions reflect the regional grid mix. For Hydro's Annual Report 2021 we have updated the factors back to 2017, and historical figures have been updated accordingly. However, we have chosen not to report indirect emissions according to the market-based approach, as this method does not give the correct picture of physical realities.\n\nAs Hydro is an integrated company, with ownership along the whole aluminium value chain. Although a substantial part of Hydro's emissions is covered within scope 1 and 2 emissions, Scope 3 emissions are also considerable.\n\nScope 3 emissions cover other greenhouse gas emissions from e.g. external transport, purchasing of cold metal and other input materials. As part of Hydro's new climate strategy we are establishing reduction targets for scope 3 emissions.\n\n## E1.1 Total greenhouse gas emissions in consolidated activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions are reported per process step.

Emissions per ton alumina and aluminium produced remained stable. Production at Alunorte was impacted by the embargo in 2018 and 2019, and returned to normal levels during 2020.\n\nTo learn more about the embargo imposed on Alunorte in 2018, see Hydro's Annual Report 2018 and the section 'The Alunorte situation'.\n\nWe report indirect emissions according to the location-based method in the revised GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance.

Scope 3 emissions constitute a minor part of total emissions from Hydro's own metal production. In 2021, we mapped scope 3 emissions from cold metal and aluminium scrap provided from external suppliers. As Hydro regards the carbon footprint of process scrap as equal to its metal origin, Hydro's scope 3 emissions are significant when including externally sourced metal. In total, Hydro's scope 3 emissions were 17 million tonnes of CO2e in 2021, a reduction of 18 percent since 2018. The reduction was due to conscious sourcing of metal with lower carbon footprint.\n\nIndustry players who do not take the inherent carbon footprint of process scrap into account will report significantly lower scope 3 emissions. Hydro believes that this method of accounting is inaccurate, as it accounts for process scrap being carbon neutral, when in reality the process scrap has the same inherent carbon footprint as its metal origin. Hydro believes that we need to focus on what drives real change towards the green transition and we need to exercise our role as a responsible supplier and customer to influence the right development. If Hydro were to regard process scrap as carbon neutral, Hydro's scope 3 emissions would be 10 million tonnes CO2e in 2021 or more than 40 percent lower than with our accounting methodology.\n\nWe will continue to report on our scope 3 emissions and will work towards setting reduction targets by the end of 2022.\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions per country in Hydro's consolidated activities (based on 100 percent).\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions per country - consolidated activities\n\n| Million tonnes CO2e   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |   2017 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brazil                |   4.81 |   4.38 |   3.86 |   3.41 |   5.21 |\n| Direct                |   4.64 |   4.23 |   3.73 |   3.29 |   5.03 |\n| Indirect              |   0.17 |   0.15 |   0.14 |   0.12 |   0.18 |\n| Norway                |   2.27 |   2.03 |   2.1  |   1.99 |   1.94 |\n| Direct                |   2.04 |   1.84 |   1.82 |   1.77 |   1.71 |\n| Indirect              |   0.24 |   0.2  |   0.28 |   0.22 |   0.22 |\n| Slovakia              |   0.86 |   0.8  |   0.99 |   1.08 |   1.09 |\n| Direct                |   0.3  |   0.28 |   0.31 |   0.32 |   0.32 |\n| Indirect              |   0.56 |   0.52 |   0.68 |   0.76 |   0.77 |\n| Other                 |   0.96 |   0.87 |   1    |   1.08 |   1.08 |\n| Direct                |   0.64 |   0.58 |   0.65 |   0.67 |   0.67 |\n| Indirect              |   0.32 |   0.29 |   0.35 |   0.41 |   0.41 |\n| Total GHG emissions   |   8.9  |   8.08 |   7.95 |   7.56 |   9.31 |\n\nHydro's direct greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2021 due to increased production volumes and restart of Line B at Hydro Husnes.

This figure is comparable to scope 1 according to the GHG protocol. Electricity generation covers indirect GHG emissions from purchased electricity and emissions from Hydro's ownership share in the gas-fired power plant at Qatalum. This figure is comparable to scope 2 according to the GHG protocol. Emissions from electricity generation are based on electricity consumption and IEA CO2 emissions from Fuel Combustion 2020 factors for indirect emissions.\n\nHydro's 50/50 joint venture Qatalum has previously double accounted GHG emissions from anode effects from electrolysis process into Hydro's environmental management system.

The reported value corresponds to the purchased amount of such substances and can vary significantly according to the need of refilling existing cooling devices. In Brazil, such substances are registered and reported according to Brazilian legal requirements (GRI 305-6). In Hydro Extrusions, hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) accounts for around one third of ozone depleting substances.\n\nMethane (CH4) and N2O emissions from Hydro's operations are negligible compared to the other GHG emissions. The emissions of mercury to air has been calculated to be around 3 metric tonnes at full production.\n\n## E2.2 Spillages and leakages\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nSpillages and leakages to the external environment (ground, water or air) are registered in Synergi and in IMS, the reporting tools for incidents regarding health, safety, security and environment. According to Hydro's definition, any incident resulting in a spill or leak shall be reported, including significant spillages with short-term reversible damage. Leakages categorized as high severity, i.e. uncontained but reversible impact or uncontained and irreversible impact, and emissions to external environment categorized as high severity, i.e. unintended and sustained, are reported in the table below. A spillage or leakage can be reclassified according to changes in the actual consequence of the spillage or leakage, and historical figures are updated.

Hydro's definition of permit breaches, any incident that in any way relates to an environmental permit, is in certain cases stricter than the legal definition. Permit breaches categorized as high severity, requiring regulator contact or permit breaches with possible fine or suspension, are included in the table below. The reported permit breaches may be related to spillages and leakages covered in the table above. Several reported incidents can be related to the same permit and will be reported as one breach. Historical figures may be subject to change due to time lag in administrative procedures.\n\nFollowing a harmonization of reporting on environmental incidents and permit breaches between Extrusions and other business areas in Hydro, we identified a difference in the severity of cases being included in the report. This has been adjusted for in the reporting for 2019 and onwards.\n\n## Permit breaches\n\n|                 |   2021 |   2020 | 2019   |   2018 | 2017   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Permit breaches |      2 |     11 | 1 1)   |     23 | 25 2)  |\n\n- 1) Figures for 2019 are not comparable to previous years due to harmonization of definitions between Extrusions and the other business areas in Hydro.\n- 2) Figures from Extrusions, acquired 2 October 2017, are included for the full year.\n\nIIn 2021, Hydro Extrusion USA, LLC reached resolution with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality of certain air and water environmental compliance issues, as well as other self-disclosed issues, involving Hydro's cast house in The Dalles, Oregon. Hydro remitted the required dollar amounts (a total of 695,600 USD for air issues and 69,583 USD for water issues, either directly or through commitments to approved Supplemental Environmental Projects) and is timely fulfilling other required corrective actions. In addition to resolving the civil matters, Hydro is also cooperating with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Oregon U.S. Attorney's Office in their criminal investigation of alleged Clean Air Act violations at The Dalles.\n\nThe 2018 figure also includes in total four permit breaches in Bauxite & Alumina of which three at Alunorte: the use of Canal Velho; rainwater from the roof of a coal shed; and the leakage through a disused pipe. For more information see the section 'The Alunorte situation' in Hydro's Annual Report 2018.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE2.4\n\n## Provisions for environmental clean-up and future asset retirement obligations\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nWhen Hydro, at acquisition of an asset or start of a business activity, has an obligation to remove, dismantle or remediate the asset or site used, that obligation is included in the cost of the asset with the present value of estimated remediation costs. The same treatment is applied if an obligation to remove, dismantle or remediate the asset is introduced at a later date, through new legislation or other means.

This was partly reversed in 2019 and 2020 due to lifting of the embargo and ramp-up of production.\n\n## Renewable energy consumption\n\nWe have considered our total energy consumption by energy carrier, and used IEA's data on country energy mix to calculate the renewable energy share in our electricity consumption. Electricity derived from biofuels, waste, hydro, geothermal, solar, wind and tide are considered renewable. According to our estimates, the share of renewable energy out of total energy consumption is about 39 percent in Hydro.\n\n## E3.2 Energy intensity of alumina refining\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nEnergy intensity of the alumina refining at Alunorte is calculated based on total energy consumption at Alunorte divided by total alumina production.\n\nEnergy intensity in Hydro's consolidated smelters is direct current consumption in the electrolysis process per metric ton aluminium.\n\n## Note E4 - Other resource use\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## E4.1 Materials\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nThis covers major raw materials used in the alumina refining process and electrolysis process beyond what is included in the energy consumption data.\n\nAlumina and aluminium fluoride are primarily used in the electrolysis process, whilst lime, caustic soda (NaOH), sulfuric acid and flocculants are primarily used in the alumina refining process.

There was also a significant improvement in water efficiency within the operation in 2020.

Baseline water stress measures the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies. Areas categorized as high and extremely high with regard to water stress is included in the figure above. WRI Aqueduct is also used for evaluating Hydro's operational exposure to overall water risk, an aggregation of physical (quantity and quality), reputational and regulatory water risk. Overall water risk was evaluated using WRI Aqueduct's weighting score for mining operations, as this weighting best reflects the risk for our type of operations (0.61 : 0.02 : 0.37 for 'quantity', 'quality' and 'regulatory and reputational' risk categories, respectively).\n\n## Overall water risk\n\n|                |   Number of  locations | Share of total  water withdrawal   |\n|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Extremely High |                      2 | 0.1%                               |\n| High           |                      5 | 52.6%                              |\n| Medium - High  |                      8 | 0.6%                               |\n| Low - Medium   |                     54 | 2.3%                               |\n| Low            |                     41 | 44.4%                              |\n| Grand total    |                    110 | 100%                               |\n\n## E4.2 Water\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nSome water loss to the external environment will occur as evaporation and/or steam. This water loss is included in the figures under water discharge as other (not specified). The quality of fresh-water discharge generally complies with local or site-specific permits before discharge to local water recipients and is of a high quality, as per ICMM's definition.\n\nThe majority of Extrusions sites have a closed loop water management system, and the water use is marginal compared to the rest of Hydro. The majority of water use in Extrusions takes place in Oregon in USA, and in Sweden.\n\nFrom 2021 we have updated the definition of surface water to include rainwater and have updated previous years' data to reflect this.\n\n## Total water withdrawal by country\n\n| million m 3       | 2021    |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |   2017 |\n|-------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Norway            | 216.1   |  224.8 |  218.4 |  218.1 |  191.7 |\n| Brazil            | 69.5 1) |   54.5 |   58.7 |   57.8 |   47.6 |\n| United States     | 4.8     |    4.2 |    5   |    5.1 |    5.4 |\n| Rest of the world | 4.7     |    3.9 |    5.1 |    5.7 |    5.3 |\n| Total             | 295.1   |  287.5 |  287.3 |  286.7 |  250   |\n\n- 1) Includes 20.7 million m 3 of rainwater not used in the process, but it is treated and discharged.

Alunorte has improved the monitoring of rainwater, and the figure may not be comparable to historical figures. The figure varies with precipitation.\n\nIn 2021, 28 percent of Hydro's surface water withdrawals was rainwater, primarily captured at Alunorte and Paragominas.\n\nAlmost 75 percent of Hydro's total water withdrawal occurs in Norway from fjords (sea water) and rivers (fresh water) that supply these fjords. These water sources are vast and are not significantly affected by Hydro's operations. All sea water withdrawal in Norway is used in fume treatment plants enabling the primary production smelters to clean dust, SO2 and fluoride emissions to air. Sea water absorbs the pollutants and mitigates the environmental impact from the production process.\n\nAlunorte receives a large volume of water, entrained in the bauxite product that it receives from Paragominas, through the pipeline. In 2021, Alunorte received 11.4 million m3 of freshwater from Paragominas. Alunorte is reusing more than 70 percent of this water in the refining process.\n\nParagominas' water use was close to their current regulatory limits. However, based on new hydrological studies of the Parariquara river, Paragominas' water extraction permits were revised in 2018. Water collection can still be an issue if a new third-party user requests water extraction from the same watershed. To address this, Paragominas has implemented actions to increase water recycling within the operation and improve water storage capacity. Based on these actions,",

Reporting of recycling data is drawn from the company's production software and ERP system.\n\nThe numbers below include our pre-consumer and post-consumer scrap recycling from Hydro Aluminium Metal and Hydro Extrusions, and have been adjusted historically to reflect the sale of Hydro Rolling. 2021 was the first year we have been able to integrate Hydro Extrusions recycling, and so historical figures from 2017-2020 are not directly comparable.\n\n## Recycling\n\n| 1,000 metric tonnes          | 2021 1)   |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |   2017 |\n|------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Recycled post-consumer scrap | 335       |    104 |     98 |    104 |     96 |\n| Recycled pre-consumer scrap  | 1,018     |    317 |    340 |    371 |    395 |\n| Total recycled metal         | 1,353     |    421 |    438 |    474 |    491 |\n\n- 1) 2021 is the first year we have consolidated recycling data from Hydro Extrusions, making the 2021 results not directly comparable to previous years' data\n\nWe have adjusted historical data on recycling to exclude volumes processed by Rolling which was sold in 2021, which accounted for approximately 840,000 metric tonnes of pre-consumer and post-consumer scrap in 2020.",

In the Plateau tailings storage facility, the tailings undergo a drying cycle that can take approximately 30 or 60 days, during the dry and rainy season, respectively. After the drying process, the material has a minimum of 60 percent solid content and is then excavated and deposited back into the mined areas. This method is what Hydro refers to as 'Tailings Dry Backfill'. In 2021, 1.4 million metric tonnes of dried material was reclaimed and returned to the mined areas.\n\nParagominas is Hydro's only consolidated mine. The tailings generated in the bauxite's beneficiation process have no hazardous chemical properties.\n\nAs a control measure, static water pressures within the walls of our tailings facilities at Paragominas are monitored through the use of dedicated instrumentation (piezometers).\n\nBauxite residue, also known as red mud, is a by-product of the alumina refining process. The residue is washed with water to lower the alkalinity, and recovered caustic soda is recycled for use in the production process. Residue is dry-stacked as a claylike substance with a low moisture content.\n\n## Tailings and bauxite residue\n\n| 1,000 metric tonnes 1)   | 2021     | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|--------------------------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Tailings                 | 4,239 2) | 3,345  | 2,871  | 2,116  | 4,067  |\n| Bauxite residue          | 5,384    | 4,827  | 3,871  | 3,191  | 5,979  |\n\n- 1) On a dry basis.\n- 2) Includes 1.4 million mt returned through tailings dry backfill.\n\n## GRI Reference: G4-MM3\n\nThe significant decrease in 2018 is due to the Alunorte embargo (bauxite residue) and the corresponding Paragominas curtailment (tailings). This is partly reversed in 2019 and onwards due to lifting of the embargo and ramp-up of production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE5.2\n\n## Hazardous waste and other waste\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nFrom 2020, waste is no longer reported according to the European Waste Codes (as defined in the EU Waste Framework Directive). Instead, waste has been reported according to a harmonized categorization within Hydro, based on the common names of key waste streams relevant to our operations (e.g. bauxite residue, SPL, waste caustic soda etc.). This change in reporting was implemented to facilitate aggregation of data at a group level and avoid the use of multiple waste codes for the same waste category. Operations continue maintaining more detailed waste registries that align with local requirements and legislation. Aggregated figures presented in the tables below are comparable to previous years, as this change in categorization does not affect the total volumes of waste reported.\n\nSpent potlining (SPL) from the electrolysis cells used in primary aluminium production is defined as hazardous waste. The production of SPL varies with the relining of smelter cells which is normally done every 4-7 years for established smelters. New plants will get a relining peak at the same interval after start-up. See also SPL figures on a five year rolling average in the Environment and social responsibility chapter.\n\nA significant amount of Extrusions hazardous waste is in the form of spent caustic resulting from the die cleaning process with a large proportion of this being recycled.\n\n## Hazardous and other waste\n\n| 1,000 metric tonnes   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Spent potlining       | 73,4   | 50,5   | 52,3   | 37,5   | 35,9   |\n| Other hazardous waste | 188,6  | 199,5  | 192,6  | 205,9  | 245,1  |\n| Total hazardous waste | 262,0  | 250,0  | 244,9  | 243,4  | 281,0  |\n| Other waste           | 468,0  | 370,0  | 270,8  | 283,3  | 356,6  |\n| Total waste           | 730,0  | 620,0  | 515,6  | 526,7  | 637,6  |\n\nGRI Reference: GRI Standards 306-3 (2020)",

This is the only mine within Hydro's consolidated operations.\n\n## Overburden moved\n\n| Million metric tonnes   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |   2017 |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Overburden moved        |     79 |     67 |     45 |     48 |     83 |\n\nGRI Reference: G4-MM3\n\nThe overburden volume increase in 2021 is considered within normal annual variation. The increase from 2019 to 2020 is due to increased production following the lifting of the embargo and ram-up of the production levels.\n\nHydro uses strip mining in Paragominas, a technique that avoids the formation of an overburden stockpile. Thus, all overburden moved for mining purpose is used to reconstruct the topography of the strip previously mined, prior to rehabilitation of the mined areas. Part of the overburden (laterite) is also used for paving roads and for raising the heights of existing tailing dams and constructing new ones.\n\nThe sterile soil is untreated and has no dangerous properties. Leaching potential due to overburden removal is negligible. There is a water resource management program in place to mitigate silting from the plateau areas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## E5.3 Waste treatment\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nWaste sorted by treatment includes both external and internal treatment. In many cases waste is managed by a third party, which all are required to adhere to the Hydro Supplier Code of Conduct. A non-compliance with or breach of the principles in Hydro's Supplier Code of Conduct, that is not corrected within a reasonable period, may lead to termination of the supplier contract. All Hydro locations are also required to ensure safe transport of hazardous waste in accordance with global and local regulations and evaluate critical waste receivers and include these in a supplier development system.\n\nTailings and bauxite residue are deposited in appropriately engineered and managed on-site landfills and are not included in the table below. Combustion without energy recovery is included under Other treatment.\n\n## Treatment of hazardous waste\n\n|                 | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Energy recovery | 6%     | 5%     | 7%     | 7%     | 6%     |\n| Landfill        | 25%    | 29%    | 29%    | 29%    | 35%    |\n| Other           | 15%    | 20% 1) | 24%    | 24%    | 20%    |\n| Reuse/recycling | 54%    | 46%    | 39%    | 39%    | 39%    |\n\n- 1) The 2020 numbers have been revised to include the on-site storage which wasn't captured under the category of \"Other\" in 2020\"\n\n## Treatment of other waste\n\n|                 | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Energy recovery | 9%     | 10%    | 6%     | 5%     | 4%     |\n| Landfill        | 15%    | 15%    | 29%    | 31%    | 50%    |\n| Other           | 24%    | 23%    | 15%    | 17%    | 12%    |\n| Reuse/recycling | 53%    | 52%    | 50%    | 48%    | 34%    |\n\nGRI reference: GRI Standards 306-4 and 306-5 (2020)",

By end of 2021, the total rehabilitation gap was 201 ha.\n\nThe Hydro Paragominas property measures in total 18,764 hectares (ha), while the total land use at the end of 2021 was 7,017 ha, including 2,646 ha under ongoing rehabilitation.\n\nThere are specific closure plan requirements for the Paragominas mine (rehabilitation of mine and tailings ponds). In addition, there is a similar requirement for the bauxite residue disposal areas at Alunorte. Hydro has a dedicated corporate function which oversees legacy issues and addresses closure issues. For the time being such plans are further developed on an ad hoc basis when relevant, and a strategy is under development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## E6.2 Land use and rehabilitation\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nHydro's only consolidated mining operation is in Paragominas in Brazil. Areas are measured using the ArcGIS Platform. The rehabilitation data are reported to ANM (the Brazilian National Mining Agency) and Semas (the Secretary of State for Environment and Sustainability in Par\u00e1), as part of the clearing permit renewal process.\n\nIn our mining operation we strive for a year-on-year balance between the area that we mine and make available for rehabilitation every year and the area that we succeed in rehabilitating every year. From 2018, this target is a rolling average across two hydrological seasons, and the categories for land-use have been redefined.\n\nThe mining cycle is made up of several steps. When a given area of land is to be developed, the first step is clearing, when vegetation and soil are removed. The area is then classified as area cleared for future mining. After an area is mined, it is either classified as tailings dams and other mining infrastructure or area available for rehabilitation. All areas available for rehabilitation will be rehabilitated as soon as possible and subsequently classified as an ongoing rehabilitation area.\n\nWhen tailings faciliies are closed, they will become available for rehabilitation after settling for minimum five years. We will then get a significant increase in the tailings dam infrastructure available for rehabilitation. There may be additional movements between different statuses from year to year due to reclassification.\n\nDuring 2021, we cleared 427 hectares (ha) of land and mined 389 ha. A total area of 167 ha underwent rehabilitation in 2021, and an area of 150 ha was released from the mining operations, to be rehabilitated within two hydrological cycle as part of Hydro's 1:1 rehabilitation target. This area must be completely rehabilitated by the end of 2023 in order to meet the 1:1 rehabilitation target.\n\nOf the 91 ha made available for rehabilitation in 2019, 63 percent was rehabilitated by end of 2020. The remaining 37 percent was completed in 2021, and we met the 1:1 rehabilitation target. Of the 150 ha that were made available for rehabilitation in 2020, 77 percent was rehabilitated by the end of 2021 and the remaining 23 percent will be completed in 2022.\n\nThe clearing, mining and rehabilitation cycles are constantly ongoing and are not synchronized. Clearing and mining are at their peak in the dry season, whilst rehabilitation happens primarily in the wet season. The three cycles are also influenced by different drivers such as permits for the clearing cycle, land available for rehabilitation, and rainfall for the rehabilitation cycle. As a result, there is no direct link between the area cleared each year and the area mined or rehabilitated that same year (e.g. an area cleared in 2017 may be mined late 2018 and then rehabilitated in the 2019 wet season). Due in large part to this complexity, the figures presented above cannot be directly deducted from the figures in the land use and rehabilitation table below.\n\nAll areas stated in the table below give a snapshot of Paragominas' land use at year end.\n\nIn 2021, we reviewed land use data reported by Paragominas, and during this review, we found that land use data previously reported in the annual report included some double counting across land use categories. The table presented in this annual report is an accurate representation of land use at the site, and historical data has been updated accordingly.",

Alumina production includes Alunorte while primary aluminium production includes 100 percent of production at all Hydro's primary aluminium plants in Norway, Slovalco in Slovakia and Albras in Brazil. These volumes are not directly comparable to the volumes reported in the financial statements, as this table uses the Greenhouse Gas Protocol's guidance of reporting production at entities of at least 50 percent ownership.\n\nAlumina and primary aluminium production are by far the most energy and GHG intensive processes in Hydro.\n\n## Production volumes\n\n| 1,000 metric tonnes          | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Alumina production           | 6,305  | 5,457  | 4,487  | 3,712  | 6,397  |\n| Primary aluminium production | 1,915  | 1,726  | 1,675  | 1,653  | 1,752  |\n\nProduction volumes decreased significantly in 2018 due to the embargo at Alunorte (alumina), and curtailment at Albras (primary aluminium). This is partly reversed in 2019 and 2020 due to lifting of the embargo and ramp-up of production. This trend continued into 2021, with the increased demand and price of aluminium driving further increases in production.\n\n## Note E8 - Environmental data for 50/50-owned companies\n\nHydro has an ownership share of 50 percent in Qatalum.

This applies to all Hydro's operations, including consolidated subsidiaries, if not otherwise stated. Such data are based on the corporate reporting system for incident reporting, IMS and Synergi. The units report incidents to the systems on a regular basis in accordance with a corporate procedure on HSE incidents and sick leave data. Employee data are reported based on Hydro's SAP system.\n\nThe reporting methodology will follow Hydro's principles, unless otherwise stated.\n\nWhere applicable, we have indicated to which GRI Standards disclosure the different notes or parts of the notes are applicable. Please also see the social statements on the previous page for more such information.\n\n## Note S1 - Employees\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nData for Hydro's permanent and temporary employees are based on Hydro's human resources SAP system. Data presented represent status at year end, December 31. Payroll is based on Hydro's consolidated financial statements. Payroll, as provided in the table below, does not include pension costs.\n\nTemporary employees include among others apprentices, but exclude contractor employees. Legal requirements and customs may vary from country to country, making direct comparison difficult.\n\nNumber of full-time equivalents of contractor employees as included in the social statements is estimated based on the total hours worked by contractor employees (reported in Hydro's incident reporting system Synergi and IMS as basis for calculation of injury frequency) divided by 1,850 working hours per year. Contractor employees represented in total about 13,900 full-time equivalents during 2021. The majority relates to Hydro's Bauxite & Alumina activities.\n\nExtrusion has a greater extent of seasonal variations than the other business areas in Hydro. This is solved in different ways in different parts of the organization and may include the use of agency workers. We still do not have the full overview of the extent of such use.\n\nPermanent employees by region, gender and age as well as payroll\n\nS1.1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Permanent employees by region,

Our findings suggest that the largest share is being used in Hydro Building Systems, part of Hydro Extrusions, in France, Spain and Italy, constituting a total of 16 percent of their workforce in 2021. The use of agency workers is well regulated in these countries. This includes that they are paid above minimum wage requirements. The agency workers are mostly employed to handle production peaks. While a large proportion of these workers prefer not being permanent employees, Hydro Building Systems is still working to reduce their share in the organization to build competence and improve stability in the workforce.\n\n## Part-time employees 1)\n\n|                 | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Norway          | 0.9%   | 0.7%   | 1.2%   | 1.5%   | 1.9%   |\n| Women           | 1.9%   | 1.8%   | 3.7%   | 4.2%   | 5.6%   |\n| Men             | 0.7%   | 0.4%   | 0.5%   | 0.8%   | 1.0%   |\n| Total employees | 1.7%   | 2.0%   | 1.3%   | 1.3%   | 1.6%   |\n| Women           | 4.4%   | 5.9%   | 4.9%   | 4.9%   | 6.2%   |\n| Men             | 1.1%   | 1.1%   | 0.5%   | 0.5%   | 0.6%   |\n\n- 1) Data for 2020 includes 98 percent of Hydro's permanent employees globally.\n\nGRI Reference: GRI Standards 102-8 (2016)\n\nHydro employees normally work full time. The opportunity to work part time is considered a benefit for which a special application must be made. In 2021, we reviewed if there were any cases of involuntary part-time work in our Norwegian activities. The review confirmed that all employees working part time had applied for reduced working hours. In 2021, 58 employees worked part-time in Hydro in Norway, this includes both permanent and temporary employees.\n\n## Part-time in Norway\n\n|           |   Total employees (men  and women) | (%) proportion of  Women   |\n|-----------|------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Total     |                                 58 | 55%                        |\n| Permanent |                                 51 | 57%                        |\n| Temporary |                                  7 | 43%                        |",

In Norway, sick leave was 4.9 percent in 2021 compared to 4.5 percent in 2020. Women in Norway had a sick leave rate of 5.7 percent, while men had 4.7 percent.\n\n## Parental leave\n\nIn 2021, men and women in Hydro Norway typically used the allocated numbers of parental leave in line with the national guidelines.\n\n## Parental leave in Norway\n\n|       | 2021                | 2021                                | 2020                | 2020                                |\n|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|       | Number taking leave | Average duration   of leave (weeks) | Number taking leave | Average duration   of leave (weeks) |\n| Women | 36                  | 32                                  | 55                  | 24                                  |\n| Men   | 90                  | 12                                  | 107                 | 10                                  |\n\nIn Brazil, the legal requirement is 120 days of maternity leave and five days of paternity leave. Since 2019, Hydro has offered 180 days of maternity leave and 10 days of paternity leave to all employees. In the U.S., there are no general legal rights for paid maternity and paternity leave. Hydro Extrusions North America offers four weeks of paid parental leave, in addition to six-eight weeks of maternity leave provided under its employee insurance. Hydro Precision Tubing in the U.S. offers six-eight weeks of paid maternity leave under its employee insurance program.\n\nWe are currently mapping our leave benefits in terms of maternity, paternity, adoption and sick leave in the 18 countries with the highest number of employees to identify any need for updated policies. In our employee engagement survey, we track perceptions of healthy balance between work and spare time, and found stress level as important indicators for a sustainable work environment.\n\n## Note S2 - Remuneration\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nData on gender related salary differences is based on local salary systems. Data on \"highest paid employee\" is based on Note 9 Related parties and remuneration in Hydro's consolidated financial statements for Norway, and from local salary systems in Brazil.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS2.1\n\n## Gender related salary differences\n\nAll employees shall receive a total compensation that is competitive and aligned with local industry standard (but not market leading). The compensation should also be holistic, performance oriented, transparent, fair and objective. Salaries in the organization are reviewed on a regular basis. There are no significant gender-pay differentials for employees earning collective negotiated wages in Norway and Brazil. We have evaluated salary differences for all Hydro employees in Hungary and based on our overall figures we find no significant gender related salary differences.\n\nWe have investigated the salary conditions for all Hydro employees in the U.S., including at the remelters, extrusion plants and precision tubing facilities. Based on our initial analysis, on average there are no significant gender-related salary differences in Extrusion North America. Also, in Brazil we do not see any gender-pay differentials for employees earning collectively negotiated wages. Furthermore, based on the on the comprehensive equal pay analysis conducted for Norway in 2021, Hydro will include gender-related compensation analysis starting in 2022 in countries where we have large presence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS2.2\n\n## Highest paid employee\n\n'Highest paid employee' includes fixed salary, pension, health insurance (Brazil only) and other benefits, but excludes bonuses.

In Brazil, entry level wages are controlled by the labor agreement. We looked into salary differences in 2021, and the ratio compared to national minimum wage in Barcarena was 1.89 for women and 2.03 for men and 1.72 in Paragominas for both genders.\n\nIn Norway, the entry level wages are defined by tariff agreements. In the Norwegian operations, minimum entry wage for staff with certificates of apprenticeship is about 9 percent higher than the tariff minimum.\n\nFor Hydro Extrusions' significant location of operation, Hungary, we have reviewed entry level wage. The standard entry level wage ratio is 1.57 compared to the national minimum wage. In the USA, Hydro's most significant country of operations based on number of employees, the ratio of entry level wages across all sites to the federal minimum wage was 1.77 , and are higher than applicable state level minimum wages at all sites.\n\nGRI reference: GRI Standards 202-1 (2016)",

For both groups, the actual number of managers can vary from year to year.\n\n## Diversity in management\n\n|                                    | Women   | Women   | Women   | Women   | Women   | Non-Norwegians   | Non-Norwegians   | Non-Norwegians   | Non-Norwegians   | Non-Norwegians   |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                    | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    | 2017    | 2021             | 2020             | 2019             | 2018             | 2017             |\n| Board of directors (10 members) 1) | 40%     | 40%     | 27%     | 33%     | 33%     | 30%              | 30%              | 27%              | 11%              | 22%              |\n| Corporate assembly                 | 33%     | 35%     | 33%     | 33%     | 33%     | -                | -                | -                | -                | -                |\n| Corporate Management Board         | 44%     | 40%     | 40%     | 40%     | 40%     | 20%              | 10%              | -                | 10%              | 20%              |\n| Top 50 managers                    | 35%     | 31%     | 32%     | 33%     | 28%     | 34%              | 43%              | 37%              | 39%              | 37%              |\n| Top 200 managers                   | 36%     | 32%     | 27%     | 25%     | 21%     | 41%              | 53%              | 60%              | 56%              | 51%              |\n\n- 1) With three women among the seven shareholder-elected members and one woman among the three employee representatives on the Board of Directors and one woman among the three employee representatives, Hydro complies with the Norwegian legal requirements on female representation. .\n\nGRI reference: GRI Standards 405-1 (2016)\n\nIn addition to the groups above, we also monitor the gender distribution across additional staffing categories. In women leadership positions, where we monitor positions that have at least one line report, we have a target of 25 percent by 2025. In 2021 we achieved 18% of women in leadership positions, a 2 percentage point increase on 2020.\n\nWe also monitor women in white-collar, or staff positions. For this group the data include level 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 managers. We have set a target of 35% by 2025 in this category. In 2021, 28% of staff were women, a 3 percentage point increase on 2020.",

Local is defined at country level for Norway and at state level for Brazil. Only significant sites of operation are included.\n\n## Local representation in senior management\n\n| Share of senior management hired from local  community   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Norway                                                   |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Production sites in Norway                               | 88%    | 98%    | 97%    | 97%    | 100%   |\n| Aluminium Metal management team                          | 80%    | 80%    | 77%    | 91%    | 90%    |\n| Extrusions management team                               | 14%    | 29%    | 38%    |        |        |\n| Brazil                                                   |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Paragominas, Par\u00e1                                        | 15%    | 9%     | 9%     | 8%     | 9%     |\n| Barcarena, Par\u00e1                                          | 17%    | 22%    | 17%    | 13%    | 15%    |\n| Bauxite & Alumina management team                        | 0%     | 0%     | 0%     | 0%     |        |\n\nGRI reference: GRI Standards 202-2 (2016)\n\nOf the thirteen members of the Bauxite & Alumina management team in Brazil, seven are Brazilian citizens.\n\nHydro employs locals when necessary competence and capacity are available and normally uses expatriates only to secure employee development and the transfer of values and competence. Open positions in Hydro are normally posted at hydro.com and in local media. To secure competence transfer, it is important that there are also senior employees with experience from other units. This may also be the case at the blue-collar level, especially during start-up of new plants or equipment.\n\n## Note S4 - Employee engagement\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nHydro's employee engagement survey is normally carried out for all employees every second year.\n\nThe survey provides an Employee Engagement Index (EEI), a Psychosocial Risk Indicator (PRI) and an Integrity Culture Index (ICI).\n\nEEI measures the extent to which employees are motivated to contribute to organizational success and are willing to apply discretionary effort to accomplishing tasks important to the achievement of organizational goals.\n\nPRI measures work-related stress which affects employee mental health and wellbeing.\n\nICI measures the employee perception of Hydro's integrity culture.\n\nHydro changed survey provider in 2020, and the EEI may therefore not be comparable to previous years. The Hydro specific Performance Excellence Index is discontinued.\n\nThe long-term ambition is to be among the top 25 percent companies worldwide on EEI. In 2021, we launched the Hydro Inclusion Index in order to track perceived inclusion, consisting of eight questions related to diversity, inclusion and belonging with comparisons to external benchmarks.\n\n## Hydro Monitor\n\n|                                                   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   | 2017   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employee Engagement Index (EEI)                   | N/A    | 72%    | N/A    | 84%    | N/A    |\n| Women                                             |        | 70%    |        | 86%    |        |\n| Men                                               |        | 72%    |        | 83%    |        |\n| Psycosocial Risk Index (PRI)                      | N/A    | 75%    |        |        |        |\n| Women                                             |        | 73%    |        |        |        |\n| Men                                               |        | 75%    |        |        |        |\n| Integrity Culture Index (ICI)                     | N/A    | 76%    |        |        |        |\n| Women                                             |        | 75%    |        |        |        |\n| Men                                               |        | 76%    |        |        |        |\n| Performance Excellence Index (PEI) (discontinued) | N/A    | N/A    | N/A    | 82%    | N/A    |\n| Response rate                                     | N/A    | 89%    | N/A    | 88%    | N/A    |\n\nThe engagement survey is a tool to work with organizational development, therefore the most important part is follow-up of agreed actions.",

TRI rate is calculated per one million hours worked.\n\nLost time injury (LTI) is a personal injury at work leading to unfitness for work and absence beyond the day of the accident.\n\nRestricted work case (RWC) is a personal injury at work that does not lead to absence beyond the day of the accident, because of alternative job assignment.\n\nMedical treatment case (MTC) is treatment, other than first aid, administered by a physician or registered professional personnel under the standing orders of a physician.\n\nEmployees are workers under direct supervision of Hydro.\n\nContractors are workers who are under contract to execute work for Hydro, and who are under the direct supervision of the contractor, but at Hydro premises under Hydro's indirect supervision.\n\nAbsenteeism for Hydro globally includes all absence due to injuries, work related and other illness, measured as number of hours lost due to sick leave as percent of number of hours worked plus number of hours lost due to sick leave.\n\nSick leave, Norway includes all absence due to illness, measured as number of days lost due to sick leave as percent of number of possible working days excluding holidays.\n\nThere are challenges in ensuring consistent reporting practice on sick leave across the company due to legislative and cultural differences between countries.",

We use our proactive tool for work environment risk assessment (WERA) to identify health risk and implement risk reducing measures e.g. substitution of hazardous chemicals, noise reduction, personal protective equipment to avoid development of new occupational illness cases. Through the work we have reduced the frequency of occupational illness cases related to noise and pot room asthma.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## S5.4 Wellness\n\nHydro cares about the health and wellbeing of our employees, and offers a variety of initiatives to promote physical and mental health.\n\nThe majority of Hydro's sites offer wellness initiatives, ranging from healthy eating, exercise opportunities, weight management, stop smoking campaigns and work-life balance management. Several sites have access to a social worker or counselor to address psychological health and safety, and health and wellness is also addressed at site Health and safety-day events.\n\nHealth and wellbeing topics emphasized in 2021 included mental health and a celebration of the World mental health day, mental health podcasts, mental health and stress management webinars and revision of existing psychosocial risk assessments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS5.5\n\n## Covid-19 pandemic\n\nIn order to avoid spread of the virus at Hydro controlled sites a number of actions have been put in place and their use updated and revised based on local conditions and the emergence of Covid-19 variants. A corporate risk assessment process was developed to support all sites and business travel to allow business to continue safely and in fully aligned, or more stringent, than applicable national rules and guidelines.",

The nominal tax rates typically vary between around 20 and 35 percent. The effective tax rates may differ from the nominal tax rates, among other things as a result of differences in depreciation rates and other tax deductions.\n\n- \u00b7 The marginal tax rate for our power production in Norway is 59 percent.\n- \u00b7 The general corporate income tax rate in Brazil is 34 percent. Hydro's bauxite, alumina and aluminium operations in Brazil have been granted income tax incentives encouraging investments in the northern provinces of Brazil, reducing the tax rate on operating income to between 20 and 34 percent up to 2017. No tax incentives have been valid or applicable for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. In 2021, Hydro Paragominas has been granted renewal of a SUDAM income tax incentive for a 10-year period, reducing the tax rate on operating income to between 20 and 34 percent from 2020 to 2029. In addition, Hydro's operations in Brazil are subject to a number of significant indirect taxes.\n- \u00b7 Hydro is present in some countries with at tax rate below 10 percent. In Switzerland, we have bauxite, alumina and aluminium sales activities, and aluminium sales activities in Singapore, both are taxed at rates of around 10 percent. In addition, Hungary has a tax rate of 9 percent.\n\nQatalum, a 50/50 joint venture with Qatar Petroleum, had a 10 year exemption from income taxes in Qatar, which expired in 2020. It has been Hydro's consistent position that the generally applicable tax rate, currently at 10 percent, should apply to Qatalum after the expiry of the tax holiday. However, the joint venture partners have not been able to agree on a common interpretation of the applicable tax law, and Qatalum filed its 2020 tax return applying a 35 percent tax rate on 30 June 2021. Hydro is pursuing alternative measures to protect its financial interest in this matter.\n\nHydro reports according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and Norwegian legal requirements, see Hydro's Country by country report.

In addition, compliance data has been obtained from quarterly compliance reporting by business areas, and a self-assessment filled in by each business area at year-end. Some information has also been collected through other sources including Hydro's Legal department and Procurement Network.\n\n## S10.1 Reported and confirmed cases of non-compliance\n\nNon-compliance cases are normally reported to line management and/or supporting staff functions including Group Compliance, Group Internal Audit and Investigations, Human Resources, Legal, HSE, Finance and Accounting. Noncompliances can also be reported through Hydro's AlertLine, which offers the possibility of anonymous reporting, unless otherwise prohibited by local law. Although separate reporting statistics have been kept for Extrusions (acquired 2017) and the rest of Hydro, the figures from 2018 are consolidated.\n\nThe number of dismissals due to breach of Hydro policy is limited to cases reported to Hydro's Internal Audit.\n\nIn 2021, Hydro received 896 notices in Canal Direto, the grievance channel designed for external stakeholders in Brazil. The majority of the entries, 53%, relate to information request ranging from supplier registration, contracts, invoicing, payment, human resources up to overall commercial issues. Around 38% refer to the food card distribution process as part of the Term of Adjusted Conduct (TAC) agreement with the Government of Par\u00e1 and the Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico in relation to the Alunorte situation in 2018. Most files, 57%, were registered through our toll-free number (0800), while 38% came from email and 5% through Hydro website.\n\nA set of improvements were performed in Canal Direto along 2021: internal leaders were trained on the importance of grievance mechanisms for companies as well as their role in responding to grievances appropriately; a complete Canal Direto website revamp was made, along with a comprehensive communication plan; technical improvements were performed to bring more stability, confidentiality to the data base; the third-party service supplier team was trained on ways to improve service quality as well as on human rights related aspects",

Albras was fined at a rate of 0.1% of gross turnover while the other port association members were fined at 0.5%.\n\nFor information about a civil fine related to certain air and water environmental compliance issues in Hydro's casthouse The Dalles, Oregon, US, please see Note E2.3 Permit breaches.\n\nHydro Extrusion Portland, Inc. (HEP) and its U.S. parent company, Hydro Extrusion USA, LLC (Hydro ENA), entered into agreements in April 2019 to resolve certain investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). HEP pled guilty to one charge of mail fraud, received three years of probation, and paid approximately NOK 400 million. Hydro ENA entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) in which it admitted to mail fraud, but the prosecution of the charge is deferred for three years, subject to its fulfilment of certain obligations.\n\nFor more information about legal proceedings in Hydro please see the section Legal proceedings.\n\n## Legal claims related to the Alunorte\n\nThe legal claims stated below are primarily cases related to Brazil and goes beyond what is covered under noncompliances with laws and regulations above.\n\nFor information related to the Alunorte situation, please see Hydro's Annual Report 2018.\n\nMarch 16, 2018: CAINQUIAMA - Associa\u00e7\u00e3o dos Cablocos, Indigenas e Quilombolas da Amaz\u00f4nia (an association with an office in Barcarena) filed a lawsuit in the State Court in Bel\u00e9m against Norsk Hydro Brasil, Alunorte and the State of Par\u00e1, claiming that chemical waste was intentionally discharged and that the bauxite residue deposits in operation were subject to a fraudulent license granted by the State of Par\u00e1. Furthermore, the plaintiff alleged that the bauxite residue deposits (DRS 1 and 2) are located on an ecological reserve. With reference to these allegations the plaintiff requested the defendants to carry out medical examinations of allegedly impacted communities. The lawsuit is ongoing and awaiting a final decision in the lower Court.\n\nMarch 27, 2018: A collective lawsuit was filed by IBS (Barcarena's Social and Environmental Institute) against Norsk Hydro Brasil, Albras, Alunorte, Imerys, Alubar, the Municipality of Barcarena and the State of Par\u00e1 to seek remediation of the environment and compensation for material and moral damages. The lawsuit is ongoing and awaiting a final decision in the lower Court.\n\nApril 3, 2018: The State of Par\u00e1 filed a civil class action seeking to recover environmental damages allegedly caused by Alunorte, as well as indemnification for alleged material and moral damages. On December 12, 2018, Alunorte and the State of Par\u00e1 entered into a settlement agreement to end the lawsuit with reference to the Term of Adjusted Conduct (TAC) and Term of Commitment (TC) signed on September 5, 2018. On October 14, 2019 the court issued a decision homologating the agreement and extinguishing the lawsuit. The decision was subject of appeal filed by ADECAM association and is pending a decision from the Court of Appeal.\n\nApril 5, 2018: The State and Federal Public Prosecutor's Offices (Ministerio P\u00fablico) filed a lawsuit against Alunorte, Norsk Hydro Brasil and the State of Par\u00e1. As a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs requested partial suspension of Alunorte's production activities (50 percent reduction) and prohibition of using the bauxite residue deposit DRS2 until the license to operate was obtained, and the company could demonstrate operational stability and efficiency. On April 30, 2018, the Federal Court partially granted the injunction, determining a similar embargo previously granted by a State Criminal Court. The State of Par\u00e1 and the State Public Prosecutor's Office were excluded from the lawsuit. On May 15, 2019 the Federal Court lifted the production embargo on Alunorte. On September 20, 2019 the Federal Court issued a decision homologating the agreement between Federal Public Prosecutors, Alunorte and Norsk Hydro Brasil to resume DRS2 installation and commissioning activities. The decision was subject of appeal filed by individuals and is pending a decision.\n\nMay 15, 2018: Another lawsuit was filed by CAINQUIAMA against Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Paragominas (MPSA), Albras, Norsk Hydro Brasil, Alunorte, INMETRO (National Institute of Metrology), BVQI -CERTIFICADORA LTDA; Federal Union of Brasil, National Department of Mineral Production ('DNPM'), in the Federal Court in Paragominas, alleging that MPSA's\n\ntailings contain hazardous substances. CAINQUIAMA also claimed that the bauxite residue have been illegally dumped in Alunorte's bauxite residue deposits (DRS1 and DRS2) and that these deposits are located in an ecological reserve requesting an injunction to stop the operation of MPSA. On July 18, 2018 the Federal Court denied the request for injunction. The lawsuit is ongoing and awaiting for final decision in the lower Court.\n\nSeptember 12, 2018: ADECAM (Association of Education, Culture, Protection and Defense of Consumers, Taxpayers and Environment of Brazil) filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court in Bel\u00e9m against Alunorte, Norsk Hydro Brasil, the Federal Union and Ibama (the Federal Environmental Agency) seeking compensation for alleged collective moral damages to the people of Par\u00e1, having the rainfall in February 2018 as the main ground for the claim. The association accuses the companies of pollution, including overflow and leakage of the bauxite residue deposits, discharge of contaminated effluents through clandestine/hidden pipes, in addition to what has already been claimed in other lawsuits involving the February incident. The lawsuit is ongoing and awaiting a final decision in the lower Court.\n\nOctober 31, 2018: CAINQUIAMA filed a similar lawsuit as the one filed in March 16, 2018 against Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Paragominas (MPSA), Albras, Norsk Hydro Brasil, Alunorte, State of Par\u00e1, BVQI - Certificadora Ltda in the State Court of Belem, requesting the suspension of the operation of the companies. On June 17, 2019, the court issued a decision that denied the injunction request. The lawsuit is ongoing and awaiting a final decision in the lower Court.\n\nOn May 3rd, 2019: CAINQUIAMA filed a new lawsuit, with an injunction request, before the 5th Public Treasury Court of Belem against (i) the State of Par\u00e1; (ii) Norsk Hydro Brasil.; (iii) Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Paragominas; (iv) Alunorte. and (v) Albras. In short, the complaint states that the products used in Brazil in order to refine bauxite are more toxic than the ones used in Norway. Further, it argues that the amount of coal and heavy fuel oil consumed per year by Alunorte released into the atmosphere is harmful to the environment (as it can cause, e.g., acid rain and contamination of soil and water) and to humans (as it can cause respiratory illness and premature death). Lastly, it mentions that the ICMS tax benefit given to defendants must be lifted, because Alunorte has not changed the energy source from fuel oil to natural gas as agreed with the government through one of the commitments in the ICMS agreement. On June 10, 2019 the Court issued a decision that denied the injunction request. The lawsuit is ongoing and awaiting for final decision in the lower Court.\n\nOn August 1, 2019: About 100 Individuals from Abaetetuba and Barcarena (State of Par\u00e1) filed a lawsuit against Alunorte. The case relates to the 2018 rainfall incident and claims that Alunorte contaminated the environment, and due to this, the plaintiffs are not able to sustain their livelihoods as farmers and fishermen and are requesting material and moral compensation. The lawsuit is ongoing and awaiting a final decision in the lower Court.\n\nOn August 20, 2019, the Agrarian State Public Prosecutor Office issued a 'recommendation' alleging that: (i) DRS1 and DRS2 were built in an area designated as an 'ecological reserve' as defined in the purchase agreement from 1982 and according to environmental legislation; (ii) restoration of agricultural area as defined in the 1982 agreement was not implemented and; (iii) Taua community was wrongfully evicted in the 1980s and later eviction cases, and should be granted land rights. The main requests from the Agrarian State Public Prosecutor Office are: (i) the demolishment of parts of DRS1 and DRS2; (ii) the agricultural area should be re-established; and (iii) Taua community should be recognized as a traditional community and granted their community and land rights. Alunorte and Hydro disagree with the allegations made by Agrarian State Public Prosecutor Office but remain in dialogue in order to seek a solution to the case.\n\n## Bauxite & Alumina Labor cases\n\nFebruary 2017: The union at Paragominas filed in February 2017 a claim representing all employees, asking to be compensated for hours spent commuting back and forth from work. Following the labor law reform in November 2017, the obligation to compensate for commuting if the place of work is not served by regular public transportation or if the public transportation is not satisfactory to meet the demand, is not valid. Due to this change, the period in question is February to November 2017. The case was partially granted by the initial ruling and is currently being re-evaluated by the Court of Appeals. The case is now suspended, as the Labor Court of Appeals and Superior Labour Court of Appeals have different interpretations on the subject.\n\nApril 2019: Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Paragominas ('MPSA') Employees Union filed a Collective Labor Lawsuit on behalf of all employees asking for additional salary differences related to night shift work for employees working on rotating shifts, as well as weekly rest payments for those working for seven consecutive days. The case was dismissed in the initial ruling. When re-ruling the case, the Labor Court of Appeals changed the decision and granted additional pay for night shift workers and dismissed the claim on weekly rest payment without analysis of its merits. Both parties appealed to the Superior Labor Court, where judgment is pending.\n\n## Other cases\n\nFrom 2008 there is a legal dispute between five of the 120 relocated families and the alumina refinery project CAP in Barcarena in Brazil. Their requests have been denied by the Court. The case is still awaiting a decision from the Court of Appeals.",

In 2012, more than 5,400 claims related to the overflow were filed in the local court. By the end of October 2021, a total of 5035 cases were closed with favorable decision to Alunorte, and 419 cases are pending decision from the lower Court and/or Court of Appeals.\n\nIn respect of the alleged inappropriate disposal of waste in Ulian\u00f3polis Municipality, in September 2011, a civil class action was filed by the Municipality of Ulian\u00f3polis against Albras and Alunorte and several other companies. The case seeks remediation of environmental damage and condemnation by the companies and collective moral damages, considering their alleged contribution to environmental damages related to previous disposal of waste through Companhia Brasileira de Bauxita (CBB). Albras and Alunorte are parties in the class action, as both delivered waste to CBB prior to 2003. The class action was filed after an attempt from the Municipality of Ulian\u00f3polis together with the State Environmental Agency - Semas, to negotiate a settlement with all the companies involved. Albras and Alunorte did not agree to the terms of the proposed settlement as they had already removed their waste from the site. The lawsuit is ongoing and awaiting a final decision in the lower Court. Besides the civil class action, in March 13, 2014 and December 7, 2015 , six similar labour claims were filed before the Labour Court of Paragominas, Par\u00e1, against Companhia Brasileira de Bauxita (\"CBB\"), Alunorte, Albras and 81 other companies by former CBB employees alleging that they have worked under unhealthy and hazardous conditions, without receiving appropriate personal protective equipment and, as consequence, they developed serious illnesses that prevented them from working. They claim payment for moral and material damages. A medical expert examination was carried out by the Labor Court but the report was not conclusive as to whether any of the alleged diseases derived from activities performed while employed by CBB. Therefore, all the six cases were dismissed. Claimants filed appeals challenging the decision and the cases are now being processed to be sent to the Regional Labor Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Federal and State Public Prosecutors filed in 2016 a Public Class Action against Albras, Alunorte, Imerys, Votorantim, Oxbow, Yara (companies located in the industrial district of Barcarena) and the Municipality of Barcarena, the State of Par\u00e1 and the Federal Union (Brazilian Government). The purpose of the lawsuit is to protect the rights of the local people of Barcarena that allegedly consume contaminated water due to the industrial activities in the municipality. The lawsuit is ongoing and awaiting a final decision in the lower Court.\n\nIn 2017, CAINQUIAMA - Associa\u00e7\u00e3o dos Cablocos, Indigenas e Quilombolas da Amaz\u00f4nia (an association with office in Barcarena), filed a lawsuit against Norsk Hydro Brasil, Alunorte and Albras, the State of Par\u00e1, Bureau Veritas Brasil and Inmetro. They claim part of the bauxite residue deposits for Alunorte (DRS1 and DRS2) was established on an area designated as an ecological reserve, and that they have suffered social and environmental damages. The lawsuit is ongoing and awaiting a final decision in the lower Court.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, CAINQUIAMA and nine Brazilian individuals filed a lawsuit with the Rotterdam District Court, in the Netherlands, against Hydro's Dutch entities and Norsk Hydro ASA (Hydro) seeking compensation for alleged financial damages and personal injuries suffered as a result of Alunorte and Albras activities in the municipality of Barcarena. According to the plaintiffs, Hydro's Dutch entities and Hydro are part of Alunorte and Albras' corporate group and, therefore should be liable for the alleged environmental violations caused in the municipality of Barcarena throughout the years. The lawsuit is ongoing and awaiting a final decision by the lower Court.\n\n## S10.3 Confirmed significant human rights breaches\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nWe define significant human rights breaches as either one or more confirmed cases of forced labor, child labor abuse, or confirmed breach of ILO 169 caused, contributed or linked to Hydro. We also include cases where a municipality/region/ area of more than 100 people has been irreversibly impacted by confirmed cause, contribution or link to Hydro (e.g. spill, systematic pollution over time, involuntary relocation). The confirmed impact to people in the municipality/region/area is life-long and/or life-shortening.\n\nRelocation of people may at times be necessary in connection with our operations. No voluntary or involuntary relocation of people with legal or prescriptive rights to their dwellings, took place in Hydro's operations in 2021. In Barcarena in Par\u00e1, Brazil, in an area surrounding Hydro's operations and regulated for industrial purposes, illegal logging and settlements have accelerated since 2016. We realize that we need to better understand the situation in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders, the municipality and civil organizations.\n\nHydro did not detect severe human rights impacts in our own operations in 2021.\n\nIncidents of harassment and discrimination are reported separately from (other) human rights breaches in Note S10.1 Reported and confirmed cases of non-compliance. Occupational health and safety incidents, including fatalities, can be found in Note S5 Health and Safety.\n\n## S10.4 Compliance training\n\nIn Hydro, compliance awareness training is provided on a range of topics and consists of classroom-training, workshops, town hall meetings and various e-learning modules. In 2021, training was provided e.g. on the topics of anti-corruption, Hydro's code of Conduct, competition law, data privacy, trade sanctions and market regulations. Compliance training is mainly prepared and executed by Group Compliance and Group Legal, but other group functions also contribute. In 2021 a suite of new compliance e-learning courses was procured.\n\nThe various compliance awareness and training modules were in total completed 25,709 times, of which the various compliance e-learning training modules were completed 18,148 times and classroom training was provided to 7,561 employees.",

This mostly relates to suppliers, but also some customers, agents and other. business partners were included New business partners related to most operations are screened before registered in our ERP system. Furthermore operations in North America screened approximately 13,000 customers and suppliers in the denied parties risk tool MK Denial.\n\nAll suppliers, customers and other business partners registered in our main accounting systems are screened on a weekly basis against recognized international sanction lists.\n\nThe number of audits in 2021 is still on the same low level as 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In total 49 supplier audits were conducted in 2021 in Hydro. All the supplier audits included topics related to health, safety, environment and social responsibility. Around 80 percent of the audits led to action plans, and by the end 2021, more than 70 percent of the corrective actions proposed by Hydro resulted in improved performance. All audits are risk based emphasizing topics relevant for the suppliers operations, e.g., quality, safety, environmental, human rights and governance.\n\nKey social responsibility and HSE findings from the audits relate to lack of management systems, environmental awareness, compliance controls and emergency preparedness. A non-compliance with or breach of the principles in Hydro's Supplier Code of Conduct that is not able to be corrected within a reasonable period, may lead to termination of the supplier contract.\n\n## S10.6 Cyber security training\n\nHydro continue to emphasize security awareness for end-users, and provide e-learnings for all users with access to Hydro Academy. Guidelines are published in relevant channels for all users.\n\n- In 2021, a new mandatory cyber security training was established for all IT users in all business areas. A total number of 14 000 employees participated in the training, which covered essential topics of cyber security.\n\n## Note S11 - Spending on local suppliers\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nSelection of local partners and suppliers/contractors shall be based on competitive bidding to the extent feasible, and in compliance with competition laws and regulations as well as Hydro's requirements. A local supplier is here defined as a supplier situated in the same country as the operational site.\n\nData on local purchasing is gathered by for all the business areas. For the business areas Bauxite & Alumina, Aluminum Metaland and Hydro's project organization, Brazil, Norway and USA are considered the most significant locations of operation based on economic importance.\n\nSpending on local suppliers vary from site to site depending on which goods and services are available. Local spend in our Brazilian Bauxite & Alumina operations was estimated to be 70 percent in 2021. Most of the raw materials used at the aluminum plants in Norway are imported, while electricity and services are sourced locally. In the Norwegian smelters local procurement mainly relates to maintenance services etc. and is about 20 percent in 2021. This year we also report on Hydro Extrusions which has a local spend of about 62 percent in 2021, whereas Hydro Energy has 88 percent local spend.\n\n## Note S12 - Public affairs and lobbying\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nData on public affairs and lobbying is gathered from Hydro's Communication & Public Affairs department in Norway, Germany and Brazil, in addition to our office in Brussels that follows up EU affairs. These units cover all consolidated activities.\n\nIn total nine full-time equivalents (FTE) are dedicated to public affairs and lobbying. This includes four FTEs in Brazil and four in the EU (Brussels office). In Norway one FTE are dedicated to public affairs and lobbying. Within the EU, lobbying activities are publicly reported through the EU Transparency Register. To get a full overview of all Hydro's memberships in different industry associations see Hydro.com.\n\nAccording to our global directives, Hydro may not make financial contributions to political parties. We have no indications that such contributions took place in 2021.",

Certification according to these standards is a decentralized responsibility based on identified business needs.\n\nHydro's power plants in Norway have chosen not to be certified. However, they are fulfilling the requirements given in the mentioned standards. In addition, the power plants need to comply with the requirements given by the Norwegian Water Resource and Energy Directorate (NVE), i.e. concessions for operations as well as environmental, third person safety, security and emergency preparedness regulations. The table below shows the distribution of certification of the other operational sites in Hydro.\n\nIn addition to the mentioned ISO and OSHAS standards below, a number of sites are also certified according to different sector and customer specific standards. Examples of such certifications are the IATF 16949 for the automotive industry, and the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative.\n\n## Share of relevant operational sites certified\n\n|       | ISO 9001   | ISO 14001   | ISO 45001 1)   | ASI   |\n|-------|------------|-------------|----------------|-------|\n| Hydro | 98%        | 99%         | 79%            | 42%   |\n\nOf our sites delivering to the automotive industry, 88 percent are certified according to the IATF 16949.

They have provided a clear, global understanding of governmental duties and corporate responsibilities for human rights. The UNGPs articulate that wherever and however a company operates, it must refrain from violating human rights. Companies are expected to be fully aware of their human rights impacts, take concrete steps to address them and implement measures to mitigate negative impacts in the future. Companies are also expected to communicate any impacts or risks of impacts, and mitigating actions. Hydro is committed to transparency, including through this annual report.\n\nHydro uses the GRI document \"Linking G4 and the UN Guiding Principles\" document as basis for how we report on our adherence with the UNGPs, and report on this in the GRI index 2021. This is also included in external auditor's consistency check of Hydro's GRI index 2021. We also report according to relevant laws that are based on the UNGPs, including the Norwegian Transparency Act 2021 (valid from 2022), the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, and the Australia Modern Slavery Bill 2018. The most salient and prioritized human rights issues are reported the Human rights chapter.\n\nThrough Hydro's human rights due diligence processes, we did not detect severe human rights impacts in 2021 and therefore have nothing to report for 2021 on the GRI B4 \"Additional severe impacts\".\n\n## ICMM\n\nHydro is a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals and reports according to the ICMM requirements. That includes Hydro's reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards, see the section about GRI above. The Environment and social responsibility 2021 reporting is prepared in line with the requirements found in the ICMM 10 principles and position statements. The complete Environment and social reporting is - according to the ICMM requirements - assured by our external auditor.\n\nAs part of our ICMM commitments, we disclose mineral development contracts granted or entered into from 1 January 2021 that we have signed with host governments, see hydro.com\n\n## ASI\n\nThe Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) is a global, multi-stakeholder, non-profit standards setting and certification organization. The ASI works toward responsible production, sourcing and stewardship of aluminium following an entire value chain approach.\n\nHydro is an active member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative. ASI's mission is to recognize and collaboratively foster the responsible production, sourcing and stewardship of aluminium. We have been involved at all stages in the multistakeholder development of ASI standards to date. We have participated in developing ASI's certification program. The third-party certification platform was launched in December 2017. Until publication of this report, 65 production sites have been certified according to the ASI Performance Standard, covering Hydro's value chain from bauxite mining to finished products. Hydro has also certified several sites according to the Chain of Custody standard, and delivered the first ASI certified metal to a customer in July 2019.\n\nHydro reports in the GRI index 2021 on how we relate to ASI's 11 principles and underlying criteria. This is also included in external auditor's consistency check of Hydro's GRI index 2021. For the full GRI index, see hydro.com/gri.\n\n## TCFD - Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\nHydro is a signatory to the TCFD recommendations. TCFD was formed by the Financial Stability Board in 2015. The recommendations were made public in June 2017. Hydro launched a new climate strategy in 2019 that takes into account\n\nscenario analysis. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 New policies: similar to a 2\u00b0C scenario in line with the Paris agreement\n- \u00b7 Current policies: similar to a 4\u00b0C scenario and in line with already adopted measures\n- \u00b7 Physical risks: stress testing of physical risks under a 6\u00b0C scenario\n\nThe table below shows an overview of Hydro's initial approach to the recommendations. All page references relate to Hydro's Annual Report 2021.\n\n## Partnerships and commitments\n\n## GRI Standards\n\nHydro uses the GRI Standards for voluntary reporting of sustainable development. The guidelines comprise economic, environmental and social dimensions relating to an enterprise's activities, products and services. GRI collaborates with the United Nations Environment Program and UN Global Compact. Hydro has reported according to GRI since 2003.\n\nWe believe that our reporting practice is consistent with GRI's reporting principles in all material respects. We report in adherence to \"Core\" as defined by the GRI Standard 101: Foundation 2016, and include the GRI G4 Mining & Metals sector supplement and certain relevant aspects of the G4 Electric Utilities sector supplement in our reporting.\n\nThe report is externally assured by KPMG. The external assurance, as outlined in the Independent Auditor's Assurance report, concludes that the report is presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI Standards.\n\nThe GRI index, including the full definition of each indicator and references to specific sections in this report as well as additional information, can be found on hydro.com/gri.\n\n## UN Global Compact Communication of progress\n\nWe support the principles of the UN Global Compact. Human rights, international labor standards, working against corruption and environmental considerations are fundamental to our approach to corporate responsibility.\n\nHydro has played an active role in the Global Compact since its formation. Our commitment is expressed by the Chair of the Board of directors and the CEO in their letter to stakeholders. Our Communication on progress (COP) in relation to the Compact's 10 principles is at the Advanced level and thus also reflects the Global Compact's 21 advanced criteria. The consistency of the information in Hydro's annual report 2021 with the information in the Hydro Communication on Progress 2021 has been reconciled by our auditors. A complete report can be found at hydro.com/globalcompact.\n\n## UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) embrace a universal approach to the sustainable development agenda. They explicitly call on business to use creativity and innovation to address development challenges and recognize the need for governments to encourage sustainability reporting. Hydro has an impact on all of the 17 development goals, but some more than others. Of the 17, Hydro has chosen eight goals that are the most important to us, that are highlighted throughout the report.\n\nHydro uses the SDG Compass, a tool built in a partnership between GRI, UN Global Compact and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development, to make a high-level review on how we relate to the UN Sustainability Development Goals. This review is included in the GRI index 2021 and is also included in external auditor's consistency check of Hydro's GRI index 2021.\n\nA more complete overview of Hydro's positive and negative impacts on each of the 17 SDGs, can be found at hydro.com.",

To fulfill this purpose, mandatory reporting requirements for both financial and non-financial companies have been developed. As a non-financial company Hydro reports on revenue (turnover), capital expenditure and operating expenses.\n\nRead more about Hydro's sustainability ambitions, targets and performance in the Environmental and social responsibility chapter.\n\nThe EU taxonomy climate and reporting delegated acts were published in June and July 2021, respectively, with the first stage of reporting requirements for non-financial companies applying from January 1, 2022, for 2021. This is a very short implementation phase, especially given the lack of guidelines available.

The relevant activities and associated thresholds for what constitutes both substantial contribution and significant harm are detailed in the annexes to the delegated acts on the environmental objectives of the taxonomy. The thresholds vary from activity to activity.\n\nfour objectives on water, circular economy, pollution prevention and biodiversity. More activities are planned for inclusion in the framework as it is further developed.\n\nFor 2021, all companies within the scope of the regulation have to report performance indicators on turnover (revenue), capital expenditure (Capex) and operational expenditure (Opex) related to taxonomy eligible activities, i.e activities covered by the taxonomy. For 2022, companies also have to report on the indicators for aligned activities, i.e. eligible activities meeting the technical screening criteria. The performance indicators are described in the section Measuring performance.\n\nAt the time of issuing this report, technical screening criteria for two of the six environmental objectives, climate change mitigation and adaptation, for about 100 activities have been finalized and published. The Environmental Delegated Act, to be published in the first half of 2022, will cover the remaining\n\n## OVERARCHING CONDITIONS\n\nSubstantially contribute to at least one of the objectives\n\nHydropower based primary aluminium production, secondary aluminium and renewable energy generation substantially contribute to climate change mitigation\n\nDo no significant harm to any of the five others\n\nWe believe it is reasonable to assume that our operations in Europe meet the criteria as long as they are within normal, lawful operations. Uncertainties relate to operations outside Europe as the criteria reference EU law.\n\nComply with minimum social safeguards\n\nWe undertake extensive work to ensure workers and other stakeholders' human and labor rights are respected throughout our activities, in adherence with best practice methodology",

Hydro also has a part-ownership in a primary aluminium producer in Qatar, reported as a joint venture and thus outside the scope of the taxonomy.\n\nTo make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, primary aluminium production facilities must meet the technical screening criteria set out in the taxonomy.\n\n## Manufacture of secondary aluminium\n\nThe manufacture of secondary aluminium is an eligible activity according to the taxonomy. Process scrap and postconsumer scrap are purchased from third parties for recycling into extrusion ingot. Standard ingot and alloying metal are added to meet customer specifications. Hydro has a portfolio of stand-alone recyclers, in addition to wall-to-wall recyclers alongside our extrusion plants.\n\nAll manufacturing of secondary aluminium is defined by the taxonomy as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation.\n\n## Identifying eligible activities\n\nOf the activities currently eligible in the EU taxonomy, three apply to Hydro:\n\n## Manufacture of primary aluminium\n\nThe manufacture of primary aluminium in Hydro is an eligible and transitional activity according to the EU taxonomy. The technical screening criteria refer to the production of liquid aluminium through electrolysis of alumina. However, liquid aluminium is rarely sold to third parties due to logistical challenges.\n\nHydro's primary aluminium plants have reduction facilities with potlines and casthouses, where liquid and remelted aluminium is cast to form value-added products such as extrusion ingot, primary foundry alloys, sheet ingot and wire rod, in addition to standard ingot. When cast into these products, alloying metals and externally purchased cold metal is added. The amount of cold metal added varies with market circumstances and available casthouse capacity.\n\nHydro has five fully-owned primary aluminum production facilities in Norway, aluminium production facilities operated\n\n## Hydropower production\n\nHydropower production is an eligible activity under the taxonomy. Hydro owns and operates 39 hydropower plants in Norway, with a combined installed capacity of 2.7 GWh.\n\nThe purpose of Hydro's hydropower assets is to secure a stable power supply to our primary aluminium plants located in Norway, and is therefore mainly used for internal consumption.\n\n## End-use contribution from Hydro's activities\n\nA range of the products we manufacture contribute to climate change mitigation as constituent parts of technologies, infrastructure and complex products needed in a lowcarbon society. Examples are battery casings used in the manufacture of electric vehicles, window frames contributing to energy-efficient buildings, and aluminium frames for solar panels. The taxonomy does not provide clear guidance on how to define eligibility in the supply chain of taxonomyeligible activities. Consequently, we have chosen to report for 2021 based on the taxonomy-eligible activities of primary and secondary aluminium production, rather than on end-use of the aluminium we produce.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Reporting delegated act gives some clear guidance and definitions, while other aspects of how the indicators are to be determined are left open to practice or for future regulation to fill in. The indicators are:\n\n- \u009f Capital expenditure\n- \u009f Turnover (revenue)\n- \u009f Operating expenditure\n\nThe three indicators are expressed as ratios, representing the relative share of Hydro's total amounts for these metrics that meets certain criteria.\n\nHydro's activities are linked to the boundaries of the reporting entity as defined by IFRS and described in the group financial statements, See Hydro's consolidation principles in Note 1.1 Reporting entity, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies to the Financial statements.\n\nIn combination, these indicators are intended by the taxonomy to express the company's activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable.\n\n## Revenue (turnover)\n\nThe revenue indicator is defined as follows:\n\nRevenue associated with eligible activities\n\nHydro's total revenue from the sale of products and services\n\nRevenue from the sale of products and services represents Hydro's total revenue from contracts with customers as specified in Note 5.1 Revenue from contracts with customers to the Financial statements. This amount excludes income (loss) from realized and unrealized changes in fair value of derivative instruments which is considered not eligible activities under the taxonomy.\n\nRevenue associated with eligible activities comprises the following elements from external revenues:\n\n- \u009f Revenue from sale of casthouse products to customers\n- \u009f Revenue from sale of liquid metal\n- \u009f The metal value of revenue from sale of extruded products\n- \u009f Revenue from sale of electricity\n\nHydro's eligible activities are primary aluminium production, secondary aluminium production and production of electricity. The output from these activities is partly sold directly to customers, partly upgraded to more advanced products for sale to customers through further processes not described in the taxonomy, and partly consumed in the production process.\n\nRevenue from sale of liquid metal is the direct output from the production of primary metal. No adjustments are made to the prices agreed with customers. The amount is limited as liquid metal cannot be stored or transported over longer distances.\n\nRevenue from the sale of casthouse products to customers is the most directly associated commercial product resulting from aluminium production, whether primary or secondary. The majority of the value of a casthouse product results from its aluminium content, while most products also contain alloying material to achieve the intended properties for use.\n\nAlloying material varies from less than 1% up to around 11%. The value of alloying materials is considered an integral part of the product and its value thus included in revenue from eligible activities. In production of casthouse products, in particular for recycling of post-consumer scrap, cold metal with a known purity is added to achieve the intended properties of the casthouse product. Purchased standard ingot is the primary source for this purpose. As this element is neither manufacture of primary nor secondary aluminium, the revenue is adjusted for the share of aluminium added on a tonnage basis. The eligible share of revenue from sale of casthouse products only covers the sale of aluminium produced by Hydro.\n\nMetal purchased for resale, including metal produced by the joint venture Qatalum, is excluded.\n\nThe metal value of revenue from sale of extruded products is included to reflect the similar value as for casthouse products. The metal value is calculated the same way as for casthouse products, also excluding the value of added cold metal whether in recyclers set up close by the extrusion plants, or\n\n## Analyze requirements\n\nThe reporting requirements for the financial year 2021 are limited to eligible activities. From 2022 onwards, Hydro is also required to report on the aligned share of revenue, CapEx and OpEx. In Hydro's Annual Report 2021 we are disclosing voluntary information on Hydro's preliminary analysis for the climate change mitigation objective how we are positioned to meet the criteria for substantial contribution and do no significant harm (DNSH), i.e the aligned share.\n\nPrimary aluminium based on renewable electricity will meet the substantial contribution criteria for manufacture of aluminium based on the smelters energy efficiency and GHG content in the electricity. All aluminium remelting activity qualifies for substantial contribution under the taxonomy's manufacture of secondary aluminium activity. We believe it is reasonable to assume that our operations in Europe meet the DNSH criteria for all environmental objectives as long as they are within normal, lawful operations, comply with emission permits to air and water, have performed environmental impact assessments and taken necessary action required. Hydro's major production sites have performed a climate risk and vulnerability assessment. Uncertainties relate to aluminium assets outside of Europe as the criteria reference EU law. Documentation requirements for hydropower production are substantial, and we are working together with other Norwegian hydropower producers to come to a common understanding for shared waterways.\n\nHydro's activities are carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards set out in the Regulation related to international minimum human and labor rights and standards. The taxonomy regulation defines the minimum rights and standards as being defined by the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, including the declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the eight fundamental conventions of the ILO and the International Bill of Human Rights.\n\nHydro undertakes extensive work to ensure workers and other stakeholders' human and labor rights are respected throughout our activities, in adherence with best practice methodology as described in the international standards and conventions listed in the taxonomy regulation. More information on our work on this can be found in the Human rights chapter.",

As a starting point, entire plants including associated and supporting functions are included. However, several of our aluminium smelters have on-site production of anodes, an activity that is not described in the taxonomy. Where a smelter has an associated anode production facility, these are excluded from investments in a smelter. For extrusion plants, the eligible share of CapEx covers the recycling facilities as such including furnaces and casthouse equipment. Extrusion presses, other facilities and support facilities mainly serving the extrusion activities are fully excluded from eligible CapEx.\n\nFor future reporting of the aligned share of CapEx, the aligned share is intended to include sustaining and expansion investments in activities meeting the criteria for aligned activities, as well as investments in activities that are not aligned which form part of a plan to meet the criteria within a period of a maximum of ten years.\n\nInvestments in activities that are not aligned at the time of investment, and where the activity as such will not become aligned, is not included as an aligned investment. That includes investments with the purpose of reducing the environmental footprint of activities, but not covered by the taxonomy. Such investments may cover significant reductions of CO2 or other emissions.\n\n## Operating expenditure\n\nThe OpEx indicator is defined as follows:\n\nSpecified operating expenses associated with eligible activities\n\nHydro's total estimated expenses from the specified functions\n\nHydro's total estimated expenses from the specified functions represent a sub-set of expenses presented, primarily in the line items Employee benefit expense and Other expenses in Hydro's income statements. Operating expenditure is described as a share of the expenses included in the subtotal EBIT in the income statement. The regulation requires us to report on expenses that represent direct non-capitalized costs that relate to the following functions:\n\n- \u009f building renovation measures\n- \u009f research and development\n- \u009f short-term lease\n- \u009f maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures\n\nrelating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets.\n\nResearch and development costs cover projects that do not meet the specific criteria for capitalization as intangible assets. Expenses include such items as employee benefits, use of research facilities including operating expenses and depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and external services both for specific services to projects managed internally, for outsourced projects managed by external parties as well as financing of initiatives conducted jointly with other companies or industry associations.\n\nBuilding renovation measures are currently of limited relevance to Hydro, as there are no significant such projects ongoing.\n\nShort-term leases and leases for low value assets are described in Note 2.6 Leases to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nMaintenance and repair expenses include Hydro's maintenance and repair cost not qualifying for capitalization as part of the relevant asset. The maintenance expenses are only partly captured in Hydro's financial reporting, as Hydro presents its operating expenses by nature of expenses and not by function. Repair and maintenance activities consist of employee expenses, consumables and spare parts, and various services. The total expenses related to these activities have been estimated based on management reporting in units and business areas, which is not necessarily fully consistent. Management considers the amounts to be a reasonable expression of such expenses in Hydro.\n\nHydro's total estimated expenses from the specified functions represent primarily the maintenance and day-to-day servicing costs for assets used in the eligible activities. In addition, research and development projects with the aim of improving production methods for primary and secondary aluminium are included as eligible activities.\n\nResearch and development activities aiming at improving mining methods, production methods for alumina and improved application of aluminium products, and which may have significant impact on reducing direct and indirect negative environmental impacts, is excluded from the metric as these processes are not currently covered in the taxonomy.\n\nin the primary smelters and separate recycling facilities also supplying the extrusion plants.\n\nThe value of upgrading the products through such processes as extruding profiles for customers' application, further fabrication of those profiles, surface treatment and other processes that might apply is also excluded.\n\nRevenue from sale of electricity consists of revenue from spot sales of daily excess production from Hydro's power plants in Norway above what is consumed in Hydro's own activities. To the extent Hydro sells power purchased from other producers, that revenue is excluded from the eligible share together with any revenue from power trading.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nThe CapEx indicator is defined as follows:\n\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment and to intangible assets for eligible activities\n\nHydro's total additions to property, plant and equipment and to intangible assets\n\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment represent the gross amount of purchase, development or lease as specified in Note 2.1 Property, plant and equipment to the Financial statements. It also includes the gross amount of purchase or development of intangible assets as specified in Note 2.2 Intangible assets.\n\nAny amount of gross additions to property, plant and equipment or intangibles resulting from business combinations is included in CapEx under this metric. Further, any lease capitalized is included with the addition (or reduction) required by IFRS.\n\nShort-term leases and small asset leases as well as variable lease payments are not recognized as fixed assets and are thus not included in this indicator. Any goodwill recognized in a business combination is not included in the indicator. Further, financial investments, including capital injections in associated companies and joint ventures, are excluded from the metric.\n\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment and to intangible assets for eligible activities include both sustaining investments in existing plants engaged in eligible activities",

The goals of the review were to achieve clear communication aligned with industry and peer practice and simplify where possible. This process resulted in Hydro deciding to focus on EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as the main performance measures going forward.\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nOn March 5, 2021, Hydro announced an agreement to sell its Hydro Rolling business to KPS Capital Partners. On June 1, 2021, the transaction was completed. See Note 1.5 in the 2021 Financial statements. Operating results for the Rolling business and the gain on disposal are presented net of financial items and tax as 'Income (loss) from discontinued operations' and separated from Hydro's reported EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. All prior periods income statements in the report have been reclassified accordingly. In addition, depreciation of property, plant and equipment for Hydro Rolling has been excluded from operating results in periods subsequent to the date of the agreement.\n\nAssets and liabilities related to the Rolling business are presented as assets held for sale in Hydro's consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2021.

Higher all-in metal and alumina prices, improved volumes upstream, and record high quarterly results from Hydro Energy, contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. These positive elements were partly offset by higher fixed and raw material costs upstream and negative currency effects.\n\nIn 2021, Hydro achieved an adjusted return on average capital employed of 18.6 percent, significantly higher than the 3.7 percent achieved in 2020, and above the ambition to deliver 10 percent over the cycle.\n\nThe global economy has rebounded to pre-crisis levels, however the pace of growth slowed in the fourth quarter amid the emergence of the Omicron variant, continued global supply-chain shortages, high energy prices, and concerns around inflation. There is increasing uncertainty around the outlook as post-recovery demand and policy supports continue to impact, driving supply chain shortages and inflationary pressures on key inputs, including energy, raw materials, and transportation costs. Hydro's top priority remains the health and safety of our people and the communities where we operate. Hydro continues to implement guidelines in accordance with national regulations in handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe three-month aluminium price increased during the fourth quarter, starting the quarter at USD 2,690 per mt and ending at USD 2,808 per mt. However, the LME price was very volatile trading between USD 2,555 per mt and USD 3,172 per mt as coal prices reached all-time high levels before declining prices caused aluminium prices to decrease at the end of the quarter. In early 2022, the LME was trading around USD 3,000 per mt.\n\nRising gas and power prices have led to an increase in production costs in Europe, followed by the curtailment of several European smelters, including Hydro's majority owned primary aluminium plant Slovalco in Slovakia. The capacity at Slovalco was reduced from 80 to 60 percent by mid-February, which constitutes an annual reduction of 35,000 tonnes of production.\n\nNordic power prices were significantly higher in the fourth quarter compared to the previous quarter. The high prices were due to colder than normal weather conditions and high and increasing continental power prices. Higher production and increased gain from price area differences significantly increased adjusted EBITDA for Hydro Energy for the quarter. The higher production resulted in net spot sales in the fourth quarter compared to a net spot purchase in the third quarter. Significant price area differences in the Nordic region have continued during the fourth quarter and have prevailed into early 2022.\n\nHydro's Capital Markets Day was held in December and new improvement targets as well as new sustainability ambitions were announced to strengthen Hydro in terms of both profitability and sustainability. Hydro continues to deliver on its 2025 strategy, including further strengthening its low-carbon aluminium position as well as maturing business opportunities within new energy solutions. The company increased its Improvement program target from NOK 7.4 billion to NOK 8.5 billion and Commercial ambition from NOK 1.5 billion to NOK 2.5 billion. For 2021, the Improvement program reached NOK 6.3 billion in improvements, exceeding the original annual target of NOK 5.1 billion. On the back of the strong markets, NOK 1.5 billion of commercial improvements were delivered by end 2021.\n\nHydro has long been recognized as a leader in sustainability, and the new sustainability ambitions launched at the Capital Markets Day will be a key driver for Hydro's competitive positioning going forward. Hydro has the ambition of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 or earlier and is pursuing three decarbonization paths to reduce the carbon footprint of aluminium to net zero. Hydro will have the first commercial volumes of near zero carbon product (defined as less than 0.5kg CO2 per kg aluminium) available in 2022 based on using 100 percent complex post-consumer scrap.\n\nThe decarbonization path for existing primary smelters is based on carbon capture and storage technology. In the fourth quarter, Hydro invested in the carbon capture and storage company, Verdox, which will deliver cost-efficient aluminum carbon capture technology and direct air capture technology for piloting from 2025, and with the aim of achieving industrial scale production by 2030.

Hydro Sunndal will continue to be a leading producer of Hydro REDUXA low-carbon aluminium to the automotive and building & construction segments.\n\nHydro Extrusions continues its efforts to restructure, optimize and commercially position its portfolio. In the fourth quarter, Hydro announced the divestment of its general extrusion operations in Kuppam, India to Hindalco Industries Limited for USD 33 million on a cash free and debt free basis. The sale was completed in early February 2022. Hydro Extrusions is also investing NOK 390 million in a new extrusion press at its aluminium manufacturing plant in Suzhou, China which will serve China's growing automotive and electric vehicle market.\n\nIn the new energy area, Hydro continued to mature business opportunities. In the fourth quarter, Hydro Rein and Eolus entered partnership to jointly develop up to 672 MW of Swedish wind power. As part of the transaction, Hydro Rein will acquire 50 percent of the portfolio from Eolus, who will retain the remaining 50 percent.\n\nFurthermore, Hydro Havrand, Hydro's green hydrogen company, and Shell New Energies Holding Europe B.V. agreed to explore potential for joint projects producing hydrogen from renewable electricity. The ambition is to use the hydrogen to help decarbonize Hydro's and Shell's own operations, and to supply customers in heavy industries, the maritime sector and road transport.\n\nIn Batteries, Hydro became the largest owner in the maritime battery company, Corvus Energy, through a private placement, increasing their ownership share to 22.7 percent.\n\nCompared to the third quarter 2021, Hydro's adjusted EBITDA increased from NOK 7,219 million to NOK 9,011 million in the fourth quarter 2021. Higher all-in metal and alumina prices and better results from Hydro Energy contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. This improvement was partly offset by higher raw material costs and fixed costs.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year 2021 increased compared to 2020. Higher all-in metal and alumina prices, improved volumes upstream, improved margins and volumes in Hydro Extrusions, and better results from Hydro Energy, contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. These positive elements were partly offset by higher raw material and fixed costs upstream\n\nand negative currency effects.\n\nNet income from continuing operations amounted to NOK 8,525 million in the fourth quarter. In addition to the factors described above, Net income from continuing operations included a net foreign exchange gain of NOK 823 million, a NOK 2,744 million unrealized gain on power and raw material contracts and a NOK 744 million unrealized gain on LME related contracts.\n\nHydro's net debt 1) position decreased from NOK 1.2 billion to a net cash position of NOK 3.2 billion at the end of the quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in short-term and long-term collateral 2) and excluding purchases of money market funds 3) amounted to NOK 7.5 billion. Net cash used in investment activities, excluding short term investments, amounted to NOK 2.8 billion.\n\nAdjusted net debt decreased from NOK 10.5 billion to NOK 7.0 billion, largely driven by an improvement in the net cash position and a decrease in collateral requirements. The collateral requirements amounted to NOK 5.3 billion at the end of the quarter, mainly relating to strategic and operational hedging positions.\n\nHydro held NOK 22.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, NOK 1.0 billion in time deposits and NOK 1.4 billion in money market funds, included in short-term investments, at the end of the fourth quarter. Time deposits and money market funds are normally available at short notice. The revolving credit facility of USD 1.6 billion was fully available at the end of the quarter.\n\nHydro's ambition is to pay attractive dividends to shareholders. In light of the strong financial performance in 2021, and reflecting our robust balance sheet, the Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of NOK 5.40 per share, equal to 80 percent of adjusted net income for 2021. The proposed dividend represents a combination of 50 percent ordinary dividends and 30 percent extraordinary dividends. Final distribution for 2021 is subject to approval by the Annual General meeting on May 10, 2022.\n\nUSD 20 million, and will have a minority ownership position.\n\nHydro also made a final build decision to invest BRL 1.3 billion at the Alunorte alumina refinery, Brazil, to carry out a fuel-switch project, to replace heavy fuel oil with natural gas. The project will start in first quarter of 2022 and is expected to be in operation in 2023. The fuel switch will reduce the refinery's annual CO2 emissions by 700,000 tonnes and is a key enabler for Hydro's climate ambitions and global commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition to the climate targets, Hydro has strengthened the ambitions to protect biodiversity and reduce environmental footprint. Additionally, Hydro's seeks to improve the lives and livelihoods where the company operates. In the fourth quarter, The Global Child Forum ranked Hydro at the top of global metals & mining companies on child rights.\n\nRecycling is one of Hydro's main growth areas. and in the fourth quarter a number of investment decision were announced supporting the strategic ambition to grow the current recycling business substantially across the recycling value chain, and to double post-consumer scrap usage.\n\nIn Michigan, US, Hydro will invest in the construction of a new aluminium recycling plant producing 120,000 tonnes of aluminium extrusion ingot per year. In Norway, Hydro will invest NOK 105 million to establish H\u00f8yanger Recycling, a dedicated aluminium recycling facility located by the Hydro H\u00f8yanger primary aluminium smelter. In Hungary, Hydro will build a new aluminium remelt facility, and the new facility will be built at Hydro's aluminium extrusion plant in Szekesfehervar with an annual capacity of 90,000 tonnes. Also, Hydro made the decision to further invest in the Deeside recycling plant in the UK to increase the plant's aluminium recycling capacity to 70,000 tonnes per year, providing UK customers with low-carbon aluminium such as Hydro CIRCAL.\n\nOver the next 5 years, Hydro expects another doubling of sales volumes for greener products as the company is positioning the recycling portfolio to meet increasing demand for Hydro CIRCAL. In 2022, volumes for Hydro CIRCAL is expected to increase 25 percent compared to 2021. Additionally, Hydro is positioning its smelter portfolio to meet expected demand for Hydro REDUXA. In 2022, Hydro REDUXA volumes are expected to increase 30 percent compared to 2021. In Norway, Hydro will invest NOK 750",

Guinea, Australia and Indonesia accounted for most of China's bauxite imports in the period. In Guinea, bauxite mining and shipping operations have so far not been impacted by the military coup in September.\n\nThe average Chinese bauxite import price was USD 52 per mt CIF in the fourth quarter 2021, up from USD 44 per mt CIF in the fourth quarter 2020.\n\n## Primary aluminium\n\nThe three-month aluminium price increased during the fourth quarter of 2021, starting the quarter at USD 2,690 per mt and ending at USD 2,808 per mt. The average price for the quarter was USD 2,784 per mt. The LME price was volatile during the quarter, trading between USD 2,555 per mt and USD 3,172 per mt driven by significant energy price fluctuations. In addition, rising gas and power prices have led to an increase in production costs in Europe, resulting in the curtailment of several European smelters. During January the LME was trading around USD 3,000 per mt.\n\nEuropean duty paid standard ingot premiums ended the fourth quarter at USD 405 per mt, up from USD 375 per mt at the end of the third quarter, supported by smelter curtailments in Europe. The US Midwest premium was down USD 96 per mt during the quarter, reaching an all-time high on growing market tightness, but subsequently decreased in line with LME prices, ending at USD 665 per mt.\n\nShanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) prices decreased by USD 51 per mt ex. VAT during the fourth quarter, ending at USD 2,833 per mt ex VAT. Average price for the quarter was up USD 210 per mt ex. VAT compared to the third quarter.\n\nGlobal primary aluminium consumption was up 2 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, limited by a decrease of 1 percent in China. Overall global demand for primary aluminium recovered in 2021, leading to a significant tighter market than 2020. External sources 1) estimate a deficit between 0.4 million mt and 1.2 million mt for 2021, in large parts due to very strong demand globally and widespread supply cuts in China. For 2022, global primary aluminium\n\n## Platts PAX development\n\nUSD/mt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## LME price (3 month aluminium)\n\nUSD/mt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market developments and outlook\n\n## Covid-19 pandemic and macroeconomic effects\n\nGlobal GDP growth was around 5 percent in 2021. The global economy has rebounded to pre-crisis levels during the second quarter, however the pace of growth slowed in the fourth quarter amid the emergence of the Omicron variant, continued global supply-chain shortages, high energy prices, and concerns around inflation. The rate of growth hides regional discrepancies, with the Eurozone experiencing the most pronounced reduction whereas the US recovery is more mature and less volatile. External sources estimate global economic growth in 2022 will be 4-5 percent.\n\nThere is increasing uncertainty around the outlook as postrecovery demand and policy supports continue to impact, driving supply chain shortages and inflationary pressures on a range of key inputs, including energy, raw materials, and transportation costs. This has led to increased focus on inflation with many central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, now indicating policy tightening. Covid-19 developments and Russia-Ukraine tensions adds to the uncertainty.\n\n## Bauxite & alumina\n\nThe average Platts alumina index increased in the fourth quarter of 2021 to USD 412 per mt, compared to USD 327 per mt in the third quarter 2021. The Platts alumina index reached its annual high in mid-October at USD 484 per mt driven by a potential alumina deficit as certain Chinese provinces requested refineries curtail production to reduce energy consumption. The Platts alumina index declined to USD 345 at the end of December, driven by decreasing Chinese alumina prices after Chinese authorities intervened to control coal prices. In addition, primary smelter curtailments in Europe, due to record high energy prices, contributed to reclining demand in the Atlantic basin. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, the average Platts alumina index was 46 percent higher.\n\nChina's net alumina imports reached 622 kmt in the fourth quarter 2021 compared to 814 kmt in the same period in 2020. Australia accounted for 60 percent of Chinese alumina imports in the period with Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Indonesia accounting for most of the rest.\n\nChina imported 26 million mt of bauxite in the fourth quarter",

The transport segment continues to be supported by strong orders, with trailer industry build rates expected to increase 29 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year. However, automotive build rates have decreased 14 percent in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, as light vehicle and heavy truck production continue to be impacted by labour and semiconductor shortages.\n\nCRU estimates that the North American demand for extruded products will increase by around 10 percent for the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter last year. Overall, extrusion demand is estimated to increase by 6 percent in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\n## Energy\n\nNordic power prices were significantly higher compared to same quarter last year and the previous quarter. The high prices were due to colder than normal weather conditions and high and increasing continental power prices. The increase in continental power prices were influenced by rising carbon, gas and coal prices. Drier conditions and export capacity to UK and the continent continues to support higher prices in southern Norway compared to the rest of the Nordic area. Significant price area differences in the Nordic region have continued during the fourth quarter and have prevailed into early 2022.\n\nThe Nordic hydrological balance ended the quarter around 17 TWh below normal, compared to around 18 TWh below normal at the end of the previous quarter and 19 TWh above normal at the end of last year. Hydropower reservoirs in Norway were at 55.9 percent of full capacity at the end of the quarter, which is 12.1 percentage points below the normal level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Premiums\n\n## Energy spot price NOK/MWh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- n System price\n- n NO2 price (Kristiansand)\n- n NO3 price (Molde, Trondheim)\n\ndemand is expected to increase by 2-3 percent and aluminium production is expected to increase by 1-2 percent, resulting in a continued global deficit in 2022.\n\nThe European consumption of extrusion ingot and sheet ingot increased in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period 2020. Consumption of PFA decreased in the fourth quarter 2021 mainly due to the negative impact of the semiconductor shortage on automotive production.\n\nTotal global stocks at the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 were estimated to be 9.7 million mt, down from 10.0 million tonnes in the third quarter and down 1.1 million mt compared to the fourth quarter 2020.\n\n## Extruded products\n\nEuropean demand for extrusions is estimated to have increased 2 percent during the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter last year, and decreased 3 percent compared to the third quarter of 2021 mainly driven by seasonality. Underlying demand has continued to perform well across key segments, especially for the industrial and the building & construction segments. Commercial building & construction, although supported by public sector spending, is impacted by weaker orders, while the residential sector is experiencing strong demand supported by refurbishing. Demand in the industrial segment continues to advance in line with improving industrial production. Automotive demand continues to be negatively impacted by shortage of semiconductors and overall supply-chain issues, constraining automotive production for large OEMs. However, premium cars and electric vehicles which are typically more aluminium intensive are relatively less impacted.\n\nCRU estimates that the European demand for extruded products will decline 4 percent in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter last year. Overall, extrusion demand is estimated to increase by 3 percent in 2022 compared to 2021, but dependent on improved automotive demand in the second half of 2022.\n\nNorth American extrusion demand is estimated to have increased 7 percent during the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter last year, but decreasing 3 percent compared to the third quarter of 2021, partly due to increased labor shortages. Demand has continued to remain strong across key segments, particularly building & construction and transportation. Residential construction",

Based on the elements approved, Hydro has concluded that an estimated compensation for aluminium produced and sold in 2021 can be recognized. An amount of compensation reflecting the uncertainty has been recognized in the interim result.\n\nNegotiations are ongoing in the European Parliament and among the EU member states on Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and the EU Emission Trading System (ETS). CBAM is prioritized by the French EU presidency and they are moving towards a conclusion in the Council before summer. Next phase will be trilogue negotiations between representatives of the Parliament, the Council, and the Commission, additional rules will have to be detailed out after an agreement has been reached. The revision of the ETS is in a similar process as CBAM, and also closely linked as it represents the carbon pricing system that CBAM is to be built on. The high energy price situation, with also record high CO2 prices, is underlining the need for efficient carbon leakage protection as well as framework conditions that enable green growth in Europe.\n\nThe Aluminium industry is still experiencing price volatilities and availability uncertainties of alloying materials like silicon\n\n## Additional factors impacting Hydro\n\nThe accumulated LME hedge in Hydro as of December 31, 2021 amounted to 430 thousand tonnes for the remainder of 2022, 460 thousand tonnes for 2023 and 20 thousand tonnes for 2024. This has been achieved using both commodity derivatives and currency derivatives. Parts of the raw material exposure is also hedged, using both fixed price physical contracts and financial derivatives. Further hedges of 30 thousand tonnes for 2022 and 80 thousand tonnes for 2024 were executed during January and February.\n\nThe total USD/BRL hedge in place at Alunorte and Albras amounts to approximately USD 350 million per year for 2022 and 2023 and USD 170 million for 2024.\n\nAluminium Metal has sold forward around 60 percent of its expected primary aluminium production for the first quarter of 2022 at a price level of around USD 2,625 per mt 1) .\n\nHydro has assessed the changes made to the CO2 compensation scheme in Norway for the period 2021 to 2030.

Hydro has secured alloy supply for first half of 2022.\n\nOne of the four production lines at Hydro's part-owned aluminium plant Albras in Brazil was shut down on February 19, 2022, due to an internal power distribution failure. The affected potline produces 110,000 tonnes of liquid aluminium annually. The other three lines at Albras were not affected and are running as normal.",

In addition, results were negatively impacted by costs related to the scrapping of assets totaling NOK 332 million in non-recurring costs, following a review of the fixed asset register.\n\nCompared to third quarter 2021 the adjusted EBITDA was lower mainly due to seasonally lower sales volumes and higher fixed, variable costs and costs related to the scrapping of assets, partly offset by higher margins.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2021 increased compared to last year due to increased sales volumes and higher margins partly offset by higher variable and fixed cost costs as operations returned to normal levels and non-recurring costs of NOK 517 million related to the scrapping of assets. In addition, results for the full year 2020 were positively impacted by insurance compensation of NOK 496 million related to the cyber-attack in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The increase was mainly due to higher prices, increased gain from price area differences, and a change in the power contract portfolio including positive effects from the expiration of a legacy purchase contract. This is partly offset by a negative impact from significantly lower production. The gain from price area differences is mainly due to the sale of power at spot prices from our Hydro power plants in Southwest Norway (NO2, NO5) at higher prices than the purchase of power at spot prices required to cover Energy's delivery commitments to our primary aluminium plants located in Mid-Norway (NO3).\n\nCompared to the last quarter the Adjusted EBITDA increased significantly mainly due to higher production and increased gain from price area differences. The higher production resulted in net spot sales in the fourth quarter compared to a net spot purchase in the third quarter.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year 2021 increased significantly compared to 2020. The increase was mainly due to higher prices, increased gain from price area differences, and a significant change in the power contract portfolio including positive effects from the expiration of a legacy purchase contract. This was partly offset mainly by lower production, and lower commercial results.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Financial APMs are intended to enhance comparability of the results and cash flows from period to period, and it is Hydro's experience that these are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties. Management also uses these measures internally to drive performance in terms of long-term target setting and as basis for performance related pay. These measures are adjusted IFRS measures defined, calculated and used in a consistent and transparent manner over the years and across the company where relevant. Operational measures such as, but not limited to, volumes, prices per mt, production costs and improvement programs are not defined as financial APMs. To provide a better understanding of the company's underlying financial performance for the relevant period, Hydro focuses on adjusted EBITDA in the discussions on periodic adjusted financial and operating results and liquidity from the business areas and the group, while adjusting effects excluded to EBITDA, EBIT and net income (loss) are discussed separately. Financial APMs should not be considered as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with IFRS. Disclosures of APMs are subject to established internal control procedures.\n\n## Hydro's financial APMs\n\n- \u00b7 EBIT: Income (loss) before tax, financial income and expense.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBIT: EBIT +/- identified adjusting items to EBIT as described below.\n- \u00b7 EBITDA: EBIT + depreciation, amortization and impairments, net of investment grants.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA: EBITDA +/- identified adjusting items to EBITDA as described below.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations: Net income (loss) from continuing operations +/- adjusting items to net income (loss) as described below.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations: Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Hydro shareholders divided by weighted average number of outstanding shares (ref.: the interim financial statements).\n- \u00b7 Investments: Additions to property, plant and equipment (capital expenditures) plus long-term securities, intangible assets, long-term advances and investments in equity accounted investments, including amounts recognized in business combinations for continuing operations.\n- \u00b7 Net cash (debt): Short- and long-term interest-bearing debt and Hydro's liquidity positions\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net cash (debt): Net cash (debt) adjusted for liquidity positions regarded unavailable for servicing debt, pension Aluminium Metal specific adjustment to EBITDA:\n- \u00b7 Qatalum 50% pro rata represent an adjustment to illustrate Hydro's share of EBITDA in Qatalum rather than Hydro's share of net income in Qatalum. The adjustment reflects the relevant elements of Qatalum's results as included in Hydro's income statement.\n- \u00b7 Metal Markets specific adjustments to EBITDA:\n- \u00b7 Currency effects include the effects of changes in currency rates on sales and purchase contracts denominated in foreign currencies (mainly US dollar and Euro for our European operations) and the effects of changes in currency rates on the fair valuation of derivative contracts (including LME futures) and inventories mainly translated into Norwegian kroner. Hydro manages its external currency exposure on a consolidated basis in order to take advantage of offsetting positions\n- \u00b7 Inventory valuation effects comprise hedging gains and losses relating to inventories. Increasing LME prices result in unrealized hedging losses, while the offsetting gains on physical inventories are not recognized until realized. In period of declining prices, unrealized hedging gains are offset by write-downs of physical inventories.\n\n\u00b7\n\n## Adjusting items to EBITDA, EBIT, net income (loss) and earnings per share\n\nHydro has defined two categories of items which are adjusted to results in all business areas, equity accounted investments and at group level. One category is the timing effects, which are unrealized changes to the market value of certain derivatives. When realized, effects of changes in the market values since the inception are included in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT. Changes in the market value of trading portfolios are included in adjusted results. The other category includes material items which are not regarded as part of underlying business performance for the period, such as major rationalization charges and closure costs, effects of disposals of businesses and operating assets, major impairments of property, plant and equipment, as well as other major effects of a special nature, and realized effects of currency derivatives entered into for risk management purposes. Materiality is defined as items with a value above NOK 20 million. All adjusting items to results are reflecting a reversal of transactions or other effects recognized in the financial statements for the current period. Part-owned entities have implemented similar adjustments.\n\n- \u00b7 Unrealized derivative effects on LME related contracts include unrealized gains and losses on contracts measured at market value, which are used for operational hedging purposes related to future expected sales and purchase transactions, both fixed-price customer and supplier contracts and transactions at not yet determined market prices. Also includes elimination of changes in fair value of certain internal physical aluminium contracts.\n- \u00b7 Unrealized derivative effects on power and raw material contracts include unrealized gains and losses on embedded derivatives in raw material and power contracts for Hydro's own use and for financial power contracts used for risk management purposes, as well as elimination of changes in fair value of embedded derivatives within certain internal power contracts.\n- \u00b7 Significant rationalization charges and closure costs include costs related to specifically defined major projects, and not considered to reflect periodic performance in the individual plants or operations. Such costs involve termination benefits, dismantling of installations and buildings, clean-up activities that exceed legal liabilities, etc. Costs related to regular and continuous improvement initiatives are included in adjusted results.\n- \u00b7 Significant community contributions Brazil refers to the provision recognized in relation to Alunorte's TAC and TC agreements with the Government of Par\u00e0 and Minist\u00e8rio P\u00f9blico made on September 5, 2018, including later cost adjustments and certain similar agreements.\n- \u00b7 Other effects include insurance proceeds covering asset damage, legal settlements, etc. Insurance proceeds covering lost income or expenses incurred in the same or a prior period are included in adjusted results.\n- \u00b7 Pension includes recognition of pension plan amendments and related curtailments and settlements.\n- \u00b7 Transaction related effects reflect the (gains) losses on divested of businesses and individual assets, the net remeasurement (gains) losses relating to previously owned shares in acquired business as well as inventory valuation expense related to acquisitions.\n- \u00b7 Adjusting items in equity accounted investments reflects Hydro's share of items excluded from adjusted net income Qatalum and are based on Hydro's definitions, including both timing effects and material items not regarded as part of underlying business performance for the period.\n- \u00b7 Impairment charges (PP&E, intangible assets and equity accounted investments) relate to significant write-downs of assets or groups of assets to estimated recoverable amounts in the event of an identified loss in value. Gains from reversal of impairment charges are also adjusted for.\n- \u00b7 Realized foreign exchange gain (loss) on risk management instruments represents such items as foreign currency derivatives entered into and managed to mitigate currency risk in the production margin, i.e. the difference between sales price for products such as aluminium or alumina versus the cost of raw materials and energy used in production. Realized embedded currency derivatives in certain power contracts in Norway denominated in Euro are also adjusted for. Such currency effects are included in currency gains and losses in finance expense in the income statement, and included in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT.\n- \u00b7 Net foreign exchange (gain) loss: Realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and payable, funding and deposits, embedded currency derivatives and forward currency contracts purchasing and selling currencies that hedge net future cash flows from operations, sales contracts and operating capital, with the exceptions of the realized foreign currency exchange gain (loss) on risk management instruments mentioned above.\n- \u00b7 Calculated income tax effect: In order to present adjusted net income from continuing operations on a basis comparable with our adjusted operating performance, the adjusted income taxes include adjustments for the expected taxable effects on adjusting items to income before tax.\n- \u00b7 Other adjustments to net income from continuing operations include other major financial and tax related effects not regarded as part of the business performance of the period.",

Management views this measure as providing additional understanding of the rate of return on investments over time in each of its capital intensive businesses and in the operating results of its business segments. RoaCE is calculated as adjusted EBIT after tax divided by average Capital employed for the respective period. The definition of capital employed was amended during 2021 to be consistent with the amended definition of Net cash (debt), and excludes long-term collateral.\n\nCapital employed for 2021 excludes Assets held for sale and Liabilities in disposal groups, as results from the divested Hydro Rolling business is separately reported as Income (loss) from discontinued operations. Capital employed and RoaCE for 2020 includes the divested Rolling business as reported in the 2020 annual report. This is consistent with the classification of the business in the years reported for.\n\n## RoaCE\n\n|                                | Reported   | Reported   | Adjusted   | Adjusted   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| NOK million                    | 2021       | 2020       | 2021       | 2020       |\n| EBIT                           | 17,887     | 7,332      | 20,786     | 6,051      |\n| Adjusted Income tax expense 1) | (4,314)    | (2,366)    | (5,255)    | (2,640)    |\n| EBIT after tax                 | 13,572     | 4,966      | 15,531     | 3,411      |\n\n## Capital Employed\n\n| NOK million 2)                                    | December 31 2021   | September 30 2021   | June 30 2021   | March 31 2021   | December 31 2020  Restated   | September 30 2020  Restated   | June 30 2020  Restated   | March 31 2020  Restated   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Current assets in continuing operations 3)        | 46,027             | 39,689              | 36,952         | 48,508          | 38,326                       | 40,109                        | 39,984                   | 48,122                    |\n| Property, plant and equipment                     | 54,605             | 54,642              | 56,353         | 53,890          | 64,245                       | 68,657                        | 70,478                   | 77,909                    |\n| Other non-current assets 4)                       | 42,250             | 42,144              | 41,951         | 39,749          | 40,072                       | 34,176                        | 35,159                   | 39,377                    |\n| Current liabilities (in continuing operations) 5) | (33,140)           | (27,277)            | (25,494)       | (33,764)        | (24,300)                     | (21,524)                      | (20,414)                 | (26,329)                  |\n| Non-current liabilities 5)                        | (24,574)           | (27,020)            | (24,643)       | (22,402)        | (33,104)                     | (34,658)                      | (33,179)                 | (36,712)                  |\n| Adjusted for Assets held for sale 6)              |                    |                     |                | (17,069)        |                              |                               |                          |                           |\n| Adjusted for Liabilities in disposal group 6)     |                    |                     |                | 12,266          |                              |                               |                          |                           |\n| Capital employed                                  | 85,167             | 82,177              | 85,119         | 81,178          | 85,239                       | 86,760                        | 92,027                   | 102,367                   |\n\n## Return on average Capital Employed (RoaCE) 7)\n\nReported\n\nAdjusted\n\n|       | 2021   | 2020   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Hydro | 16.3%  | 5.4%   | 18.6%  | 3.7%   |\n\n- 1) Adjusted Income tax expense is based on reported and adjusted tax expense adjusted for tax on financial items.\n\n.\n\n- 2) Previous periods have been restated following a change to the capital employed definition in 2021.\n\n.\n\n- 3) Excluding cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n- 4) Excluding long-term collateral related to strategic and operational hedging activities.\n- 5) Excluding interest-bearing debt.\n- 6) Adjustment to exclude Hydro Rolling, since Rolling is separately reported as Income (loss) from discontinued operations and is not included in EBIT.\n\n.\n\n- 7) Average Capital Employed measured over the last 4 quarters to reflect the return for the full year.",

Various factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in a forwardlooking statement or affect the extent to which a particular projection is realized. Factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: our continued ability to reposition and restructure our upstream and downstream businesses; changes in availability and cost of energy and raw materials; global supply and demand for aluminium and aluminium products; world economic growth, including rates of inflation and industrial production; changes in the relative value of currencies and the value of commodity contracts; trends in Hydro's key markets and competition; and legislative, regulatory and political factors.\n\nNo assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Hydro disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.",
