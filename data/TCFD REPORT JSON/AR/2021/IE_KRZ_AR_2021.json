Delivering consumer-preferred taste, while also improving the nutritional profile of food and beverage products, is where Kerry excels.\n\nThe past couple of years has seen the importance of health and sustainability increase amongst consumers, customers and indeed all stakeholders. The collective corporate willingness to work together to do better for people and planet has never been as strong. Kerry is exceptionally well positioned to play a key role in the drive towards a more sustainable food and beverage ecosystem. The impact Kerry is delivering in conjunction with its customers in enhancing the taste, nutrition and sustainability profile of food and beverage products that are consumed every day across the globe is remarkable. This is testament to how Kerry's purpose and vision have been embedded throughout the organisation in recent years.\n\n## Significant Strategic Progress\n\nKerry's evolution and industryleading capabilities were presented at a virtual Capital Markets Day during the year. The Executive Team outlined Kerry's unique strategic positioning, strong leadership positions and future growth strategies. The Group also presented its updated financial targets for the period 2022 to 2026.\n\nThe Group completed a number of important strategic developments during the year as Kerry continues to evolve its portfolio to strengthen its position as a market leading Taste & Nutrition company. The acquisition of Niacet enhances Kerry's leadership position in food protection and preservation. The Group also completed the sale of its Consumer Foods Meats and Meals business, and I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the Board to thank all of the 4,500 employees who worked in those businesses for their contribution to Kerry over many years.\n\nThe Group will continue to pursue organic and acquisitive growth opportunities aligned with the Group's strategic priorities and key growth platforms of Authentic Taste, Plant-based, Food Waste and Health & Bio-Pharma.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nIn 2020, the Group announced its 2030 sustainability strategy Beyond the Horizon , which underpins Kerry's future growth as it continues to partner with its customers across the globe to create a world of sustainable nutrition. At the Capital Markets Day in October, the Group announced a higher carbon reduction target, while also enhancing its diversity, inclusion and belonging commitments.\n\nThe Board, through the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee, contributed to, reviewed and approved the significant sustainability developments actioned in 2021. This year for the first time, climate related disclosures, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), are outlined on pages 68-74.\n\nThe Group will also publish in 2022 its first GRI Sustainability Report alongside the Annual Report which will detail the Group's progress against its sustainability strategy and targets in line with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards.",

During 2021, the Board reviewed the Company's corporate governance policies and procedures to monitor compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code and with latest best practice developments. We also engaged with our stakeholders during the year as we believe listening to their views and needs is fundamental to building a sustainable business. Further details of our stakeholder engagement activities are outlined on pages 99-104.\n\nEach year the Board undertakes a formal evaluation of its effectiveness and that of its committees. In 2021 this was an internal self-assessment which concluded that the Board and its Committees are performing effectively.\n\n## Board Changes\n\nJinlong Wang joined the Board as a non-Executive Director on 5 January 2021 and Joan Garahy retired from the Board following the Company's Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2021. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Joan for her contribution and service to the organisation. I am delighted to welcome Michael Kerr and Fiona Dawson who joined the Board as non-Executive Directors on 3 May 2021 and 4 January 2022 respectively. I look forward to both of them making significant contributions to the Board in the years ahead.\n\nGerard Culligan and Con Murphy will retire from the Board at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM and will not seek re-election. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Gerard and Con for their strong contribution over the last five years.\n\nAs part of the ongoing Board refreshment process, the Governance, Nomination & Sustainability Committee will continue its search for suitable candidates to join the Board in the context of the Group's diversity commitments.\n\n## Purpose and Values\n\nOur Purpose, Inspiring Food, Nourishing Life, and our Values of Courage, Enterprising Spirit, Inclusiveness, Open-mindedness and Ownership guide our actions and behaviours, keeping us on the right path toward achieving a world of sustainable nutrition. During 2021, the Board has continued to ensure that management promote our purpose and values to unite the organisation across diverse cultures and geographies. Staying true to our purpose as the organisation has continued to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, has shown the extraordinary agility, compassion and resilience of our people, operating in difficult circumstances, to do the right thing for our customers, our shareholders, our communities and the environment, and this will enable us to continue the Group's evolution in the years ahead.\n\n## People and Engagement\n\nCentral to Kerry's continued success is the hard work and commitment of all our employees. The Board is proud of the response of our employees to the challenges we faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Board also recognises the importance of employee engagement and continues to enhance its employee engagement activities. During 2021, Tom Moran, the designated Workforce Engagement Director, engaged in a detailed programme of activities where he had the opportunity to gauge the engagement levels of our people supporting our business, both in-person within our offices or sites and remotely. Tom has also participated in various employee events across the business, gaining a more in-depth understanding of how Kerry continues to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and is adapting to new ways of working.\n\nAs a result of ongoing restrictions during the year, all events were held virtually and details of these activities are outlined in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 96-108.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board recommends a final dividend of 66.7 cent per share (an increase of 10.1% on the 2020 final dividend) payable on 6 May 2022 to shareholders registered on the record date of 8 April 2022. Together with the interim dividend of 28.5 cent per share, this brings the total dividend for the year to 95.2 cent, an increase of 10.1% on 2020.\n\n## Prospects\n\nThe Board remains confident that the Group's business model, strategic priorities and key growth platforms will continue to deliver shareholder value and benefit our other stakeholders in the years to come. Kerry will continue to pursue organic and acquisitive growth opportunities and the Group's balance sheet is well placed to support our objectives. The view of management regarding the business outlook for 2022 is presented in the Chief Executive Officer's Review.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to sincerely thank Edmond and the Executive Management team for their exceptional leadership and thank everyone throughout the organisation for their contribution to the ongoing success of the Group.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHaving served ten years on the Board, I will retire as Chairman and as a Director of the Company at the upcoming AGM. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Board, our employees and all our shareholders for their support during my years on the Board and as Chairman. Finally, I wish my successor Tom Moran the very best as he assumes the Chairmanship of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhilip Toomey Chairman 15 February 2022",

The strategic priorities of Taste, Nutrition and Emerging Markets comprise Kerry's overarching strategic framework.

This will be achieved by partnering with our customers to create products that are better for people, society and the planet. This is how we support our customers to move along the sustainable nutrition spectrum.\n\nAs part of our Beyond the Horizon sustainability strategy, we announced enhanced sustainability commitments at our Capital Markets Day. We increased our emissions reduction target to align with a 1.5\u00baC temperature pathway, which has increased our target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction from 33% to 55% by 2030. CREATING A WORLD OF SUSTAINABLE NUTRITION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarket conditions have been highly dynamic across the year, with a strong overall demand environment combined with high degrees of variability across geographies and channels. At home consumption remained strong, with foodservice improving as consumers embraced the opportunities for more out-of-home social engagement and food consumption.\n\nThe extent of consumer demands continues to increase in areas such as plant-based, functional food for specific health requirements, taste without compromise, and products with an improved sustainability impact. These heightened and complex consumer demands are presenting greater challenges for our customers, as they continue to balance these with current industry labour and supply chain dynamics. This is leading to the need for a greater level of support from value-add partners and increasing the level of collaborative innovation in our industry.",

Over the last few years, we have been deploying our Kerry Management Effectiveness programme and the impact is now being reflected in our 2021 results with our people's experience of management effectiveness increasing across all survey dimensions. This year our Virtual Leadership Academy has contributed to this enhanced feedback, through providing coaching to our leaders, combined with access to thought leadership content and world class business school programmes to enhance their leadership impact, and support them in creating more positive team environments that value, encourage and support inclusivity. In addition, during 2021 we increased our investment in our learning academies and have elevated our focus on building functional capabilities in our sales, foundational technologies, integrated operations, marketing and finance areas to deliver on our strategic priorities.\n\nOur relentless drive to make it easier for our people is reflected in the introduction of a core communication platform - Workplace. We now have more than 10,000 colleagues actively using this tool to better communicate, connect, collaborate, and build community throughout Kerry. In our commercial teams we have introduced Agile ways of working to improve sales effectiveness and to launch a new customer self-serve portal. Our drive for operational excellence continues through our Plant Transformation programme, helping us to build and sustain consistent excellence across all manufacturing sites.\n\nFurther to feedback from our 2020 employee engagement survey, we launched our Kerry global employee recognition programme in 2021 - Inspiring People. This reinforces recognition in line with our values, underpinning our Kerry culture and supporting all the actions we have taken in relation to evolving our leadership and people management capabilities. We are confident this will continue to improve overall employee engagement in Kerry during 2022.\n\nThroughout 2021 we have continued our engagement focus on Leadership, Talent Management and Simplification and we will continue to build on these priorities globally in 2022, incorporating specific feedback from 2021. Our functional, regional and plant teams will continue to ensure that our engagement action plans are relevant and impactful at a local level.\n\nIn 2021 we established our Inclusion Index, as an integral component of our employee engagement survey - this is a measure of our ability to foster a truly inclusive workplace. Through this Index we will begin to monitor progress against our goal to become a top quartile employer in terms of inclusion, and target improvement efforts year-on-year to achieve this. Our Inclusion Index covers five externally researched and validated dimensions of inclusion - Fair Treatment, Trust, Psychological Safety, Integrating Differences and Belonging - which are embedded within our employee engagement survey. Collectively, these dimensions provide additional insights into how we are leveraging diversity in Kerry to increase our people's overall sense of belonging, which is proven to lead to higher engagement, retention, and productivity.\n\nWe are delighted to see strengths coming through in many of these dimensions this first year, for example Trust, which references our approach to fostering open and honest communications and how respected our people feel. This is core to building inclusivity in organisations.\n\nDuring 2021 we have continued to support Mr. Tom Moran, our designated Workforce Engagement Director, who has participated in numerous employee engagement activities, enabling him to have a firsthand and broad view of our progress in this area as he carries out his responsibilities for the Board (for details on activities supported during 2021, please see our Corporate Governance section on page 96).",

The purpose of these is to raise awareness, build confidence through peer discussions, and equip leaders with the skills and behaviours to lead inclusive conversations with their teams, to uncover and action areas of immediate focus, and to drive greater inclusion and belonging within Kerry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGender diversity is an underlying indicator of a healthy and inclusive culture. In 2020, we committed to increasing representation of women in senior leadership roles to 35% by 2025 and remain on track to achieve this, being positioned at 29% at year end. In 2021, we reinforced our gender diversity commitment and expanded our focus, setting an additional target to achieve equal gender representation in all senior management roles by 2030. We are currently at 36%.\n\nOur Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Councils, teams and global employee networks play a core role in championing our commitments across the Group and enabling our people to actively involve themselves in building a truly inclusive workplace where diversity is celebrated and nurtured. This year we launched two additional global employee networks, PRYSM supporting LGBTQI colleagues and allies and SEEN a network raising awareness and providing support on issues relating to race and social equity. These networks - together with our Global and Regional Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Councils - worked throughout the year to raise awareness, educate, and implement initiatives focused on building a more inclusive workplace.",

At Kerry, we partner with our people, helping them to fulfil their career aspirations while ensuring we have a ready supply of qualified expert and leadership talent to meet the current and future needs of the business.\n\nIn 2021 we evolved our Career Review process, an employee-led initiative where our people update and refresh their online career profile in readiness for a career conversation with their people manager. Career profiles provide the basis for building robust development plans which will support our people to grow and achieve their ambitions. This also helps to align internal opportunities with the career aspirations of our people.\n\nOur learning and development function supports our Career Review process by providing challenging, business-oriented, leadership and employee career development programmes aligned to organisational priorities. These programmes include a blend of classroom, virtual and interactive content focused on developing technical, functional and leadership skills, stimulating peer discussions and encouraging collaboration across different functions and regions. We also leverage our leading subject matter experts within our business to provide coaching or more specialist and technical developmental support as part of our overall curriculum. This includes developing unique offerings for critical talent segments, for example our Flavourist Academy, designed to grow and sustain our in-house expertise for the future.\n\nThis year, we focused further resource on strengthening the quality of our leadership pipelines by conducting more in-depth strategic talent reviews across our regional businesses and global functions. We have maintained a focus on building the quality of our leadership team, making key strategic appointments as well as continuing to invest in building future leaders. Activities to accelerate succession readiness of identified leadership talent have included participation in externally benchmarked assessments, internally led 360-feedback tools to better target leadership development plans, individual coaching, mentoring and collective participation in certified business school programmes.\n\nKerry's early careers programme is a core component of our strategy to strengthen our current and future talent pipeline, providing opportunities for interns and graduates to develop skills and experience across a wide range of core disciplines, enabling longer-term sustainable leadership for the organisation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021 saw the launch of our refreshed global graduate programme, enhancing our focus on building leadership behaviours and embedding a sustainability mindset, with graduates applying to Kerry from across the globe and competing for places on our 2022 programme.\n\n## Rewarding and Recognising our People\n\nAt Kerry, we believe Total Reward is about more than just pay and financial rewards. It encompasses career development, personal growth, and access to worldwide opportunities in an inclusive culture where all our people can flourish.\n\nIt supports us in being the first choice for the best talent by providing fair, competitive offerings which our people value and which drive an ownership mindset to achieve Kerry's success. Our programmes are designed to recognise and reward high performance while nurturing a healthy, diverse workforce by offering choice and flexibility, supporting our people and their families through different life and career stages.\n\nDuring 2021, we implemented the next phase of our Rewards Roadmap - a multi-year change journey developed following the Total Reward Review completed during 2019. Our aim is to ensure that our reward programmes are positioned as one of the key levers of business performance, are appropriately aligned with the external market, and are delivered in a way which makes them more easily understood and appreciated by our people.",

Recognition, when done right, is a powerful driver of employee engagement and our Inspiring People programme is a key tool which our people leaders now use to enhance the employee experience and reinforce our purpose and values.\n- We introduced a new Long Term Incentive Plan during 2021. The new plan enhances our market competitiveness and provides greater flexibility to allow us to compete globally for talent.\n- We also increased the maximum bonus payable under our Management Incentive Plan from 150% to 200% of target bonus where performance has exceeded maximum levels on each KPI.\n- In Q3, we launched Kerry's new agile working framework for all Kerry employees. This new framework addresses the paradigm shift in ways of working brought about by the pandemic and facilitates the implementation of a coherent and consistent global approach to agile working, whilst also ensuring sufficient flexibility at a local level to shape specific policies and programmes to meet local business, market or cultural needs. The framework will be implemented in line with return to the workplace government guidance and timelines. The framework also facilitates the adoption of flex-time, part-time and job share options in line with our commitment to building an inclusive workplace.\n\nIn addition to changes to our global programmes we made enhancements to local in-country benefit plans, in accordance with our regional and country specific reward roadmaps. The implementation of the Rewards Roadmap will continue during 2022.\n\nWe are committed to gender pay equality and continue to proactively monitor the pay of male and female colleagues engaging in similar roles to ensure it is comparable. We appoint and promote based on merit and will continue to encourage the career development of all our people, paying attention to our promotion and recruitment practices with regards to gender, and supporting greater representation of women at all senior management levels in line with our commitments.\n\nOur Wellbeing framework - focused on the pillars of Nutritional, Physical, Emotional and Financial health - provides access to tools and resources, such as our global Employee Assistance Programme (available to every employee in Kerry, as well as their family members). This Wellbeing approach played a critical role in our response to the emerging needs of our people over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and we have continued to build out the programme and applicability of the framework over the course of 2021 based on feedback and evaluation of emerging trends.",

The capitalised element of the cost of this project is being amortised over a seven-year period.\n\n## Brand Related Intangible Asset Amortisation\n\nBrand related intangible asset amortisation increased to \u20ac46.2m (2020: \u20ac41.7m) which is reflective of recent acquisition activity.\n\n## Finance Costs (net)\n\nFinance costs (net) for the year decreased by \u20ac2.5m to \u20ac69.9m (2020: \u20ac72.4m) primarily due to lower interest rates. The Group's average interest rate for the year was 2.7% (2020: 3.0%).\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe tax charge for the year before non-trading items was \u20ac96.2m (2020: \u20ac85.1m) representing an effective tax rate of 13.3% (2020: 13.0%) and reflective of the geographical mix of earnings.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nDuring the year, the Group completed five acquisitions for a total consideration of \u20ac1,106.5m . These acquisitions were aligned to the Group's strategic priorities: enhancing the Group's taste and nutrition capabilities, while also expanding its presence in emerging markets.\n\n## Non-Trading Items\n\nDuring the year, the Group incurred a non-trading credit of \u20ac134.4m (2020: \u20ac15.5m charge) net of tax. The credit in the year primarily related to the gain on the disposal of the Consumer Foods Meats and Meals business, partially offset by costs related to acquisition integration.\n\n## Adjusted EPS in Constant Currency\n\nAdjusted EPS in constant currency increased by 12.1% to 380.8 cent (2020: 9.4% decrease) reflecting the strong overall business performance in the year.\n\n## Basic EPS\n\nBasic EPS increased by 37.6% to 430.6 cent (2020: 313.0 cent). Basic EPS is calculated after accounting for brand related intangible asset amortisation of 26.0 cent (2020: 23.6 cent) and a non-trading item credit of 75.8 cent net of related tax (2020: 8.8 cent charge).\n\n## Return on Average Capital Employed\n\nROACE increased to 9.9% (2020: 9.8%) reflecting business performance and the impact of portfolio developments in the year.",

Net capital expenditure in the year (including computer software) amounted to \u20ac315.2m (2020: \u20ac310.7m). The level of capital investment supports the Group's growth initiatives and included the strategic development of its Rome, Georgia, US facility, creating a world-leading manufacturing facility to meet increasing demand for integrated solutions across a variety of protein applications.",

The improvement in the net position was driven primarily by strong returns on schemes' assets which was partially offset by an increase in schemes' liabilities. The net surplus expressed as a percentage of market capitalisation at 31 December 2021 was 0.3% (2020: 0.2%).\n\n## Shareholders' Equity\n\nShareholders' equity increased by \u20ac945.7m to \u20ac5,601.2m (2020: \u20ac4,655.5m), resulting from profits generated during the year, offset in part by dividends.\n\nA full reconciliation of shareholders' equity is disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 164.\n\n## Capital Structure\n\nThe Group finances its operations through a combination of equity and borrowing facilities, including bank borrowings and senior notes from capital markets.\n\nThe financing structure of the Group is managed in order to optimise shareholder value while allowing the Group to take advantage of opportunities that might arise to grow the business. The Group targets acquisition and investment opportunities that are value enhancing and the Group's policy is to fund these transactions from cash flow or borrowings while maintaining its investment grade debt status.\n\nThis is managed by setting Net debt to EBITDA targets while allowing flexibility to accommodate significant acquisition opportunities. Any expected variation from these targets should be reversible between 18 and 24 months; otherwise consideration would be given to issuing additional equity in the Group.\n\n## Free Cash Flow\n\nIn 2021, the Group achieved free cash flow of \u20ac566.1m (2020: \u20ac412.0m) reflecting 84% cash conversion in the year.\n\n| Free Cash Flow                                  | 2021 \u20ac'm   | 2020 \u20ac'm   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Trading profit                                  | 875.5      | 797.2      |\n| Depreciation (net)                              | 201.5      | 200.7      |\n| Movement in average working capital             | (37.7)     | (102.5)    |\n| Pension contributions paid less pension expense | (14.7)     | (23.4)     |\n| Finance costs paid (net)                        | (71.3)     | (74.6)     |\n| Income taxes paid                               | (72.0)     | (74.7)     |\n| Purchase of non-current assets                  | (315.2)    | (310.7)    |\n| Free cash flow                                  | 566.1      | 412.0      |\n\nCash conversion\u00b9\n\n84%\n\n67%",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability-Linked Bond Progress Report\n\nIn 2021, Kerry issued a \u20ac750 million, ten year Sustainability-Linked Bond (SLB) aligned with the Sustainability-Linked Bond Principles (SLBPs) administered by the International Capital Markets Association. The bond has a sustainabilitylinked feature that could result in an interest coupon step-up if certain KPI targets are not met, as outlined below, by December 2030.\n\nThe KPIs that have been included in the SLB have been selected as they reflect material environmental sustainability challenges for our industry and key focus areas under our Beyond the Horizon strategy. These KPIs and targets are as follows:\n\nKPI 1: 55% Absolute reduction in Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions\n\nKPI 2: 50% Food waste reduction across our operations\n\n## 2021 Performance\n\nIn 2021, we made strong progress against both targets, delivering a 39% reduction in our absolute 1 & 2 emissions and a 19% reduction in our food waste volumes, versus a 2017 baseline for both KPIs.\n\n| Emissions (CO 2 e)   | 2021    | 2017    | Food Waste   | 2021   | 2017   |\n|----------------------|---------|---------|--------------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 & 2 (Tonnes) | 536,370 | 878,363 | Tonnes       | 10,290 | 12,780 |\n| % change             | 39%     | -       | % change     | 19%    | -      |\n\nFor more details of our efforts to reduce emissions and food waste, see our Sustainability Review on page 50 and also our 2021 GRI Sustainability Report at kerrygroup.com.\n\n## Key Financial Ratios\n\nThe Group's balance sheet is in a strong position. With a Net debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.0 times, the Group has sufficient headroom to support future growth plans. During the year, the Group repaid US$200m of outstanding private placement notes. Following this repayment, the Group now has no financial arrangements that carry financial covenants.\n\n|                      |   2021 |   2020 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net debt: EBITDA     |    2   |    1.9 |\n| EBITDA: Net interest |   14.9 |   13.8 |\n\n## Share Price and Market Capitalisation\n\nThe Company's shares traded in the range \u20ac99.95 to \u20ac130.00 during the year. The share price at 31 December 2021 was \u20ac113.25 (2020: \u20ac118.50) giving a market capitalisation of \u20ac20.0 billion (2020: \u20ac20.9 billion). Total shareholder return for 2021 was (3.7%) (2020: +7.4%).\n\n## Financial Risk Management\n\nWithin the Group risk management framework as described in the Risk Management Report on page 76, the Group has a Financial Risk Management Programme, which is approved by the Board of Directors and is subject to regular monitoring by the Finance Committee and Group Internal Audit. The Group does not engage in speculative trading.\n\nFurther details relating to the Group's financial and compliance risks and their associated mitigation processes are discussed in the Risk Management Report on pages 75-85 and in note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Dividend and Annual General Meeting\n\nDuring the year, the Group paid an interim dividend of 28.5 cent per A ordinary share, which was an increase of 10.0%. The Board has proposed a final dividend of 66.7 cent per A ordinary share, payable on 6 May 2022 to shareholders registered on the record date of 8 April 2022. When combined with the interim dividend, the total dividend for the year amounts to 95.2 cent per share (2020: 86.5 cent per share), which is an increase of 10.1% over last year's dividend. The Group's aim is to have double digit dividend growth each year. Over 35 years as a listed company, the Group has grown its dividend at a compound rate of 16.3%.\n\nKerry's Annual General Meeting is scheduled to take place on 28 April 2022.",

Within the Food EUM, Bakery delivered very strong growth through taste, preservation and clean label solutions. Performance in Meals and Cereal & Sweet were impacted by product repositioning within these categories, while Snacks had good growth supported by new launches in healthier snacking.

Volume growth in Brazil was driven by performance in Beverage and ice-cream, while growth in Mexico was led by Snacks. Within the global Pharma EUM, cell nutrition delivered good growth, which was offset by weaker volumes in excipients as a result of supply chain delays in the year.\n\nDuring the year, we commenced production at our new state-ofthe-art facility in Rome, Georgia, and within our taste facility in Irapuato, Mexico.

This reflected very strong volume growth of 9.9%, increased pricing of 1.8%, contribution from acquisitions of 2.3% and the impact of favourable transaction and translation currency of 0.1% and 0.5% respectively. The level of growth achieved in the region reflected strong progress across the year, while recognising softer prior year comparatives.\n\nGrowth in the retail channel was driven by performance within the Food EUM. Meat achieved excellent growth through a number of plant-based meat alternative innovations, launches with natural preservation and increased demand for healthier coating systems. Bakery & Confectionary delivered a very strong performance through texture systems and indulgent innovations. Dairy achieved strong growth in premium and dairy-free ice cream ranges, while international dairy markets reflected increased demand versus supply dynamics. Within the Beverage EUM, there was good growth with low/nonalcoholic beverages incorporating Kerry's botanicals, natural extracts and sugar reduction technologies.\n\nThe foodservice channel achieved excellent growth particularly in the UK and Southern Europe. This growth was broad-based across our end use markets, as customers extended their menu ranges and reintroduced limited time offers as the year progressed.

The overall growth across the region was led by strong performances in China and the Middle East.\n\nGrowth in the retail channel was well spread across Kerry's markets. Within the Food EUM, Meat had strong growth through local authentic taste innovations and a number of plant-based launches. Growth in the Bakery EUM was led by savoury taste innovations with a number of local leaders across the region. Within the Beverage EUM, growth was driven by innovations across tea, coffee and refreshing beverage through solutions incorporating Kerry's natural extracts, Tastesense\u2122 sugar reduction technology and proactive nutrition portfolio.\n\nThe foodservice channel delivered strong overall growth and a good finish to the year. This was achieved despite COVID-related restrictions impacting performance across the region at various stages, most notably in South East Asia.\n\nDuring the year, we continued to make good progress in expanding our capacity and deploying our technology capabilities in the region. We opened our new taste facility in Durban, South Africa in the final quarter, which represents an important strategic step in our expansion within the continent. We made good progress in the development of our new taste facility at our Jeddah, Saudi Arabia operation and we also announced the development of a new taste facility in Karawang, Indonesia.",

The contribution of the current food system to environmental and social impacts such as climate change, resource use, access to fresh water, obesity and hunger, means that as an industry, we must take urgent action to address the impacts of the products we produce and the way in which we produce them.\n\n## Across the globe, our Purpose, Inspiring Food, Nourishing Life is central to everything we do.\n\nWe collaborate with others to fulfil this purpose and our Vision is to be our customers' most valued partner, creating a world of sustainable nutrition. With the sustainability commitments under our Beyond the Horizon s trategy and our four strategic platforms of Authentic Taste, Plant-based, Food Waste and Health & Bio-Pharma, we have set out a clear pathway to bring this vision to life.\n\nOur ambition is to reach over two billion people with sustainable nutrition solutions by 2030. Our Beyond the Horizon strategy outlines how we will play a crucial role with our industry-leading portfolio, innovation expertise and sustainability commitments, leading to better outcomes for people, society and the planet.\n\nWe are proud of our achievements to date and particularly our ability to reach over one billion people with positive and balanced nutrition solutions. We also recognise the very significant environmental and social challenges facing our industry and the need to accelerate our actions.

According to the World Health Organisation, good nutrition is central to the achievement of twelve of the seventeen SDGs. However, today more than three billion people are malnourished and many consume diets which are low in quality 1 . Food production is also responsible for a significant share of greenhouse gas emissions and global resource use and yet it is estimated that a third of all food produced is lost or wasted 2 .\n\nAt our Capital Markets Day in October 2021, we announced a step up in our emissions reduction goal to align with the most ambitious 1.5-degree pathway under the Paris Climate Agreement, as well as a strengthening of our gender diversity targets.\n\nWhile all seventeen goals are critically important, Kerry's integrated solutions capabilities, innovation expertise and sustainability commitments mean that we are best placed to make the most significant contribution to goals 2, 3, and 12.\n\n## Responsible Consumption and Production\n\nUsing natural resources responsibly and enabling our customers to consume and produce more sustainably through our innovation expertise and technology portfolio.\n\n## Zero Hunger\n\nHelping people access sufficient amounts of the right nutrition in a cost-effective way while working with producers to sustainably intensify production and improve livelihoods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutrition source/sustainability/\n- 2 UN FAO https://www.fao.org/food-loss-and-food-waste/flw-data)\n\n## Good Health & Well-being\n\nSupporting good health and wellbeing and helping reduce mortality through the cocreation of products that help improve consumer diets.",

At Kerry, we believe that the best way to achieve this is through ongoing and inclusive stakeholder engagement. We are involved in continuous dialogue with key groups, as we share our vision for a world of sustainable nutrition and seek to incorporate a diverse set of views to help inform our approach. Among our key stakeholders are employees, customers and consumers, shareholders, suppliers, communities and government. For more on our approach to stakeholder engagement see our Corporate Governance Report on pages 99-104 and our GRI Sustainability Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Defining What is Most Important\n\nOur material topics are defined through a dedicated process of stakeholder engagement which considers a broad universe of issues. We assess the relative importance of each issue in influencing the decision making of these stakeholders, their importance to Kerry's business performance and our wider social, environmental and economic impacts. We conducted a comprehensive review of our materiality assessment in 2021, which enabled us to integrate the principles of dynamic and double materiality within the assessment process and reflect the evolution of many sustainability topics across our industry.\n\nThe outputs of this assessment, including our relative impact in each area, are reflected in the matrix on the opposite page and while many of these topic areas are not new, we have seen disaggregation in some areas as certain elements within broader topics become increasingly salient. We also see changes in relative importance of some topics, most notably the continued acceleration of climate related issues, the increasing importance being attributed to biodiversity and the demand for more sustainable innovation as stakeholders look for solutions in response to these challenges.\n\nThese material topics are reviewed as part of the broader risk assessment process and further details on the Group's principal risks are outlined in the Risk Management Report on pages 78-84.

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), in 2021 healthy diets were out of reach for three billion people*. Malnutrition, in all its forms including hunger and obesity, occurs when safe, healthy foods are not accessible or affordable for people. Poor quality diets, high in salt, sugar and saturated fat can lead to diet-related diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes which account for one quarter of all adult deaths each year. In 2021, the UN Food Systems Summit emphasised the responsibility of the food system in addressing the issue of malnutrition, providing accessible nutritious foods to ensure a healthy future for both people and planet.\n\nConsumers are also increasingly mindful of the link between diet, health and the environment. Kerry's Sustainability in Motion research highlighted that consumers are seeking out products and brands that have a positive impact on their health and the world around them. As food and beverage manufacturers seek to respond to these changing consumer preferences, demand for partners who can support them in creating products that deliver more sustainable nutrition is growing.\n\n- * https://www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition#",

In 2021, we published the findings from our Sustainability in Motion research, following engagement with over 14,000 consumers across 18 countries and three continents. This comprehensive study shows how the definition of sustainability is evolving, with more and more emphasis on health, nutrition and sustainability, as it relates to an individual, as well as the more traditional associations of sustainability and its impact on the environment.\n\nWhen it comes to the food and beverage industry in particular, an individual's considerations regarding sustainable food and drinks can encompass environmental concerns, social needs, industry\n\n## Global consumers follow a consistent Sustainability Adoption Curve:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKERRY PROPRIETARY INSIGHTS\n\n## TABLESTAKES\n\nEnvironment and atmosphere preservation Sustainable packaging Community aid and human rights advocacy\n\n## Extrinsic\n\n## Intrinsic\n\nExtrinsic associations are the first point of contact consumers have with sustainability.\n\nIntrinsic associations are made by consumers who have matured in their sustainability journey.\n\nSUSTAINABILITY ADOPTION CURVE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EMERGING\n\nReducing food, packaging and production waste\n\nZero plastic movement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand the environment. Nutritional concerns for our customers and their consumers range from food safety and security, clean label, positive and balanced nutrition, proactive nutrition and an increasing focus on personalised nutrition. There is also growing awareness around the environmental and social impact of food and so the way in which food is produced must also be considered in the context of sustainable nutrition. For more on our approach see our white paper at kerrygroup.com.\n\nexpectations (e.g. responsible sourcing) and personal goals around health and nutrition.\n\nThese findings have major implications for the food and drinks industry. Our growing and increasingly urbanised global population has high expectations regarding the broader impacts of food. However, it also demands high standards in terms of taste, convenience and value. As the leading global expert in taste and nutrition, Kerry provides a crucial link between manufacturer capabilities and consumer expectations and is firmly at the forefront of technological innovation within food and beverages - a critical foundation for building a more sustainable future food system.

We conduct our business guided by our purpose and underpinned by our values, and the Group's comprehensive Code of Conduct clearly defines the standards and expectations for all Kerry colleagues.\n\nIn 2021, we refreshed our Code of Conduct, revising several underlying policies to better reflect the evolving expectations of our business and making it more accessible for all employees. As part of this process, the Code of Conduct has been made available in 26 languages and led by the CEO and the Executive Team, we have engaged broadly across the organisation to communicate these changes. As part of the Group's Code of Conduct, Kerry's Anti-Bribery Policy describes our zero-tolerance approach and provides guidance to all employees regarding potential situations involving bribery and corruption.\n\nRegardless of role, seniority or location, all colleagues have a responsibility to apply these standards and expectations in their work every day. We continue to monitor understanding of this Code through dedicated training requirements and in 2021, over 90% of required colleagues achieved Code of Conduct certification. For more on our approach to business ethics and reporting of potential issues, see our GRI Sustainability Report.\n\n## Upholding Labour Standards and Human Rights\n\nKerry is fully committed to upholding internationally recognised human rights. Our Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy apply to all employees and sets out our expectations for business and supply chain partners to conduct their business in a way that upholds our values.\n\nIn 2021, Kerry's work on human rights was led through the Social Sustainability Council, chaired by the Group's Chief Human Resources Officer. Across our operations, our manufacturing facilities complete a self-assessment, ensuring our visibility of potential human rights within our business. Across our supply chain, we have expanded the scope of our human rights due diligence, bringing more direct suppliers within the scope of this programme. In 2021, 86% of these higher risk suppliers had been enrolled in the programme and we will continue to engage the remaining suppliers along with any qualifying new vendors to our business.\n\nGiven the inter-connected and complex nature of human rights, we continue to engage with expert third parties and multi-stakeholder groups to advance our approach and ensure we align with evolving best practice. In 2022, our focus will be on further building out our due diligence programme, including undertaking an independent assessment of our approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Prioritising Workplace Health and Safety\n\nThe health and wellbeing of our people underpins our culture and is a key enabler of our business success. We are committed to the ongoing improvement of our safety performance as we continue our journey towards a best-in-class safety culture. To achieve this, we continually reinforce our Safety First, Quality Always mindset at the core of our business and through our operational excellence programmes, we ensure that safety is at the centre of everything we do.\n\nWe have been deeply saddened by the loss of a colleague to a workplace fatality at a manufacturing facility in 2021 and extend our sincere sympathy to the family. The circumstances of this tragedy were thoroughly investigated, including engagement with the appropriate regulatory authorities and a complete root cause analysis. Following the investigation's conclusion, key learnings were shared as appropriate across the Group.\n\nWhile we recognise that there is no acceptable level of accident or injury, we can report a further 8% improvement in our safety performance for 2021 versus 2020. In addition, we have also seen an increase in the number of manufacturing facilities with no recordable injuries in this same 12-month period, reinforcing the progress that has been made to date. These improvements were due, in part, to the deployment of targeted training and awareness programmes for employees with a particular emphasis on serious incidents, as well as increased management focus and investment in this area.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe that embracing different perspectives, ideas and ways of working is good for business performance. We champion inclusion at all levels of our workforce, reflecting the diversity of the communities in which we operate, and we offer opportunities for colleagues without discrimination.\n\nTo measure the impact of our inclusive workplace initiatives and to ensure we are delivering on our commitments, we established an Inclusion Index during 2021 as a key metric to monitor our performance. This index is derived from our annual employee engagement survey and directly related to our employee experience, and will enable us to provide an informed view on our progress in future reports.\n\nGender diversity is an underlying indicator of a healthy and inclusive culture and a core component within our broader diversity agenda. We are committed to increasing representation of women in senior leadership roles to 35% by 2025 and remain on track to achieve this, having improved to 29% this year. At our Capital Markets Day in October 2021, we reinforced our gender diversity commitment and expanded our ambition, to include the achievement of equal gender representation in all senior management roles by 2030. We are currently tracking at 36%. For more detail see Our People on pages 18-19.\n\n## Nourishing Communities\n\nKerry continued to grow a sustainable presence in local communities through the year.\n\nThe further embedding of MyCommunity as the platform for locally-led donations and employee volunteering was aided by innovative use of digital tools which allowed many activities to continue, even against the backdrop of the pandemic. In addition, we continued to support the ongoing evolution of Group-led projects with our valued NGO partners in countries where Kerry is not on the ground.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PARTNERSHIP FOR GLOBAL LGBTI EQUALITY (PGLE)\n\nGoing beyond gender diversity, we are committed to creating an environment where everyone can bring their true selves to work and in June 2021, we were proud to join the Partnership for Global LGBTI Equality (PGLE) while signing the UN Standards of Conduct for Business to accelerate equality, inclusion and LGBTI rights.\n\n## CREATING A MORE INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT\n\nThrough our partnership with Special Olympics, Kerry welcomed athlete Fiona Brady to celebrate International Women's Day on 8 March and our employees were given insights on inclusivity for businesses with Special Olympics Ireland to celebrate International Day for People with Disabilities.\n\n## MyCommunity\n\nFollowing its successful launch in 2020, this year saw Kerry employees continue to build and enhance the MyCommunity programme. These initiatives primarily looked to support health and nutrition efforts, as COVID-19 continues to impact on lives around the world. As families and health services remain under pressure, colleagues were restricted in their ability to volunteer in person. In response, Kerry and its employees focused on donations where they saw opportunities to contribute positively, reflecting a desire to make an impact and demonstrate Kerry's values in a tangible way.\n\nExamples of these engagements include; the ongoing support for a COVID-19 quarantine and treatment centre dedicated to providing much needed accommodation, food and toiletries for women, pregnant mothers and young children in Tampoi, Malaysia; the donation of nutritional products to four hospitals in the Manaus region of Brazil; the provision of PPE and the donation of food and sanitisers for care and educational organisations in Moscow, Russia; and the work of colleagues with care facilities and food distribution charities across Ireland.",

In 2021, our focus moved to Gitega province in Burundi, where we are leveraging Kerry's dairy and nutritional expertise to improve farming methods, increase dairy yields and impact the nutritional value of school meals in the participating communities. Addressing hunger is a key driver for this project, titled Project Amata (amata is the word for milk in Kirundi, the national language of Burundi), and participating farmers are aiming to greatly enhance their impact on their communities and increase incomes as they do so. COVID-related restrictions have meant some activities have moved online, yet progress to date includes the completion of the baseline dairy farming assessment and knowledge gathering on local farming and milk production practices. We have partnered locally with V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires Sans Fronti\u00e8res (VSF) and together with Kerry expertise, delivered a virtual training programme on dairy best practices which can be rolled out across the project region.\n\n## RAIN Programme\n\nIn partnership with Concern Worldwide, Kerry is supporting the delivery of the RAIN (Realigning Agriculture to Improve Nutrition) programme in the Tahoua region of Niger. Under the programme, 1,000 vulnerable households in seven villages in Tahoua benefit from sustainable improvements in health and nutrition, diversified livelihoods, greater access to quality education and improved social capital. The focus on food security, health protection, income for vulnerable women and improved food production is complemented with community engagement and empowerment to make a lasting impact. With the conclusion of the programme in 2021, Kerry is working with Concern to assess the overall programme results and understand how these can best be used to inform future partnerships.\n\n## Special Olympics\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the work of Special Olympics across the world, with athletes and volunteers unable to participate as they were accustomed to. Despite this, the support of partners such as Kerry allowed programmes in Ireland to provide innovative online platforms for athletes to continue to engage with their training, participate in virtual wellbeing courses and host 14 face-to-face competitions during 2021. Running alongside these competitions were a number of virtual events which encouraged over 3,300 Special Olympics athletes to stay fit and healthy during the pandemic.\n\nPhoto: WFP / Irenee Nduwayezu\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCaption\n\nPhoto: Ollivier Girard of Concern Worldwide\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given the diverse nature of our portfolio, the achievement of this goal involves working across sites to understand the key drivers of food waste locally and implementing the most appropriate actions to deliver on our target. In 2021, we have continued to make good progress against this goal with a 19% reduction versus our 2017 baseline.\n\n## Supporting Our Customers\n\nWhile tackling food waste across our operations is vitally important, there are substantial opportunities for Kerry to impact on food waste elsewhere in the value chain, particularly downstream. In developed markets, the proportion of total food lost or wasted at the consumer level can be more than 60%. As consumers increasingly demand natural, clean label products that do not contain artificial preservatives, manufacturers are challenged to meet these evolving consumer demands, while maintaining or improving shelf life. With the industry's largest portfolio of clean label preservation technologies, Kerry and its new acquisition, Niacet, are ideally placed to support our customers in meeting these requirements.\n\n## Food Waste Solutions\n\nCombatting food waste represents an attractive, high growth market and at Kerry we have the capabilities and solutions to help customers with this challenge. Bakery represents the highest volume category of food waste globally and in 2021, Kerry and its new acquisition Niacet extended the shelf life of 34.5 billion loaves of bread by an average of 50%.\n\n## Tackling Plastic Waste\n\nWe fully support efforts to promote a more circular approach to plastics and have committed to making all our plastic packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. We use sustainable packaging where possible, favouring reusable, returnable, or certified paper-based material. In 2021, 57% of the plastic packaging used across our business was in line with the criteria for our 2025 target. We continue to look at ways to address the remaining volumes, with plans already in place for how we can tackle some of the more challenging plastic materials and packaging formats.\n\n## Protecting Water Resources\n\nAcross our operations we are targeting a 15% reduction in water intensity by 2025.\n\nAs our business volumes recovered through 2021, with the easing of restriction in the foodservice channel, our performance on water was challenged. At year end, we recorded a 4% reduction in water efficiency versus our 2017 base year. We have identified a pipeline of water reduction opportunities which are supported by our capital investment programme. In particular, planned investment in 2022 will result in improvements in future years to deliver our 2025 ambition.\n\nWe also understand that water discharges from our sites can have an impact on local water quality and make every effort to ensure we protect local water sources. We track and monitor compliance with relevant water standards on an ongoing basis. For more details on our water use, see our GRI Sustainability Report.\n\n## Water Risk\n\nUsing the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct Tool, we have identified priority locations that may be more vulnerable to water risk. Water efficiency across these sites exceeds that for the Group and was 15% lower in 2021 versus our 2017 base year. We have plans to keep a critical focus on water at these locations and with the support of an expert third party we are conducting a programme of metering, monitoring and targeting to help drive ongoing improvements.",

Kerry has potential to impact on biodiversity directly through its operations and indirectly through the raw materials we source. Our most significant impacts are those that are linked to our supply chain and are incorporated within our approach to the priority categories outlined below. One critical action we are working towards is the preservation of the tropical forests and the rich biodiversity they contain. We are committed to eliminating deforestation across targeted supply chains that are the leading drivers of forest loss including, Cocoa, Coffee, Soybean, Palm Oil and Paper. In support of this commitment, we are members of several multi-stakeholder initiatives focused on this area including RSPO, SAI Platform (including their deforestation workstream within the Sustainable Dairy Partnership), Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA) 2020 and others. For more on our evolving approach to biodiversity, see our GRI Sustainability Report.\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sourcing Responsibly\n\nAt Kerry, we know the production of some raw materials can present social and environmental challenges.\n\nAddressing these challenges can prove difficult within a complex global supply chain and as part of our vision to create a world of sustainable nutrition, we are engaging with our suppliers to drive more sustainable practices right back to farm level, ensuring that 100% of our priority raw materials are responsibly sourced by 2030.\n\nIn partnership with our suppliers, we work to ensure decent livelihoods for farmers, promote practices that protect and regenerate vital ecosystems, and protect the rights of workers and communities throughout our value chain. We use a combination of certification and verification and where these mechanisms do not support the best path forward, we work more directly with supply partners and expert third parties, including through direct engagement and programmes at farm level.\n\nWe risk assess our supply chains and prioritise category engagement with our suppliers and other key stakeholders, both individually and as part of broader multi-stakeholder platforms, to better understand common challenges associated with specific commodities and/or geographies and how we can work together to effectively address these.

        "page_content": "## EU Taxonomy\n\n## Background\n\nIn line with its action plan for financing sustainable growth, the European Union is defining a taxonomy of sustainable activities, which aims to increase environmental transparency and support more sustainable investment. As part of these efforts, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (the 'Taxonomy Regulation') creates a classification system for sustainable economic activities. In the following section, the Group has outlined information on the extent to which the Group's activities are eligible under this taxonomy.\n\nWe have undertaken a review of the Group's activities and as our systems do not categorise data in a manner consistent with the taxonomy, we have been prudent in our disclosure of eligible activities.\n\n## Economic Activity\n\nIn assessing eligibility, we looked at the activities of the Group and whether these fall within the scope of the economic activities outlined under the taxonomy regulation. Kerry's core business involves the manufacture of food and beverage products, which are not currently listed as eligible activities.\n\nTo support our business, we carry out some ancillary activities and we have also looked at our investment in these areas to understand if these qualify as eligible.\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\n## Turnover\n\nWhile the manufacture of food and beverage products were deemed non-eligible, we undertook a deeper review of our turnover with cross functional support and input from the Group's Chief Technology Officer.\n\nAs part of our assessment, we reviewed the Group's portfolio against those economic activities currently within the scope of the taxonomy regulation and through this assessment we determined that Kerry had no eligible turnover in 2021.\n\n## Operational Expenditure\n\nHaving reviewed our overall operating costs versus the taxonomy requirements, we determined that as the majority of our operating costs relate to our turnover, they too were determined to be non-eligible with the exception of maintenance and repairs. These costs are included in other general overheads reported in note 3 in our financial statements. The assessment of maintenance and repairs determined that there are no material eligible costs within this category.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nOur assessment was carried out with our engineering function and is based on investment in eligible economic activities listed within the regulation. This included projects involving construction of new buildings to enhance our manufacturing footprint, building renovations to improve existing manufacturing facilities and the installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment. Projects were allocated to distinct categories to avoid double counting and going forward, capital projects and associated purchases will include more detailed assessment of taxonomy alignment. The amount of capital expenditure additions deemed eligible in 2021 was 24%.\n\n## Key Performance Indicators\n\nIn the 2021 reporting period Kerry Group had no turnover or operating expenditure associated with eligible activities. The proportion of eligible capital expenditure was deemed to be 24%.\n\n## Turnover\n\nWith no eligible turnover (numerator) and using a base of our total turnover (denominator) as reported in our Consolidated Income Statement, we established the proportion of eligible turnover to be zero.\n\n## Operational Expenditure\n\nHaving identified no material eligible expenditure within this category (numerator) and using the maintenance and repairs cost base (denominator), we established the proportion of eligible operational expenditure to be zero.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nComparing these eligible capital additions (numerator) to our additions of property plant and equipment, right of use assets and intangible assets as reported in notes 11 and 12 in our financial statements (denominator), the level of eligible additions is approximately 24%. This does not include business combinations in the year.\n\n| Category                | Eligible   | Non-Eligible   |\n|-------------------------|------------|----------------|\n| Turnover                | 0%         | 100%           |\n| Operational Expenditure | 0%         | 100%           |\n| Capital Expenditure     | 24%        | 76%            |",

Kerry has a strong record of action on climate change and has been targeting emission reductions for more than a decade, reporting publicly on our progress and working with suppliers and customers to extend this impact along our value chain. As a leader in sustainable nutrition, our technology and innovation expertise will play an important role in the transition to healthier, lower impact diets that meet with changing consumer expectations.\n\nTo achieve this, we must acknowledge the significant environmental and social risks posed by the changing climate and be prepared for the challenges presented by the transition to a low carbon economy. We understand the need for enhanced disclosures in this area and the TCFD recommendations provide a consistent framework with which to align our climate reporting. In this section we have brought together information from across our Annual and Sustainability reports, in accordance with these guidelines. We continue to develop our approach to climate change and in addition to this TCFD disclosure, we provide information in our Risk Management (page 77) and Governance (page 118) Reports and within our GRI Sustainability Report at www.kerrygroup.com.

The Board approved the Group's Beyond the Horizon strategy prior to its launch in 2020, encompassing its commitments on climate action.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board also chairs the dedicated Board Committee with responsibility for Governance, Nomination and Sustainability. As such, he and the other members of the committee take a lead role in Board guidance and oversight of the implementation and performance versus the Group's sustainability strategy, including its actions on climate change. To facilitate this, scheduled meetings take place between business leaders and the Committee throughout the year.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee and the wider Board received three dedicated updates from the Group Head of Sustainability and other leaders across the business on matters which included the Group's performance versus its climate goals, climate related risks and opportunities and TCFD aligned disclosures. The potential impact of climate change is increasingly integrated into strategic matters which are considered by the Board. During the year, the Board approved an acceleration of the Group's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target to support Kerry's alignment with the 1.5\u2070 Celsius temperature pathway.\n\nThe Board is supported in their role by the Global Sustainability Council, which is chaired by the CEO and comprises executive and functional leadership from across the Group. This Council is responsible for the assessment and management of climate related risks and opportunities as part of its broader sustainability remit.\n\nAdditional thematic governance councils are in place across the organisation to support the climate agenda. Each Council is led by a member of the Executive Team and has cross functional membership from across the business and regions, incorporating our experts focused on climate action from engineering, operations, procurement and RD&A. These Councils also engage externally on specific climate related issues as required.\n\nMeeting at least quarterly, they have been established to ensure that action to address issues like climate change is embedded at all levels across the organisation and to provide a channel for reporting to the Global Sustainability Council. They include:\n\n- an Environmental Council chaired by the Group's Chief Operating Officer, which is focused on reducing operational emissions across our manufacturing facilities and addressing impacts related to waste and water. This council plays a crucial role in setting and implementing plans for the achievement of our targets, identifying process changes and capital investment to deliver the improvements required.\n- a Responsible Sourcing Council led by the Chief Procurement Officer dedicated to assessing the sustainability of the raw materials we purchase, ensuring no deforestation across our supply chains by 2025 and reducing our Scope 3 emissions by 2030, in line with our Science Based Target.\n- a Product Portfolio Council led by the Group's Chief Technology Officer tasked with monitoring and improving the sustainability of the products we produce, driving sustainable innovation and expanding our portfolio of sustainable solutions that enable carbon reduction for our customers.\n- a Commercial Council led by the Chief Commercial Officer which assesses the opportunities presented by sustainability and how Kerry can best serve its customers through the lens of sustainable nutrition, supporting them to achieve their own climate related objectives.\n\nIn 2021, we enhanced the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) for Executive Directors and Senior management which included the addition of sustainability and climate related metrics in line with our Beyond the Horizon strategy launch in 2020. As part of the overall reward framework, our long-term incentive plan considers core sustainability metrics, specifically Scope 1 and 2 carbon reduction and the progress towards our sciencebased target. More details on this can be found in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 129-130.

        "page_content": "## Strategy\n\nKerry has acknowledged the significance of climate change for its business for more than a decade and has made important progress in addressing key parts of its footprint. As the impact of climate change continues to unfold, efforts to address our emissions have accelerated and as part of our Beyond the Horizon strategy, we have placed an even greater emphasis on carbon reduction. Crucially, our climate ambitions are also reflected in our broader business strategy and particularly within our key strategic platforms. They increasingly inform all areas of our business, including our M&A activity and financing strategy. In 2021, we announced the acquisition of Niacet and Biosearch Life, both of which support our goal of creating more sustainable nutrition solutions and Kerry also issued a Sustainability-Linked Bond in the final quarter, which links our financing to the Group's sustainability performance, including its science-based emissions reduction target.\n\nTo ensure we realise our goals, we are increasingly focused on understanding material climate related issues that may impact our strategy and how we can mitigate and/or adapt to these risks and opportunities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhysical Risk\n\nTransition Risk\n\nAcute: Acute physical risks refer to those risks that are event-driven, including increased severity of extreme weather events.\n\nChronic: Chronic physical risks refer to longer-term shifts in climate patterns that may cause sea level rise or chronic heat waves.\n\nTransitioning to a lowercarbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology, and market changes. Depending on the nature, speed, and focus of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to organisations.\n\nTimeframe: While some physical risks are already evident today, the most significant impacts are likely to be felt over the medium to long-term. Transition risks are likely to manifest more quickly as society makes the shift towards a low carbon economy.\n\nIn 2021, we established a working group to evolve our existing climate risk assessment and lead our alignment with the TCFD guidance. In conjunction with an expert external party and with the support of an Executive led steering committee, we commenced a detailed qualitative and quantitative assessment of climate related issues. With broad cross-functional engagement, we defined an extensive set of risks and opportunities through stakeholder engagement, dedicated workshops and expert input. This longlist was subsequently refined based on appraisal of risk severity and likelihood, a method aligned with our overall risk management framework, and which provided us with a focused set of risks for more detailed analysis.\n\n## Key Risks and Opportunities Identified\n\n| Category                 | Risk / Opportunity        | Potential Impact                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Physical Risk  (Acute)   | Extreme weather events    | Increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events  could result in damage and/or interruption to our manufacturing  facilities and distribution network.                     |\n| Physical Risk  (Chronic) | Access to water           | The limited availability of water as a result of climate related impacts  has the potential to disrupt production at facilities in vulnerable  locations.                                   |\n| Physical Risk  (Chronic) | Raw material availability | Extreme weather events, water variability, changes to precipitation  patterns and rising global temperatures could impact on the  availability and cost of raw material supplies.           |\n| Transition Risk          | Policy                    | Existing and emerging regulations including carbon pricing could  lead to increased operational costs across different jurisdictions.                                                       |\n| Transition Risk          | Technology                | Widespread adoption of new lower-carbon technology may require  investment in our operations to maintain competitiveness and/or to  meet new regulatory requirements.                       |\n| Opportunities            | Market dynamics           | Shifts in consumer demand for low carbon products presents  potential opportunities for Kerry given our RD&A and technology  capabilities, product portfolio and leading consumer insights. |",

        "page_content": "## Assessing the Potential Impact\n\nModelling the potential impacts of these climate related risks to our business is complex. As the climate crisis unfolds, climate related impacts and policy responses will manifest in different ways and over different time-horizons. Typically, we consider business risk over a relatively shorter term (<5 years), however, climate risk requires a longer-term view as some impacts may be felt more slowly. To account for this, we have chosen to examine the potential impact of these risks over 10 years and 30 years respectively, using 2030 and 2050 as our reference timeframes.\n\nAdopting this longer-term view presents certain challenges given uncertainty surrounding the timing and severity of both physical and transition risks. For example, sea-level rise is expected to be a more gradual impact area whereas more frequent and intense weather events are already visible today. To help overcome this, we have modelled the potential impacts under different scenarios in accordance with TCFD guidance. In doing so, we looked at the potential directional impacts under the following future conditions:\n\n| Scenario One                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Scenario Two                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Under this scenario, there is inadequate action to limit  greenhouse gas emissions and modelling reflects a  world where increasing concentrations of CO 2  puts   global average temperature increases on a trajectory  towards four degrees Celsius by 2100. | Under this scenario, there is sustained and coordinated  collective action to address the climate crises, with  emissions reductions meeting the required levels to  keep global average temperature increases to below two  degrees Celsius by 2100. |\n\nUsing the above reference scenarios, we undertook an assessment for the following risks and opportunities to better understand how our business might be impacted by different temperature increases and by policy and market responses to the climate crises.

Significant temperature increases aligned with Scenario One, or the pace and scale of change required to deliver Scenario Two, will undoubtedly create risks and opportunities for our industry.\n\nThrough the work we have undertaken in 2021, we have identified where these climate-related issues have the potential to impact on our business and the strategic priorities we have set out. We have specific mitigation measures in place across key risk areas including investments in process improvements and capital to reduce GHG emissions across our value chain, water risk assessment across priority locations, business continuity plans in the event of business or supply chain disruption and alternative sourcing strategies for critical raw materials.\n\nOur analysis to date highlights the resilience of the Group's strategy to a range of climate hazards and transition risks across both temperature scenarios and over the timeframes outlined.\n\nThe outputs of the analysis were also considered in the scenarios considered for the Group's ongoing viability and impairment testing. For more see page 84. We will continue to enhance our climate assessments to ensure visibility of any potential changes to these risks or to their velocity.\n\nWe also see the opportunity to further integrate specific climate considerations within our broader risk assessment and operational planning processes in the short to medium term. This will provide a more comprehensive approach to near term risk management and improve the effectiveness of our climate related actions in the coming years.\n\nOur scenario analysis will continue to evolve and alongside the ongoing mitigation of anticipated risks, we are encouraged that our assessment reinforces the opportunities for businesses that can support the transition to a low carbon economy. At Kerry, we have an important role to play within our industry, partnering with our customers and supporting them through innovation, as they seek to meet the growing consumer demand for lower carbon products that contribute to good health and wellbeing.

The Group's risk assessment process is a coordinated bottom-up and top-down group-wide approach that facilitates the identification and evaluation of risks, as well as assessing how the risks are monitored, managed and mitigated. This process is facilitated by Internal Audit and overseen by the Risk Oversight Committee.\n\nWithin our risk management framework, we adopt an integrated approach to assessing and managing climate risks across our business and wider value chain. The impact of climate change has typically been integrated within broader risk classifications, as a contributor to other principal risks (e.g. extreme weather impacts on raw material prices). While a climate risk lens is applied as part of the broader risk assessment, we have examined key risks in greater depth and identified areas where the integration of these climate related issues can be strengthened.\n\nManaging these risks is a cross functional responsibility and with the support of the Council structure outlined under Governance above, management track and review the Group's performance, prioritise actions and investments for mitigation and report on progress to the Global Sustainability Council and the Board.\n\nIn 2021, we have also introduced 'Climate and Environmental Risk' as a standalone principal risk, reflecting the increasing importance of policy interventions, market changes and physical impacts such as water stress for our business.

As part of this commitment, we outlined an original target for a 33% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and a 30% reduction in carbon intensity for Scope 3 emissions over the same period. These targets were approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) as aligned to a well below two degree temperature pathway.\n\nIn 2021, we enhanced our targets in line with calls to limit global average temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the most ambitious pathway under the Paris Agreement. This change has taken our Scope 1 and 2 reduction target to 55% by 2030, versus our 2017 base year and this revised target has been approved by the SBTi.\n\nWe have made good progress against this target with a 39% reduction versus our base year. The measurement and target performance of Scope 1 and 2 emissions is for all sites under our operational control and is undertaken in accordance with the GHG Protocol. We report annually to CDP and in 2021, achieved a CDP score of 'A-', placing us at leadership level for our action and reporting on climate change.\n\nIn support of our climate objectives, we also have a number of associated targets which contribute to our overall goals, including:\n\n- ensuring all our purchased electricity comes from renewable sources, as part of our membership of RE100. In 2021, we have accelerated against this commitment and expect to reach this goal before the end of 2022.\n- eliminating deforestation from our relevant supply chains by 2025, helping to halt biodiversity loss and the climate impacts associated with this land use change.\n- halving food waste across our business by 2030 and supporting our customers and their consumers to reduce food loss downstream in our value chain.\n- increasing our water use efficiency and recognising the interconnected nature of water and climate risk. Our water targets are increasingly context based and designed to take account of water risk across our regions.\n\n| Target Area            | Climate Related Targets   | Climate Related Targets   | Climate Related Targets   | Performance   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n|                        | Target                    | Date                      | Base                      | 2021          |\n| Scope 1 & 2  Emissions | -55%                      | 2030                      | 2017                      | -39%          |\n| Water Intensity        | -15%                      | 2025                      | 2017                      | -4%           |\n| Food Waste             | -50%                      | 2030                      | 2017                      | -19%          |\n| Renewable  Electricity | 100%                      | 2022                      | N/A                       | 65%           |\n\nTargets are absolute with the exception of water, which is an intensity measure.

For more on our responsible sourcing targets, see page 66 of this review.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn 2021, we continued to make progress on our climate transition, supported by our existing governance structures, our integrated strategy and our science-based targets. We further embedded climate considerations within the Group's risk assessment framework and this was aided through the process of scenario analysis and dynamic risk assessment. Our disclosures are consistent with TCFD recommendations other than where we continue to enhance the climate related impact on strategy and financial planning, resilience and scenario analysis and the alignment of metrics and targets to specific climate related risks. In 2022, planned activities will include:\n\n- continuing to embed and enhance our group-wide governance structure, leveraging this to lead and engage our people on further climate action.\n- expanding our analysis to account for additional areas including potential risks associated with water and technology, while continuing to refine existing assessments and exploring the use of updated climate scenarios aligned with Kerry's 1.5\u2070C commitment.\n- exploring the potential for further mitigation measures, particularly for any risks identified with the potential to impact on our business strategy.\n- enhancing our risk process with further assessment and integration of explicit climate related issues within our enterprise risk management framework.\n- reviewing our Scope 3 carbon target and Net Zero commitment in line with evolving SBTi guidance and the release of their Net Zero standard.\n- building awareness and knowledge across our organisation with dedicated training through the Kerry learning academy.\n\nFinally, we also plan to progress our carbon footprinting at product level to support our customers in better understanding their own value chain emissions and providing us further insight into the contribution of our portfolio to lower impact consumer products.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Despite ongoing challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain disruption, our performance continues to highlight the resilience of our people, our business model and our proven track record of delivery through uncertainty.\n\nThe diversified nature of our operations and geographical footprint, together with our broad portfolio of products, customers and suppliers are important factors in mitigating the risk of a material threat to the Group's sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. However, as with any business, risks and uncertainties are inherent in our business activities and may have a significant financial, operational or reputational impact.\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for the management of risk and for setting the Group's risk appetite. On an annual basis, the Board agrees the principal and emerging risks facing the Group and a robust risk management governance framework is in place which enables the Group to effectively prioritise and manage\n\nrisk to within our risk appetite levels. The Board carries out a review of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems at least annually.\n\nThe Group's risk management governance framework has been designed using a three lines of defence (3LOD) model which has been implemented to ensure there is clear ownership and delegation of responsibility for the management and oversight of risk to support the appropriate flow of information throughout the Group.\n\nAn overview of the Group's risk management governance structure along with the key responsibilities within it is outlined in the diagram on page 76.",

        "page_content": "## Our Risk Management Governance Framework\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe Board has overall responsibility to ensure that appropriate risk management and internal control systems, designed to identify, manage and mitigate risks which may impact the achievement of the Group's objectives are in place. The Board also ensure an appropriate risk appetite has been set and consider how the Group's longer-term viability may be impacted by the crystallisation of one or more of these risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nResponsibility has been delegated by the Board to provide structured and systematic oversight of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. They review and monitor the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems throughout the year. The Chairman reports to the Board on its activities regarding audit matters and risk management. See pages 109-114 for description of the risk management activities conducted by the Audit Committee in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Oversight Committee (ROC)\n\nThe ROC supports the Audit Committee in the risk management process through ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the risk environment and the controls in place to manage those risks, in addition to the consideration of emerging risks which may impact the Group in the future. The ROC is comprised of senior leadership, and is chaired by the CFO. The ROC maintains the Group risk register and provides regular updates on changes in the principal or emerging risks to the Audit Committee and the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Executive Management\n\nExecutive management are responsible for the effective operation of internal controls designed to manage and mitigate the principal risks and uncertainties. The 3LOD model ensures accountability for risk management is embedded into processes and procedures. Key management committees support risk management including the Group Finance Committee, the ICT Security Steering Committee, the Sustainability Council, and the Quality, Safety, Health & Environment Leadership Team.\n\n## 1st LINE OF DEFENCE:\n\nOperational Management is responsible for risk identification, managing the internal control environment and monitoring changes in the risk profile of the Group.\n\n## 2nd LINE OF DEFENCE:\n\nGroup functional teams ensure the first line is operating as designed, manage performance reviews, internal control verifications and facilitate risk assessments. This includes Quality, Health & Safety, Information & Cyber Security, Legal and Financial Control functions.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management Process\n\nOur enterprise risk management process is embedded across the Group to support the delivery of our strategic objectives and our annual risk assessment is an integral part of this process. This risk assessment incorporates a groupwide top down and bottom up evaluation to determine the likelihood of occurrence and potential impact of risks on the Group at a residual level. Input is obtained from senior business and functional management through a series of workshops, one-to-one interviews and surveys, which are consolidated to produce the Group Risk Register. Our risk universe forms the basis of conversations and additional new and emerging risks are added as they are identified and assessed. A standard risk scoring methodology has been devised to provide context and ensure consistency in reporting and evaluation of risks.\n\nThe output from this process is consolidated to determine the principal risks and uncertainties for the Group. Executive Management and the ROC review and validate these risks, providing further input where necessary before submission to the Audit Committee and Board for final consideration and approval.\n\n## 3rd LINE OF DEFENCE:\n\nGroup Internal Audit function with other external assurance providers perform reviews which give independent assurance over the operation of the internal control framework, risk management systems and governance processes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "During the year the ROC and the Board considered the Group's principal risks in the context of our risk appetite and our approach is to minimise exposure to reputational, financial and operational risk, while accepting and recognising a risk and reward trade-off in pursuit of our strategic and commercial objectives. As the world's leading taste and nutrition company, the integrity of our business is critical and cannot be put at risk. Consequently, we have a zero tolerance for risks such as food safety and employee health and safety. We operate in a challenging and highly competitive market place and as a result, recognise that strategic, commercial and investment risks will be required to seize opportunities and deliver business results. We are therefore prepared to make certain financial and operational investments in pursuit of growth objectives, accepting the risk that the anticipated benefits from these investments may not always be fully realised. Our acceptance of risk is subject to ensuring that potential benefits and risks are fully understood and appropriate measures to mitigate those risks are established.\n\nEach of the Group's principal risks is assigned an executive owner who is responsible for ensuring mitigating actions are sufficient to bring risks to within the agreed appetite and the 3LOD model ensures that these mitigations and internal controls are embedded and operate effectively throughout the organisation.\n\nThe annual Board and the Audit Committee agendas include a series of updates from executive risk owners in relation to the Group's principal risks. These updates include the history of the risk to date, key mitigating actions and controls, an outline of the residual risk and any future actions planned to address control weaknesses.\n\nThe Audit Committee also receive regular updates on risk management and internal control effectiveness from the Head of Internal Audit (HIA) along with agreed mitigating actions to resolve any weaknesses identified.\n\nThe Audit Committee and Board formally approved the principal risks and risk appetite and have confirmed in the Corporate Governance Report on page 108 that a robust assessment of the Group's principal and emerging risks was completed, including those risks that could threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity of the Group.\n\n## Principal and Emerging Risks\n\nThe table on pages 78-84 describes the principal risks and uncertainties, which the Board has determined could impact the achievement of strategic objectives and have been identified through the risk assessment process, as well as the mitigating actions in place and an update on any change in the profile of each risk during the year. Additionally, each risk has been linked to the Group Strategy and Margin Expansion targets as outlined in the Strategic Report on pages 28-31. These risks form the basis of Board and Audit Committee communications and discussions.\n\nThis table presents the Board's view of the Group's principal risks and uncertainties and is not an exhaustive list of all the risks which may impact the Group. There are additional risks which are not yet considered material, or which are not yet known to the Board, which could become significant in the future. Likewise, some of the current risks may reduce in importance as management actions are implemented or changes in the operating environment occur. The Board will continue to monitor risk in the context of relevant factors such as the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, growth through geographic expansion and ongoing acquisitions, as well as other changes in the external environment, which may create future risks.\n\n## Climate Risk\n\nThe Board recognise the significant risks posed by climate change and consideration of these risks forms part of our existing risk management processes. It is acknowledged that there is opportunity to further integrate the ongoing climate related risk processes within our risk management processes and this will be a key area of focus in the coming year. The increasing importance of climate change risk was reflected in the Board's decision to include Climate Change and Environmental as a standalone principal risk during 2021, having been included as a sub-risk within Sustainability/Environmental risk previously. In addition, climate change impacts a number of our other principal risks such as Portfolio Management and Operational and Supply Chain Continuity.\n\nDuring the year, a global cross-functional team was created to further align our assessment and disclosure practices with the requirements of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This included conducting a detailed climate change risk assessment and scenario analysis with the support of an expert external party. The TCFD section on pages 68-74 summarises the work undertaken to date to understand the potential impact of climate change on the Group and outlines future areas of management focus.",

Similar to the previous year we have not considered COVID-19 as an individual risk but rather considered the amplifying effect it has had on a number of other principal risks such as Health & Safety risk, People risk, Operational and Supply Chain Continuity risk and Margin Management risk. 2021 Annual Report 2021 Annual Report 2021 Annual Report\n\nSustainability/Environmental risk was introduced as a principal risk in 2020 having previously been considered as an emerging risk. As consideration of climate change risk has been further embedded in our enterprise risk management process, this principal risk has been split out to include Climate Change and Environmental and Business Ethics and Social Responsibility as two standalone risks for this year.\n\n## Emerging Risks\n\nEmerging risks are considered as part of the risk assessment process and are identified through horizon scanning, continual dialogue with the business and keeping abreast of market and industry changes. A summary of emerging risks which are identified through this process is presented to the Audit Committee and Board for assessment and these risks continue to be monitored as part of our ongoing risk management processes. Emerging risks we are monitoring include endemic COVID-19, ESG regulatory changes, labour model disruption and technology innovation and disruption. 2019 Annual Report Risk Icons 2019 Annual Report Risk Icons 2019 Annual Report Risk Icons 2021 Annual Report Risk Icons\n\nRisk Icons\n\nRisk Icons\n\nRisk Icons\n\n## Link to Group Strategy as per the Strategic Report Risk is unchanged Risk has increased Risk has decreased Risk is unchanged Risk has increased Risk has decreased Risk is unchanged Risk has increased\n\nRisk has decreased\n\nRisk is unchanged\n\nRisk has increased\n\nRisk has decreased\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principal Risks and Uncertainties - Strategic\n\nTaste\n\nNutrition\n\nEmerging\n\nMarkets\n\nMargin\n\nExpansion\n\n## Portfolio Management\n\n## Description\n\nConsumer preferences, tastes, behaviours and demand for more sustainable products are changing at an unprecedented rate.\n\nThe Group's overall growth and profitability is determined by the effective management of its portfolio across technologies, end use markets, geographies, channels and customers to respond to these consumer-led dynamics. 2021 Annual Report Risk Icons\n\nRisk Trend\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRisk is unchanged\n\nRisk has increased\n\nRisk has decreased\n\nTaste\n\nNutrition\n\nEmerging\n\nMarkets\n\nTaste\n\nNutrition\n\nEmerging\n\n## Impact\n\nMarkets\n\nMargin\n\nExpansion\n\nIf the Group does not make optimal strategic investment decisions, then opportunities for growth and improved margin could be missed.\n\nRisk is unchanged\n\nRisk has increased\n\nRisk has decreased\n\nRisk is unchanged\n\nRisk has increased\n\nRisk has decreased\n\nRisk is unchanged\n\nRisk has increased\n\nRisk has decreased\n\nMarkets\n\nRisk is unchanged\n\nRisk has increased\n\nRisk has decreased\n\nMargin\n\nExpansion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTaste\n\nNutrition\n\nEmerging\n\nTaste\n\nNutrition\n\nEmerging\n\nTaste\n\nNutrition\n\nEmerging\n\nTaste\n\nNutrition\n\nEmerging\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShareholder\n\nConsumer Foods\n\n## How We Manage the Risk\n\n2019 Annual Report\n\nMarkets\n\nExpansion\n\nMarkets\n\nMargin\n\nExpansion\n\nMarkets\n\nMargin\n\nExpansion\n\nMarkets\n\nMargin\n\nExpansion\n\n- -   The Group's strategic planning process is designed to ensure that investment decisions balance both our financial ambitions and our Beyond the Horizon sustainability commitments.

In assessing the prospects of the Group and its ability to meet its liabilities as they fall due, the Board has taken account of the Group's medium term strategic planning cycle, capital investment plans, the business model, its diverse portfolio and the innovation pipeline. The Directors have also considered the Group's strong cash generation and debt maturity profile in addition to the principal risks and uncertainties detailed on pages 78-84. This included a consideration of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in addition to\n\n## Scenario Modelled\n\n## Scenario 1: External and Macroeconomic Risks\n\nDepressed economic performance, further deterioration in COVID-19 situation, prolonged global supply chain disruption, political unrest\n\n## Scenario 2: Climate Change and Environmental Risk*\n\nImpacts of extreme weather events, water stress and climate change\n\n## Scenario 3: One-off Expense\n\nImpact of a potential large event, fine and/or penalty\n\nthe potential impact of climate related risks on profitability and liquidity. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are outlined in the Financial Review on pages 36-43.\n\n## Period of Viability Assessment\n\nThe Board has considered the length of time to be reviewed in the context of the viability assessment. Although the Group's strategic planning cycle covers a period of five years, the Board consider that three years is the most appropriate period to assess the longer-term viability of the Group as current capital expenditure plans, commercial arrangements and financial projections are considered to be more reliable and robust over this period.\n\n## Relevant Principal Risks\n\n- - Climate Change and Environmental\n- - Business Acquisition and Divestiture\n- - Geopolitical/Emerging Markets\n- - Operational and Supply Chain Continuity\n- - Business Ethics and Social Responsibility\n- - Margin Management\n- - Portfolio Management\n- - People\n- - Intellectual Property\n- - Treasury\n- - Climate Change and Environmental\n- - Portfolio Management\n- - Operational and Supply Chain Continuity\n- - Margin Management\n- - Climate Change and Environmental\n- - Information Systems and Cybersecurity\n- - Food Safety, Quality and Regulatory\n- - Business Ethics and Social Responsibility\n- - Portfolio Management\n- - Intellectual Property\n- - Taxation\n- - Treasury\n\n## Assessment of Viability\n\nThe viability of the Group has been assessed, considering the Group's current financial position, including external funding in place over the assessment period, and after modelling the impact of certain scenarios arising from the Group's principal risks and uncertainties as outlined on pages 78-84.\n\nWhile each of the principal risks and uncertainties could have an impact on the Group's performance, three severe but plausible scenarios were modelled that the Board assessed would have the most direct and material impact on the Group. The three scenarios as outlined above were stress tested both individually and in combination to assess their potential impact on the Group's solvency, liquidity and cash flow.\n\nThis analysis indicated that significant liquidity headroom existed in all scenarios tested. In addition, the Board consider that the diverse nature of the Group's geographies, markets, customer base, and product portfolio provide significant mitigation against the impact of a serious business interruption.\n\n## Viability Statement\n\nBased on their assessment of prospects and viability, the Directors have concluded that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three year period of the assessment.\n\n- * This scenario was modelled based on a three year time horizon.

On behalf of the Board, I can confirm that for the year under review the Group has complied with all relevant Provisions of the Code other than one remuneration related Provision which will be complied with from 1 January 2023 when Executive Director pension entitlements are aligned with those available to the general workforce in Ireland.\n\nSince the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Board has focused on managing the impact of the pandemic on all stakeholders and has overseen the Group's response by providing critical guidance and support to Executive Management. Physical Board meetings were not possible during the height of COVID-19 related restrictions but resumed in the latter part of 2021 as these restrictions were eased.\n\nThe Board sets the tone and shared values for the way in which the Group operates and recognises the importance of culture to the success of the business model. During 2021, the\n\nBoard continued to assess and monitor the Group's culture to ensure that it is aligned with the Group's strategy and values and is adequately embedded across the Group.\n\nAs a Board, we recognise the benefits of understanding the views of all our stakeholders and we ensure that their interests are considered in Board discussions and in our decision making. Details of stakeholder engagement activities during the year, including the work of the designated Workforce Engagement Director, are outlined on pages 99-104.\n\nThe Board, in conjunction with the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee, ensures that there are robust plans in place to facilitate Board, executive and senior management succession. During 2021, the Board undertook a formal process to recruit two new non-Executive Directors, both of whom bring skills and experience that will strengthen the Board. Details of the non-Executive Director and Committee changes that occurred during the year, are set out in the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee Report on page 119.\n\nI have served ten years as a Director, including nearly four years as Chairman, and as previously announced I will retire from the Board, and as Chairman, at the next AGM and will be succeeded by Chairman Designate, Tom Moran. His appointment as Chairman Designate followed a formal succession process by a sub-committee of the Board, led by the Senior Independent Director Dr. Hugh Brady.\n\nThe Board recognises its role in providing guidance and strategic oversight in relation to the implementation of the Group's 2030 sustainability strategy, Beyond the Horizon . Following its official launch in October 2020, the Board expanded the role of the Nomination Committee and renamed it the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee. During the year this Committee monitored how the implementation of the 2030 sustainability strategy was progressing, reviewed performance achieved versus agreed sustainability related commitments and targets,\n\nand considered the enhanced environmental, social and governance reporting disclosures included in the 2021 Annual Report and the separate GRI Sustainability Report.\n\nDiversity at Board level has been a focus for the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee for a number of years and also continues to be a key factor when considering Board refreshment. During 2021, the Committee also monitored the progress made against the diversity targets at senior management level to ensure the appropriate level of skills and diversity exists to support the delivery of the Group's strategy and financial targets. Diversity at Board level in terms of gender, nationality and ethnic background have all been improved. In addition, the Board is committed to achieving the recommended gender diversity target in 2022.\n\nThe Group announced, at the Capital Markets Day held in October, its commitment to achieve equal gender representation across all senior management roles by 2030. Improving and monitoring diversity beyond gender and below Board level will continue to be a key area of focus for the Board and the Executive Management in 2022.\n\nEach year the Board undertakes a formal evaluation of its effectiveness and that of its Committees. In 2021, this was an internal self-assessment which was conducted by the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director. The evaluation concluded that the Board and its Committees are performing effectively. Details of the process and the resulting actions from this review are outlined on page 107.\n\nDetails of the Group's activities and the operations of the Board, contained in the following report, outline the manner in which the Group has achieved compliance with the Code through the activities and operations of the Board and its Committees during the year.\n\nPhilip Toomey Chairman of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->",

Board papers are issued to each Director at least one week in advance of Board meetings and include the meeting agenda, minutes of the previous Board meeting and all papers relevant to the agenda. The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, has primary responsibility for setting the agenda for each meeting. All Directors continually receive comprehensive reports and documentation on all matters for which they have responsibility to allow them to fully complete their duties as a Director. All Directors participate in discussing strategy, trading updates, financial performance, significant risks and operational activities in addition to the Group's purpose, vision, values and culture. Board meetings are of sufficient duration to ensure that all agenda items and any other material non-agenda items that may arise are adequately addressed. In addition to formal meetings, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer maintain regular contact with all Directors. The Chairman holds informal meetings or calls with nonExecutive Directors without the Executive Directors to discuss issues affecting the Group.\n\nAll directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible for advising the Board on all governance matters. In accordance with an agreed procedure, in the furtherance of their duties, each Director has the authority to engage independent professional advice at the Company's expense.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe Board collaborated with Executive management in the development of the Group's updated strategy and associated mid-term financial targets to help ensure that the direction of the plan was appropriate and a good fit for the Group in the long term. During the year the Board provided input and strategic guidance to Executive management in relation to the strategic priorities, key growth platforms, capital investment requirements, the key risks facing the plan and how they should be addressed and managed. The Board approved the updated strategic plan at the October Board meeting prior to its release at the Capital Markets Day held virtually later that month. The Chairman Philip Toomey, along with a number of Directors, attended the Capital Markets Day on behalf of the Board.\n\nThe Board also oversaw and approved the strategic M&A transactions during the year including the disposal of the Consumer Foods Meats and Meals business and the acquisition of Niacet, which significantly enhanced the Group's capability in food preservation.\n\nPresentations were also received from the Company's advisors throughout the year on matters such as the specialty ingredients sector, food trends and their implications for the Group, the future of work and its implications for mergers and acquisitions, as well as corporate defence and shareholder activism. Through these reviews and ongoing discussions on strategy, the Board is confident that Kerry's strategic priorities and\n\nkey growth platforms will continue to be the key drivers of organic growth and acquisition investment in the future.\n\nThe Board ensures that the decisions it makes are aligned with the achievement of the Group's strategy and are made in the long-term interest of the Group and its stakeholders. This is particularly the case when deciding how to prioritise the allocation of resources (human and financial capital) across competing research and development activities, acquisition opportunities and major capital expenditure projects.\n\nDuring the year, the Board also reviewed the business model and how it is executed. The Board is satisfied that the business model is both sustainable in the long-term and optimally structured to enable delivery of the Group's strategy. Details of the Group's strategy are outlined in Strategy and Financial Targets on pages 28-31.\n\n## Purpose, Values and Culture\n\nOur Purpose, Inspiring Food, Nourishing Life underpins our culture and is reflected in our values.\n\nThe Group's purpose is guided by the Group's Vision to be our customers' most valued partner, creating a world of sustainable nutrition. The Board is satisfied that the updated strategy is aligned to the Group's purpose which is also guided by our Values of Courage, Enterprising Spirit, Inclusiveness, Open-mindedness and Ownership. The Board is led by the Group's purpose during its discussions and when making decisions on the matters that are reserved for its consideration. Further details of the Group's purpose and values are outlined on pages 4 and 16.\n\nThe Group's culture is based on a common understanding of our values, underpinned by our practices of Safety First, Quality Always and a robust risk management framework consisting of policies and procedures, including a Code of Conduct which defines business conduct standards for anyone working for, or on behalf of the Group.\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of its role in setting the tone of Kerry's culture and embedding it throughout the Group. In addition to the Board, the Executive Team have responsibility to ensure that the policies and behaviours set at Board level are effectively communicated and implemented throughout the Group. The Group's refreshed Code of Conduct, which was approved by the Board during the year, aligns with the Group's purpose and values and the MyKerry internal website provides a platform for employees to access the Group's policies.\n\nThe Board monitors and assesses the culture of the Group through a number of mechanisms including compliance with Group policies, internal audit, formal and informal channels for employees to raise concerns, including the Leader Pulse Check, employee engagement survey and the Group's Speak Up arrangements and feedback from the designated Workforce Engagement Director.",

The Board ensured that the Group prioritised protecting the safety, health and wellbeing of employees at all times, enabling all 152 manufacturing and R&D facilities to continue to operate through the pandemic.\n\nIn approving the disposal of the Consumer Foods Meats and Meals business, the Board considered the impact of the decision on the 4,500 employees who worked in those businesses and ensured that appropriate actions were taken to mitigate the impact on the employees involved.\n\nAs part of the Group's ambition to achieve the highest standards of inclusion, diversity, engagement and belonging, the Board approved an enhanced target of equal gender representation within all senior management roles by 2030.

This includes assisting customers to enhance the nutritional profile of their products and to reduce food waste. The Group also partnered with customers to reduce complexity and preparation times in the face of labour shortages and social distancing requirements.\n\nThe Kerry Health and Nutrition Institute (KHNI) shares Kerry's scientific expertise and advances awareness of the science of healthier food. Supported by an independent Scientific Advisory Council, KHNI is enabling those within the sector to acquire new knowledge from the Group's scientists, academics and other experts, as they explore challenges in the food and beverage industry.\n\n## Key Topics\n\nOur customers are responding to the acceleration of key trends in the food and beverage industry, with increased demand for sustainable nutrition solutions, including enhancing health and immunity, plant protein options, and products addressing a diverse range of environmental and social sustainability criteria.\n\nKey topics included the ongoing impact of global end-to-end supply chain challenges, changing consumer needs and preferences and the customers' ability to operate in an environment impacted by COVID-19.\n\nOur customers also want to reduce food waste and the impact that their production activities have on the planet and in particular on climate change.\n\n## Our Response\n\nFeedback from customer engagement activities was discussed at each Board meeting as part of the business updates provided by the Executive Directors.\n\nThe Board approves the Group's significant investment in Research & Development activities and together with management, ensures that this resource is focused on those projects that can best meet customers' needs and thereby enable the Group to achieve its purpose and strategic objectives in relation to revenue growth, margin expansion, return on investment and enabling food production in a more environmentally sustainable manner.\n\nDuring 2021, the Board approved a number of acquisitions, the most significant being the acquisition of Niacet, a global leader in food preservation technologies. This acquisition significantly enhances the Group's capabilities in food protection and preservation solutions thereby enabling a reduction in food waste. The acquisition of Biosearch Life enhances the Group's capabilities in proactive nutrition and brings leading clinical research capabilities and functional food technologies across multiple life stages and need states.\n\nAs Kerry continues to evolve, the acquisitions and investments completed in 2021 help to underpin the Group's growth strategy as Kerry continues to partner with customers to create a world of sustainable nutrition.\n\nThe Board also considers customer engagement matters as part of the overall Group sustainability strategy and together with the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee, receives updates on these matters from the Group Head of Sustainability. With the increasing importance of environmental and social issues for our customers, the Board also considers the integration of sustainability within our value proposition and received updates on this from the Chief Commercial Officer and the Group Head of Sustainability throughout the year.\n\nFurther details are outlined in Our Business Model on pages 22-23, Strategy and Financial Targets on pages 28-31, the Sustainability Review on pages 54-57 and the separate GRI Sustainability Report on the Group's website.",

The Board ensures that material decisions, which could impact on stakeholder groups, are taken with due regard to their interests.",

        "page_content": "## GOVERNANCE IN ACTION:\n\n## Designated Workforce Engagement Director - Activities in 2021\n\nThroughout 2021, the designated Workforce Engagement Director, Mr. Tom Moran, participated in engagements to assess employee sentiment at all employee levels, across all group-wide locations and in different workplace contexts. As a result of the global pandemic, the 2021 plan was built on the 2020 activities, enabling him to review the continued progress and further evolution of the Group's employee engagement strategies. In addition, the 2021 plan had a particular focus on the Americas and APMEA regions given the limited opportunities for Mr. Tom Moran to interact with employees in these regions during 2020. Whilst participation in employee engagement activities continued to be virtual in 2021, it is expected to return to some level of in person activities during 2022. Details of the employee engagement activities undertaken by Mr. Tom Moran during 2021 are outlined below:\n\n- - attendance at regional executive team meetings and employee townhalls;\n- - attendance at team meetings held by the Group Information and Communications Technology function;\n- -  participation in briefings on the Group's Integrated Operations Transformation programme, including attendance at monthly plant leader engagement calls in the Americas;\n- -  attendance at regional and global events on the topic of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, including Black History Month, International Women's Day and Pride;\n- -  participation in a thought leadership session with our employee engagement survey provider on global trends in employee engagement and impacts on engagement arising from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- -  participation in briefings on employee engagement strategies from various global business and functional leaders and their teams across all regions;\n- -  participation in briefings on employee career development initiatives across a number of functions, for example our global Research, Development and Applications function.\n\n## Global Priorities for Employee Engagement in 2021 were\n\n- -  Leadership - inclusive leadership through building effective teams, setting clear goals, and engaging with employees to help them collaborate and be at their best. Ensuring that all employees clearly understand how their role plays a part in achieving Kerry's purpose and vision for the future;\n- -  Talent Development - attracting, developing and retaining talent, recognising people for their contributions, building a positive and inclusive workplace that reflects the broad mix of capabilities and cultural diversity within Kerry, where employees feel they belong; and\n- -  Simplification - employees feeling involved, empowered and enabled to make decisions and take ownership to achieve objectives. Providing opportunities for employees to make suggestions and changes to drive greater simplification across the business.\n\nMr. Tom Moran held regular meetings with the Chief Human Resources Officer and the Group Human Resources Team to provide his feedback from the engagement activities. He also presented regular reports to the Board on the activities undertaken and shared his feedback and findings where applicable.\n\nHe is satisfied that the employee engagement process is being successfully operated within the Group and, despite the pandemic constraints, has been very productive. He, and the officers leading the process, have kept the Board informed on its progress and on the views of the workforce.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nAll Directors attend the AGM and are available to meet with shareholders and answer questions as required. Notice of the AGM, proxy statement and the Annual Report and financial statements are sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. A separate resolution is proposed at the AGM on each substantially separate issue including a particular resolution relating to the adoption of the Directors' and Auditors' reports and the financial statements. Details of the proxy votes for and against each resolution, together with details of votes withheld are announced after the result of the votes by hand. These details are published on the Group's website following the conclusion of the AGM. At the AGM held on 29 April 2021, there were no material votes cast against any resolutions.\n\n## Whistleblowing Arrangement\n\nThe Group's whistleblowing arrangement includes an externally facilitated multi-lingual hotline 'Speak Up' through which all employees and third parties can raise concerns in confidence about possible wrong doings in financial reporting and other matters, 24 hours a day by phone or online.\n\nAll whistleblowing incidents are reviewed by the Legal and Ethical Compliance team and formally investigated by the relevant functional heads depending on the nature of the concern raised.\n\nIn 2021, the Audit Committee reviewed the whistleblowing incidents and outcomes and provided updates to the Board which enabled the Board to assess the adequacy of the whistleblowing arrangements and to review the reports arising from its operation. The Board is satisfied that the Group's whistleblowing arrangements are operating effectively.",

The Chairman is responsible for leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness in all respects. The Executive Directors, led by the Chief Executive Officer, are responsible for the management of the Group's business and the implementation of Group strategy and policy.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nThe principal role of the Senior Independent Director (SID) is to provide a sounding board for the Chairman and to act as an intermediary for other Directors as required. The SID is responsible for the appraisal of the Chairman's performance throughout the year. The SID is also responsible for leading a formal succession process for the role of Chairman. The SID is available to meet shareholders upon request, in particular if they have concerns that cannot be resolved through the Chairman or the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe non-Executive Directors' main responsibilities are to review the performance of management and the Group's financial information, assist in strategy development, and ensure that appropriate and effective systems of internal control and risk management are in place. The non-Executive Directors review the relationship with external auditors through the Audit Committee and monitor the remuneration structures and policy through the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe non-Executive Directors provide a valuable breadth of experience and independent judgement to Board discussions.\n\n## Company Secretary\n\nEach Director has access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, whose responsibilities include ensuring that Board procedures are followed, assisting the Chairman in relation to corporate governance matters, ensuring the Company complies with its legal and regulatory obligations and facilitating appropriate quality information flows between the business and the Board.\n\n## Commitments\n\nUnder the terms of their appointment all Directors agreed to the time commitment schedule which requires them to allocate sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities effectively. This matter is considered by the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee on an ongoing basis in accordance with its Terms of Reference.\n\nAll Directors must seek prior approval of the Board in advance of undertaking any additional external appointments. Before approving any additional external appointment, the Board considers the time commitment required for the role. Each proposed external appointment is reviewed independently.\n\n## Independence\n\nThe Board, as a whole, has assessed the non-Executive Directors' independence and confirmed that, in its opinion, all non-Executive Directors are independent in accordance with the Code.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nUnder the terms of their appointment all Directors have continuing obligations to update the Chairman as soon as they become aware of a situation that could give rise to a conflict or a potential conflict of interest.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has three Committees, the Audit Committee, the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee and the Remuneration Committee, which support the operation of the Board through their focus on specific areas of governance.\n\nEach Committee is governed by its Terms of Reference, available from the Group's website www.kerrygroup.com or upon request, which sets out how it should operate including its role, membership, authority and duties. Reports on the activities of the individual Committees are presented to the Board by the respective Committee Chairs.\n\nFurther details on the duties, operation and activities of all Board Committees can be found in their respective reports on pages 109-151 and these reports form part of the Governance Report.\n\n## Meetings and Attendance\n\nThe Board meets regularly to ensure that all its duties are discharged effectively. All Directors are expected to prepare for and attend meetings of the Board, the Committees of which they are members and the AGM. In the event that a Board member cannot attend or participate in the meeting, the Director may discuss and share opinions on agenda items with the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Senior Independent Director or Company Secretary in advance of the meeting.\n\nA total of 11 meetings were held in 2021, with meetings held virtually up until the latter part of the year due to COVID-19 related restrictions to ensure that the health and safety of our Board and colleagues was protected. Individual attendance at the Board and Committee meetings is set out in the table below.",

The purpose of the induction programme is to enable new Directors to gain a full understanding of the Group, governance related matters and Directors' duties and responsibilities. The induction programme includes presentations on the Group's operations and results, meetings with Executive Management and an outline of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group. Details of the induction programme undertaken by Mr. Michael Kerr are outlined in the Governance in Action below.\n\n## GOVERNANCE IN ACTION (example):\n\n## New Director Induction\n\nMr. Michael Kerr was appointed to the Board on 3 May 2021.

        "page_content": "Ms. Fiona Dawson who was appointed to the Board with effect from 4 January 2022, will complete a full formal induction programme tailored to her requirements over the coming months.\n\nThroughout the year, the Board as a whole engages in development through a series of consultations with subject matter experts on a range of topics including corporate governance and strategy. Presentations are also made by Executive Directors and senior management on various topics throughout the year in relation to their areas of responsibility.\n\nOn an annual basis, an 'off-site' Board meeting is scheduled at a Group location and is combined with a comprehensive schedule of activities over a week-long period, to allow non-Executive Directors further develop their understanding of the Group's activities and meet with local senior management and emerging talent. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 'off site' Board meeting did not take place in 2021.\n\nAs part of their personal development plans, individual non-Executive Directors were also afforded the opportunity to visit a number of the Group's international facilities and operations. In 2021, Mr. Michael Kerr visited the Savoury Taste Centre of Excellence and manufacturing facility in Clark, New Jersey, USA and the Global Technology and Innovation Centre in Beloit, Wisconsin, USA. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all other non-Executive Directors' international site visits did not occur. Individual Board members training requirements are reviewed with the Chairman and Company Secretary and training is provided to address these needs.\n\n## Board Performance Evaluation\n\nIn accordance with provisions of the Code, a performance evaluation of the Board is carried out annually and facilitated externally every third year.\n\nIn 2021, the Board conducted an internal self-evaluation of the performance of the Board, Board Committees, the Chairman and individual Directors against a set of pre-defined key criteria. The review was led by the Chairman of the Board and the Senior Independent Director and was facilitated by the Company Secretary. The review was undertaken using Thinking Board, Independent Audit Limited's governance self-assessment process. Independent Audit Limited, based in the UK, is recognised as a leading firm of board reviewers, and has no other connections to the Group.\n\nTopics covered during the Board Performance Evaluation included Board composition and succession planning, board meetings and papers, strategy and financial oversight, mergers and acquisitions, people and culture, stakeholder engagement and risk management.\n\nThe Chairman appraised the performance of each of the non-Executive Directors by meeting each Director individually. The key areas reviewed were independence, contribution and attendance at Board meetings, interaction with Executive Directors, the\n\nCompany Secretary and senior management, ability to communicate issues of importance and concern, their knowledge and effectiveness at meetings and the overall time and commitment to their role on the Board.\n\nIn addition, the Senior Independent Director formally appraised the performance of the Chairman. This appraisal was similar to the non-Executive Director evaluation process which included feedback from all Directors on the Chairman's performance during the year.\n\nIn December 2021, the non-Executive Directors met without the presence of the Executive Directors and, led by the Chairman, undertook a formal review of the performance of the individual Executive Directors.\n\nTo conclude on the appraisal of the non-Executive Directors, the Chairman and the Executive Directors, results are collated, summarised and presented to the Board. The appraisal process concluded that each Director is performing well and is committed to their role in terms of dedication of time and attendance at meetings.\n\nAt the December Board meeting, the Board considered the outcomes of the Board evaluation report (including the Board Committees). Overall, the Board concluded that no area of significant weakness had been identified and that it and its committees operated effectively throughout the period under review. A number of points for improvement were identified and action plans established to address them. The areas for further improvement identified from the 2021 performance evaluation included recommendations relating to Board composition and succession planning, executive succession planning, structure and content of Board papers, director training, stakeholder engagement and the appropriate time allocation between strategic priorities and other matters at Board meetings.\n\nProgress against recommendations from the previous evaluation were also considered and the Board is satisfied that improvements have been made which have enhanced the operation and effectiveness of both the Board and its Committees.\n\nThe Chairman, along with the Company Secretary, will ensure that areas for improvement identified from the 2021 evaluation report and areas for consideration arising from the Directors' appraisal, where identified, will be considered during 2022.\n\nIn line with the requirements of the Code, the performance evaluation of the Board in 2022 will be externally facilitated, three years since the last externally facilitated evaluation in 2019.",

The Directors confirm that they have carried out a robust assessment of these risks and the actions that are in place to mitigate them.\n\nThe Directors confirm that they have also reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control which operated during the period covered by these financial statements and up to the date of this report.

The report outlines how the Committee discharged its responsibilities during the year in relation to financial and other reporting, risk management and internal control, the Internal Audit function and our relationship and interaction with the external auditor.\n\nThe Committee supported the Board in assessing the principal and emerging risks facing the Group, particularly in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This included reviewing the Group's risk management and internal control systems and overseeing the operation of the Internal Audit function.\n\nThe Committee continued its work to strengthen non-financial controls and governance arrangements which included oversight of a project to refresh the Group's Code of Conduct which is a practical guide to upholding the Group's commitment to the highest standards of integrity and ethical behaviour. Each regular meeting included reviews of risk and compliance related activities and further details with regard to these matters are set out on page 112.\n\nThe Committee focused on monitoring the integrity of the Group's Financial Statements and announcements relating to the Group's financial performance. It reviewed the work completed by management in respect of the Going Concern and Viability Statements, including a consideration of the continuing impact of COVID-19 and the potential impact of climate related risks and concluded that there was no threat to the Group's prospects or viability. Further details are set out on pages 84-85. The Committee also assisted the Board in determining that the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements, when taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy. The significant issues that the Committee considered in relation to the financial statements and how these issues were addressed are set out on page 111.\n\nThe Committee oversaw the relationship with the external auditor, including monitoring all matters associated with their appointment, remuneration, performance and independence.\n\nFollowing a detailed planning process, PwC again conducted a largely remote audit across the Group and the Committee reviewed the scope and results of the audit and the effectiveness of the process. The work completed in this regard is outlined on page 113.\n\nAs outlined on page 114, the Committee considered the requirements of the Companies Act 2014 in relation to the Directors' Compliance Statement and is satisfied that appropriate steps have been undertaken by the Company to ensure that it is materially compliant with its relevant obligations.\n\nMs. Joan Garahy retired as a Director and member of the Committee at the company's AGM on 29 April 2021 and I would like to extend my sincere thanks to her for her service to the Committee during her tenure.\n\nLooking ahead to 2022, the Committee's key priorities will include maintaining oversight of the Group's risk management and internal control processes, sustaining a strong culture of risk management across the Group, continuing to monitor the impact of climate change on assumptions and taking a proactive approach in anticipating and preparing for any legislative or regulatory changes which may be required to internal controls and reporting.\n\nI trust you will find this report useful in understanding the operation and activities of the Committee during the year and I welcome any comments from shareholders on the report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristopher Rogers Chairman of the Audit Committee",

        "page_content": "The Committee has been regularly briefed by Group management on interaction with the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority ('IAASA') in respect of their review of the 2020 Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements in line with their statutory functions and normal practice. All matters arising from this review have been concluded satisfactorily.\n\nThe Committee considered the impact of climate change on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements and agreed that the disclosures outlined on pages 68-74 made in response to the recommendations of the\n\nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures are appropriate and that the assumptions used in the financial statements as outlined in note 1 are consistent with these disclosures.\n\nThe Committee has, with the support of PwC as external auditor, reviewed the suitability of the accounting policies which have been adopted and whether management have made appropriate judgements and disclosures. The table below sets out the significant matters considered by the Committee in relation to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## Significant Financial Reporting Judgements\n\n| Impairment  of Goodwill  and Indefinite  Life Intangible  Assets   | Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, as disclosed in note 12 to the Consolidated Financial  Statements, represents the largest number on the Group balance sheet at \u20ac4.7 billion. The Committee  considered the process to complete the annual impairment review of the Group's goodwill and indefinite  life intangible assets and specifically the assumptions used for the future cash flows, discount rates,  terminal values and growth rates. This included consideration of the impact of the pace and extent  of economic recovery in some markets as a result of COVID-19 in addition to the potential impact of  climate change on such assessments and a consideration of the sensitivity analysis run by management.  Following discussions with senior management and the external auditor, the Committee found that  the methodology used for the above valuation and annual impairment review are appropriate and no  impairment was identified.   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Going Concern  and Viability  Statement                            | The Committee assessed the effectiveness of the process undertaken by management to evaluate  going concern which included reviewing and challenging management's assumptions and modelling  of projected cashflows and, in particular those related to the continuing impact of COVID-19 and the  potential impact of climate related risks on profitability and liquidity on future trading performance. The  Committee also considered the Group's financing facilities and future funding plans. Based on this, the  Committee confirmed there were no material uncertainties that cast a significant doubt on the Group or  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and therefore the application of the going concern  basis for the preparation of the financial statements continued to be appropriate and recommended the  approval of the viability statement.                                                                                        |\n| Business  Combinations                                             | The Group acquired five businesses during the financial year which were accounted for as business  combinations. The Committee reviewed the methodology and assumptions applied in determining  these provisionally estimated fair values and found the methodology and assumptions to be appropriate  following discussion with senior management and the external auditor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Taxation                                                           | Significant judgement and a high degree of estimation is required when arriving at the Group's tax  charge and liability. The Committee, in conjunction with tax professionals, reviewed and discussed the  basis for the judgments in relation to uncertain tax positions and challenged management on their  assertions and also considered the outcome of the external auditors' review of the tax charge and  liability. As a result, the Committee believes the impact of uncertain tax positions has been appropriately  reflected in the tax charge and liability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n## Fair, Balanced and Understandable\n\nAt the request of the Board, the Audit Committee reviewed the content of the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements to ensure that it is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nIn fulfilling this responsibility, the Committee considered the following:\n\n- -  the timetable for the co-ordination and preparation of the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements, including key milestones as presented at the December Audit Committee meeting;\n- -  the systematic approach to review and sign-off carried out by senior management with a focus on consistency and balance; and\n- -  a detailed report from senior finance management outlining the process through which they assessed the narrative and financial sections of the 2021 Annual Report to ensure that the criteria of fair, balanced and understandable has been achieved.\n\nManagement ensured that the draft Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements were available to the Audit Committee in sufficient time for review in advance of the Committee meeting to facilitate adequate discussion at the meeting.",

A detailed overview of the Group's risk management framework is set out in the Risk Management Report on pages 75-78.\n\nThroughout the year, the Committee:\n\n- -  reviewed and approved the assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties, including climate change and emerging risks, that could impact the achievement of the Group's strategic objectives as described on pages 78-84;\n- -  received presentations on a selection of principal risks and discussed with senior management the material internal controls that exist to mitigate these to levels within the Group's risk appetite;\n- -  reviewed and approved the risk appetite for each of the Group's principal risks and recommended the risk appetites as outlined for approval by the Board;\n- -  reviewed quarterly reports from the Head of Internal Audit based on internal audits completed outlining noncompliances with Group controls and managements' action plans to address them;\n- -  received updates from the Group Financial Controller on any control weaknesses identified through monthly financial review meetings;\n- -  considered reports from the Head of Internal Audit on fraud investigations or other significant control matters which occurred during the year and approved plans to address and remediate the issues identified;\n- -  considered the results of the Kerry Control Self Assessment (the internal control self-assessment review of material finance, operational and compliance controls) and concluded that the controls are operating effectively;\n- -  assessed the Group's risk management and internal control framework in line with the FRC Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting; and\n- -  received presentations from management on work completed to refresh the Group's Code of Conduct which includes sections on protecting our people, working with integrity, safeguarding our information and assets and caring for our communities;\n- -  reviewed the report from the external auditor in respect of significant financial accounting and reporting issues, together with significant internal control weakness observations.\n\nIn addition to the above, the Board received two updates from ICT management with regard to the Group's ICT governance and information security programme and its ability to address cybersecurity threats particularly in the context of its criticality to the business and an increase in the global risk level. Further detail with regard to the Group's information systems and cybersecurity controls are outlined on page 82 of the Risk Report.\n\nThe Audit Committee, having assessed the above information, is satisfied that the internal control and risk management framework is operating effectively and has reported this opinion to the Board.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Group Internal Audit function including its focus, plans, activities and resources. To fulfil these duties the Committee:\n\n- -  reviewed and approved the Group Internal Audit function's charter, strategy and annual plan;\n- -  considered the role and effectiveness of Internal Audit in the overall context of the Group's risk management framework and was satisfied that the function has appropriate standing within the Group;\n- -  considered and were satisfied that the competencies, experience and level of resources within the Internal Audit team were adequate to achieve the proposed plan;\n- -  received quarterly updates from the Head of Internal Audit on the delivery of the 2021 plan and on the principal findings from the work of Internal Audit and management's actions to remediate issues identified;\n- -  received updates on the nature and extent of non-audit activity performed by Internal Audit;\n- -  considered the impact of remote versus on-site auditing in certain jurisdictions as a result of ongoing COVID-19 travel restrictions;\n- -  ensured that the Head of Internal Audit had regular meetings with the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Committee met with the Head of Internal Audit without the presence of Executive Management;\n- -  ensured co-ordination between Group Internal Audit and the external auditor to maximise the benefits from clear communication and co-ordinated activities.\n- -  ensured that the Head of Internal Audit had access to the Chairman of the Board if required; and\n\nIn order to comply with the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors (CIIA) requirements, an External Quality Assessment (EQA) by an independent body is conducted at least every five years to confirm conformance with the International Professional Practice Framework (IPPF) of the CIIA. The most recent EQA was completed in 2017 and the next review will be completed in 2022. On an annual basis, to ensure ongoing compliance with the IPPF, the Group Internal Audit function has an internal Quality Assurance and Improvement Program (QAIP) in place.\n\nOn the basis of the above, the Committee concluded that for 2021 the Group Internal Audit function operated effectively and is satisfied that the quality, experience and expertise of the function is appropriate for the Group.",

        "page_content": "## External Auditor\n\nOn behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with, and performance of, the external auditor. This includes making recommendations to the Board on the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the external auditor, assessing their independence and effectiveness and approving the audit fee.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee met with the external auditor without management present to discuss any issues that may have arisen during the audit of the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Independence and Provision of Non-Audit Services\n\nThe Committee is responsible for ensuring that the external auditor is independent and for implementing appropriate safeguards where the external auditor also provides non-audit services to the Group.\n\nPwC confirmed to the Audit Committee that they are independent from the Group under the requirements of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority's Ethical Standards for Auditors. PwC were appointed as the Group's external auditor in 2016 and the Committee will ensure that in accordance with EU legislation in relation to Audit Reform as adopted in Irish legislation, the external auditor will be rotated at least once every ten years. The audit lead engagement partner for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 is Enda McDonagh who was appointed in 2021 following the rotation of the previous partner.\n\nIn accordance with the Group's policy on the hiring of former employees of the current external auditor, the Committee reviews and approves any appointment of an individual, within three years of having previously been employed by the current external auditor, to a senior managerial position in the Group.\n\nA formal policy governing the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor is in place and is reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee annually. This policy is in accordance with applicable laws and takes into account the relevant ethical guidance for auditors. This policy is designed to safeguard the objectivity and independence of the external auditor and to prevent the provision of services which could result in a potential conflict of auditor independence. The policy outlines the services which can be provided by the external auditor, the relevant approval process for these services, and those services which the external auditor is prohibited from providing.\n\nIn 2021, all non-audit services and fees were approved by the Audit Committee in line with policy. The Committee is satisfied that the non-audit fees paid to PwC, which were minimal, did not compromise their independence or objectivity. Full details of the fees paid to the external auditor during the year for non-audit services are outlined in note 3 to the financial statements. Having considered all of the above, the Committee concluded that the Group's external auditor is independent.\n\n## Effectiveness\n\nPost completion of the 2020 audit, in conjunction with PwC, review meetings were held with senior finance management across all regions and it was confirmed by both parties that no issues had arisen during the audit process. This review considered the process and technology changes which were implemented to support conducting the audit remotely and were satisfied that it did not compromise the quality of the audit.\n\nAt the October Audit Committee meeting, PwC outlined to the Committee in detail the 2021 external audit plan which, similar to 2020, would be conducted remotely. The Committee discussed the significant audit risks and key audit matters, audit scope and materiality amongst other matters. The Audit Committee agreed that the plan and the materiality at which any misstatements should be reported by PwC to the Committee was appropriate.\n\nPrior to the finalisation of the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements, the Audit Committee received a detailed presentation and final report from PwC. The Committee also considered feedback from the lead partner and senior executives in concluding that PwC effectively delivered against the objectives of the agreed audit plan.\n\nIn assessing the effectiveness of the external auditor, the Audit Committee also considered the following:\n\n- -  the quality of presentations to the Board and Audit Committee;\n- -  key audit findings, including their robustness and perceptiveness in handling of key accounting and audit judgements; and\n- -  the technical insights provided relevant to the Group;\n- -  their demonstration of a clear understanding of the Group's business and key risks.\n\nOn the basis of the above the Committee is satisfied with the effectiveness of the external auditors.\n\n## Appointment\n\nPwC were appointed as external auditor in March 2016 following a comprehensive tender process which was overseen by the Audit Committee. On an annual basis, the Committee reviews the appointment of the external auditor, taking into account the auditor's effectiveness and independence. On that basis, the Committee recommended to the Board that PwC should continue in office as the auditor to the Group in respect of the year ending 31 December 2022.\n\nThe Audit Committee approved the remuneration of the external auditor, details of which are set out in note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

On the basis of this review, the Committee confirmed to the Board that in its opinion the Company is in material compliance with its relevant obligations.\n\n## Whistleblowing and Fraud Arrangements\n\nIn accordance with the Provisions of the Code, the responsibility for overseeing whistleblowing is within the remit of the Board. During 2021, at the request of the Board, the Committee considered the Group's whistleblowing arrangements and assisted the Board in its assessment of the adequacy of these arrangements. Details of the Group's whistleblowing arrangements are outlined in the Corporate Governance Report on page 104.\n\nThe Committee also considered the Group's procedures for fraud prevention and detection to ensure that these arrangements allow for the proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and appropriate follow up action. Following this review, the Audit Committee confirmed to the Board that it was satisfied that the Group's fraud prevention procedures were adequate.",

This report sets out the Committee's key activities in 2021 as well as the Committee's priorities for 2022.\n\nThe Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee is responsible for evaluating the structure, size, composition and successional needs of the Board and its Committees and making recommendations on same, with due regard for Board diversity. The Committee also reviews the results of the annual Board evaluation process as it relates to the Board and Committee performance and composition. Additionally, the Committee is responsible for monitoring Corporate Governance developments and for providing guidance and oversight on the implementation of the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\nJinlong Wang joined the Board on 5 January 2021. His in-depth understanding of Asian markets has been very insightful in Board discussions relating to growth opportunities in that geographic region. During the year under review, the Committee continued to lead the Board refreshment process ensuring that the composition of the\n\nBoard and its Committees has the correct balance of skills, knowledge, experience, diversity and independence. To further progress Board diversity, we engaged with an executive recruitment consulting firm to conduct a search for new independent non-Executive Directors. Potential non-Executive Directors were considered by the Committee and a shortlist were interviewed after assessing their qualifications against the above criteria and their other time commitments. This culminated in the appointment of Michael Kerr and Fiona Dawson to the Board. Michael Kerr was appointed to the Board on 3 May 2021 and joined the Audit Committee on 1 November 2021. He brings to the Board a detailed knowledge of global equity markets, financial knowledge, extensive business leadership skills and insights into the North American market. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Board also approved the appointment of Fiona Dawson as a non-Executive Director effective on 4 January 2022. She brings to the Board a deep knowledge of the consumer food and beverage sector, an understanding of global markets and general management experience on a global scale.\n\nThe Committee also recommended changes to the composition of the Board Committees as outlined on page 119. The Committee continues to engage with executive recruitment consulting firms to identify an appropriate pipeline of candidates to join the Board as independent nonExecutive Directors in the future.\n\nJoan Garahy did not seek re-election at the 2021 AGM and retired from the Board as Senior Independent Director and as Chair of the Remuneration Committee having served nine years on the Board. She was succeeded as Senior Independent Director by Dr. Hugh Brady and as Chair of the Remuneration Committee by Tom Moran.\n\nI have served ten years as a Director including less than four years as Chairman, and in line with the Provisions of the Code will not seek re-election at the 2022 AGM. A sub-committee of the Board led by Dr. Hugh Brady as Senior Independent Director and supported by independent advisors undertook a formal and extensive succession process which considered internal and external candidates. Following the conclusion of this process, Tom Moran was appointed as Chairman Designate and will assume the role of Chairman on 28 April 2022.\n\nGerard Culligan and Con Murphy will also retire from the Board at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM and will not seek re-election. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Gerard and Con for their strong contribution over the last five years.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed senior management development and succession plans having regard to business growth and geographic expansion and taking account of diversity goals below Board level.\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee reviewed the Company's corporate governance policy and processes and monitored developments in corporate governance best practice. The Committee also provided guidance and oversight to the Group on the implementation of the 2030 sustainability strategy Beyond the Horizon , including monitoring progress against agreed targets and considering the enhanced environmental, social and governance reporting requirements, recognising the importance of consistent and relevant information on sustainability related matters. Furthermore, the Committee also contributed and reviewed the climate related risks and opportunities as well as the broader material topics refresh.\n\nAn internal review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees was conducted during 2021 and the outcome of this review is that the Board and its Committees consider that they are operating effectively. Further details are outlined on page 107.\n\nThe Committee's priorities for 2022 will continue to focus on Board and Committee refreshment, taking account of all skill sets required, diversity (beyond gender) and planned retirements over the coming years. The Committee will ensure that senior management development and succession planning can support the delivery of Group strategy and will also continue to focus on diversity and inclusion in the wider workforce. In addition, the Committee will continue to oversee the implementation of the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPhilip Toomey Chairman of the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability\n\nCommittee",

The key stages of the nomination process are outlined below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee assessed the skill set, experience and diversity on the Board, the requirements to meet the Group's future growth plans, together with the planned retirements from the Board over the coming years.\n\nThe Committee prepared a detailed role profile; identifying the need for a new nonExecutive Director with international food & beverage industry experience and the capabilities to align with the Group's purpose, value and culture. The Committee also considered the Board's commitment to enhance the gender profile of the Board.\n\nThe Committee instructed Korn Ferry to conduct a search for appropriate candidates for appointment to the Board based on the profile and skillset agreed by the Committee.\n\nThe Committee assessed a long list of candidates identified by Korn Ferry as having met the criteria.\n\nA shortlist of potential candidates was interviewed by the Chairman, the Committee and the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nA formal recommendation was made by the Committee to the Board proposing the appointment of Ms. Fiona Dawson as a non-Executive Director. The Board approved the appointment of Ms. Fiona Dawson noting that she had a balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity that matched the requirements set. Appointment terms were drafted and agreed with her.\n\n## Succession Planning\n\nThe Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee reviews the succession plans for the Board and its Committees on an ongoing basis to ensure an orderly refreshment of membership, taking into account Group strategy, the challenges and opportunities facing the Group and the skills, knowledge and experience required.\n\nThe Committee also reviews succession plans for senior management, which form part of the Group's overall annual approach to succession planning and agrees these with the Chief Executive Officer before being presented to the Board. The succession planning process includes defining success criteria for prioritised key roles, identifying and evaluating candidate pools and aligning successor development activities with individual and business needs to ensure leadership continuity and improve the depth of the leadership succession pipeline. This process is fully documented and monitored throughout the year in conjunction with the Committee.

        "page_content": "The Board believes in the benefits of having a diverse Board and the value that it can bring to its effective operation. In accordance with the Board Diversity Policy, differences in background, gender, skills, experiences, nationality, ethnicity and other attributes are considered in determining the optimum composition of the Board with the aim to balance it appropriately. All Board appointments are made on merit, with due regard to diversity. The Board currently has a 29% female representation and this will increase to 36% post the planned retirements following the conclusion of the 2022 AGM. In line with its diversity policy, and recommended best practice, the Board is committed to maintaining a minimum of 33% female representation on the Board and has an ambition to increase the representation of members with diverse backgrounds such as nationality, ethnicity and other attributes. During the year, the ethnicity profile of the Board was broadened. In reviewing Board composition and agreeing a job specification for new non-Executive Director appointments, the Committee considers the benefits of all aspects of diversity including, but not limited to, those described above, in order to complement the range and balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board. As part of the identification process executive recruitment consultants are required to present a list of potential candidates, who meet the stated specification and requirements comprising candidates of diverse backgrounds, for consideration by the Committee. 0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nIn 2021, diversity targets were agreed for senior management succession pools with the Executive Directors and approved by the Board to improve the diversity profile of senior leadership teams and ensure internal candidate pools better reflect the broader cultural mix of people within the Group. The Group is committed to achieving the highest levels of inclusion, diversity, engagement and belonging and is targeting equal gender representation at senior management level by 2030. The Committee reviews progress against these diversity goals each year, whilst taking account of business growth and geographic expansion within the organisation. 0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nExecutive\n\n21%\n\nFurther details of the Group's approach to Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, including our broader organisational goals focused on building an inclusive and diverse workplace are outlined in our GRI Sustainability Report and in Our People on pages 18-19. 0\n\n## Sustainability\n\nDuring 2021, the role of the Committee was expanded to provide guidance and oversight on the implementation of the Group's 2030 sustainability strategy Beyond the Horizon following its launch in October 2020.

This is my first Remuneration Committee Report having been appointed chairperson of the Committee following Joan Garahy's retirement on 29 April 2021. I would like to acknowledge and thank Joan for her valued leadership of the Committee over the last nine years.\n\n## Introduction\n\n2021 was an important year for Kerry Group. In parallel to delivering strong growth and a good financial performance against a challenging COVID-19 backdrop, we have taken significant strategic steps to further solidify our position as the world's leading Taste & Nutrition company:\n\n- -    a comprehensive strategy refresh, with ambitious mid-term growth, return and enhanced sustainability targets communicated at our Capital Markets Day in October; and\n- -    divestment of non-core consumer foods assets, coupled with strategic acquisitions in food waste reduction and health & bio-pharma.\n\nWe could not have achieved all of this without the continued and consistent excellent leadership of our Executive Directors into and throughout 2021, the drive and agility of our leadership teams and the tremendous commitment of our people across the world.\n\nOur 2020 Directors' Remuneration Report outlined the comprehensive coordinated global response taken by Kerry in response to the pandemic, and these efforts continued and were further strengthened during 2021, ensuring a positive experience for our broader stakeholders, including employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate.\n\nFrom the outset of the pandemic, we have consistently put the safety and wellbeing of our people at the core of our coordinated global response, ensuring we could safely fulfil our critical role in the global food supply chain and enabling all 152 manufacturing and R&D facilities to continue to operate to meet our customers' and consumers' needs.\n\nIn recognition of the achievements of our employees, and in order to minimise the economic impact of COVID-19 on our people, we retained pay levels for all employees, apart from the Executive Directors, throughout 2020 and awarded annual merit increases across all geographies in both 2021 and 2022. Kerry did not benefit from COVID-19 related government support in any of our key geographies.\n\nFrom a shareholder perspective, in 2021 the Group has delivered strong growth, a resilient share price and sustained dividend payments. Shareholder prospects for improved long-term returns have been further enhanced through the strategic actions of our Executive Directors and their teams over the past 12 months as detailed throughout this year's Annual Report.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\nThe Group's Remuneration Policy is outlined in Section C on pages 128133. This policy was approved by shareholders in 2021 and provides the framework for remuneration decisions made by the Committee until the next policy review.\n\nThe Committee is confident that the Group's Remuneration Policy is aligned with shareholder interests, promotes long term sustainable success and is in line with applicable best market practice. Furthermore, it ensures that Executive Director remuneration is aligned to the Group's purpose and values and can be clearly linked to the successful delivery of the Group's strategy and mid-term financial targets.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the policy has operated as intended and that no changes are required to the operation of the policy for 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Kerry's Remuneration Principles\n\n## Delivery of Group Purpose, Values and Strategy\n\nThe Group's Executive Director short and long-term remuneration philosophy is to ensure that executive remuneration is aligned to the Group's purpose and values, supports strategy and promotes the long-term success of the Company.\n\n## Creating Sustainable, Long-Term Performance\n\nRemuneration includes performance related elements designed to align Directors' interests with those of shareholders and to promote long-term sustainable growth and performance at the highest levels in line with the Group's strategy.\n\n## Attract, Motivate and Retain Talent\n\nMarket-competitive total remuneration is structured to attract, motivate and retain individuals of the highest quality on an international basis.\n\n## Stakeholder Interests\n\nBy incorporating a high proportion of Executive Directors' potential remuneration to short-term and long-term performance metrics with robust share ownership requirements, the Remuneration Committee believes that the interest and risk appetite of the Executive Directors is properly aligned with the interests of the shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n## Pay For Performance\n\nThe Committee ensures alignment with shareholders' longterm interests by aligning remuneration metrics with the Group's business model and strategic objectives.\n\n## Remuneration Policy Implementation 2022 Basic Salary\n\nFor 2022, no substantive increases are proposed, and the basic salaries of the Executive Directors will be increased as normal in line with increases available to the general workforce (i.e. a range of 2.5%-3.3%) in Ireland and the US respectively.\n\n## Pension Alignment\n\nAs detailed on page 129 Executive Directors' pension contribution rates will be aligned to those of Kerry's general workforce in Ireland with effect from 1 January 2023. Existing arrangements will apply for 2022.\n\n## Incentive Plans\n\nA detailed review of our short and long-term incentive plans was completed during 2020 following which a number of changes were made to the metrics and weightings in both plans and incorporated into the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the 2021 AGM.\n\nWe have consistently ensured that there is very strong alignment between our short term and long term incentive metrics and the Group's business strategy and financial targets. During 2021 the Remuneration Committee reviewed the incentive plan metrics again to ensure full alignment with the Group's refreshed strategy and updated mid-term targets as outlined during the Capital Markets Day held in October 2021.\n\n## 2022 Short-Term Incentive Plan\n\nFollowing the review outlined above, the Committee concluded that the only change required for 2022 was to amend the Margin Expansion Metric from EBITA to EBITDA. This change is reflective of the updated midterm targets and ensures better alignment with internal performance measurement and with the metric more commonly used by our industry peers. Annual bonus maximum opportunity and metric weightings will remain unchanged for 2022.\n\n## 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nThe LTIP performance metrics, weightings and target calibrations were also reviewed in 2021. The Committee concluded that the current metrics and weightings continue to be appropriate and will therefore remain unchanged for 2022.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy approved and implemented in 2021, included an increase in the maximum LTIP opportunity, to be implemented on a phased basis over two years. The second phase of the increase will be implemented in 2022 and in line with this, each Executive Director will be awarded their maximum LTIP opportunity in 2022 as follows; CEO 300% of basic salary (from 250%), CFO and CEO Taste & Nutrition 250% of basic salary (from 225%).\n\n## Pay for Performance\n\nKerry has a strong track record of demonstrating appropriate rigour and discipline when setting stretching targets as illustrated by the following chart.\n\n| Year    | STIP % of Max Achieved   | LTIP % of Max Achieved   |\n|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 2017    | 75%                      | 62%                      |\n| 2018    | 59%                      | 64%                      |\n| 2019    | 73%                      | 63%                      |\n| 2020    | 0%                       | 33%                      |\n| 2021    | 72%                      | 22%                      |\n| Average | 56%                      | 50%                      |\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the targets set for the 2022 STIP and LTIP awards are appropriately stretching given the current inflationary environment, the ongoing impact of COVID-19, overall market growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required to support future growth ambitions.",

For 2022, no substantive increases are proposed, and in line with the Remuneration Policy approved by Shareholders at the 2021 AGM, the basic fee paid to the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors will be increased in line with the increase available to the general workforce (+ 2.5%) in Ireland. No increases will be applied to Committee membership or Chair fees.\n\n## Remuneration Policy Outturn 2021\n\nIn determining the Executive Director's remuneration outturns for the financial year, the Committee maintained a clear and rigorous focus on aligning pay with performance in the context of another challenging year driven by COVID-19.\n\n10\n\n0\n\nIn 2021, the Group delivered strong growth and good financial performance with constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 12.1% driven by strong volume growth of 8.0%, and a 40 bps expansion in trading margin.\n\nAs can be seen in the Total Shareholder Return graph - below Kerry has generated a 173% return for shareholders (including reinvestment of dividends) over the last 5 years.\n\n## Shareholder Consultation\n\nOn behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I had the opportunity recently to consult with a number of our major shareholders, along with the key proxy advisors, regarding specific aspects of Kerry's Executive Director Remuneration in 2021.\n\nOur shareholders recognised the strong leadership shown by our Executive Directors in 2021; and many specifically acknowledged the seamless and simultaneous execution of significant strategic divestments and acquisitions, coupled with the completion of our comprehensive strategy refresh and communication of our updated mid-term targets.\n\nThank you for your valuable perspectives and feedback, they have been very helpful in informing the final decisions made by the Committee.\n\n## 2021 Short Term Incentive Plan Outturn\n\nFor 2021, STIP payouts to Executive Directors were on average 72% of the maximum available opportunity. The Committee exercised independent judgement when awarding this outcome and considers it to be reflective of the Group's and the individual Executive Directors' strong performance during the year, the broader stakeholder experience, as well as the challenging and stretching nature of the targets set.\n\nIn line with the Directors' Remuneration Policy, one-third of the STIP payout will be deferred into shares/options to be held for two years.\n\n## 5 Year Total Shareholder Return (Value of \u20ac100 Invested on 31/12/2016)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Long Term Incentive Plan 2019-2021 Outturn\n\nThe three year performance period in respect of the 2019-2021 LTIP award ended on 31 December 2021. The 2019 LTIP award was subject to Adjusted Earnings per Share (EPS), Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE) performance metrics.\n\nGood performance was achieved against our TSR and ROACE performance metrics over the three-year period. However, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the EPS metric in 2020 (-9.4%), which effectively negated the EPS growth achieved in 2021 (12.1% after recognising a dilution of 3.2% resulting from the disposal of the Consumer Foods Meats and Meals business) and 2019 (+8.3%). As a result, the threshold level for this metric, weighted at 50% of the overall award, was not achieved.\n\nThe final outcome of the 2019-2021 LTIP award was 22% of maximum opportunity as outlined in further detail on page 143. This is the second financial year in which the impact of the pandemic during 2020 has had a very significant impact on the remuneration outcomes for our Executive Directors and in particular on their LTIP vesting outcome (2019 LTIP award: 22%, 2018 LTIP award: 33%).\n\nThis outcome is clearly disappointing, particularly in consideration of the continued strong leadership of our Executive Directors into and throughout 2021, as well as the positive stakeholder experience over the past 3 years. On behalf of the Committee, I wish to wholeheartedly commend our Executive Team and emphasise again our sincere appreciation of their dedication and their excellent leadership over the three year performance period. Their leadership has ensured the resilience of the Kerry business and sustained shareholder return against the very challenging backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. We would particularly commend their leadership of the significant strategic steps taken in 2021 to enhance shareholder prospects for improved long-term returns.\n\nWhilst the Committee decided not to exercise discretion to amend the formulaic vesting of the 2019 LTIP for Executive Directors despite a strong supporting case, consistent with our decision in 2020 we have decided to exercise discretion for their extended leadership teams. The formulaic vesting of the 2019 LTIP for approximately 400 leaders will be adjusted from 22% to 45%, in recognition of their sustained commitment, agility and performance against a very challenging backdrop.\n\n## Other Matters\n\n## Committee Refreshment\n\nMs Emer Gilvarry was appointed to the Committee on 16 June 2021. Emer is a highly experienced professional who brings legal, business and corporate governance expertise to the Committee and also has remuneration committee experience with other listed companies.\n\n## Committee Performance\n\nAn internal review of the Remuneration Committee's performance was undertaken by the Committee during 2021 and the outcome of this review is that the Committee is operating effectively.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n2021 has been a successful year for Kerry and the Committee has faced difficult decisions in appropriately recognising the contributions of our leadership teams in very challenging circumstances. The 2019 LTIP outturn for our Executive Directors is disappointing in the context of their excellent leadership and the decision we have taken regarding the LTIP vesting for their extended leadership teams demonstrates our full appreciation of their sustained contribution to Kerry.\n\nThe Committee continues to review the Group's Remuneration Policy to ensure that it remains aligned to shareholders' long term interests, is correctly reported in accordance with relevant legislation and provides the right framework to attract, retain and motivate the Executive Directors in line with the pay for performance principle.\n\nAs in previous years, the Remuneration Report is being put to shareholders for an advisory vote. Last year, 99% of our shareholders who voted, voted in favour of the Remuneration Report and I hope our shareholders continue to provide their support at this year's AGM.\n\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the Remuneration Committee for their commitment and support during the year.\n\nTom Moran Chairperson, of the Remuneration Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

Decisions are made within agreed reference terms, with additional meetings held as required. In considering the agenda, the Committee gives due regard to overall business strategy, the interests of shareholders, employees, other stakeholders and the performance of the Group. The main responsibilities of the Committee, which were reviewed during 2021, are set out in written terms of reference which are available from the Group's website www.kerrygroup.com or upon request.\n\n## Primary Responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee\n\n- -   To determine the Remuneration Policy for, and set the remuneration of the CEO, Executive Directors and senior management;\n- -   To review the remuneration of the Chairman;\n- -   To receive the recommendations of the CEO and set the salaries and overall remuneration of senior management;\n- -   To review and approve incentive plan structures and targets;\n- -   To agree the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the shareholders;\n- -   To ensure alignment of incentives and rewards with strategy, values and culture;\n- -   To ensure the contractual terms of Executive Directors and senior management are deemed fair and reasonable;\n- -   To place before shareholders at each AGM, a Directors' Remuneration Report setting out the Group's policy and disclosures on remuneration;\n- -   To arrange where appropriate, external benchmarking of overall remuneration levels and the effectiveness of incentive schemes;\n- -   To review annually its own performance and terms of reference to ensure it is operating effectively;\n- -   To engage with the workforce to explain how executive remuneration aligns with the wider company pay policy;\n- -   To review workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with the Group's culture, and take these into account when setting the policy for executives; and\n- -   To consider appropriate application and use of clawback and malus provisions as well as discretion to adjust the formulaic outturns for performance related pay.\n\n## Remuneration Committee Meetings and Activities 2021\n\nThe Committee held four scheduled meetings and two additional meetings during 2021. The additional meetings were required to review the incentive plan metrics in the context of the updated mid-term targets, as outlined during the Capital Markets Day, and to consider the Executive Director's remuneration outturns for the financial year. Attendance at these meetings is outlined on page 106.\n\nThe key activities undertaken by the Committee in discharging its duties during 2021 are set out below:\n\n| Subject                                                                                                       | Remuneration Committee Activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Remuneration  Report                                                                                          | A review of best practice remuneration reporting was completed during 2021 to ensure compliance with  relevant legislation and reporting requirements while also ensuring the delivery of a report which is transparent  and understandable for all shareholders.

        "page_content": "## Section C: Remuneration Policy\n\n## Remuneration Principles\n\nThe Group's Executive Director remuneration philosophy is to ensure that executive remuneration is aligned to the Group's purpose and values, supports strategy, promotes the long-term success of the company, properly reflects the duties and responsibilities of the Executives, and is structured to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the highest quality on an international basis. Remuneration includes performance related elements designed to align Directors' interests with those of shareholders and to promote long-term sustainable growth and performance at the highest levels in line with the Group's strategy.\n\nA high proportion of Executive Directors' potential remuneration is based on short-term and longterm performance related incentive programmes. By incorporating these elements, the Remuneration Committee believes that the interest and risk appetite of the Executive Directors is properly aligned with the interests of the shareholders and other stakeholders. When authorising remuneration outcomes, the Committee exercises independent judgement and discretion, taking account of Group and individual performance as well as the investor experience, environmental, governance and social matters and wider workforce pay conditions to ensure that it is fair and appropriate for the role, experience of the individual, responsibilities and performance delivered.\n\n## Drivers of Shareholder Return\n\nAs outlined in the Strategic Report on page 31, Volume Growth and Margin Expansion are the main drivers of Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) which is the key performance metric for measuring growth. Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE) is a key measure of how efficiently the Group employs its available capital. Cash Conversion is an important indicator of the cash the Group generates for reinvestment or for return to shareholders.\n\nThese are the main Group metrics which drive the Executive Director's Short Term Incentive Plan (STIP) and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) underpinned by the Group's sustainability measures. Together these metrics deliver Total Shareholder Return which aligns the interest of the Executive Directors with that of the shareholders.\n\nOur remuneration philosophy also supports our long-term approach by deferring a significant part of annual and long term variable remuneration into share awards, which provides clear alignment with the long-term interests of shareholders, together with requiring Executives to acquire and maintain significant shareholdings in the Group.\n\nIn line with best market practice, malus and clawback provisions apply to the Executive Director's STIP and LTIP awards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\nKerry's current Remuneration Policy was submitted to a non-binding advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting, one year earlier than required under the Shareholders Rights Directive as enacted in Ireland.\n\nAs an Irish incorporated company, Kerry Group plc is not obliged to comply with the UK legislation which requires UK companies to submit their remuneration policies to a binding shareholder vote every three years or earlier if changes are required prior to this.\n\nSimilarly, Kerry Group plc is not required to comply with the remuneration reporting regulation contained in the UK Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 but follows the requirements as a matter of best practice unless they conflict with Irish or other legal requirements or there are other reasons where it is considered not practicable to do so.\n\nIn setting remuneration levels, the Committee has regard to comparable UK, USA and European companies which are comparable to the Group in terms of size, geographical spread and complexity of business, and operate in the food and beverage and other sectors. It also considers workforce remuneration and related policies and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group.",

It has been clearly  communicated to shareholders and proxy advisors. Our Chief Human Resources Officer's (CHRO) role has  direct responsibility for engaging with our employees and collaborates closely with Mr. Tom Moran, our  designated workforce engagement Director. The Committee monitors the effectiveness of engagement with  the wider workforce through updates provided by the CHRO and the designated workforce engagement  Director. The Board is comfortable that our Remuneration Policy is clearly understandable by employees.                   |\n| Simplicity            | The Committee considers that the Remuneration Policy is simple and easy to understand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Risk                  | The Remuneration Policy is designed to discourage inappropriate risk taking and to ensure that it is not  rewarded. This is achieved by (i) the balanced use of both short-term and long-term incentive plans which  employ a blend of financial, non-financial and shareholder return targets (ii) the significant role played by  equity in our incentive plans together with shareholding requirements and (iii) malus and clawback provisions  and (iv) the ability of the Committee to utilise discretion to adjust formulaic outcomes to ensure outcomes are  aligned to, and are reflective of, the underlying business performance of the Group. |\n| Predictability        | Executive Directors' remuneration is subject to individual participation caps, with our share-based plans  also subject to market standard dilution limits. The scenario charts on page 133 illustrate how the rewards  potentially receivable by our Executive Directors vary based on performance delivered and share price growth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Proportionality       | There is a clear link between individual rewards, delivery of strategy and long-term performance. In addition,  the significant role played by STIP and LTIP/'at risk' pay, together with the structure of the Executive Directors  service contracts, ensures that poor performance is not rewarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Alignment to  Culture | Kerry has a relentless focus on delivering for our shareholders and other stakeholders and this is fully aligned  with our Remuneration Policy in that employee personal success is directly linked to the success of the Group  through the short-term and long-term incentive plans and targets we operate.

The Committee is comfortable that the policy remains appropriate supporting the Group's strategy and that no changes are required prior to the triennial vote at the 2024 AGM. The current policy is reproduced below for ease of reference.\n\n## Remuneration Policy Table\n\nThe following table details the Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors for the period 2021 to 2023:\n\n| Purpose and Link   to Strategy                                                                                                                                  | Operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Opportunity                                                                                                                                 | Performance  Metrics   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Basic Salary                                                                                                                                                    | Basic Salary                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Basic Salary                                                                                                                                | Basic Salary           |\n| Reflects the value of the  individual, their skills and  experience Competitive salaries are set to  promote the long-term success  of the Company and attract, | -   Remuneration Committee sets the basic salary  and benefits of each Executive Director -   Determined after taking into account a  number of elements including the Executive  Directors' performance, experience and level of  responsibility | -   Set at a level to attract,  retain and motivate  Executive Directors -  Reviewed annually -   Full review undertaken  every three years | -  Not  applicable     |\n| Benefits                                                                                                                                                        | Benefits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Benefits                                                                                                                                    | Benefits               |\n| To provide a competitive benefit  package aligned with the role  and responsibilities of Executive  Directors                                                   | -   These benefits primarily relate to the use of a  company car or a car allowance                                                                                                                                                               | -  Not applicable                                                                                                                           | -  Not  applicable     |",

They align with the Group's strategic objectives while also ensuring the longterm operational and financial stability of the Group. Targets are set at appropriately stretching levels to achieve threshold, target and maximum payout levels. Performance targets are based predominately on the financial metrics of Volume Growth, Margin Expansion and Cash Conversion (amounting to 80% of maximum opportunity).\n\nVolume Growth and Margin Expansion are key performance metrics as they are the main drivers of Adjusted EPS Growth. Cash Conversion is key to ensuring there are sufficient funds available for reinvestment or for return to shareholders.\n\nStrategic objectives (amounting to 20% of maximum opportunity) are relevant to each Executive Director's specific area of responsibility and are key in ensuring focus on the strategic and functional priorities of the business.\n\nDue to their commercial sensitivity, the Committee is of the view that it would be detrimental to the Company to disclose the targets in advance of or during the relevant performance period. The Committee will disclose the targets and performance against them in next year's Remuneration Report.\n\n## LTIP\n\nThe performance targets under the LTIP are set to reflect the Group's longer-term growth objectives and at a level where maximum opportunity genuinely represents outperformance. The performance metrics are currently based on Adjusted EPS Growth, TSR, ROACE and Sustainability metrics.\n\nAdjusted EPS Growth is a key performance metric encompassing all the components of growth important to the Group's stakeholders. EPS Growth is driven by the STIP metrics, Volume Growth and Margin Expansion. TSR is an important indicator of how successful the Group has been in terms of shareholder value creation. ROACE represents a good perspective on the Group's internal rate of return and financial added value for shareholders. ROACE supports the strategic focus on growth and margins through ensuring cash is reinvested to generate appropriate returns.

The Committee further has the discretion to recover incentives paid within a period of two years from vesting (clawback).\n\nThe key trigger events for the use of malus and clawback provisions include material misstatement of the Company's audited financial results, serious wrongdoing, payment made on the basis of erroneous data, gross misconduct, serious reputational damage and corporate failure.\n\nAny recalculation of the award shall be effected in such manner and subject to such procedures as the Group determines to be measured and appropriate, including repayment of any excess incentive or offset against any amounts due or potentially due to the participant under any vested or unvested incentive awards.\n\nThe Company retains the right to apply the malus and clawback provisions to former directors STIP and LTIP awards. Other elements of remuneration are not subject to malus or clawback provisions.\n\n## Committee Discretion\n\nThe Committee has discretion to adjust the formulaic outcomes under STIP and LTIP to ensure outcomes are aligned to and are reflective of the underlying business performance of the Group.\n\nIn line with plan rules, the Committee may, at its discretion, amend or vary the performance metrics of the STIP and LTIP related incentives, the calculation methodology for those performance metrics and the composition of the TSR peer group when appropriate, in the interest of alignment and fairness.\n\n## Service Contracts\n\nThe CEO and Executive Directors have service contracts in place which can be terminated by either party giving 12 months notice. In addition, all service contracts include pay in lieu of notice, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions of up to 12 months post departure, in order to protect the Group's customer base, employees and intellectual property.\n\nNo ex-gratia severance payments are provided for in respect of the CEO or Executive Directors.\n\n## Remuneration Policy for Recruitment of New Executive Directors\n\nThe Remuneration Committee will determine the contractual terms for new Executive Directors, subject to appropriate professional advice to ensure that these reflect best practice and are subject to the limits specified in the Group's approved policy as set out in this report.\n\nSalary levels for new Executive Directors will take into account the experience and calibre of the individual and his/her remuneration expectations. Where it is appropriate to offer a lower salary initially, a series of increases to the desired salary positioning may be made over subsequent years, subject to individual performance and development in the role.\n\nPension and benefits will be provided in line with the approved policy, with relocation, travel or other expenses provided if necessary.\n\nThe structure of the variable pay element will be in accordance with and subject to the limits set out in the Group's approved policy detailed above. Different performance measures may be set initially for STIP in the year an Executive Director joins the Group taking into account the responsibilities of the individual and the point in the financial year that he/she joins the Board. Subject to the rules of the scheme, an LTIP award may be granted after joining the Group.\n\nIf it is necessary to buy-out incentive pay or benefit arrangements (which would be forfeited on leaving the previous employer) in the case of an external appointment, this would be provided for taking into account the form (cash or shares), timing and expected value (i.e. likelihood of meeting any existing performance criteria) of the remuneration being forfeited. The general policy is that payment should be no more than the Committee considers is required to provide reasonable compensation for remuneration being forfeited. The Group's policy is that the period of notice for new Executive Directors should not exceed 12 months and should include pay in lieu of notice, noncompete and non-solicitation provisions to protect the Group.\n\nThe Committee will ensure that any arrangements agreed will be in the best interests of the Group and shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Payments for Loss of Office\n\nIn the event of a Director's departure, the Group's policy on termination is as follows:\n\n- -   the Group will pay any amounts it is required to make in accordance with or in settlement of a Director's statutory employment rights and in line with their employment agreement;\n- -   STIP and LTIP awards will be paid out in line with plan rules on exit (i.e. for good leavers as defined in the LTIP rules), with awards prorated to normal vesting date, subject to performance and a two-year holding requirement and prorated to reflect the proportion of the performance period that has elapsed on the date of cessation; and\n- -   the Group will seek to ensure that no more is paid than is warranted in each individual case;\n- -   other payments, such as legal or other professional fees, repatriation or relocation costs and/or outplacement fees, may be paid if it is considered appropriate and at the discretion of the Committee.\n\nA Director's service contract may be terminated without notice and without any further payment or compensation, except for sums accrued up to the date of termination, on the occurrence of certain events such as gross misconduct.\n\n## Change of Control\n\nOutstanding STIP and LTIP awards/options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to plan rules, including the satisfaction of any performance conditions and pro-rating. The Committee may exercise its discretion to vary the level of vesting having regard to the circumstances and reasons for the events giving rise to the change of control.\n\n## Alignment with Workforce Pay and Policies\n\nThe Remuneration Policy provides an overview of the structure that operates for the Group's Executive Directors and senior management. Differences in quantum will depend on size of the role and responsibility, the location of the role and local market practice.\n\nWhen setting the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors, the Committee considers the pay policies and procedures for the wider workforce. The key difference is that, overall, Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay compared to other employees.\n\nBasic salaries are operated under the same policy as detailed in the Remuneration Policy table with comparator groups used as a reference point. The Committee considers the basic salary increase for the broader workforce when determining the annual salary review for the Executive Directors.\n\nSenior management are invited to participate in both the STIP and LTIP to incentivise performance through the achievement of short-term and long-term objectives and through the holding of shares in the Group.\n\nThe Committee will seek shareholder approval at a later date for an All-Employee Share Plan which will allow for the grant of various share-based awards to employees across the Group once implemented (subject to local tax and securities laws).\n\n## Consultation with Employees\n\nWhen setting remuneration for Executive Directors the Committee takes into account the remuneration structures, policies and practices in the Group as a whole, the feedback from employee engagement activities and the information provided by our external advisors. In addition, matters relating to remuneration which come to the attention of the Committee Chairperson, in his capacity as the designated workforce engagement Director, are reported to the Committee. The Group has a number of different channels for engagement and the Committee continually reviews and enhances these channels to enable the Committee to engage more effectively with the wider workforce to explain broader pay policies and practices and the alignment to the Executive Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Consultation with Shareholders\n\nThe Committee considers the guidelines issued by the major institutional shareholders and the bodies representing them and the feedback provided by such proxy advisors and shareholders, when completing its annual and triennial review of the Group's Executive Remuneration policies and practices.\n\nThe Committee is committed to continued consultation with shareholders regarding its Remuneration Policy.",

In determining the fees, which are set within the limits approved by shareholders, consideration is given to both the complexity of the Group and the level of fees paid to non-Executive Directors in comparable companies. Fees are reviewed on an annual basis and the basic fee is increased in line with the inflation increase available to the general force in Ireland. A detailed benchmark review is carried out on a three-year basis and any recommendations are presented to the Executive Directors for approval. Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the Group's incentive plans, pension arrangements or other elements of remuneration provided to the Executive Directors. Non-Executive Directors are reimbursed for travel and accommodation expenses (and any personal tax that may be due on those expenses). Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to build up a shareholding in the Company.\n\n## Illustration of Remuneration Policy\n\nThe following diagrams show the minimum, target, maximum and maximum +50% share appreciation composition balance between the fixed and variable remuneration components for each Executive Director effective for 2022.

        "page_content": "## Section D: Remuneration Policy Implementation\n\n## Part I: Remuneration Policy Implementation 2022\n\nThis part of the report sets out how the proposed Remuneration Policy as described on pages 127-128 will operate in 2022.\n\n## Basic Salary and Benefits\n\nThe salaries of the Executive Directors effective for the year commencing on 1 March 2022, together with the comparative figures, are as follows:\n\n| Directors         | 2022 \u20ac'000   | 2021 \u20ac'000   | % Increase   |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Edmond Scanlon    | 1,249        | 1,219        | 2.5%         |\n| Marguerite Larkin | 773          | 754          | 2.5%         |\n|                   | $'000        | $'000        | % Increase   |\n| Gerry Behan       | 1,019        | 987          | 3.3%         |\n\nThe increases in salaries for the Executive Directors are in line with increases for the general workforce in Ireland 2.5% and the US 3.3%.\n\nBenefits relate primarily to the use of a company car/car allowance. Any travel arrangements or travel costs required for business purposes will also be met by the Group, on a net of tax basis.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe Group CEO participates in the general employee Irish defined contribution scheme and the CFO receives a taxable cash allowance based on a percentage of basic salary, in lieu of pension. The CEO Taste & Nutrition participates in a US-defined contribution scheme and a US-defined benefit pension scheme.\n\nFollowing the Remuneration Policy review carried out in 2020 pension contribution rates will continue as is for 2022. The pension contribution rate for Executive Directors will be aligned to that of Kerry's general workforce in Ireland (currently a rate of 10%) with effect from 1 January 2023.\n\n## Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP)\n\nA review of the STIP metrics was completed in 2021 to ensure that they remain appropriate, are linked to strategy, consistent with best practice and that the targets are appropriately calibrated. The Committee concluded that the only change required for 2022 was to amend the Margin Expansion metric from EBITA to EBITDA to reflect the updated mid-term targets and to ensure better alignment with internal performance measurement and with the metric more commonly used by our industry peers. There is no change to the weightings attributed to the metrics. All other metrics continue to support the Group's long-term sustainable growth and forward-looking strategy as well as attracting, motivating and retaining Executives of the highest quality internationally.\n\nThe maximum STIP opportunity remains the same as 2021: 200% of salary for the CEO and 175% of salary for the CFO and CEO Taste & Nutrition.\n\n| Group Metrics        | CEO and CFO % of award Target   | Max   | CEO T&N % of award Target   | Max   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------|-------|\n| Volume growth*       | 17.5%                           | 35%   | 17.5%                       | 35%   |\n| Margin expansion*    | 13.5%                           | 27%   | 13.5%                       | 27%   |\n| Cash conversion      | 9%                              | 18%   | 9%                          | 18%   |\n| Strategic objectives | 10%                             | 20%   | 10%                         | 20%   |\n| Total                | 50%                             | 100%  | 50%                         | 100%  |",

        "page_content": "The Committee is of the view that a 50% of maximum award payout for on target performance is appropriate taking into account the level of stretch in the targets set. Due to the commercial sensitivity of the financial metrics and strategic objectives, the Committee is of the view that it would be detrimental to the Company to disclose the targets in advance of, or during, the relevant performance period. The Committee will disclose the targets and performance against them in next year's Remuneration Report.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\n\nA review of the LTIP metrics was completed in 2021 to ensure that they remain appropriate, linked to strategy and that targets are appropriately stretching. The Committee concluded that no changes were required in relation to the financial metrics other than to amend the target range applicable for the ROACE metric to better align with the new mid-term targets communicated at the Capital Markets Day held in October 2021.

The second phase of the increase will be implemented in 2022 and in line with this each Executive Director will be awarded their maximum LTIP opportunity in 2022 as follows: CEO 300% of basic salary, CFO 250% of basic salary and CEO Taste & Nutrition 250% of basic salary.\n\nSee Group Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) on pages 34 and 35 for more information on the link between the performance metrics used for incentive purposes and the Group's Strategic Plan.\n\n## Non-Executive Director Remuneration Review\n\nNon-Executive Director fees were last reviewed in 2020 and increases were made effective from 1 January 2021.

        "page_content": "## Discretion\n\nThe Committee concluded that there was no requirement to exercise discretion as the 2021 STIP outcomes reflected the underlying performance of the business, the broader stakeholder experience and the strong performance of the Executive Directors against strategic objectives.\n\n## Final Outturn for 2021\n\nThe targets for the Executive Directors, which were set by the Remuneration Committee, were challenging and stretching in the context of the uncertain and volatile economic environment due to inflationary pressures and the evolving and fast-changing COVID-19 situation. For 2021, a pay-out of 72% of max opportunity was achieved by each Director.\n\nUnder the policy, one third of the bonus is awarded by way of shares or options which are issued following the end of the two-year deferral period.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\n\n## 2021 LTIP\n\nA new LTIP plan was approved by shareholders at the 2021 AGM. The first conditional awards under this plan were made to Executive Directors in 2021. Subject to performance metrics being met over a three-year performance period, the first awards under this plan will potentially vest in March 2024, 100% of which will be subject to a two-year deferral period.\n\n## 2013 LTIP\n\nThe terms and conditions of the plan were approved by shareholders at the 2013 AGM. The Remuneration Committee approves the terms, conditions and allocation of conditional awards under the Group's LTIP to Executive Directors and senior management. Under this plan, Executive Directors and senior management are invited to participate in conditional awards over shares or share options in the Company.\n\nSubject to performance metrics being met over a three-year performance period, the LTIP award will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. 50% of the award is delivered at the vesting date with the remaining 50% of the award being delivered following a two-year deferral period. This provides for a combined performance period and deferral period of five years for half of the award that vests.\n\nThe first conditional awards under this scheme were made to Executive Directors in 2013. The maximum award that can be made to an individual Executive Director under the LTIP over a 12-month period is equivalent to 180%-200% of basic salary for that period.\n\nAn award may lapse if a participant ceases to be employed within the Group before the vesting date. The market price of the shares on the date of each award outlined above is disclosed in note 28 to the financial statements.\n\nThe proportion of each conditional award which vests will depend on the Adjusted EPS Growth, TSR and ROACE performance of the Group during the relevant three year performance period.\n\n## 2019 LTIP Awards\n\nSet out below is the performance against targets for the 2019 LTIP award where the three-year performance period ended on 31 December 2021 and the award vests in 2022.\n\n## EPS Performance Test\n\n50% of the award vests according to the Group's average adjusted EPS growth ('EPS metric') over the performance period. This measurement is determined by reference to the growth in the Group's adjusted EPS calculated on a constant currency basis in each of the three financial years in the performance period in accordance with the vesting schedule outlined in the following table:\n\n|           | Average Adjusted EPS Growth   | Percentage of the Award Which Vests   |\n|-----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Threshold | 6%                            | 25%                                   |\n| Target    | 10%                           | 50%                                   |\n| Maximum   | 12%                           | 100%                                  |\n\nBelow 6% none of the award vests. Vesting between target points is on a straight line basis.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a particular impact on the EPS metric in 2020 (-9.4%), which negated the strong EPS growth achieved in 2019 (+8.3%) and 2021 (+12.1% after recognising a dilution of 3.2% resulting from the disposal of the Consumer Foods Meats and Meals business). As a result, the threshold level for this metric was not achieved, resulting in an award outcome calculated on a formulaic basis of 0% out of a possible maximum of 50%.",

In line with best practice guidelines, the Company ensures that the level of share awards granted under all share schemes does not exceed 10% of the Group's share capital over a rolling ten year period, with a further limitation of 5% in any ten-year period in respect of discretionary schemes. The dilution resulting from all vested share awards/share options for the ten-year period to 31 December 2021 is 1%. This level of dilution is well below the maximum dilution level recommended for executive share-based incentive plans.\n\nThe potential future dilution level from unvested share awards/share options as a result of these schemes is a further 0.7%.\n\nThe UK Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 require certain UK incorporated companies to publish the ratio of CEO remuneration to UK staff pay. Although not a requirement for Irish incorporated companies, the ratio of the CEO's total remuneration to that of the median Irish employee is disclosed in the table below, in line with the Group's commitment to ensure that its remuneration policies, practices and reporting reflect best corporate governance practices.\n\nIn providing the CEO ratio we have used Method C as set out in the regulations but have applied the principles of Method A.\n\nTable 12: CEO Ratio\n\n|                                                                         | 2021       | 2020       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Chief Executive Officer's: Total remuneration                           | \u20ac3,855,000 | \u20ac2,323,000 |\n| Median Irish employee: Total remuneration                               | \u20ac43,260    | \u20ac42,137    |\n| Median Irish employee: Salary only                                      | \u20ac40,645    | \u20ac39,654    |\n| Median pay ratio - Total remuneration                                   | 89x        | 55x        |\n| Median pay ratio - excluding all variable short and long-term incentive | 37x        | 33x        |\n\nThe Committee believes that our senior executives should have a significant proportion of their pay directly linked to Group performance in order to drive alignment with shareholders. A significant portion of the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration is therefore delivered through the Group's short-term and long-term incentive plans where awards are linked to Group performance and share price movements over time. This means that ratios will depend significantly on short-term and long-term incentive outturns and may fluctuate from year to year as a result.\n\nThe CEO pay ratio based on total remuneration has increased year on year. Performance outturns under both the short-term and long-term incentive plans in 2020 were low with no STIP payout and only a 32.5% outturn for LTIP. In addition, the CEO took a 25% voluntary reduction in basic salary for three months in 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, as reported in previous sections, there was a good performance against STIP targets resulting in a 72% payout of maximum opportunity. The LTIP award for the three-year period ended 31 December 2021 had a vesting outturn of 22% of maximum which is lower than last year's level of 32.5%. As a result, the total remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer has increased in 2021 as compared to 2020.",

These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB\n\nAs explained in note 1 to the financial statements, the Group, in addition to applying IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (Ireland) ('ISAs (Ireland)') and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (Ireland) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Ireland, which includes IAASA's Ethical Standard as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by IAASA's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Company.\n\nOther than those disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements, we have provided no non-audit services to the Group or the Company in the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.",

In the prior year, materiality was based on approximately 5% of the three-year average profit before taxation and non-trading items.\n\n- -    \u20ac35 million (2020: \u20ac34.5 million) - Consolidated financial statements.\n- -   \u20ac10.5 million (2020: \u20ac8 million) - Company financial statements.\n- -   Based on approximately 1% of net assets.\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- -   The reporting components where an audit of the complete financial information was performed accounted for in excess of 85% of Consolidated revenues and in excess of 85% of Consolidated profit before taxation and non-trading items.\n- -   We conducted audit work in 39 reporting components. We selected these components due to their size or characteristics and to ensure appropriate audit coverage. An audit of the complete financial information of 26 components was performed. Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were also performed at a further 13 components. We also performed audit work at each of the principal shared service centres.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- -   Business combinations - valuation of acquired intangible assets.\n- -   Goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets impairment assessment.\n- -Income  taxes.\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors' professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.",

Tax legislation is open to different interpretations and the tax treatments of many items are uncertain. Tax audits can require several years to conclude, and transfer pricing judgements may impact the Group's tax liabilities. Management judgement and estimation is required in the measurement of uncertain tax positions in the context of the recognition of current and deferred tax assets/liabilities.\n\nWe determined this to be a key audit matter due to its inherent complexity and the estimation and judgement involved in the measurement of uncertain tax positions in the context of the recognition of current and deferred tax assets/liabilities.\n\n## How we tailored the audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, including those performed at the Group's shared service centres and the industry in which the Group operates.\n\nThe Group is structured along two operating segments: Taste & Nutrition and Consumer Foods. The majority of the Group's components are supported by one of the Group's principal shared service centres in Ireland, Malaysia, and the United States.\n\nWe determined that an audit of the complete financial information should be performed at 26 components due to their size or risk characteristics and to ensure appropriate coverage. These 26 components included components that control central Group functions such as Treasury and Employee Benefits. Specific audit procedures on certain balances and transactions were also performed at a further 13 components primarily to ensure appropriate audit coverage. The reporting components where an audit of the complete financial information was performed accounted for in excess of 85% of Consolidated revenues and in excess of 85% of Consolidated profit before taxation and non-trading items.\n\nThe Group team performed the audit of the central function components and component auditors within PwC ROI and from other PwC network firms, operating under our instruction, performed the audit on all other in scope components and the required supporting audit work at each of the Group's principal shared service centres.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the Group tax strategy through discussions with management and the Group's inhouse tax specialists.\n\nThe team, assisted by PwC International and Irish taxation specialists, challenged judgements used and estimates made by management to measure uncertain tax positions in the context of the recognition of current and deferred tax assets/ liabilities. This included obtaining explanations regarding the tax treatment applied to material transactions and evidence to corroborate management's explanations. Such evidence, where appropriate, included management's communications with local tax authorities and copies of the tax advice obtained by management from its external tax advisors including transfer pricing studies.\n\nBased on the evidence obtained, while noting the inherent uncertainty with such tax matters, we determined the measurement of uncertain tax positions in the context of the recognition of current and deferred tax assets/liabilities as at 31 December 2021 to be within an acceptable range of reasonable estimates.\n\nThe Group team was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement the Group team needed to have to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole.\n\nDue to the current restrictions on travel and social distancing measures, enacted as a response to the global pandemic, the Group engagement leader and senior members of the Group engagement team used video conferencing to facilitate our oversight of the component auditor work and had video meetings and discussions with management and component audit teams in Ireland, the USA, Brazil, Mexico and the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThe meetings with our component teams confirmed their audit approach. The meetings also involved discussing and understanding the significant audit risk areas and obtaining updates on local laws and regulations and other relevant matters. In addition to the meetings noted above, the Group team interacted regularly with the component teams during all stages of the audit. We received a detailed memorandum of examination on work performed and relevant findings in addition to an audit report which supplemented our understanding of the individual components. In addition to this, the Group engagement team reviewed certain audit working papers in component audit files. Post audit conference calls were held with all in scope audit teams to discuss their audit findings.",

        "page_content": "This, together with audit procedures performed by the Group team gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. These procedures included, amongst others, procedures over IT systems, treasury, post-retirement benefits, the consolidation process and key audit matters including uncertain tax positions, impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, and business combinations.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\n|                                   | Consolidated   financial   statements                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Company   financial  statements                                                                            |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overall  materiality              | \u20ac35 million   (2020: \u20ac34.5 million).                                                                                                                                                                                                           | \u20ac10.5 million   (2020: \u20ac8 million).                                                                        |\n| How we  determined  it            | Approximately 5% of  profit before taxation  and non-trading  items.

In evaluating these forecasts, we considered the Group's historic performance and its past record of achieving strategic objectives. Additionally, we have considered management's assessment of the likely impact which COVID-19 and climate related risks may have on financial performance and liquidity for a period of 12 months from the date on which the financial statements are authorised for issue;\n- -   considering whether the assumptions underlying the base case were consistent with related assumptions used in other areas of the entity's business activities, for example in testing for non-financial asset impairment;\n- -   testing the mathematical integrity of the forecasts and the models and reconciling these to board approved budgets;\n- -   performing our own independent sensitivity analysis to assess further appropriate downside scenarios; and\n- -   considering the Group's available liquidity, financing and maturity profile to assess liquidity through the going concern assessment period.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date on which the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group's or the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nWe are required to report if the directors' statement relating to going concern in accordance with Rule 6.1.82 (3) (a) of the Listing Rules for Euronext Dublin and Rule 9.8.6 R (3) of the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority is materially inconsistent with our knowledge obtained in the audit. We have nothing to report in respect of this responsibility.",

The directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Directors' Report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the Companies Act 2014 (excluding the information included in the 'Non Financial Statement' as defined by that Act on which we are not required to report) have been included.\n\nBased on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs (Ireland), the Companies Act 2014 (CA14) and the Listing Rules applicable to the Company (Listing Rules) require us to also report certain opinions and matters as described below (required by ISAs (Ireland) unless otherwise stated).\n\n## Directors' Report\n\n- -In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Directors' Report (excluding the information included in the 'Non Financial Statement' on which we are not required to report) for the year ended 31 December 2021 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the applicable legal requirements. (CA14)\n- -Based on our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Directors' Report (excluding the information included in the 'Non Financial Statement' on which we are not required to report). (CA14)\n\n## Corporate governance statement\n\n- -In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements,\n- -    the description of the main features of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process included in the Corporate Governance Report; and\n- -    the information required by Section 1373(2)(d) of the Companies Act 2014 included in the Report of the Directors;\n\nis consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with section 1373(2) of the Companies Act 2014. (CA14)\n\n- -Based on our knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit of the financial statements, we have not identified material misstatements in the description of the main features of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process and the information required by section 1373(2)(d) of the Companies Act 2014 included in the Corporate Governance Report and the Report of the Directors. (CA14)\n- -In our opinion, based on the work undertaken during the course of the audit of the financial statements, the information required by section 1373(2)(a),(b),(e) and (f) of the Companies Act 2014 and regulation 6 of the European Union (Disclosure of Non-Financial and Diversity Information by certain large undertakings and groups) Regulations 2017 is contained in the Corporate Governance Statement. (CA14)\n\nThe directors' assessment of the prospects of the Group and of the principal risks that would threaten the solvency or liquidity of the Group\n\n- -We have nothing material to add or to draw attention to regarding:\n- -    The directors' confirmation on page 108 of the Annual Report that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.\n- -    The directors' explanation on pages 84-85 of the Annual Report as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n- -    The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated.\n- -We have nothing to report having performed a review of the directors' statement that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group and the directors' statement in relation to the longer-term viability of the Group. Our review was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statements; checking that the statements are in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code'); and considering whether the statements are consistent with the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (Ireland) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the IAASA website at:\n\nhttps://www.iaasa.ie/getmedia/b2389013-1cf6458b-9b8f-a98202dc9c3a/Description\\_of\\_auditors\\_ responsibilities\\_for\\_audit.pdf\n\nThis description forms part of our auditors' report.\n\n## Use of this report\n\nThis report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company's members as a body in accordance with section 391 of the Companies Act 2014 and for no other purpose.

Statement of accounting policies\n\n## General information\n\nKerry Group plc is a public limited company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland. The registered number is 111471 and registered office address is Prince's Street, Tralee, Co. Kerry, V92 EH11, Ireland. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in the Business Reviews and note 36 'Group entities'.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Kerry Group plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'), International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ('IFRIC') interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act, 2014 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Company Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company Statement of Cash Flows and the notes to the financial statements. The financial statements include the information in the remuneration report that is described as being an integral part of the financial statements. Both the Parent Company and Group financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union ('EU') which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB'). The Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. IFRS adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS issued by the IASB. References to IFRS hereafter refer to IFRS adopted by the EU.\n\nThe Parent Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting policies consistent with the accounting policies applied to the consolidated financial statements by the Group.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative financial instruments) and financial asset investments which are held at fair value. Assets classified as held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. The investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements contained herein are presented in euro, which is the functional currency of the Parent Company, Kerry Group plc. The functional currencies of the Group's main subsidiaries are euro, US dollar and sterling.\n\nIn the 2021 consolidated financial statements, the Group has re-presented corresponding 2020 balances to align with current year presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company Statement of Cash Flows, note 5 'Non-trading items', note 26 'Retirement benefit obligations' and note 29 'Cash flow components'.\n\nCertain income statement headings and other financial measures included in the consolidated financial statements are not defined by IFRS. The Group make this distinction to give a better understanding of the financial performance of the business.\n\nThe consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting. The Directors have considered the Group's business activities and how it generates value, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect future development, business performance including liquidity and access to financing as outlined in note 24. The position of the Group including the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the potential impact of climate related risks on profitability and liquidity was also considered. The foodservice business in our Taste & Nutrition segment has shown good recovery in 2021 to record third party revenues of \u20ac1,616.1m (2020: \u20ac1,390.5m). There are no material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.\n\nThe Directors report that they have satisfied themselves that the Group is a going concern, having adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. In forming this view, the Directors have reviewed the Group's forecast for a period not less than 12 months, the five year medium term plan, and have taken into account the cash flow implications of the plans, including proposed capital expenditure, and compared these with the Group's committed borrowing facilities and projected gearing ratios.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries), all of which prepare financial statements up to 31 December. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with the policies adopted by the Group. Control is achieved where the Company has the power over the investee, has exposure or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.\n\nSubsidiaries\n\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the financial year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the date the Company gains control until the date the Company ceases to control the subsidiary. All inter-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.",

        "page_content": "## 1.   Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\nBasis of consolidation (continued) Joint ventures\n\nJoint ventures are all entities over which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. On acquisition of the investment in joint venture, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying value of the investment.\n\nThe Group's share of its joint ventures post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in 'Share of joint ventures profit after taxation during the financial year' within Trading Profit in the Consolidated Income Statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves until the date on which joint control ceases. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment, less any impairment in value. Where indicators of impairment arise, the carrying amount of the joint venture is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount.\n\nUnrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are eliminated to the extent that they do not provide evidence of impairment. The accounting policies of joint ventures are amended where necessary to ensure consistency of accounting treatment at Group level.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue represents the value of the consideration received or receivable, for taste and nutrition applications and consumer foods chilled food products, from third party customers. Revenue is recorded at invoice value, net of discounts, allowances, volume and promotional rebates and excludes VAT. Revenue is recognised when control of the products has transferred, which is usually upon shipment, or in line with terms agreed with individual customers. Revenue is recorded when there is no unfulfilled obligation on the part of the Group. An estimate is made on the basis of historical sales returns and is recorded to allocate these returns to the same period as the original revenue is recorded. Rebates and discounts are provided for based on agreements or contracts with customers, agreed promotional arrangements and accumulated experience using the expected value method. Any unutilised accrual is released after assessment that the likelihood of such a claim being made is highly improbable.\n\nThe Group disaggregates revenue by End Use Market (EUM) and primary geographic market. An EUM is defined as the market in which the end consumer or customer of Kerry's product operates. The economic factors within the EUMs of Food, Beverage and Pharma which affect the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are similar.\n\n## Trading profit\n\nTrading profit refers to the operating profit generated by the businesses before intangible asset amortisation and gains or losses generated from non-trading items. Trading profit represents operating profit before specific items that are not reflective of underlying trading performance and therefore hinder comparison of the trading performance of the Group's businesses, either year-on-year or with other businesses.\n\n## Segmental analysis\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management structure of the Group and the internal financial information provided to the Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (the Executive Directors) who is responsible for making strategic decisions, allocating resources, monitoring and assessing the performance of each segment. Trading profit as reported internally by segment is the key measure utilised in assessing the performance of operating segments within the Group. Other Corporate activities, such as the cost of corporate stewardship and the cost of the KerryConnect programme, are reported along with the elimination of inter-group activities under the heading 'Group Eliminations and Unallocated'. Intangible asset amortisation, non-trading items, net finance costs and income taxes are managed on a centralised basis and therefore, these items are not allocated between operating segments and are not reported per segment in note 2.\n\nThe Group has determined it has two reportable segments: Taste & Nutrition and Consumer Foods. The Taste & Nutrition segment is the world's leading taste and nutrition partner for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical markets. Kerry innovates with its customers to create great tasting products, with improved nutrition and functionality, whilst ensuring better impact for the planet. The Taste & Nutrition segment supplies industries across Ireland, Europe, Americas and APMEA (Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa). The Consumer Foods segment is a leader in our consumer foods categories in the chilled cabinet primarily in Ireland and in the UK.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\n- - Buildings\n\n2% - 5%\n\n- - Plant, machinery and equipment\n\n7% - 25%\n\n- - Motor vehicles\n\n20%\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises purchase price and other directly attributable costs. Freehold land is stated at cost and is not depreciated. Depreciation on the remaining property, plant and equipment is calculated by charging equal annual instalments to the Consolidated Income Statement at the following annual rates:\n\nThe charge in respect of periodic depreciation is calculated after establishing an estimate of the asset's useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. Increasing/ (decreasing) an asset's expected life or its residual value would result in a (decreased)/increased depreciation charge to the Consolidated Income Statement as well as an increase/(decrease) in the carrying value of the asset.\n\nThe useful lives of Group assets are determined by management at the time the assets are acquired and reviewed annually for appropriateness. These lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology or the location of the asset and its climate related risk. Historically, changes in useful lives or residual values have not resulted in material changes to the Group's depreciation charge.\n\nAssets in the course of construction for production or administrative purposes are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and other directly attributable costs. Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use, on the same basis as other property assets.",

        "page_content": "## 1.   Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Leasing\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which consists of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Group in setting up/entering into the lease, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease and any payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentive received).\n\nThe Group depreciates right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life or the end of the lease term. The carrying amounts of right-of-use assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nThe Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the applicable incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises of fixed or variable payments (based on an index or rate), amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nSubsequent to the initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for the interest applied and it is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or contract modifications. When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset or in the Consolidated Income Statement if the right-of-use asset is already reduced to zero.\n\nThe Group has elected to record short-term leases of less than 12 months and leases of low-value assets as defined in IFRS 16 as an operating expense in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Group has also elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components, and instead account for each lease component and any associated nonlease components as a single lease component further increasing the lease liability.\n\n## Assets classified as held for sale\n\nAssets are classified as held for sale if their carrying value will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met if, at the financial year end, the sale is highly probable, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition, management is committed to the sale and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.\n\nAssets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nGoodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous Irish/ UK GAAP amounts subject to impairment testing. Goodwill written off to reserves under Irish/UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.\n\nAt the date control is achieved, goodwill is allocated for the purpose of impairment testing to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) provided they represent the lowest level at which management monitor goodwill for impairment purposes. Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for indications of impairment at least annually and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, where identified. Impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill (not previously written off to reserves) is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## Brand related intangibles\n\nBrand related intangibles acquired as part of a business combination are valued at their fair value at the date control is achieved. Intangible assets determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortised and are tested for impairment at least annually. Indefinite life intangible assets are those for which there is no foreseeable limit to their expected useful life. In arriving at the conclusion that these brand related intangibles have an indefinite life, management considers the nature and type of the intangible asset, the absence of any legal or other limits on the assets' use, the fact the business and products have a track record of stability, the high barriers to market entry and the Group's commitment to continue to invest for the long-term to extend the period over which the intangible asset is expected to continue to provide economic benefits. The classification of intangible assets as indefinite is reviewed annually. The future expectation of potential market disruption due to changing consumer preferences or changes in supply chain of raw materials linked to sustainability and climate change were assessed as part of this review and were deemed to have no material impact.\n\nFinite life brand related intangible assets are amortised over the period of their expected useful lives, which predominantly range from 2 to 20 years, by charging equal annual instalments to the Consolidated Income Statement. The useful life used to amortise finite intangible assets relates to the future performance of the assets acquired and management's estimate of the period over which economic benefit will be derived from the asset. Historically, changes in useful lives have not resulted in material changes to the Group's amortisation charge.\n\n## Computer software\n\nComputer software separately acquired, including computer software which is not an integral part of an item of computer hardware, is stated at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises purchase price and other directly attributable costs.",

        "page_content": "## 1.   Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Intangible assets (continued)\n\nCosts relating to the development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once the recognition criteria outlined as follows are met:\n\nComputer software (continued)\n\n- -an asset can be separately identified;\n- -the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably;\n- -it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;\n- -it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity; and\n- -the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nComputer software is amortised over its expected useful life, which ranges from 3 to 7 years, by charging equal annual instalments to the Consolidated Income Statement. Amortisation commences when the assets are ready for use.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation. They are tested annually for impairment or when indications exist that the asset may be impaired. For the purpose of assessing impairment, these assets are allocated to groups of cash generating units (CGUs) using a reasonable and consistent basis. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement for the amount by which the asset's carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell or its value in use. Value in use is determined as the discounted future cash flows of the CGU. The key assumptions during the financial year for the value in use calculations are discount rates, cash flows and growth rates.\n\nWhen an impairment loss (other than on goodwill) subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not exceeding its carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is reviewed by assessing the asset's value in use when compared to its carrying value.\n\nThe carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost includes raw materials, direct labour and all other expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the products to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated at the weighted average cost incurred in acquiring inventories. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price of inventory on hand less all further costs to completion and all costs expected to be incurred in distribution and selling. Writedowns of inventories are primarily recognised under 'Raw materials and consumables' in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes include both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes are charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement except when they relate to items charged or credited directly in other comprehensive income or shareholders' equity. In this instance the income taxes are also charged or credited to other comprehensive income or shareholders' equity.\n\nThe current tax charge is calculated as the amount payable based on taxable profit and the tax rates applying to those profits in the financial year together with adjustments relating to prior years. Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe Group is subject to uncertainties, including tax audits, in any of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Group accounts for uncertain tax positions in line with IFRIC 23 'Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments'. The Group considers each uncertain tax treatment separately or together with one or more uncertain tax treatments based on which approach better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. If the Group concludes that it is not probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment the Group reflects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable profit, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rate. The Group reflects the effect of uncertainty for each uncertain tax treatment using an expected value approach or a most likely approach depending on which method the Group expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. The unit of account for recognition purposes is the income tax/deferred tax assets or liabilities and the Group does not provide separately for uncertain tax positions. When the final tax outcome for these items is different from amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax in the period in which such a determination is made, as well as the Group's cash position.\n\nDeferred taxes are calculated based on the temporary differences arising between the tax base of the asset or liability and its carrying value in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred taxes are recognised on all temporary differences in existence at the balance sheet date except for:\n\n- -temporary differences which arise on investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n- -temporary differences which arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction does not affect accounting or taxable profit or loss, or on the initial recognition of goodwill for which a tax deduction is not available; and\n\nThe recognition of a deferred tax asset is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date.",

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Income taxes (continued)\n\nCurrent income tax assets and current income tax liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and the Group intends to settle on a net basis. Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts, the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle on a net basis.\n\n## Retirement benefits obligation\n\nPayments to defined contribution schemes are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as they fall due and any contributions outstanding at the financial year end are included as an accrual in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nActuarial valuations for accounting purposes are carried out at each balance sheet date in relation to defined benefit schemes, using the projected unit credit method, to determine the schemes' liabilities and the related cost of providing benefits. Scheme assets are accounted for at fair value using bid prices.\n\nCurrent service cost is recognised as it arises within staff costs in the Consolidated Income Statement. Net interest which is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets is recognised in interest costs in the Consolidated Income Statement. Gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a scheme are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the curtailment or settlement occurs. Re-measurement of retirement benefits obligation, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on scheme assets (excluding amounts included in net interest cost) are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\nThe defined benefit liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of any scheme assets. Defined benefit assets are also recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet but are limited to the present value of available refunds from, and reductions in future contributions to, the scheme.\n\n## Provisions\n\n- -the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event;\n\nProvisions can be distinguished from other types of liability by considering the events that give rise to the obligation and the degree of uncertainty as to the amount or timing of the liability. These are recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet when:\n\n- -it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation; and\n- -a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nThe amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, after taking account of the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nThe outcome depends on future events which are by their nature uncertain. In assessing the likely outcome, management bases its assessment on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances. Provisions are disclosed in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Non-trading items\n\nCertain items, by virtue of their nature and amount, are disclosed separately in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information. These items relate to events or circumstances that are not related to normal trading activities and are labelled collectively as 'non-trading items'.\n\nNon-trading items include gains or losses on the disposal of businesses, disposal of assets (non-current assets and assets classified as held for sale), costs in preparation of disposal of assets, material restructuring costs and material transaction, integration and restructuring costs associated with acquisitions. Non-trading items are disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Research and development expenditure\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the financial year it is incurred.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is assessed and capitalised as an internally generated intangible asset only if it meets all of the following criteria:\n\n- -it is intended to complete the asset for use or sale;\n- -it is technically feasible to complete the asset for use or sale;\n- -the Group has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;\n- -adequate resources are available to complete the asset for sale or use; and\n- -it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits;\n- -the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nCapitalised development costs are amortised over their expected economic lives. Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, product development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the financial year it is incurred. Accordingly, the Group has not capitalised product development expenditure to date.\n\n## Grants\n\nGrants of a capital nature are accounted for as deferred income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are released to the Consolidated Income Statement at the same rates as the related assets are depreciated. Grants of a revenue nature are credited to the Consolidated Income Statement to offset the matching expenditure.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends are accounted for when they are approved, through the retained earnings reserve. Dividends proposed do not meet the definition of a liability until such time as they have been approved. Dividends are disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group has granted share-based payments to Executive Directors and senior executives under a long-term incentive plan and to Executive Directors under a shortterm incentive plan.\n\nThe equity-settled share-based awards granted under these plans are measured at the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. The cost of the award is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement over the vesting period of the awards based on the probable number of awards that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to shareholders' equity.",

Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Share-based payments (continued)\n\nFor the purposes of the long-term incentive plan, the fair value of the award is measured using the Monte Carlo Pricing Model. For the short-term incentive plan, the fair value of the expense equates directly to the cash value of the portion of the short-term incentive plan that will be settled by way of shares/share options.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed and any adjustment necessary is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Share-based payments are disclosed in note 28 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising from either the retranslation of the resulting monetary assets or liabilities at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date or from the settlement of the balance at a different rate are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when they occur.\n\nOn consolidation, the income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into euro at the average exchange rate. If this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, a weighted average rate is used. The balance sheets of such subsidiaries are translated at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. Resulting exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency subsidiaries are taken directly to a separate component of shareholders' equity.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign subsidiaries are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries and are translated at the closing rate.\n\nOn disposal of a foreign currency subsidiary, the cumulative translation difference for that foreign subsidiary is recycled to the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs incurred for qualifying assets, which take a substantial period of time to construct, are added to the cost of the asset during the period of time required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used for the acquisition of businesses. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate fair value of the consideration given. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' are recognised at their fair value at the date the Group assumes control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the Group's previously held investment in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.\n\nCertain assets and liabilities are not recognised at their fair value at the date control was achieved as they are accounted for using other applicable IFRSs. These include deferred tax assets/liabilities and also any assets related to employee benefit arrangements.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is still in progress. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period of one year from the date control is achieved when additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances which would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.\n\nWhere applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement measured at fair value at the date control is achieved. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.\n\nAny fair value adjustments in relation to acquisitions completed prior to 1 January 2010 have been accounted for under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations (2004)'.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries held by the Parent Company are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## Investments in joint ventures\n\nInvestments in joint ventures held by the Group are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except for those classified as fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.\n\nAll financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date basis, where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe of the market concerned.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, only if the Group holds an enforceable legal right of set off for such amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise an asset and settle the liability simultaneously. In all other instances they are presented gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- -those to be measured at amortised cost.\n- -those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through OCI or through profit or loss); and",

        "page_content": "## 1.   Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Financial instruments (continued)\n\nThe classification depends on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).\n\n## Debt instruments:\n\n- -Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at amortised cost. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement. Impairment losses are presented in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depend on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:\n\n- -FVOCI: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. The Group have no debt instruments measured at FVOCI.\n- -FVPL: Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). In addition, assets that are irrevocably designated as FVPL at origination to eliminate or significantly reduce an accounting mismatch are also measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Equity instruments:\n\nThe Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group's management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to the Consolidated Income Statement following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the Group's right to receive payments is established.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets measured at FVPL (Rabbi Trust assets) are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.\n\n## Trade and other receivables:\n\nTrade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, when they are recognised at fair value. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents:\n\nCash and cash equivalents carried at amortised cost consists of cash at bank and in hand, bank overdrafts held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with a maturity of three months or less from the date of placement. Cash at bank and in hand and short-term bank deposits are shown under current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet under the heading 'Cash at bank and in hand'. Bank overdrafts are shown within 'Borrowings and overdrafts' in current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows. The carrying amount of these assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nOther non-derivative financial liabilities consist primarily of trade and other payables and borrowings. Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost, which approximates to their fair value given the short-term nature of these liabilities. Trade and other payables are non-interest bearing.\n\nDebt instruments are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Subsequently they are reported at amortised cost, except for hedged debt. To the extent that debt instruments are hedged under qualifying fair value hedges, the carrying value of the debt instrument is adjusted for changes in the fair value of the hedged risk, with changes arising recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. The fair value of the hedged item is primarily determined using the discounted cash flow basis\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial liabilities at FVPL arise when the financial liabilities are either derivative liabilities held for trading or they are designated upon initial recognition as FVPL.\n\nThe Group classifies as held for trading certain derivatives that are not designated and effective as a hedging instrument. The Group does not have any other financial liabilities classified as held for trading.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor trade receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. Further detail is provided in note 19.\n\n## Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Group derecognises financial liabilities only when the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\nDerivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivatives are carried at fair value. The Group's activities expose it to risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in relation to international trading and long-term debt. The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to hedge these exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. When cross currency interest rate swaps are used to hedge interest rates and foreign exchange rates, the change in the foreign currency basis spreads element of the contract that relates to the hedged item is recognised within other reserves under the cost of hedging reserve.",

When the hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction occurs and results in the recognition of an asset or liability, the amounts previously recognised in the hedge reserve, within OCI are reclassified through profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is impacting the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, resulting in the recognition of a non-financial asset, such as inventory. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred cost of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is applied to foreign exchange forward contracts which are expected to offset the changes in fair value of expected future cash flows. In order to achieve and maintain cash flow hedge accounting, it is necessary for management to determine, at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether a forecast transaction is highly probable.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nWhere fixed to floating interest rate swaps are used, they are treated as fair value hedges when the qualifying conditions are met. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are recognised directly in the Consolidated Income Statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nHedge accounting is derecognised when the hedging relationship ceases to exist. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised over the remaining maturity of the hedged item through the Consolidated Income Statement from that date.\n\n## Trading derivatives\n\nCertain derivatives which comply with the Group's financial risk management policies are not accounted for using hedge accounting. This arises where the derivatives; (a) provide a hedge against foreign currency borrowings without having to apply hedge accounting; or (b) where management have decided not to apply hedge accounting. In these cases the instrument is reported independently at fair value with any changes recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. In all other instances, cash flow or fair value hedge accounting is applied.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Preparation of the Group consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimations, assumptions and judgements that affect the reported profits, assets and liabilities.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information or more experience. Such changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised.\n\nIn particular, information about significant areas of estimation and judgement that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are described below and in the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the critical accounting estimates and judgements as outlined below has been assessed and is not considered material in the context of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets (Estimation) Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired or whether a reversal of an impairment of intangible assets (other than on goodwill) should be recorded requires comparison of the value in use for the relevant groups of cash generating units (CGUs) to the net assets attributable to those CGUs. The value in use calculation is based on an estimate of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGUs and these are discounted to net present value using an appropriate discount rate. The tests are dependent on management's estimates, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates applied to those cash flows, the expected long-term growth rate of the applicable businesses and terminal values. Such estimates are subject to change as a result of changing economic conditions. As forecasting future cash flows is dependent upon the Group successfully leveraging its base of intangible assets over the long-term, estimates are required in relation to future cash flows which will support the asset value.",

        "page_content": "## 1.   Statement of accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued)\n\nThese estimates may depend upon the outcome of future events and may need to be revised as circumstances change. The impact of COVID-19 on the Group was considered and has been reflected in the cash flow forecasts employed in the value in use calculations. The potential impact of climate related events was also considered under two different temperature scenarios and had no impact on our conclusions. Details of the assumptions used and key sources of estimation involved are outlined in note 12 to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets (Estimation) (continued)\n\nThe Group continues to monitor its assessment of the economic environment particularly due to the pace and extent of recovery in some markets as a result of COVID-19. The long-term outlook for our businesses currently remains positive, supports our CGU valuations and no impairment was identified as a result of the impairment testing review carried out. There is significant headroom in the recoverable amount of the related CGUs as compared to their carrying value and the likelihood of impairment is considered remote.\n\n## Business combinations (Estimation)\n\nWhen acquiring a business, the Group is required to bring acquired assets and liabilities on to the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value, the determination of which requires a significant degree of estimation.\n\nAcquisitions may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of goodwill. Estimation is required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets. For intangible assets acquired, the Group bases valuations on expected future cash flows taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19 where applicable. This method employs a discounted cash flow analysis using the present value of the estimated after-tax cash flows expected to be generated from the purchased intangible asset using risk adjusted discount rates, revenue forecasts and estimated customer attrition as appropriate. The period of expected cash flows is based on the expected useful life of the intangible asset acquired.\n\nDepending on the nature of the assets and liabilities acquired, determined provisional fair values may possibly be adjusted within the measurement period as allowed by IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'.\n\nBusiness combinations are disclosed in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Non-trading items (Judgement)\n\nThe Group considers certain items, by virtue of their nature and amount, are disclosed separately in order for the user to obtain a proper understanding of the financial information. These items relate to events or circumstances that are not related to normal trading activities and are labelled collectively as 'non-trading items'. Determining which transactions are to be disclosed separately is often a subjective matter. Circumstances that the Group believes would give rise to non-trading items for separate disclosure are outlined in the accounting policy on non-trading items. For clarity, separate disclosure is made of all items in one column on the face of the Group Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nIncome tax charge and income/deferred tax assets and liabilities (Estimation and Judgement)\n\nSignificant judgement and a high degree of estimation is required in determining the income tax charge as the Group operates in many jurisdictions and the tax treatment of many items is uncertain with tax legislation being open to different interpretation. Furthermore, the Group can also be subject to uncertainties, including tax audits in any of the jurisdictions in which it operates, which by their nature, are often complex and can require several years to conclude. The Group considers these uncertain tax positions in the recognition of its income tax/deferred tax assets or liabilities. In line with its accounting policy, the Group bases its assessment on the probability of a tax authority accepting its general treatment having regard to all information available on the tax matter and when it is not probable reflects the uncertainty in income tax/deferred tax assets or liabilities. When applying its accounting policy at the year end the Group generally considered each uncertain tax treatment separately and reflected the effect of the uncertainty in the income tax/ deferred tax assets or liabilities using an expected value approach as this better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty. Such estimates are determined based on management judgement, interpretation of the relevant tax laws, correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and external tax advisors and past practices of the tax authorities. Where the final outcome of these tax matters is different from the amounts that were recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax charge in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nIncome taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 7 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively.",

Factors that may affect the Group's future tax charge include the effects of restructuring, acquisitions and disposals, changes in tax legislation and rates and the use of brought forward losses. In 2021, political agreement was reached by the OECD Inclusive Framework on a two-pillar approach to international tax reform, which aims to address the tax challenges arising from digitalisation and globalisation of the economy. In the absence of any finalised or substantively enacted legislation, the Group continues to monitor developments as they may apply to the Group.",

This could result in differing amortisation charges based on the allocation to finite life and indefinite life intangible assets.\n\nIncluded in the cost of brand related intangibles are intangibles of \u20ac1,621.9m (2020: \u20ac1,262.4m) which have indefinite lives.\n\nApproximately \u20ac11.4m (2020: \u20ac17.5m) of computer software additions during the year were internally generated, included in this are payroll costs of \u20ac10.0m (2020: \u20ac13.1m). The Group has not capitalised product development expenditure in 2021 (2020: \u20acnil).\n\nThe Group has no separate individual intangible asset that is material, as all intangibles acquired are integrated and developed within the existing business.",

Intangible assets (continued)\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and indefinite life intangibles are subject to impairment testing on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. These assets are allocated to groups of cash generating units (CGUs). The recoverable amount of each of the four CGUs is determined on value in use calculations. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are allocated to CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business acquisition, rather than where the assets are owned.\n\nCash flow forecasts employed for the value in use calculations are for a five year period approved by management and a terminal value which is applied to the year five cash flows. The terminal value reflects the discounted value of the cash flows beyond year five which is based on the weighted average long-term growth rates for each CGU.\n\nNo impairment was recognised in 2021 or 2020 as a result of the impairment testing which identified significant headroom in the recoverable amount of the related CGUs as compared to their carrying value. In 2021, there was no specific impairment charge (2020: \u20acnil) in relation to goodwill recorded in non-trading items in the Consolidated Income Statement due to the classification of a business as held for sale.\n\nA summary of the allocation of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets by CGU, is as follows:\n\n|                   | Goodwill 2021 \u20ac'm   | Goodwill 2020 \u20ac'm   | Indefinite Life  Intangibles 2021 \u20ac'm   | Indefinite Life  Intangibles 2020 \u20ac'm   |\n|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Taste & Nutrition |                     |                     |                                         |                                         |\n| Europe            | 564.5               | 496.5               | 196.6                                   | 77.0                                    |\n| Americas          | 2,150.1             | 1,507.3             | 1,356.4                                 | 1,088.1                                 |\n| APMEA             | 263.5               | 243.5               | 47.9                                    | 51.4                                    |\n| Consumer Foods    |                     |                     |                                         |                                         |\n| Europe            | 143.2               | 402.7               | 21.0                                    | 45.9                                    |\n|                   | 3,121.3             | 2,650.0             | 1,621.9                                 | 1,262.4                                 |\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nForecasts are generally derived from a combination of internal and external factors based on historical experience and take account of expected growth in the relevant region. The key assumptions for calculating value in use calculations are those relating to the discount rate, growth rate and cash flows. The table below outlines the weighted average discount rates and weighted average long-term growth rates used in the terminal value for each CGU:\n\nGrowth\n\n|                   | Discount   Rates 2021   | Discount   Rates 2020   | Growth   Rates 2021   | Rates 2020   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------|\n| Taste & Nutrition |                         |                         |                       |              |\n| Europe            | 6.3%                    | 6.7%                    | 1.4%                  | 1.4%         |\n| Americas          | 7.1%                    | 7.1%                    | 1.1%                  | 1.1%         |\n| APMEA             | 8.9%                    | 9.5%                    | 3.6%                  | 3.5%         |\n| Consumer Foods    |                         |                         |                       |              |\n| Europe            | 6.1%                    | 6.6%                    | 1.7%                  | 1.5%         |\n\nManagement estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates consistent with the Group's weighted average cost of capital and the risks specific to the CGUs. A higher discount rate is applied to higher risk markets, while a lower rate is applied to more stable markets.\n\nLong-term growth rates are based on external market data, are broadly in line with long-term industry growth rates and are conservative in nature. Generally, lower growth rates are used in mature markets while higher growth rates are used in emerging markets.",

Intangible assets (continued)\n\n## Impairment testing (continued)\n\nThe assumptions used by management in estimating cash flows for each CGU include future profitability and capital expenditure requirements. The cash flows included in the value in use calculations are generally determined based on historical performance, management's past experience, management's expectation of future trends affecting the industry and other developments and initiatives in the business. Management also considered the impact of COVID-19 on the Group which has been reflected in the cash flow forecasts employed in the value in use calculations. Capital expenditure requirements to maintain the CGUs performance and profitability are based on the Group's strategic plans, excluding future development activity, and broadly assume that historic investment patterns will be maintained.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis has been performed across the four CGUs. If the discount rate was 1% higher than management's estimates, there would have been no requirement for the Group to recognise any impairment charge in 2021 or 2020. Further, a 5% increase would not have resulted in an impairment charge in 2021 or 2020 as there is headroom in the discounted cash flows. If the estimated growth rate was 1% lower than management's estimates, there would have been no requirement for the Group to recognise any impairment charge in 2021 or 2020. If the estimated cash flows were 5% lower than management's estimates, again there would have been no requirement for the Group to recognise any impairment charge in 2021 or 2020. Management believes that no reasonable change, in normal circumstances, in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount. The potential impact of climate related events was also considered as part of the sensitivity analysis and had no impact on our conclusions.\n\n## 13.

These investments have no fixed maturity or coupon rate. A fair value assessment was performed at 31 December 2021 which did not result in a change to the carrying value of these assets. In October 2020, the Group disposed of its investments in equity securities for a total consideration of \u20ac5.3m following a fair value assessment in June 2020, resulting in a decrease to the carrying value of these assets of \u20ac1.3m through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Other investments\n\nThe Group maintains a Rabbi Trust in respect of a non-qualified deferred compensation plan in the USA. The assets of the trust primarily consist of equities, bonds and cash which are restricted for use. These assets are fair valued through profit or loss at each financial year end using quoted market prices. The corresponding liability is recognised within other non-current liabilities (note 22).",

In the above table, NOLs refers to Net Operating Losses.\n\nThe following is an analysis of the deferred tax balances (after offset) for balance sheet purposes:\n\n|                          | 2021 \u20ac'm   | 2020 \u20ac'm   |\n|--------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Deferred tax assets      | (67.8)     | (33.8)     |\n| Deferred tax liabilities | 447.3      | 330.2      |\n|                          | 379.5      | 296.4      |\n\nThe total deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised is \u20ac26.9m (2020: \u20ac21.8m). The Group does not have any unrecognised losses which have an expiry date.\n\nDeferred tax has not been recognised in respect of withholding taxes and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, as the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The deferred tax liabilities which have not been recognised in respect of these temporary differences are not material as the Group can rely on the availability of participation exemptions and tax credits in the context of the Group's investments in subsidiaries.\n\nAn increase of 1% in the tax rates at which deferred tax is calculated would increase the net deferred tax balance of the Group by \u20ac16.7m (2020: \u20ac15.0m).\n\n## 18.

The fair value of these receivables approximates their carrying value as these are short-term in nature; hence, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales and the corresponding historical credit loss experience. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward looking information on macroeconomic factors, including the GDP of the countries in which the Group sells its goods and services, that affect the ability of customers to settle receivables.\n\nBefore accepting any new customer, the Group uses a credit scoring system to assess the potential customer's credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. These credit limits are reviewed regularly throughout the financial year. The Group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade receivables.\n\nThere is no significant concentration of credit risk or transaction currency risk with respect to trade receivables, as the Group has a large number of internationally dispersed customers. Further disclosures on currency risk are provided in note 24 to the financial statements.",

No assets of the Group have been pledged to secure these items.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021 and at 31 December 2020, the Group's debt portfolio included:\n\n- -\u20ac750m of senior notes issued in 2015 and \u20ac200m issued in April 2020 as a tap onto the original issuance (the 2025 senior notes). \u20ac175m of the issuance in 2015 were swapped, using cross currency swaps, to US dollar; and\n- -US$750m of senior notes issued in 2013 maturing in 2023 (the 2023 senior notes), of which US$250m were swapped, using cross currency swaps, to euro;\n- -\u20ac750m of senior notes issued in 2019 (the 2029 senior notes). No interest rate derivatives were entered into for this issuance.\n\nIn addition as at 31 December 2021, the Group's debt portfolio includes the December 2021 \u20ac750m of euro sustainability-linked bond notes (2031 SLB senior notes) and no interest rate derivatives were entered into for this issuance.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Group's debt portfolio included US$200m of senior notes issued in 2010 (private placement notes) which were swapped using cross currency swaps to euro. These notes were repaid in full in June 2021 ahead of their scheduled maturity date. The related cross currency swaps also matured during the same period.\n\nThe adjustment to senior notes classified under liabilities at fair value through profit or loss of \u20ac10.9m (2020: \u20ac33.7m) represents the part adjustment to the carrying value of debt from applying fair value hedge accounting for interest rate risk. This amount is primarily offset by the fair value adjustment on the corresponding hedge items being the underlying cross currency interest rate swaps.\n\n|                                          | Notes      | Financial  Assets/ (Liabilities)  at Amortised  Cost 2020 \u20ac'm   | Assets/  (Liabilities)   at Fair Value   through Profit   or Loss 2020 \u20ac'm   | Derivatives   Designated   as Hedging   Instruments 2020 \u20ac'm   | Assets/  (Liabilities) at   FVOCI 2020 \u20ac'm   | Total 2020 \u20ac'm   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Group:                                   |            |                                                                 |                                                                              |                                                                |                                              |                  |\n| Financial asset investments              | 13         | -

Financial instruments\n\n## Capital management\n\nThe financing structure of the Group is managed in order to optimise shareholder value while allowing the Group to take advantage of opportunities that might arise to grow the business. The Group targets acquisition and investment opportunities that are value enhancing and the Group's policy is to fund these transactions from cash flow or borrowings while maintaining its strong investment grade credit rating.\n\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of debt related financial liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, deferred payments on acquisitions of businesses and equity attributable to owners of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, as represented in the table below:\n\n2020\n\n|                                                                  | Notes   | 2021 \u20ac'm   | \u20ac'm     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------|---------|\n| Issued capital and reserves attributable to owners of the parent |         | 5,601.2    | 4,655.5 |\n| Net debt - pre lease liabilities                                 | 23      | 2,049.9    | 1,863.6 |\n| Lease liabilities                                                | 20/22   | 74.2       | 81.5    |\n| Deferred payments on acquisition of businesses                   | 20/22   | 15.0       | 22.2    |\n|                                                                  |         | 7,740.3    | 6,622.8 |\n\nDuring the financial year the Group undertook four notable debt financing events, the first three of which were completed in June.\n\nThe Group entered into a dedicated bridge facility for US$1,000m for the acquisition of Niacet. This facility was drawn on the closure of the acquisition in late Q3 2021 and was repaid and cancelled in early Q4 2021, with repayment funded predominantly out of the proceeds from the sale of the Consumer Foods Meats and Meals business.\n\nThe Group exercised the second of the two 'plus one' extension options on its \u20ac1,100m revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date of this facility for the full \u20ac1,100m to June 2026. As part of this process the Group amended and restated the facility agreement to allow for IBOR replacement language. This amendment to immediately adopt SONIA for GBP loans and to allow for switch language for US Dollars at a future date has no commercial impact on the Group. In keeping with the Group's commitment to Sustainability, the facility incorporates a price adjustment mechanism which is linked to the Group meeting or exceeding its carbon, water and food waste reduction targets.\n\nThe Group repaid US$200m of outstanding private placement notes ahead of the scheduled maturity date (Tranche C US$125m and Tranche D US$75m of the 2010 senior notes). At the time of issuance the US$200m of private placement notes were swapped from US dollar fixed rate to euro floating rate using cross currency interest rate swaps which were closed out at the time of the repayment. The net cash outflow was funded from existing cash resources of the Group. Following repayment of the US$200m of private placement notes, the Group has no borrowings that carry financial covenants.\n\nIn December 2021 the Group issued \u20ac750m 10-year euro sustainability-linked bond notes (2031 SLB senior notes). The issuance is listed on the Euronext Dublin - Global Exchange Market. The proceeds of the issuance will be used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of indebtedness and the funding of acquisitions in the ordinary course of business. The SLB senior notes embed key 'Beyond the Horizon' sustainability commitments into our financing.\n\nAll senior notes issued by the Group are rated by S&P (BBB+) and Moody's (Baa2).\n\nNet debt is subject to seasonal fluctuations that can be up to 25% above year end debt levels, before allowance for acquisition activity undertaken during the financial year.\n\nCapital is managed by setting net debt to earnings before finance income and costs, income taxes, depreciation (net), intangible asset amortisation and non-trading items (EBITDA) targets while allowing flexibility to accommodate significant acquisition opportunities. Any expected variation from these targets should be reversible in a period of time that retains our strong investment grade credit rating, otherwise consideration would be given to issuing additional equity in the Group.\n\n|                      |   2021  Times |   2020 Times |\n|----------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Net debt: EBITDA     |           2   |          1.9 |\n| EBITDA: Net interest |          14.9 |         13.8 |\n\nThe Net debt: EBITDA and EBITDA: Net interest ratios disclosed are calculated using an adjusted EBITDA, adjusted finance costs (net of finance income) and an adjusted net debt value to adjust for the impact of non-trading items, acquisitions net of disposals and deferred payments in relation to acquisitions.\n\nFor the financial year end 31 December 2020, the private placement notes issued in 2010 had $200m outstanding and this series of notes carry financial covenants calculated in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement. The principal financial covenants were that the ratio of Net debt to EBITDA of a maximum of 3.5 times and EBITDA to Net interest charge of a minimum of 4.0 times. The actual outturn for 2020 were 1.9 times and 13.8 times respectively.",

        "page_content": "## 24. Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives\n\nThe Group has a clearly defined Financial Risk Management Programme, which is approved by the Board of Directors and is subject to regular monitoring by the Finance Committee and Group Internal Audit. The Group operates a centralised treasury function, which manages the principal financial risks of the Group and Company.\n\nThe principal objectives of the Group's Financial Risk Management Programme are:\n\n- -to manage the Group's exposure to interest rate risk;\n- -to manage the Group's exposure to foreign exchange rate risk;\n- -to ensure that the Group has sufficient credit facilities available to fund the Group and manage liquidity risk; and\n- -to ensure that counterparty credit risk is monitored and managed.\n\nResidual exposures not managed commercially are hedged using approved financial instruments. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group's policies and procedures. The Group does not engage in speculative trading.\n\nThe principal objectives of the Group's Financial Risk Management Programme are further discussed across the following categories:\n\n- (ii)   Interest rate risk management - key interest rate exposures of the Group and the disclosures on interest rate derivatives.\n- (i) Foreign exchange rate risk management - key foreign exchange exposure of the Group and the disclosures on forward foreign exchange contracts.\n- (iii)   Liquidity risk management - key banking facilities available to the Group and the maturity profile of the Group's debt.\n- (v)   Price risk management - key price risk exposures of the Group.\n- (iv)   Credit risk management - details in relation to the management of credit risk within the Group.\n- (vi)   Fair value of financial instruments - disclosures in relation to the fair value of financial instruments.\n- (vii)  Offsetting financial instruments - disclosures in relation to the potential offsetting values in financial instruments.\n\n## (i) Foreign exchange rate risk management\n\nThe Group is exposed to transactional foreign currency risk on trading activities conducted by subsidiaries in currencies other than their functional currency. Group policy is to manage foreign currency exposures commercially and through netting of exposures wherever possible. Any residual exposures arising on foreign exchange transactions are hedged in accordance with Group policy using approved financial instruments, which consist primarily of spot and forward exchange contracts and currency swaps.\n\nAs at 31 December, the Group had an exposure to a US dollar liability of \u20ac13.1m (2020: \u20ac29.4m asset) and a sterling asset of \u20ac36.5m (2020: \u20ac8.4m). Based on these net positions, as at 31 December 2021, a weakening of 5% of the US dollar and sterling against all other key operational currencies, and holding all other items constant, would have impacted the profit after taxation of the Group for the financial year by a decrease of \u20ac1.0m (2020: \u20ac1.6m).\n\nThe Group's gain or loss on the retranslation of the net assets of foreign currency subsidiaries is taken directly to the translation reserve. As at 31 December 2021 a 5% strengthening of the euro against the US dollar and sterling, holding all other items constant, would have resulted in an additional translation reserve loss of \u20ac25.9m (2020: \u20ac21.6m) and \u20ac23.2m (2020: \u20ac22.9m), respectively.\n\n## (i.i) Forward foreign exchange contracts\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in relation to international trading, primarily sales in US dollar and sterling out of the Eurozone and sales and purchases in US dollar in APMEA. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge these exposures. All such exposures are highly probable. Derivative financial instruments are held in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value.\n\nThe following table details the portfolio of forward foreign exchange contracts* at the balance sheet date:\n\n|                                       | 2021 \u20ac'm Asset   | 2021 \u20ac'm Liability   | 2021 \u20ac'm Total   | 2020 \u20ac'm Asset   | 2020 \u20ac'm Liability   | 2020 \u20ac'm Total   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Designated in a hedging relationship: |                  |                      |                  |                  |                      |                  |\n| - current  1                          | 15.2             | (40.1)               | (24.9)           | 14.1             | (10.0)               | 4.1              |\n| - non-current  2                      | 0.2              | (0.5)                | (0.3)            | 0.1              | (0.5)                | (0.4)            |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts    | 15.4             | (40.6)               | (25.2)           | 14.2             | (10.5)               | 3.7              |",

The Group enters into hedge relationships when there is an economic relationship between the underlying highly probable forecasted transactions (hedged item) and the forward foreign exchange contracts (hedged instruments). As the critical terms match for the prospective assessment of effectiveness, a qualitative assessment is performed. The Group has established a 1:1 hedge ratio as the underlying risks in the forward foreign currency exchange contract are identical to the hedged risk components. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the origination of the hedging relationship. In instances where changes occur to the hedged item which result in the critical terms no longer matching, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness.\n\nThe Group does not hold any forward foreign exchange contracts classified as fair value hedges.\n\nThe following table details the foreign exchange contracts classified as cash flow hedges at 31 December:\n\n|                                                       | Fair Value Asset/(Liability)   | Fair Value Asset/(Liability)   | Notional Principal   | Notional Principal   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                       | 2021 \u20ac'm                       | 2020 \u20ac'm                       | 2021 \u20ac'm             | 2020 \u20ac'm             |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts                    |                                |                                |                      |                      |\n| less than 1 year                                      | (24.9)                         | 4.1                            | 2,798.0              | 1,105.0              |\n| 1 - 2 years                                           | (0.3)                          | (0.4)                          | 50.2                 | 31.4                 |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts - cash flow hedges | (25.2)                         | 3.7                            | 2,848.2              | 1,136.4              |\n\nThe following table details the impact of forward foreign exchange contracts - cash flow hedges on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 December:\n\n|                                                       | 2021 \u20ac'm   | 2020 \u20ac'm   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts - cash flow hedges | (25.2)     | 3.7        |\n| Retained earnings and other reserves:                 |            |            |\n| Cash flow hedging reserve                             | (3.2)      | (2.9)      |\n| Amount reclassified from OCI to profit or loss        | 28.4       | (0.8)      |\n|                                                       | 25.2       | (3.7)      |\n\nThe fair value included in the hedging reserve will primarily be released to the Consolidated Income Statement within 9 months (2020: 7 months) of the balance sheet date.

Derivative financial instruments are held in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their fair value.\n\n## (ii) Interest rate risk management\n\n## (ii.i) Interest rate profile of financial liabilities excluding related derivatives fair value\n\nThe Group's exposure to interest rates on financial assets and liabilities are detailed in the table below including the impact of cross currency swaps (CCS) on the currency profile of net debt (including lease liabilities):\n\nFixed\n\n|                     | Total   Pre CCS \u20ac'm   | Impact   of CCS \u20ac'm   | Total   after CCS \u20ac'm   | Floating   Rate Debt \u20ac'm   | Rate Debt \u20ac'm   |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|\n| Euro                | (1,831.1)             | (45.9)                | (1,877.0)               | 618.9                      | (2,495.9)       |\n| Sterling            | 74.5                  | -                     | 74.5                    | 74.5                       | -               |\n| US Dollar           | (513.5)               | 45.9                  | (467.6)                 | (246.7)                    | (220.9)         |\n| Others              | 122.3                 | -                     | 122.3                   | 122.3                      | -               |\n| At 31 December 2021 | (2,147.8)             | -                     | (2,147.8)               | 569.0                      | (2,716.8)       |\n| Euro                | (1,562.0)             | (191.7)               | (1,753.7)               | (25.0)                     | (1,728.7)       |\n| Sterling            | 78.2                  | -                     | 78.2                    | 78.2                       | -               |\n| US Dollar           | (591.5)               | 191.7                 | (399.8)                 | (196.1)                    | (203.7)         |\n| Others              | 82.0                  | -                     | 82.0                    | 82.0                       | -               |\n| At 31 December 2020 | (1,993.3)             | -                     | (1,993.3)               | (60.9)                     | (1,932.4)       |\n\nThe currency profile of debt highlights the impact of the US$250m (2020: US$450m) of cross currency swaps entered into at the time of issuance of senior notes. For the 2013 senior notes, US$250m were swapped from US dollar fixed to euro fixed and accounted for as cash flow hedges. As at 31 December 2020, the US$200m private placement notes were swapped from US dollar fixed to euro floating and are accounted for as fair value hedges. All cross currency swaps relating to the private placements notes matured in June 2021. The retranslation of the foreign currency debt of US$250m (2020: US$450m) to the balance sheet rate resulted in a foreign currency loss of \u20ac25.5m (2020: \u20ac36.8m) which is directly offset by a gain of \u20ac25.5m (2020: \u20ac36.8m) on the application of hedge accounting on the cross currency swaps.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds \u20ac950m of 2025 senior notes of which \u20ac750m were issued in 2015 and \u20ac200m were issued in 2020. \u20ac175m of the 2025 senior notes from 2015 were swapped, using cross currency swaps, from euro fixed to US dollar floating and are accounted for as fair value hedges of the related debt. The fair value of the related derivative includes an asset of \u20ac2.9m (2020: \u20ac16.2m) for movement in exchange rates since the date of execution which is directly offset by a loss of \u20ac2.9m (2020: \u20ac16.2m) on the application of hedge accounting on the cross currency swaps.\n\nThe floating rate financial liabilities are at rates which fluctuate mainly based upon LIBOR or EURIBOR and comprise of bank borrowings and other financial liabilities bearing interest rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from 1 to 6 months. At the financial year end 15% (2020: 24%) of gross debt was held at floating rates.\n\nIf the interest rates applicable to floating rate net debt were to rise by 1% holding all other items constant, the profit of the Group before taxation and non-trading items in the Consolidated Income Statement could decrease by 1% (2020: 1%).",

The Group enters into hedge relationships when there is an economic relationship between the identified notional amount of the underlying debt instrument (hedged item) and the interest rate swap contract (hedged instrument).\n\n## Interest rate swap\n\nAs the critical terms match for the prospective assessment of effectiveness, a qualitative assessment is performed. The Group has established a 1:1 hedge ratio as the underlying risks in the interest rate swap contracts are identical to the hedged risk components. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the origination of the hedging relationship. In instances where changes occur to the hedged item which result in the critical terms no longer matching, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness. Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to the credit/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps which is not matched by the loan.\n\n## Cross currency interest rate swap\n\nThe Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness for such swaps as while the critical terms match, both qualitative and quantitative assessments are required to be performed as there remains characteristics in cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are not present in the hedged item, being basis risks. The Group has established a 1:1 hedge ratio as the underlying risks in the cross currency interest rate swap contracts are identical to the hedged risk components. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the origination of the hedging relationship and at each reporting date.\n\nThe full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than twelve months and as a current asset or liability if the maturity of the hedged item is less than twelve months. The classification of the maturity profile of the interest rate derivative contracts are set out in the following tables (a) and (b).\n\nThe tables as set out reflect the hedging relationships affected by interest rate benchmark reform (IBOR reform) as financial instruments transition to risk free rates. Group Treasury are managing the IBOR transition process. The principal change is expected to be for the contractual terms of IBOR-referenced interest rate swaps and debt instruments and the related impact on hedge designation, systems and processes. While general communication with swap and debt counterparties has commenced, no specific changes have been agreed to date. In assessing the potential impact the Group has assumed that the uncertainty in relation to the IBOR reform will remain until the Group has completed specific changes with the swap and debt counterparties and the Group will continue to apply the amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' until this date.",

Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives (continued)\n\nLiquidity risk considers the risk that the Group could encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. There is no significant concentration of liquidity risk.\n\n## (iii) Liquidity risk management\n\nThe Group entered 2021 with significant available liquidity and no significant loan maturities arising until April 2023. During 2021, this position was further strengthened by (a) completing a \u20ac750m sustainability-linked bond issuance (2031 SLB Senior Notes) and (b) the exercise of the second of the two 'plus one year' extension options on our June 2019 revolving credit facility.\n\nGroup funding and liquidity is managed by ensuring that sufficient facilities are available from diverse funding sources with an appropriate spread of debt maturities. The Group uses cash flow forecasts to constantly monitor the funding requirements of the Group.\n\nGroup businesses are funded from cash generated from operations, borrowings from banks and senior notes from capital markets. It is Group policy to ensure that:\n\n- -at least 75% of total facilities available are committed.\n- -sufficient facilities are available to cover its gross forecast debt by at least 1.25 times; and\n\nBoth targets were met at 31 December 2021 and 2020.\n\nAll Group credit facilities are arranged and managed by Group Treasury and approved by the Board of Directors. Where possible, facilities have common security and terms and conditions. Other than the pre existing contractual exercise of the 'plus one year' extension option on the revolving credit facility agreement, the Group did not undertake any liability modifications to contracts for existing debt during 2021.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group had undrawn committed bank facilities of \u20ac1,100m (2020: \u20ac1,100m), and a portfolio of undrawn standby facilities amounting to \u20ac337m (2020: \u20ac320m). The undrawn committed facilities comprise primarily of a revolving credit facility maturing between 4 - 5 years (2020: between 4 - 5 years). As set out above during the year the Group exercised the second of its two 'plus one year' extension options on the revolving credit facility. As a result of the extension option the Group now holds a committed facility until June 2026 for \u20ac1,100m.\n\n## (iii.i) Contractual maturity profile of non-derivative financial instruments\n\nThe following table details the Group's remaining contractual maturity of its non-derivative financial instruments, including lease liabilities and deferred payments on acquisitions of businesses, excluding the remaining trade and other payables (note 20) and other non-current liabilities (note 22), of which \u20ac1,759.5 (2020: \u20ac1,499.2m) is payable within 1 year, \u20ac96.7m (2020: \u20ac85.3m) between 2 and 5 years. This information has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities to the earliest date on which the Group can be required to repay. The analysis includes both interest commitments and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest rates are floating, the rate used is derived from interest rate yield curves at the end of the reporting date and as such, are subject to change based on market movements.",

At 31 December 2021 and 2020 all cash, short-term deposits and other liquid investments had a maturity of less than 3 months. Cash at bank and in hand of \u20ac1,039.1m (2020: \u20ac554.9m) includes an amount of \u20ac545.0m (2020: \u20ac210.2m) held on short-term deposit of which \u20ac100.0m (2020: \u20ac75m) was held under a Sustainable Deposits programme.\n\nCredit risk exposure to financial institutions is actively managed across the portfolio of institutions by setting appropriate credit exposure limits based on a value at risk calculation that takes EBITDA of the Group and calculates approved tolerance levels based on credit default swap rates for the financial institutions. These levels are applied in controlling the level of material surplus funds that are placed with counterparties and for controlling the institutions with which the Group enters into derivative contracts. Credit default swaps are updated and reviewed on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Group's exposure to its counterparties is continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions entered into is spread amongst approved counterparties.\n\nTrade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable at operating unit level at least on a monthly basis.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to credit risk consists of gross trade receivables (note 19), cash deposits (note 23) and other financial assets (note 23), which are primarily interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.\n\n## (v) Price risk management\n\nThe Group's exposure to equity securities price risk, due to financial asset investments held, is considered to be low as the level of securities held versus the Group's net assets is not material.\n\n## (vi) Fair value of financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments recognised at fair value are analysed between those based on:\n\n## (a) Fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value\n\n- -quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);\n- -those involving inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).\n- -those involving inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices) (Level 2); and",

This includes equity investments;\n\nThe fair value of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows:\n\n- -other financial assets and liabilities (excluding derivatives) are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments. This includes interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts which are determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows;\n- -derivative financial instruments are calculated using quoted prices. Where such prices are not available, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments. Forward foreign exchange contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates adjusted for counterparty credit risk, which is calculated based on credit default swaps of the respective counterparties. Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates adjusted for counterparty credit risk, which is calculated based on credit default swaps of the respective counterparties.\n- -the fair values of financial instruments that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) requires entity specific valuation techniques; and",

Financial instruments (continued)\n\n## Financial risk management objectives (continued)\n\nThe Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements. The ISDA agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This is because the Group does not have any current legally enforceable right to offset recognised amounts, because the right to offset is enforceable only on the occurrence of future events such as a default on the bank loans or other credit events. No collateral is paid or received.\n\n## (vii) Offsetting financial instruments\n\nThe following table sets out the carrying amounts of recognised financial instruments that are subject to the above agreements.\n\nThe table also sets out where the Group has offset bank overdrafts against cash at bank and in hand based on a legal right of offset as set out in the banking agreements.\n\n|                                    | Gross amounts of financial assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet \u20ac'm   | Gross amounts of financial liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet \u20ac'm   | Amounts of financial instruments presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet \u20ac'm   | Related financial  instruments that are not offset \u20ac'm   | Net amount \u20ac'm   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| At 31 December 2021                |                                                                           |                                                                                |                                                                                    |                                                          |                  |\n| Financial assets                   |                                                                           |                                                                                |                                                                                    |                                                          |                  |\n| Cash at bank and in hand           | 1,039.1                                                                   | -

The amount of self-insurance is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure it remains appropriate. The provision for these exposures represents amounts provided based on advice from insurance consultants, industry information, actuarial valuation and historical data in respect of claims that are classified as incurred but not reported and outstanding loss reserves. The methodology of estimating the provision is periodically reviewed to ensure that the assumptions made continue to be appropriate. The utilisation of the provision is dependent on the timing of settlement of the outstanding claims. Historically, the average time for settlement of outstanding claims ranges from 2 to 3 years from claim date.\n\nThe Group operates a level of self-insurance. Under these arrangements, the Group retains certain exposures up to pre-\n\n## Non-trading items\n\nNon-trading items relate to restructuring and acquisition integration provisions incurred in 2021 and 2020; these costs are expected to be paid within 22 months.\n\n## 26. Retirement benefits obligation\n\nThe Group operates post-retirement benefit schemes in a number of its businesses throughout the world. These schemes are structured to accord with local conditions and practices in each country they operate in and can include both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. The assets of the schemes are held, where relevant, in separate trustee administered funds.\n\nDefined benefit post-retirement schemes exist primarily in Ireland and the Netherlands (Eurozone), the UK and the USA (included in Rest of World). These defined benefit schemes comprise final salary pension schemes, career average salary pension schemes and post-retirement medical plans. All material defined benefit pension schemes are closed to future accrual. The post-retirement medical plans operated by the Group relate primarily to a number of USA employees and are closed to new entrants. Defined benefit schemes in Ireland, the UK, and the USA are administered by Boards of Trustees. The Boards of Trustees generally comprise of representatives of the employees, the employer and independent trustees. These Boards are responsible for the management and governance of the schemes including compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.",

        "page_content": "## 26. Retirement benefits obligation (continued)\n\nThe values used in the Group's consolidated financial statements are based on the most recent actuarial valuations and have been updated by the individual schemes' independent and professionally qualified actuaries to incorporate the requirements of IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' in order to assess the liabilities of the various schemes as at 31 December 2021 using the projected unit credit method. All assets in the schemes have been measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. Full actuarial valuations for funding purposes are carried out for the Group's pension schemes in line with local requirements. The actuarial reports are not available for public inspection.\n\nThe Group continues to harmonise, standardise and integrate the benefit offering to employees across the countries in which it operates. As a result, a number of deferred members transferred their past service benefits out of the Irish defined benefit scheme during 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe defined benefit schemes expose the Group to risks such as interest rate risk, investment risk, inflation risk and mortality risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the discount rate which is derived from the interest yield on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date. Market conditions in recent years have resulted in volatility in discount rates which has significantly impacted the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Such changes lead to volatility in the Group's Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Interest rates also impact on the funding requirements for the schemes.\n\n## Investment risk\n\nThe net surplus/(deficit) recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the schemes' assets. When assets generate a rate of return less than the discount rate this results in an increase/(decrease) in the net (deficit)/surplus. The schemes have a diversified portfolio of investments which include equities, bonds and other asset classes. The investment allocation for each scheme is reviewed periodically by the scheme's external investment consultants who advise on the most appropriate asset allocation taking account of asset valuations, funding requirements, liability duration and the achievement of an appropriate return on assets.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nA significant proportion of the defined benefit obligation is linked to inflation, therefore an increase in inflation rates will increase the defined benefit obligation. However, a portion of the schemes' assets are inflation-linked debt securities which mitigates some of the effects of inflation movements.\n\n## Mortality risk\n\nThe present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of schemes' participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the schemes' participants will increase the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## (i) Recognition in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\n\nThe following amounts have been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in relation to defined contribution and defined benefit post-retirement schemes:\n\n|                                                                             | 2021 \u20ac'm   | 2020 \u20ac'm   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Service cost:                                                               |            |            |\n| - Costs relating to defined contribution schemes                            | 64.9       | 63.9       |\n| - Current service cost relating to defined benefit schemes                  | 5.5        | 3.2        |\n| - Past service and settlements                                              | (4.7)      | (12.8)     |\n| Net interest cost                                                           | 0.7        | -          |\n| Recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement                             | 66.4       | 54.3       |\n| Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liability:                       |            |            |\n| - Return on scheme assets (excluding amounts included in net interest cost) | (129.8)    | (95.0)     |\n| - Experience losses/(gains) on schemes' liabilities                         | 24.9       | (5.5)      |\n| - Actuarial losses/(gains) arising from changes in demographic assumptions  | 41.9       | (3.0)      |\n| - Actuarial (gains)/losses arising from changes in financial assumptions    | (47.2)     | 170.5      |\n| Recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income            | (110.2)    | 67.0       |\n| Total                                                                       | (43.8)     | 121.3      |\n\nThe total service cost is included in total staff numbers and costs (note 4) and the net interest cost is included in finance income and costs (note 6).",

The assumptions may differ from the actual data as a result of changes in economic and market conditions as well as the actual experience within each scheme. The present value of post-retirement benefit schemes' liabilities is heavily dependent on the discount rate. As the discount rate is based on a market driven measure, which is the interest yield on high quality corporate bonds at the balance sheet date, the present value of post-retirement benefit schemes' liabilities can fluctuate significantly from valuation to valuation. The expected rate of inflation impacts the schemes' liabilities in that inflation is the basis for the calculation of the assumed future salary and revaluation increases in each scheme where applicable. In relation to demographic assumptions, differing expectations regarding current and future changes in mortality rates can have a significant impact on the schemes' liabilities.\n\nThe table below gives an approximate indication of the impact of a change in the principal financial actuarial assumptions (discount rate, inflation rate and pension increases and salary increases) and the principal demographic actuarial assumption (mortality) on the schemes' liabilities. The present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method. The impact on the defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2021 is calculated on the basis that only one assumption is changed with all other assumptions remaining unchanged. The assessment of the sensitivity analysis below could therefore be limited as a change in one assumption may not occur in isolation as assumptions may be correlated. There have been no changes from the previous year in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis.\n\nImpact on schemes' liabilities of changes in assumptions\n\n|                                       | 2021        | 2021   | 2021              | 2020        | 2020    | 2020               |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|-------------|---------|--------------------|\n| Change in Assumption                  | Eurozone  % | UK  %  | Rest of  World  % | Eurozone  % | UK  %   | Rest of   World  % |\n| Discount rate                         |             |        |                   |             |         |                    |\n| Decrease of 0.50%                     | 10.4%       | 11.0%  | 5.2%              | 10.5%       | 12.8%   | 5.6%               |\n| Increase of 0.50%                     | (9.0%)      | (9.5%) | (4.7%)            | (9.1%)      | (11.0%) | (5.1%)             |\n| Inflation Rate and Pension Increases  |             |        |                   |             |         |                    |\n| Increase of 0.50%                     | 7.9%        | 4.3%   | -                 | 8.2%        | 8.9%    | -                  |\n| Decrease of 0.50%                     | (7.1%)      | (5.2%) | -                 | (7.0%)      | (7.8%)  | -                  |\n| Salary Increase                       |             |        |                   |             |         |                    |\n| Increase of 0.50%                     | -           | -      | 0.2%              | -           | -       | 0.4%               |\n| Decrease of 0.50%                     | -           | -      | (0.2%)            | -           | -       | (0.3%)             |\n| Mortality                             |             |        |                   |             |         |                    |\n| Increase in life expectancy of 1 Year | 3.9%        | 3.0%   | 2.5%              | 3.8%        | 4.0%    | 2.5%               |\n| Decrease in life expectancy of 1 Year | (3.9%)      | (3.0%) | (2.5%)            | (3.8%)      | (4.0%)  | (2.5%)             |",

Retirement benefits obligation (continued)\n\n(iv) Reconciliations for defined benefit schemes (continued)\n\nThe fair values of each of the categories of the pension schemes' assets at 31 December were as follows:\n\n|                                             | 2021 \u20ac'm   | 2020 \u20ac'm   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Liability Driven Investment                 | 537.7      | 355.8      |\n| Other Fixed Income                          | 380.0      | 274.6      |\n| Equities                                    |            |            |\n| - Global Equities                           | 308.4      | 566.5      |\n| - Emerging Market Equities                  | 24.4       | 70.7       |\n| Diversified Growth Funds                    | 185.9      | 164.4      |\n| Cash and other                              | 189.9      | 19.1       |\n| Total fair value of pension schemes' assets | 1,626.3    | 1,451.1    |\n\nThe majority of equity securities and bonds have quoted prices in active markets. The schemes' assets are invested with professional investment managers. Investments in the Group's own financial instruments, if any, are solely at the discretion of the investment managers concerned. The actual amount of the Group's own financial instruments held by the pension schemes during 2021 and 2020 were not material. No property held by the pension schemes was occupied by the Group nor were any other pension schemes' assets used by the Group during 2021 or 2020.\n\nBoth the UK and Irish Schemes have invested in pooled Liability Driven Investment (LDI) strategies. The primary goal of this asset class is to mitigate the impact of interest rate and inflation volatility and enable better matching of investment returns with the cash outflows required to pay benefits. The pooled LDI solutions invest in various levered and unlevered bonds and the value of the LDI assets at 31 December 2021 across the UK and Irish schemes was \u20ac537.7m (2020: \u20ac355.8m) which is based on the latest market bid price for the underlying investments, which are traded daily on liquid markets.\n\n## (v) Funding for defined benefit schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes in a number of countries and each scheme is required to be operated in line with local legislation, conditions, practices and the regulatory framework in place for the specific country. As a result, there are a number of different funding arrangements in place that accord with the specific local legislative, regulatory and actuarial requirements.\n\nFunding for each scheme is carried out by cash contributions from the Group's subsidiaries. These funding arrangements have been advised by the pension schemes' actuaries and agreed between the Group and the relevant Trustees. Actuarial valuations, which are not available for public inspection, are carried out every three years in Ireland and the UK; and every year in the USA. During the financial year ending 31 December 2022, the Group expects to make contributions of approximately \u20ac18.9m to its defined benefit schemes.\n\n## 27.

Share capital (continued)\n\n## Shares issued\n\nDuring 2021 a total of 148,415 (2020: 185,094) A ordinary shares, each with a nominal value of 12.50 cent, were issued at nominal value per share under the Long-Term and Short-Term Incentive Plans.\n\nThe total number of shares in issue at 31 December 2021 was 176,848,451 (2020: 176,700,036).\n\n## Share buy back programme\n\nAt the 2021 Annual General Meeting, shareholders passed a resolution authorising the Company to purchase up to 5% of its own issued share capital. In 2021 and 2020, no shares were purchased under this programme.\n\n## 28. Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates two equity-settled share-based payment plans. The first plan is the Group's Long-Term Incentive Plan and the second is the element of the Group's Short-Term Incentive Plan that is settled in shares/share options after a 2 year deferral period. Details on each of these plans are outlined below.\n\nThe Group recognised an expense of \u20ac17.2m (2020: \u20ac12.5m) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the Consolidated Income Statement during the financial year. The expectation of meeting performance criteria was taken into account when calculating this expense.\n\n## (i) Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nThe Group operates an equity-settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) under which an invitation to participate was made to Executive Directors and senior executives. The proportion of each invitation which vests will depend on the Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) performance, Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Return on Average Capital Employed (ROACE) of the Group during a three year period ('the performance period'). The invitations made in 2019, 2020 and 2021 will potentially vest in 2022, 2023 and 2024 respectively. 50% of the award will be issued at the date of vesting, with 50% being issued after a 2 year deferral period.\n\nFor the 2019 and 2020 awards, up to 50% of the shares/share options subject to an invitation will vest according to the Group's Adjusted EPS growth calculated on a constant currency basis compared with target during the performance period. Up to 30% of the shares/share options subject to an invitation will vest according to the Group's TSR performance during the performance period measured against the TSR performance of a peer group of listed companies. The remaining 20% of the shares/share options will vest according to the Group's ROACE versus predetermined targets. For the 2021 awards, the performance conditions are weighted 40% for Adjusted EPS growth calculated on a constant currency basis, 25% for TSR, 15% for ROACE and the remaining 20% of the shares/share options will vest according to the Group's Sustainability metrics versus predetermined targets. An invitation may lapse if a participant ceases to be employed within the Group before the vesting date.\n\nUnder the LTIP, the Group introduced career shares awards, under which an invitation to participate was made to a limited number of senior executives. The proportion of each invitation which vests will depend on personal objectives during a three year period ('the performance period') and the senior executives remaining within the Group for a four year period ('the retention period'). The invitations made in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 will potentially vest in 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 respectively. An invitation may lapse if a participant ceases to be employed within the Group before the vesting date.",

Share-based payments (continued)\n\n## (i) Long-Term Incentive Plan (continued)\n\nExpected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group's share price over the previous three years. Market based vesting conditions, such as the TSR condition, have been taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted. The TSR performance over the period is measured against the TSR performance of a peer group of listed companies. Non-market based performance conditions, such as the EPS, ROACE and Sustainability conditions, were not taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted, however the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction is adjusted so that the amount recognised is based on the number of equity instruments that eventually vest.\n\n## (ii) Short-Term Incentive Plan\n\nIn 2013 the Group's Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) for Executive Directors was amended to incorporate a share-based payment element with 25% of the total bonus to be settled in shares/share options. The shares/share options awarded as part of this scheme will be issued 2 years after the vesting date once a deferral period has elapsed. There are no further performance conditions relating to the shares/share options during the deferral period.\n\nThere are 4,632 share options (2020: 1,114 share options) outstanding and exercisable in relation to the STIP.\n\nA share-based payment expense is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the scheme to reflect the cash value of the bonus to be paid by way of shares/share options. The issuance of shares/share options under the STIP which related to the 2020 and 2021 financial years will be released from deferral in 2022 and 2023 respectively.",

Given that the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities recently acquired is still in progress, some of the above values are determined provisionally. The valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities will be completed within the measurement period. For the acquisitions completed in 2020, there have been no material revisions of the provisional fair value adjustments since the initial values were established. The Group performs quantitative and qualitative assessments of each acquisition in order to determine whether it is material for the purposes of separate disclosure under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' and as a result separate disclosure was made for the Niacet acquisition.\n\nThe goodwill is attributable to the expected profitability, revenue growth, future market development and assembled workforce of the acquired businesses and the synergies expected to arise within the Group after the acquisition. \u20ac11.7m of goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\n\nTransaction expenses related to these acquisitions of \u20ac11.0m were charged in the Group's Consolidated Income Statement during the financial year. The fair value of the financial assets includes trade and other receivables with a fair value of \u20ac39.6m and a gross contractual value of \u20ac40.4m.",

Dividends totalling \u20ac0.1m (2020: \u20ac0.1m) were also received by key management personnel during the financial year, based on their personal interests in the shares of the company.\n\n## 34. Events after the balance sheet date\n\nSince the financial year end, the Group has:\n\n- -proposed a final dividend of 66.70 cent per A ordinary share (note 10).\n- -entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the shares of Almer Malaysia Sdn Bhd, based in Malaysia and 92% of the shares of c-LEcta GmbH, based in Germany. The Group also expects to complete the previously announced acquisition of 100% of the shares of Natreon, Inc., in Q1 2022. The combined consideration for these acquisitions is expected to be \u20ac244.5m ; and\n\nThere have been no other significant events, outside the ordinary course of business, affecting the Group since 31 December 2021.\n\n## 35. Reserves\n\n## Fair value through other comprehensive income reserve (FVOCI)\n\nThe fair value through other comprehensive income reserve represents the unrealised gains and losses on the financial assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income by the Group.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nCapital redemption reserve represents the nominal cost of the cancelled shares in 2007.\n\n## Other undenominated capital\n\nOther undenominated capital represents the amount transferred to reserves as a result of renominalising the share capital of the Parent Company due to the euro conversion in 2002.\n\n## Share-based payment reserve\n\nThe share-based payment reserve relates to invitations made to employees to participate in the Group's Long-Term Incentive Plan and the element of the Group's Short-Term Incentive Plan that is settled in shares/share options. Further information in relation to this share-based payment is set out in note 28.\n\n## Translation reserve\n\nExchange differences relating to the translation of the balance sheets of the Group's foreign currency operations from their functional currencies to the Group's presentation currency (euro) are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\nThe hedging reserve represents the effective portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments from the application of cash flow hedge accounting for which the underlying hedged transaction is not impacting profit or loss. The cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is reclassified to profit or loss only when the hedged transaction affects the profit or loss.\n\n## Cost of hedging reserve\n\nThe cost of hedging reserve arises from where the Group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps. Such cross currency interest rate swaps have basis risk as there are characteristics in the cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are not present in the hedged item, being currency basis spreads.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nRetained earnings refers to the portion of net income, which is retained by the Group rather than distributed to shareholders as dividends.",

Revenue\n\n## Volume performance\n\nThis represents the sales performance year-on-year, excluding pass-through pricing on raw material costs, currency impacts, acquisitions (net of disposals) and rationalisation volumes.\n\nVolume performance is an important metric as it is seen as the key driver of top-line business improvement. This is used as the key revenue metric, as Kerry operates a pass-through pricing model with its customers to cater for raw material price fluctuations. Pricing therefore impacts like-for-like revenue performance positively or negatively depending on whether raw material prices move up or down. A full reconciliation to reported revenue performance is detailed in the revenue reconciliation below.\n\n## Revenue Reconciliation\n\n| 2021              | Volume   performance   | Price   | Transaction  currency   | Acquisitions/  Disposals   | Translation  currency   | Reported   revenue   performance   |\n|-------------------|------------------------|---------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Taste & Nutrition | 8.3%                   | 1.3%    | -                       | 2.1%                       | (2.7%)                  | 9.0%                               |\n| Consumer Foods    | 6.0%                   | 0.5%    | 0.1%                    | (18.8%)                    | 1.7%                    | (10.5%)                            |\n| Group             | 8.0%                   | 1.2%    | -                       | (1.7%)                     | (1.8%)                  | 5.7%                               |\n| 2020              |                        |         |                         |                            |                         |                                    |\n| Taste & Nutrition | (3.0%)                 | 0.1%    | (0.1%)                  | 1.2%                       | (2.6%)                  | (4.4%)                             |\n| Consumer Foods    | (2.6%)                 | 1.2%    | -                       | -                          | (0.7%)                  | (2.1%)                             |\n| Group             | (2.9%)                 | 0.3%    | (0.1%)                  | 1.0%                       | (2.3%)                  | (4.0%)                             |\n\n## 2.

Adjusted Earnings Per Share and Performance in Adjusted Earnings Per Share on a Constant Currency Basis\n\nThe performance in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis is provided as it is considered more reflective of the Group's underlying trading performance. Adjusted earnings is profit after taxation attributable to owners of the parent before brand related intangible asset amortisation and non-trading items (net of related tax). These items are excluded in order to assist in the understanding of underlying earnings. A full reconciliation of adjusted earnings per share to basic earnings is provided below. Constant currency eliminates the translational effect that arises from changes in foreign currency year-on-year. The performance in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis is calculated by comparing current year adjusted earnings per share to the prior year adjusted earnings per share retranslated at current year average exchange rates.\n\n2021\n\n|                                                                                                | EPS cent   | Growth %   | EPS cent   | Growth  %   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| Basic earnings per share                                                                       | 430.6      | 37.6%      | 313.0      | (2.3%)      |\n| Brand related intangible asset amortisation                                                    | 26.0       | -          | 23.6       | -           |\n| Non-trading items (net of related tax)                                                         | (75.8)     | -          | 8.8        | -           |\n| Adjusted earnings per share                                                                    | 380.8      | 10.2%      | 345.4      | (12.3%)     |\n| Impact of retranslating prior year adjusted earnings per share at  current year average rates* |            | 1.9%       |            | 2.9%        |\n| Growth in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis                             |            | 12.1%      |            | (9.4%)      |\n\n2020",

Free Cash Flow\n\nFree cash flow is trading profit plus depreciation, movement in average working capital, capital expenditure, payment of lease liabilities, pensions costs less pension expense, finance costs paid (net) and income taxes paid.\n\nFree cash flow is seen as an important indicator of the strength and quality of the business and of the availability to the Group of funds for reinvestment or for return to shareholders. Movement in average working capital is used when calculating free cash flow as management believes this provides a more accurate measure of the increase or decrease in working capital needed to support the business over the course of the year rather than at two distinct points in time and more accurately reflects fluctuations caused by seasonality and other timing factors. Average working capital is the sum of each month's working capital over 12 months.
