This situation is partly due to the economic environment, with a very low cost of risk stemming from massive State aid during the crisis. But this situation is above all structural, because with our powerful, diversi/fied and adaptable model our revenues have increased very regularly for the past /five years.\n\nOur universal banking model allows us to provide all our clients with the expertise of an international group with a worldwide presence. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB contributes to this goal by demonstrating once again this year that it is a trusted partner for the Group's clients.\n\nOur Group project is clear and simple and aims to address environmental and societal challenges, as well as the transitions we need to face. This is why we have designed a real program\n\nplan  around  concrete commitments. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was one of the pioneers  in this /field. It was the /first bank to announce a gradual withdrawal from the coal sector, the /first bank to cease financing  non-conventional fossil fuels and is clearly committed to its clients' energy transition.\n\nOur Group project is clear and simple and aims to address environmental and societal challenges, as well as the transitions we need to face. This is why we have designed a real plan-programme around concrete commitments.\n\nOur dynamism and\n\nsolidity are assets to face the uncertainties that lie ahead, characterized by a potential resumption of in/flation due to the liquidity injected by public policies during the crisis. In addition to this in/flationary uncertainty there are questions concerning a possible increase in the cost of risk that could follow the end of State aid.\n\nThe strongest uncertainty however is linked to the situation in Ukraine, and more generally in Europe as a whole. It might have considerable consequences for the security of the continent's energy supply and for the global energy market. Without abandoning our commitment to responsible /finance focused on the indispensable energy transition, it is obvious that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole will adapt to this new context to serve its clients in accordance with the prevailing imperatives.\n\n## PHILIPPE BRASSAC\n\nChairman of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Board of Directors Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Chief Executive Of/ficer\n\nIn 2021, in the context of the continuing health crisis, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB delivered a strong performance. Its Net Income Group Share reached approximately EUR 1.7 billion generated by its global corporate and investment banking and private banking activities. This is the best result since the 2008 /financial crisis.\n\nThe complementary nature of our businesses and locations demonstrated the relevance of our well-balanced model. The collective work of the entire value chain of our Bank, in contact with our clients, supporting the transactions carried out for them, or in the transverse functions, is the strength of our company and allowed us to maintain and even develop our franchises. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB maintains its leading positions, remaining #1 in syndicated loans in France and #3 in EMEA with landmark transactions in every sector.\n\n2022 begins in a particularly dramatic geopolitical environment. Year after year, month after month, we have demonstrated our ability to overcome crises by prioritising the protection of our employees and the high quality service we provide to our clients.\n\nWe will pursue this ambitious dynamic to meet the challenges that lie ahead. First of all the societal challenge: in response to the climate emergency, we will support our clients in their transition,\n\nYear after year, month after month, we have demonstrated our ability to overcome crises by prioritising the protection of our employees and the high quality service we provide to our clients. We will pursue this ambitious dynamic to meet the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nparticularly their energy transition, or help them start this transition if they have not yet prepared. Secondly, given the technological and digital challenges, we will speed up the transformation of our processes, tools and solutions.

        "page_content": "2021 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n## 2/hairspace. 2021 HIGHLIGHTS\n\nThe year 2021 was again largely impacted by the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, which continued to affect almost all of the world's economies (lockdown strategies, slow recovery in hardest-hit sectors such as tourism and aviation, deployment of vaccination campaigns). As a result, the European Central Bank's (ECB) budgetary and monetary support policies continued to shore up economic performances, on the decline until the /first quarter (eurozone GDP down -0.3%), with net asset purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) and Asset Purchase Programme (APP) of \u20ac1,850 billion and \u20ac20 billion respectively, while also maintaining abundant liquidity through re/financing operations (TLTRO III). France and the eurozone in general withstood the constraints caused by the crisis, leading to faster-than-expected economic momentum with growth of +2% and, starting in the third quarter, a recovery in the manufacturing sector and business investment buoyed by strong demand for manufactured goods and the European funds for stimulus measures. At the same time, however, in/flation accelerated and expectations continued to rise as demand made a comeback, driven by the ongoing normalisation of health conditions and the business recovery. By the end of the year, the economy was going full-force: the French GDP registered a growth rate at +7% for the full-year 2021, a 52-year record. And with a rate of 5% year-on-year in December, the expectation of longer-than-anticipated in/flation took root in the region.\n\nThe /financial markets were hurt at the end of the year by a strong wait-and-see attitude among clients, mainly due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, while normalisation was taking hold.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's revenues remained high, up +1% (1) compared to 2020.

The Bank held on to its leading positions by remaining at the /first place of syndication activities in France (2) /uni00A0and third place in the EMEA (3) . With the market still normalising, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB consolidated its leading positions in bond issues, ranking /fifth on the All Bonds in Euro worldwide market (4) , fourth in the Global Green and Sustainability Bonds (5) ranking, and focusing on a speci/fic service for each of its clients in their transition to green and social responsibility.\n\nOnce again this year, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB demonstrated the complementarity of its business lines and the relevance of its business model as a bank serving its clients and the economy as a whole.\n\nAt end-December 2021, the Bank maintained its organic growth and investment strategies. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's cost/income ratio excluding SRF stands at 52.9% (6) , below the MTP target (</uni00A055%). Human and Societal projects are also prioritised for the Group in today's new post-Covid environment, through employee support programmes, continued leadership in green and sustainable /financing, and major societal commitments. For example, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB helped the European Commission launch of the world's largest green bond issue under the NextGenerationEU (NGEU) programme and signed an agreement with Enel S.p.A, the leader in private-sector renewable energy production, to complete the energy transition. The Group is also developing a network of Sustainable Finance coordinators in all its business lines and support functions in order to adapt its organisation to sustainable /finance and the energy transition.",

Investment Banking comprises all 'equity and long-term' /financing activities for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's corporate clients and is structured around three main divisions:\n\n## PRIMARY EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS\n\nThe Primary Equity Capital Markets business line is responsible for the advisory activities related to stocks and securities issuance giving access to share capital.\n\nIn particular, it is in charge of capital increases, secondary offerings as well as convertible bonds, exchangeable bonds and other hybrid products issues for the large and mid-cap primary market .\n\n## 3.3. CROSS-FUNCTIONAL\n\n## Unique coverage: CIB\n\nDrawing on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's client-centric approach, the CIB division provides coverage for all of the bank's clients. At the centre of the bank's organisational structure, the division is responsible for client income and pro/fitability, manages client relations for the entire bank worldwide, promotes all of the bank's business lines, as well as Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's business lines, and manages the bank's overall exposure by client.\n\n## 3.4. WEALTH MANAGEMENT\n\nWealth Management, a business operated under the global brand name Indosuez Wealth Management since January 2016, offers a tailored approach that enables each of its clients to preserve and develop their /financial assets and real assets to meet their needs as closely as possible. With a global vision, its multi-disciplinary teams offer them tailor-made, sustainable solutions, combining excellence, experience and expertise.\n\nSince 2012, Wealth Management has been part of a fully global and cross-business organisation. It not only optimally combines employee expertise, but also leverages all their synergies in order to improve the convenience and experience of an increasingly international client base.\n\n## GLOBAL CORPORATE FINANCE\n\nThe Global Corporate Finance business line encompasses activities dedicated to mergers and acquisitions, from strategy advisory services to transaction execution.\n\nMore speci/fically, it assists clients in their development with advisory mandates for purchases and disposals, opening up capital to new investors and restructuring strategic /financial advisory services and advisory services for privatisations.\n\n## STRUCTURED AND FINANCIAL SOLUTIONS (SFS)\n\nThe Structured and Financial Solutions business line offers Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's large clients tailored solutions with high added value in support of their complex /finance transactions. In particular, it provides alternative /financing solutions to traditional banking operations and capital market solutions .\n\nSFS also realises receivables' /financing, including the CICE tax (competitiveness and employment tax credits) set up by the French government.\n\nWithin this division, a dedicated Sustainability Banking team advises clients on bond issues and responsible /financing. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is a world leader in the green, social & sustainability bond market.\n\nIn addition, in terms of Islamic /financing, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB facilitates access to Shariah-compliant solutions in many segments with a dedicated team in the Gulf.\n\nWith the constant ambition of consolidating the quality of its services and strengthening its ef/ficiency, Indosuez Wealth Management is actively pursuing the digitisation of its offering and processes.\n\nIn response to client expectations, Indosuez Wealth Management is expanding its value proposition in favour of more sustainable development and a more responsible economy in cooperation with other Group entities.\n\nIn France, the partnership between Indosuez Wealth Management France and the Regional Banks (Caisses) is based on complementary approaches and is a clear asset when it comes to meeting the ever-changing expectations of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's high net worth clients.",

OUR CSR STRATEGY: PROGRESSIVE ACTIONS DRIVEN BY EMPLOYEES' INVOLVEMENT\n\nSome of the information not included in this document can be found in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy, which is published on the Bank's website. There you will find details about Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's approach, its financing and investment policies and their implementation, the protection of client interests and respect for ethics in business, its undertakings and actions as a responsible and committed employer, the management of the impacts of the Bank's operations and its policy on charities, sponsorship and supporting university research.\n\nThe following pages focus on the actions taken in 2021.\n\nAlthough the developments below illustrate, for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, the implementation of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group/uni00A0S.A. Vigilance Plan and the group's non-financial performance, this chapter is neither a report on the implementation of the Vigilance Plan, nor a declaration on the non-financial performance, both of which are presented in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 1.1. OUR APPROACH\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB\n\nIn  2019  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  put  together  its  new '2022/uni00A0Ambitions' project with a view to establishing its social utility as an essential component of its activities, business lines and processes. This strategic plan is three-dimensional, comprising a Client Project, a Human Project and a Societal Project.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's strategy fully embraces this approach. The Bank has entered into stringent societal commitments which cover three priority areas: the /fight against climate change, preservation of biodiversity and respect for human rights.\n\nFor several years now, these issues have been tackled by a three part initiative:\n\n- y to reduce its direct environmental footprint;\n- y to measure and reduce environmental and social risks related to its /financing activity (notably based on the Equator Principles, the CSR sector policies, and the introduction of CSR scoring of corporate clients);\n- y to increase the positive impacts of its business through Sustainable Banking.\n\nIn addition to controlling the Bank's direct environmental footprint, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB seeks through this initiative to tackle societal objectives and help its clients overcome their social, environmental and solidarity related challenges.\n\n## Indosuez Wealth Management\n\nSince 2020, Indosuez Wealth Management's CSR approach has been supported by a global business line dedicated to offers and business development. It is structured around its Human Project, its Client Project and its Societal Project.\n\nIt seeks to strengthen Indosuez Wealth Management's usefulness to its clients, and in particular to:\n\n- y increase its presence and impact,\n- y better meet their expectations,\n- y better coordinate the development and distribution of responsible offers in accordance with prevailing laws,\n- y establish a sustainable development culture and dynamic at Indosuez Wealth Management.\n\nTo that end, at each entity, including Azqore, a two-person team consisting of the local CSR manager and a front of/fice employee is responsible for promoting the convictions and societal dynamics of the Group and its geographical regions. Their roles and responsibilities are clearly de/fined; the projects are overseen centrally and are operationally managed by the entities with a view to complying with the strategy implemented.\n\n## 1.2.  GOVERNANCE STRENGTHENED BY EMPLOYEES' INVOLVEMENT\n\n## Governance\n\nSustainable development challenges are taken into account by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in accordance with the general guidelines proposed by the CSR Department of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and validated by the CSR Committee of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. They are the subject of two internal governance documents that de/fine the framework.\n\nThe  Corporate  Social  and  Environmental  Responsibility department, which reports to Risks and Permanent Control, proposes and coordinates Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's sustainable development actions with the bank's business lines and support functions.\n\nAn ad hoc Committee, the Committee for the Assessment of Transactions with an Environmental or Social Risk (CERES), chaired by the head of the Compliance function, acts as a top-",

This Committee issues recommendations prior to the Credit Committee meeting for all transactions whose environmental or social impact it feels needs close monitoring. The CERES Committee validates the ratings of the transactions in accordance with the Equator Principles, issues opinions and recommendations on transactions classi/fied as sensitive in respect of environmental and social aspects, and approves signi/ficant modi/fications to processes, methodologies and governance texts relating to sustainable development.\n\nThe CERES Committee met eight times in 2021 to discuss issues such as the review of transactions signed-off during the year, the approval of ratings according to the Equator Principles, the monitoring of sensitive /files, and the review of sector policies and methodologies linked to environmental and social risks.\n\nIn 2021, the CERES Committee speci/fically reviewed 88 transactions before they were sent to the Credit or Commercial Decision Committee, given their importance and the sensitivity of the potential environmental or social impacts identi/fied. In two cases, its recommendations resulted in not continuing a commercial opportunity and in thirty-one cases imposing speci/fic conditions for the management of environmental and social risks.\n\n## Employees at the heart of the implementation\n\nThe model developed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is based on the daily involvement of all employees as agents of sustainable development in their work, in order to assess and manage direct or indirect environmental risks.\n\ntransactions from an environmental or social point of view to the CERES Committee.\n\nThe gradual incorporation of sustainable development priorities into our operations (widening the scope of application of the Equator Principles, sector wide CSR policies, scoring of corporate clients, etc.) and the central role entrusted to employees in the strategy, has led the Bank to step up training for employees to raise their awareness of CSR matters. The action plan aimed at reinforcing the CSR culture, implemented in 2017, continues to be deployed with an objective to incorporate the CSR aspects into operations. The health situation meant that most of the awareness-raising and training actions continued to be carried out by videoconference.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\nThe search for better integration with business activity/uni00A0\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Executive Committee has entrusted the head of the Sustainable Banking division with the task of proposing a new structure for developing synergies between all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's departments in order to continue improving the assistance given to our clients in meeting their environmental and social challenges./uni00A0 This review, which includes the creation of a Climate & Sustainable Strategy team, is expected to conclude in the /first half of 2022.\n\nClient managers and senior bankers are responsible for analysing environmental and social challenges related to their client portfolio. If necessary, they call on the Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Department, and submit the most complex\n\n## 1.3.  AN APPROACH FOCUSING ON ONGOING PROGRESS AND LISTENING TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS\n\n## The FReD approach\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and CA Indosuez Wealth Management are fully involved in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's FReD progress driven approach. The process, intending to strengthen CSR within the Group, has, since 2020, been focused on Medium-Term Plan CSR objectives, and consists of 6/uni00A0action plans focused on three key areas involving clients (Fides), employees (Respect) and the environment (Demeter). Speci/fic and measurable objectives are de/fined for each plan. The desire to link FReD actions more closely with strategic challenges leads to the selection of longer-term plans. Since this review, the average annual growth target has been 1.3 on a progress scale comprising 4 levels.\n\nIn 2021, the average level of progress recorded by the 6 action plans of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was 1.5.\n\nIn 2021, the average level of progress recorded by the action plans of the Indosuez Wealth Management Group was 1.17.\n\n## Relationships with stakeholders\n\nFor Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, listening to its stakeholders is the way forward. It held several meetings with NGOs in 2021. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB plays an active role in sharing best practices with its peers and has been a member of the Mainstreaming Climate Action within Financial Institutions initiative for several years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "PROMOTING AN ETHICAL CULTURE\n\n## 2. PROMOTING AN ETHICAL CULTURE\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group has adopted the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's approach to positioning ethics as one of its priorities. It promotes Group initiatives which aim to exceed regulatory standards and establish an ethical culture.\n\n## 2.1. DEVELOPING AN ETHICAL DIMENSION IN BUSINESS\n\nThe mission of the Compliance function is to contribute to the respect of activities and operations of the Bank as well as its staff with laws and regulations in force, internal and external rules, and the professional and ethical standards in banking and /finance applicable to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's activities.\n\n## The code of conduct\n\nIn 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB reviewed its Code of Conduct to take into account and implement all the themes of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group Ethics Charter. This Code of Conduct consists of a common foundation of 7 principles intended to align behaviours with the Bank's values and thus guide employees on a daily basis. Its purpose is to:\n\n- y assert our principles and ethical values;\n- y engage with our clients and Group partners.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez circulated its Code of Conduct - which translates the commitments of the global Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Ethics Charter into practical action - to its Wealth Management entities. This Code of Conduct, available on the new intranet site as well as on the websites of each entity, is both a tool and a guide. It is the foundation of ethical and professional conduct that re/flects the Group's values and the guidelines on behaviour to be adopted with all our clients and all stakeholders: employees, suppliers, service providers...\n\n## Training of directors and company administrators\n\nIn accordance with the guidelines of the European Banking Authority and the provisions of the French Monetary and Financial Code, Compliance of/ficers train members of the Board of Directors on current regulatory issues.\n\nMembers of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Board of Directors are thus trained in compliance issues on a yearly basis. In 2021, Board members were given training on recent regulatory changes, particularly on the extraterritorial effect of US laws, and on security-based swap dealer regulations and conduct risk. At the same time, a number of compliance courses are made available to them so that they can have access to concise information on compliance issues. And newly appointed administrators meet with the Head of Compliance at the beginning of their role.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez Wealth Management Group has also rolled out the system proposed by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. The members of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez, as well as the administrators in the entities, receive an annual update on all regulatory developments required for fully understanding compliance issues.\n\n## Deploying a responsible compliance policy\n\n## FIGHTING AGAINST CORRUPTION\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group claims and applies, at the highest level, a zero-tolerance policy for any unethical behaviour in general, and any risk of corruption in particular. This policy illustrates the group's long-standing commitment to business ethics, a key element of its corporate social responsibility policy. It integrates well with the compliance and /financial security programmes of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, aiming to ensure transparency and loyalty to clients, suppliers and all types of counterparties with relationships with the Bank, to contribute to the integrity of /financial markets and to combat money laundering, fraud and corruption.\n\nThe group's commitment to /fighting corruption is re/flected in the BS 10500 certi/fication obtained in 2016, and subsequently the award to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group in 2017, renewed in 2019 of the ISO 37001 international standard for its anticorruption set-up. The latter recognises its determination and the quality of its corruption prevention programme. It proves that corruption risks have been correctly identi/fied and analysed and that the programme has been designed to limit these various risks, applying the best international practices. This certi/fication covers all the business lines and support functions of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of increased legal obligations for /fighting corruption, in 2018 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB implemented 'Measures aimed at preventing and detecting corrupt practice', as referred to in article 17 of the so-called Sapin 2 law of 9 December 2016 on transparency, /fighting corruption and the modernisation of the economy. Existing systems for /fighting corruption have been strengthened by the implementation of the recommendations of the French Anti-Corruption Agency (AFA).\n\nThe Group has implemented speci/fic governance to develop the behaviours to be adopted in order to avoid any lapses in probity. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB wrote and circulated an anti-corruption Code of Conduct which was accompanied by an e-learning training programme for all employees and in-person training for people in positions which could be exposed to corruption risks. Employees in roles that are the most exposed to the risk of corruption at the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez Wealth Management Group also followed a dedicated e-learning training course.\n\n.",

        "page_content": "PROMOTING AN ETHICAL CULTURE\n\n## PREVENTING FRAUD\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB continues to strengthen its systems for preventing internal and external fraud, in the context of increased frequency and growing complexity of fraud.\n\nCorrespondents of the /fight against fraud within business lines and support functions are regularly trained to increase their awareness with regard to elements of risk. Warning and vigilance messages are sent to all employees, particularly via the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Intranet site. Targeted prevention actions are undertaken to advise and support employees in their choices and to help them to reconcile issues relating to ethics, professional behaviour, objectives and obligations. These actions enable a culture of probity to permeate all levels of the company; the controls and procedures associated with any lapses provide an appropriate management of any behaviours which may harm, directly or indirectly, clients, the Bank and its employees.\n\n## FIGHTING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM\n\nThe Compliance Division of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group is responsible for the implementation by the Group as a whole of a /financial security set-up, consisting of a set of measures aimed at /fighting money laundering and the /financing of terrorism, as well as ensuring compliance with international sanctions.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group has taken into account the requirements of the transposition into French law of the /fifth European Directive 2018/843, approved by the European Parliament on 30 May 2018, on preventing the use of the /financial system for money laundering and the /financing of terrorism. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB devised a vigilance system and aligned it to the speci/fic nature of its clientele, its business and its network outside France. Therefore, when entering into any relationship, the required client due diligencies are a /first /filter to prevent money laundering and the /financing of terrorism. This preventative measure relies on knowledge of the client and of the ultimate bene/ficial owners, completed by research through specialised databases. It also takes into account the purpose and intended nature of the business transaction. During the business relationship, there is an appropriate vigilance proportionate to the identi/fied level of risks. For that purpose, the Group's employees may use computer tools to analyse clients' risk levels and to detect unusual transactions.\n\nThe /fight against the /financing of terrorism and the set-up for ensuring compliance with international sanctions implies, in particular, a constant screening of client and supplier /files, both when entering into the relationship and during the relationship, with a list of sanctions as well as the real-time monitoring of international transactions.\n\nDespite the performance of the computer tools available, human vigilance remains essential so all employees exposed to these risks are periodically trained in the /fight against money laundering and the /financing of terrorism, and compliance with international sanctions.\n\nLastly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB has put in place a dedicated governance system and tools allowing to follow at the highest level and monitor risks of money laundering, terrorist /financing, as well as the respect of international sanctions.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez has also rolled out the AML-CFT and international sanctions system introduced by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and certi/fies annually to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB that all the Corpus's AML-CFT ratings have been implemented within CAI as well as in the entities within its consolidated supervision scope.\n\n## PRESERVING THE INTEGRITY OF THE MARKETS/uni00A0AND ANTICIPATING MARKET ABUSE\n\nThe Bank continuously ensures that the rules on the integrity of the /financial markets and those relating to market abuse are respected by all Group employees. Thus, strict ethical standards, procedures and rules have therefore been put in place to prevent:\n\n- y market manipulation and attempted market manipulation (such as /fixing the price of a /financial instrument at an abnormal level or disseminating and transmitting false or misleading information);\n- y any insider dealing;\n- y any unlawful disclosure of privileged information.\n\nThese obligations are reiterated on an ongoing basis by the various Compliance teams across all of the Bank's activities as well as through its training programme covering the various compliance topics.\n\nIn addition, controls have also been put in place and daily monitoring is carried out by Compliance in order to detect potential market abuse and to be able to inform senior management and report this to our regulators.\n\nFinally, any suspicion or detection of market abuse must be escalated to Compliance, which will then be responsible, if necessary, for informing the senior management of the Bank and our regulators.\n\n## SIGNALLING BEHAVIOURS AND PRACTICES THAT GENERATE A RISK OF NON-COMPLIANCE\n\nThe entire compliance set-up (organisation, procedures, training programmes) creates an environment contributing to the strengthening of ex ante control. Nonetheless, when preventive measures failed and an incident occurs, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has speci/fic procedures in place to ensure that these incidents are:\n\n- y detected and then analysed as quickly as possible;\n- y brought to the attention of managers and compliance functions at the most appropriate level within each business line;\n- y monitored and solved, by establishing an action plan to resolve the issues.\n\nThe centralisation of incidents through the reporting process, described in a speci/fic governance text, makes it possible to measure, at the highest level of the company, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB Group's exposure to the non-compliance risk. Therefore, when an employee reasonably establishes the existence of an incident related to compliance concerns, he must tell his supervisor who informs the operational heads and the Compliance, Permanent Control and Legal functions, depending on the subject. The system is completed by a whistleblowing mechanism allowing any employee, if they /find an abnormality in the treatment of a malfunction which they consider is due to a de/ficiency of, or pressure exercised by, their manager, or if they think they are being submitted to pressure, active or passive, that may lead them to cause a dysfunction or to conceal it, to inform their compliance manager and/or, if they so wish, their manager's direct superior of the situation. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group has deployed a secure reporting tool across all its entities, selected by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. for the entire Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, accessible to employees and any external third parties via the Internet. This tool enables the con/fidentiality of the facts reported, any people involved and conversations which may occur between the whistleblower and the of/ficer responsible for processing the alert.",

Compliance Division has developed a training programme covering Compliance issues. This programme has been replicated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Compliance and Human Resources Divisions and supplemented with training courses speci/fic to its business activities.\n\nAt the same time, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Compliance pole of expertise provide both e-learning and classroom/remote training in their area of expertise to targeted groups.\n\nA continuous training action plan improves employee awareness of all Compliance and Financial Security issues, which are constantly evolving. Training on general subjects is usually provided in the form of e-learning, while training targeting at-risk populations is preferred for face-to-face/remote training.\n\nThe Compliance Culture is also consolidated through dedicated campaigns such as the Compliance Awards which are given to the best initiative or the best project incorporating the principles of compliance and ethics. Finally, the compliance criteria, which are regularly updated and expanded, form part of each employee's annual appraisal.\n\nIn order to reinforce non-compliance risk management within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez Wealth Management Group, a number of initiatives are being carried out in terms of training. More speci/fically, an action entitled 'Supporting Relationship\n\nManagers on compliance values' is underway. This initiative involves compliance training for Relationship Managers as soon as they are hired.\n\n## MANAGING ACTIVITIES AND DISTRIBUTED PRODUCTS\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group designs and distributes new products, activities and services for its clients in a secure manner thanks to the implementation of a management system for this process called 'NAP Committee' (New Activities/New Products). Any new product, activity or service must go through the NAP process so that all support functions can analyse them. In this way, any product, activity or service envisaged is approved by a NAP Committee whose decision is based on an analysis of all risks and a con/firmation of its compliance with regulations as well as the group's strategy.\n\nThe NAP Committee process also involves a CSR analysis and the systematic provision of a legal and compliance opinion.\n\n## Implementing a transparent lobbying policy\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB acts within the framework of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group policy.\n\nAs a result of the entry into force of the Sapin II Law, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group introduced a new system in 2017 to bring its Directors and interest representatives in line with the reporting obligations.\n\n## 2.2. SUPPORTING OUR CLIENTS OVER THE LONG TERM\n\nProtecting clients and their interests is central to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's concerns.\n\nIn terms of protecting the interests of clients, the Bank has a Con/flict of Interest Management Policy and detailed, annually updated procedures, as well as strict rules to identify, prevent and manage all con/flicts of interest that may arise. Actions to increase the awareness of the First Line of Defense were again carried out in 2021 and will continue in 2022.\n\nMoreover, the Group also implements all measures to protect its clients' data and takes client opinions into account.\n\n## Protecting data\n\nProtecting data and using it in the appropriate manner, in the interests of clients, the Bank, its employees and partners have always been at the core of the group's preoccupations.\n\nThus, in 2017 the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group adopted the Charter on the 'Use of Personal Data', which has been endowed by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. The following year it adapted its system in France and abroad in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulations which came into force in May 2018.\n\nAnother strong signal of this commitment is Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's deployment, in France and its main entities abroad, of its NSU (New Solutions and Uses) set-up. This system enables to proactively manage the regulatory, legal, operational and IT security risks associated with the implementation of new solutions or new uses concerning data, in an ethical approach focused on\n\nthe interests of third parties or persons concerned. It offers to all of the Bank's Business Lines and Support Functions a secure framework for the digital transformation (Cloud computing, New ways of working,...), innovation and the use of new technologies (Arti/ficial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, Blockchain,...).\n\n## Ensuring quality relationships\n\nOne of the principles of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group is to develop long-term relationships with its clients based on trust and transparency.\n\nIn this regard, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has implemented a secure process for initiating these relationships and managing the sale of market-based products. The protection of clients is based on a comprehensive client classi/fication system which not only involves applying the MiFID rules applicable in the European Economic Area, but also worldwide after an internal process called 'Internal suitability rating'. This set-up forms part of the sales process, in particular so that the /financial instruments offered to clients are in line with their risk awareness.\n\nFurthermore, Compliance pays particular attention to commercial margins on market-based products and the documentation intended for client information, while continuing to /file and retain the underlying data appropriately.\n\nThe Bank relies on its NAP process to ensure its new products/ new activities are in line with the client pro/file.

TAX POLICY\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group monitors the commitments made by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group in the area of prevention of the risk of tax fraud by its clients, prospects or suppliers, since tax practices represent an important element of corporate social responsibility.\n\nIn this regard, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non the one hand, ensures compliance with all countries' /fiscal regulations (FATCA, AEOI, etc.);\n\non the other hand, provides no help or encouragement to clients, prospects and suppliers with infringing tax laws and regulations, nor does it facilitate or support transactions where tax ef/ficiency is based on the non-disclosure of facts to the tax authorities.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the OECD standard on the automatic exchange of information as part of tackling tax evasion, adopted by around one hundred States and transposed by the European Union, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group identi/fies the holders of accounts who are resident for tax purposes in countries with which an exchange agreement has been concluded and sends information about those clients to their local tax authorities, which forwards them to the tax authorities of the relevant States of residence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn line with its global strategy, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez Wealth Management Group has a basic rule of only working with clients who meet their tax obligations.

This period may be extended to thirty-/five days in exceptional situations (for reasons outside the control of the payment service provider).\n\n## Being responsible along the entire chain\n\nA governance document, updated in 2019, describes the procurement function's general operating principles at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group, within the framework of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's Procurement Business Line. These rules apply to all purchases made by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB units. This document emphasises the need to include, to the extent possible, a company from the disability friendly sector in the list of subcontractors and suppliers. The MUST RSE (MUST CSR) programme applied to purchases made by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has made it possible to manage legal, /financial and reputational risks by applying best practices in order to forge balanced relationships with suppliers. A number of achievements have been made as a result of this programme, namely:\n\n- y adding a clause to our contracts which provides for the referral to a mediator from the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, in the event of disagreements relating to the execution of a contract between a supplier and the internal decision-maker, should both parties fail to /find a solution internally. The option of using a Group mediator is to prevent the disagreement escalating into a dispute or court action;\n- y adding a sustainable development appendix to our contracts to reiterate the Group's commitments in this area and the expectations that we have of our suppliers;\n- y obtaining from third-party service providers CSR ratings on our suppliers and prospects during consultations or calls for tender.\n\nIn addition, the centralisation of receipt and processing of supplier invoices in an electronic work/flow brought improvements in our suppliers' invoice payment chain and faster invoice processing times.\n\nAll the buyers have had training on the issue of human rights in the value chain.\n\nThe Indosuez Wealth Management group is continuing its policy launched in 2016 consisting of a 'Responsible Purchasing' governance and policy which is clear, homogeneous and in line with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group S.A. strategy.\n\nThe responsible purchasing policy's de/fining issues and priorities include  Human  Rights,  Industrial  Relations  and  Working Conditions, the Environment, Fair Business Practices, Diversity and Communities and Local Development.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At COP26, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB once again strengthened its commitment to climate change and to supporting its clients in the energy transition and their decarbonisation strategies. As the /first milestones in its strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has committed to reducing its exposure to oil extraction by 20% between 2020 and 2025 and increasing its exposure to carbon-free energy (production and storage) by 60% over the same period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\nStrengthening our sector policies and supporting our  clients  in  their  energy  transition  and  their decarbonisation strategy\n\nAt COP 26, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB strengthened its sector policies in hydrocarbons by committing, alongside /five other French banks, from January 2022, to no longer /financing projects directly linked to shale oil, shale gas and oil sands, and companies whose exploration and production of such energies account for more than 30% of their business activities.

        "page_content": "INCORPORATING THE CHALLENGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n## 3.2. MANAGING OUR CLIMATE RISKS\n\nFor a number of years, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has undertaken work designed to better understand and manage climate risks:\n\n- y by evaluating the carbon footprint caused by its /financing and investment portfolio and de/fining the sector wide policies for sectors which account for a large proportion of this footprint (over 80% of this footprint on a cumulative basis);\n- y by seeking to identify the materiality of the climate risks and by gradually introducing additional analyses for clients appearing to present the highest risk.\n\nThis approach was strengthened in 2021 by de/fining action plans with a view to meeting the European Central Bank's expectations.\n\n## Measuring and mapping climate challenges\n\nSince 2011, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has used a procedure to calculate greenhouse gas emissions said to be /financed by a /financial institution. The procedure was developed at its request by the Chair in Quantitative Finance and Sustainable Development at Paris Dauphine University and \u00c9cole Polytechnique. This innovative methodology, originally known as P9XCA but renamed SAFE (Single Accounting of Financed Emissions), has, since 2014, been recommended for corporate and investment banks in the /financial sector guide to 'Conducting a greenhouse gas emissions audit' published by the Agency for Environment and Energy Management, the Observatory on Corporate Social Responsibility and the Bilan Carbone Association.\n\nIt enables Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB to calculate, without multiple counting, the order of magnitude of the emissions /financed and map them according to sector and geographical location. Greenhouse gas emissions are allocated to economic players according to their capacity (and their economic interest) to reduce them according to an allocation described 'by issue' as opposed to the usual allocation 'by scope' (see sectoral guide). This methodology gives us a sectoral and geographical mapping of the carbon issue which has guided the choice of sectors of the bank for the development of sectoral CSR policies and has been used in methodologies for calculations linked to the transition climate risks presented below. Certain methodological adjustments were made in 2018 in parallel with the revision of emission factors.\n\nFurthermore, mapping of the challenges linked to physical climate risk is under way, combining sector based and geographical vulnerability indices.\n\n## Scenario and materiality of climate risks\n\nIn line with the recommendations of the Task force on Climate related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), sensitivity to climate risks was assessed in 2017 within the framework of various scenarios.\n\nThe four scenarios tested in 2017 stand out due to the scope of the mitigation measures and the gradual nature of their implementation. These scenarios identify three timescales: short term (before 2020); medium term (from 2020 to 2030) and long term (after 2030). They are outlined brie/fly below.\n\nEach scenario led to a climate trajectory and to a carbon price level in line with the scope of the mitigation measures. Research has therefore been carried out into the potential impact on the pro/fitability of companies which are the CIB clients both as regards the physical climate risk and the transitional climate risk.\n\nRegarding the physical risk, the average potential impact on the added value of companies has been considered to directly re/flect the impact of global warming on world GNP as generally estimated (without taking into account, at this stage, the different impacts according to sector and country).\n\nFor the transitional risk, the potential vulnerability of companies was assessed using the emissions allocated to the economic players in the sectors and countries de/fined in P9XCA (in the by challenge version) and correlated with their added value. Valued at the carbon price selected for each scenario, these emissions make it possible to provide an initial economic assessment of the carbon challenge for each macro sector and country. Based on several studies concluding that a controlled energy transition would not damage growth (see below), it was considered that the carbon challenge would impact companies differently depending on their ability to anticipate and therefore the rate of progress to implement measures to adapt to this risk.\n\nThese calculations are by necessity approximate but provide insight into the orders of magnitude and make it possible to compare the potential impacts on sectors and countries depending on the scenarios and time-scales used. The calculations show the transitional climate risk in the 'sudden progress' scenario as the main medium-term risk, while underlining the strong increase in the physical climate risk over time, notably in the scenario involving no new mitigation measures.\n\nThey also provide an initial macroeconomic insight into climate risks by highlighting the main risk areas (sectors and countries) according to the various scenarios and time-scales. For the medium-term transitional risk, identi/fied as the main potential risk, a complementary microeconomic approach has been developed which seeks to differentiate it at individual counterparty level.\n\n## Transition risk index\n\nFor /financial players, the transitional climate risk arises mainly from the uncertain return from their clients' investments and changes in the /financial models which result from the changes in the economic environment brought about by initiatives against global warming (introduction of a carbon price, regulatory changes).\n\nAn OECD study published in May 2017, 'Investing in Climate, Investing in Growth', concluded that a controlled energy transition is favourable to the economic growth of the G20 countries, backing up the conclusions of a study by the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) in 2016,'An electricity mix from 100% renewable sources? Technical summary and macroeconomic evaluation summary' for France. It would seem, therefore, that the impact of the energy transition will not necessarily be negative for economic players. Rather, it will be important to be able to identify the winners and the losers in this major change.\n\nThe potential impact of the energy transition on the /financial performance of a company would therefore seem to depend on both the potential sensitivity of the company to the transition (due to its business sector and geographical location) and its ability to manage the transition (level of anticipation and strategy).\n\nThe economic player's potential sensitivity to the transition challenge depends on how much pressure it is under. This, in turn, depends on the extent to which it operates independently of the measures it puts in place. It is a measure of the extent of the potential positive or negative impact of the energy transition for the economic player, which can be described as a combination\n\n<!-- image -->",

It seems to us that this level of 'maturity' should be assessed relative to the business sector, across all geographical locations.\n\nA medium-term transition risk index has therefore been calculated since 2017 for the Bank's corporate client groups using a combination of three factors:\n\n- y the extent to which the issues will impact /financing in the sector, as calculated by the P9XCA methodology adopting an issue-based approach;\n- y the importance the country places on reducing greenhouse gas emissions such as the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC);\n- y the maturity of the client when faced with climate challenges and its ability to adapt, as evaluated by a non /financial agency or estimated on the geographic average.\n\nFor each client group, the transition risk index is calculated by adding together these three factors. The index is positive when the counterparty demonstrates above average preparedness and is negative if it does not. The more the client stands out from its peers, the more the sector is considered to be at stake, and the more the country has committed to a rapid energy transition, the higher the absolute value of the index.\n\nThus, a player in the Energy or Transport sectors in a country committed to signi/ficantly lowering emissions will have more to gain or lose than a player in a sector which is less affected in a country with lower greenhouse gas reduction demands. The extent to which this actor is affected will depend on its ability to adapt its strategy and economic model to the new situation.\n\n## Reducing climate risks\n\nThe CSR sector policies are the /first line tool for managing environmental and social risks, particularly the transitional climate risk. These policies cover the macrosectors of energy and transport, which account for over 80% of the carbon footprint caused by our /financing. In particular, the policies on fossil fuels do not usually include transactions relating to activities which seem the least compatible with the developments expected in light of the energy transition and thus potentially the most risky as regards the transitional climate risk.\n\nThe transitional risk index completes this approach by making it possible to identify clients for which additional analyses seem necessary in view of their exposure to the transition risk and management of this risk. This approach applies to all sectors and all countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\nDefinition of an action plan reflecting changes in risks\n\nIn 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB evaluated its system for assessing and managing environmental and climate risks in light of the recommendations published by the European Central Bank in November 2020. This analysis highlighted areas for improvement and resulted in the de/finition of an action plan.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has adopted a pragmatic approach involving making adjustments to its actions based on the intensity of environmental risks projected over the time horizon of the activities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB that generate these risks. In particular, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has selected pilot sectors and regions for which the metrics previously developed (see below) have been deployed at the portfolio level at meetings of the Strategy and Portfolio Committee.\n\n## 3.3.  PROMOTING CLIMATE SMART OBJECTIVES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB actively contributes to meeting this objective:\n\n- y by developing its /financing of climate-friendly projects and green bond projects, with a view to doubling the size of its Green Bonds portfolio between 2019 and 2022;\n- y and to seek relevant partnerships.\n\n## Project finance\n\nFinancing renewable energies is an integral part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's strategy, who is one of the /first providers in /financing those projects. The Bank /first entered this sector in 1997 by /financing the /first wind farms, and in 2008 it /financed a solar energy project in Spain. The project funding business line has /financed in total more than 46.800/uni00A0MW of installed wind farm capacity and over 18.600/uni00A0MW of installed solar panel capacity.\n\n## Green Bonds, Green Loans, SustainabilityLinked Bonds, Sustainability-Linked Loans\n\nGreen Bonds have been instrumental in steering the bonds markets towards climate change /financing and helped to create a link between the market products and the infrastructures required for the energy transition. Investors are given precise information on the projects /financed by these bonds and their social impacts and environmental bene/fits. A growing number of investor clients value this information and the additional commitment by issuers.\n\nGreen Loans have developed along the same principles of transparency and the link between the /financial income//financial products and the assets required for the energy transition.\n\nSustainability-Linked Bonds and Sustainability-Linked Loans are /financial products whose cost is indexed against the issuer's environmental performance. In 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also consolidated its presence in other /financial products such as green securitisations and sustainable derivatives.",

        "page_content": "INCORPORATING THE CHALLENGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nCommitted to the development of climate /finance since 2010, with its own dedicated Sustainable Banking team, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has con/firmed its leading position as arranger on the Green Bonds, Social Bonds and Sustainability Bonds market worldwide and helps its clients structure ambitious and innovative environmental transactions.\n\nIn 2021 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was involved in the following transactions:\n\n- y The European Commission's Green Bond NextGenerationEU: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB acted as co-lead manager of this /first historic bond issue. This is the world's largest green bond issue, which supports the European Union's determination to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 (\u20ac12 billion, 15-year maturity).\n- y Fleury Michon's sustainable securitisation programme: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole supported Fleury Michon in setting up its securitisation programme, the /financing cost of which is indexed to its non-/financial performance (with indicators on workplace safety, the energy transition and health/nutrition). As a result of this transaction, it became the /first agri-food company in Europe to make the /financing margin of a securitisation agreement conditional on the achievement of multi-year CSR targets.\n- y The sustainability-linked derivative transaction for CEMEX: in parallel with the arrangement of a $3.35 billion sustainability-linked loan, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB participated in a euro cross-currency swap for CEMEX, using the same indicators and objectives set out in the sustainability-linked framework that were used for the bond issue (including, a net reduction in CO 2 emissions, use of green energy to produce cement). This swap is one of the leading sustainability-linked swaps in Latin America.\n- y Ford's inaugural sustainability-linked loan: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB structured the ESG aspects of the transaction (reduction of CO 2 emissions in production and emitted by the type of vehicles built), use of electricity from eligible production and supported Ford in this transaction, which is the /first of its kind for a US car manufacturer. This transaction makes Ford one of the largest sustainability-linked loan borrowers on the market ($15.5 billion in total on loans with maturity of between three and /five years).\n\n2021 also saw major regulatory changes, notably with the publication of the /first EU Taxonomy delegated acts as part of the European Commission's Action Plan for Sustainable Finance aimed at supporting the growth of responsible /financing, including the Green Bonds market. The head of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Sustainable Banking team was actively involved in the preparatory work of the Technical Expert Group (TEG) on Taxonomy. Moreover, the European Commission has published the EU Green Bond Standards usability guide, and the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) on sustainability/uni2010related disclosures in the /financial services sector has entered into force.\n\nFinally, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB remains committed to governance of the Green Bond, Social Bond and Sustainability Bond markets. The Bank is a founding member of the Green Bond Principles and an active member of the Executive Committee of this /financial market initiative. The Bank is also behind the Social Bond Principles, the governance of which has been incorporated into that of the Green Bond Principles.\n\n## Liquidity green supporting factor\n\nTo support its business lines in this area, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB enables climate change projects to bene/fit from more favourable internal costs for accessing funds. This makes it possible to offer\n\nattractive conditions to investors, thus increasing the amount of responsible /finance. This favourable internal cost of liquidity, previously offered only on medium- and long-term /financings, is now also applied to short-term loans.\n\nSuccessfully applied for many years within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, it has now been extended to other Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities.\n\n## Indosuez Wealth Management\n\nAfter the launch in November 2019 of the Indosuez Objectif Terre international equity fund (classi/fied as an Article 9 fund under  the  SFDR  regulation),  which  offers  investments  in securities of companies involved in tackling global warming and protecting natural resources, Indosuez Wealth Management is continuing to roll out its responsible offering across all asset classes. ESG criteria are now integrated into its various support models (Advisory/Discretionary Management), its processes for developing and selecting /financial products (direct securities, investment funds, structured products, private equity), as well as its credit approval policy.\n\nAs such, Indosuez Wealth Management now offers its clients and wealthy clients of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Banks management guidance on environmental and societal issues.\n\nIndosuez's range of structured products has also been expanded with a number of green products mainly issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and a green Structured Product mandate. For example, CFM Indosuez Wealth Management, in collaboration with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, launched an innovative solidarity-based /finance offering, CFM Indosuez Oc\u00e9ano, acclaimed by 81 clients and that includes a \u20ac171,000 donation to the Oceanographic Institute of Monaco, a key player in the protection of the oceans and a partner of the bank.\n\nFinally, ESG criteria are incorporated into the selection of Private Equity fund managers and are now used in the management processes.\n\nSince the end of 2021, the periodic portfolio statements sent to clients have been supplemented by ESG ratings produced by Amundi for all directly-held equities and bonds in its investment universe.\n\nIt should be noted that, at the 2021 WealthBrie/fing Asia Greater China Awards, Indosuez Wealth Management was named best bank for its ESG offering and best bank for sustainable and responsible investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\n## The Transition Score\n\nThe work on creating a climate transition score for clients resulted in a second version with sector-speci/fic adaptations for counterparties monitored by major providers of non-/financial data.\n\nThe Transition Score, which is a tool that promotes dialogue based on objective quantitative data, has been designed to help to support our clients in their decarbonisation trajectory.\n\n<!-- image -->",

IMPROVING OUR CLIMATE PERFORMANCE\n\nSince 2011, in addition to the standard greenhouse gas (GHG) calculations shown in the 'Limiting our direct environmental footprint' section, an estimation of the Bank's /financing and investment carbon footprint is now in place, using the P9XCA methodology.\n\nThis calculation showed an indirect carbon footprint about one thousand times higher than the total operating emissions estimated for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, re/flecting the carbon intensity of activities /financed and corresponding to the Bank's active role in the /financing of the world economy.\n\nThe order of magnitude, on the basis of the amounts outstanding at 31 December 2021, was 60 to 65 Mt equivalent of CO 2 , i.e. a carbon intensity of less than 250 t of CO 2 per million euros of /financing, less than in 2020.\n\nThe CSR sector policies and the transition risk index help both reduce the climate risks of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (see above) and improve climate related results. The transition risk index makes it possible to develop a generalised consideration of this matter across all sectors and countries.

REPORTING ON OUR CLIMATE ACTION\n\nFinancial institutions, particularly in the private sector, face a major dilemma regarding the disclosure of their actions. On the one hand, they are bound by a duty of con/fidentiality towards their clients. On the other hand, public interest groups continue to demand greater transparency and comparability. Other major hindrances to accurate reporting of actions performed are the large numbers of clients and transactions, the low relevance of international economic classi/fications to climate issues and the wide range of bank loans.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is nevertheless making major efforts in terms of transparency by publishing its environmental and social evaluation and exclusion criteria in its sector wide CSR policies and presenting its climate risk assessment approach and tools. In a spirit of Corporate Social Responsibility, this transparent approach meets the recommendations of TCFD and the requirements of Article 173 of the law on energy transition for green growth.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB encourages its clients to also engage in this transparency approach. This is embodied in the Equator Principles, which contain an obligation for clients to publish certain information. This is also true of the Green Bond Principles and Social Bond Principles, which aim to increase transparency on these market by encouraging issuers to regularly publish their reporting on fund allocation and on environmental and social impact measures for /financed projects.\n\nbe both more precise and more relevant than one that is only based on successive sector-based exclusions.\n\nThe good performances achieved in climate /finance re/flect Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's positive action in this area:\n\n- y In terms of number of loans, renewable energy represented over 84% of electricity generation project /finance in 2021.\n- y In 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB acted as bookrunner on \u20ac28.3 billion of responsible bond issues for its major clients. The Bank is regularly recognised by the IFR, the Banker and Global Capital magazine for its role in the sustainable /finance market, as well as the transactions in which it participates.\n- y The exposure of the /financing portfolio to the coal sector has been calculated since 2019 by taking into account both direct /financing of carbon assets and indirect exposure calculated on client turnover related to carbon using the data available to us. Decreasing since 2019, this exposure stood at less than \u20ac350 million at the end of 2021, or less than 0.1% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's total exposures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\nSteering the Bank's carbon trajectory\n\nIn 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB carried out initial work on de/fining carbon metrics with a view to steering sectoral trajectories. Begun in the oil and gas sector, this work will be extended in 2022 to other sectors with a high carbon footprint (air and maritime transport, automotive industry, construction, steel production, etc.).",

This is primarily achieved by:\n\n- y offering dedicated funds to finance environmental projects : the Green and Social notes;\n- y advising our clients on social and environmental projects;\n- y promoting Socially Responsible Investment in Wealth Management;\n- y assessing and managing the risks inherent in the environmental and social impacts of our financing.\n\n## 4.1. OFFERING DEDICATED FUNDS TO FINANCE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL PROJECTS: GREEN AND SOCIAL NOTES\n\n## Concept - Description\n\nIn 2013, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB developed a new product: the 'Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Green Notes'. The Green Notes are bonds or any other /financial instrument issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB whose funds raised is dedicated to funding environmental projects.\n\nIn 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole put in place a Green Bond Framework to serve as a common framework for all the Group's issuing entities, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, for their respective Green Bond and Green Note issues. In November 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole published a Group Social Bond Framework covering all the Group's issuing entities, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. This Framework allowed Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to successfully launch its inaugural \u20ac1 billion Social Bond issue on 2 December 2020.\n\nFor its Green and Social Notes, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has followed the principles laid down by the Green and Social Bond Principles which are voluntary principles for the formulation of Green and Social Bonds and allowed to guide the market development. The Green and Social Bond Principles are offered by the major green bond and social bond arranging banks, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Green and Social Notes are presented based on four structuring lines, de/fined by the Green and Social Bond Principles:\n\n- y use of the funds;\n- y project assessment and selection;\n- y funds monitoring;\n- y reporting.\n\n## The implementation of the Green Bond Principles is described on the Bank's website (www.ca-cib.com). Second opinion\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's 'Green and Social Notes' issued under the Group's Green and Social Bond Framework bene/fit from a second opinion from the extra-/financial rating agency V.E (Vigeo Eiris). V.E's experts approved the relevance and soundness of the Group's Green and Social Bond Frameworks, the methodology used to select the projects to be included in the green and social portfolio as well as its alignment with the Green and Social Bond Principles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also supported clients on certain high-impact projects such as the Duval Group, which took out a \u20ac30 million Social Loan in October 2021 dedicated to micro/finance projects (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB acted as ESG advisor and arranger of the loan, which was fully syndicated with /five Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Banks).\n\n## 4.3. RAISING OUT CLIENTS' AWARENESS OF SUSTAINABLE FINANCE\n\nIn 2021, the Sustainable Banking team organised the twelfth edition of its annual Sustainable Finance conference. It brought together major investors and issuers over three days in a remote format. This edition was attended by approximately /fifty international experts and key players in ESG and Sustainable\n\nFinance (company managers, economists, regulators, etc.) and comprised 14 round table discussions and speeches. This conference was also an opportunity for issuers to hold discussions with investors at bilateral meetings (with more than 250 meetings held).\n\n## 4.4.   PROMOTING SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT (SRI) IN WEALTH MANAGEMENT\n\nThe Indosuez Wealth Management Group has established an action plan aimed primarily at promoting CSR and providing a complete wealth management offering. It aims at achieving the following objectives:\n\n- y the inclusion of ESG criteria in the client journey;\n- y the introduction of a 100% ESG advisory service;\n\n- y the creation of a socially responsible /financing and investment offering;\n- y the enrichment of ESG ratings within client portfolios.\n\nThe work carried out has already resulted in the enhancement of the value proposition of the ESG offering, with client events and the launch of funds, structured products and green management mandates at the heart of Indosuez Wealth Management's offering.\n\n<!-- image -->",

ASSESSING AND MANAGING THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF OUR FINANCING\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has developed a system to assess and manage the risks arising from the environmental and social impacts relating to both transactions and clients, by factoring in the main sustainable development issues, i.e. combating climate change, biodiversity protection and respect for human rights.\n\n## Consideration of sustainable development issues\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nThe consideration of this issue is detailed in Part 3 'Integrating climate change issues'.\n\n## BIODIVERSITY PROTECTION\n\nSince it exercises a services activity and is located in urban environments, the Bank does not have a signi/ficant direct impact on biodiversity.\n\nHowever, the activities it /finances may in some cases affect biodiversity. In its CSR sectoral policies, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB therefore introduced analytical and exclusionary criteria based on biodiversity protection, with particular attention paid to important areas based on this criterion. Critical adverse impacts on the most sensitive protected areas, such as and wetlands covered by the Ramsar Convention, constitute exclusionary criteria under these policies.\n\nSince 2016, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been mapping the sectors and geographical regions which are most exposed to water access and pollution issues. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has included this criterion of analysis in its CSR scoring system described below. An arti/ficial intelligence tool was developed in 2021 to help account managers read the documents published by clients and identify their responses to this issue.\n\nIn 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB began mapping the sectors and regions most exposed to issues associated with the loss of biodiversity: while some sectors are highly dependent on good levels of biodiversity, other sectors may have negative impacts on natural environments. Bearing that in mind, risk indices based on sectoral and geographical criteria can be calculated.\n\n## OTHER ACTIONS TO PROMOTE HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB fully endorses the values of the United Nations Global Compact, of which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole is a signatory. This particularly concerns human rights and labour standards. These general principles have been supplemented by a number of speci/fic charters signed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.: the Diversity Charter in 2008, the Human Rights Charter in 2009 and the Responsible Purchasing Charter in 2010.\n\nActions concerning employees are covered in 'Developing people and the social ecosystem' and those concerning sub-contractors and suppliers are discussed in 'Promoting an ethical culture'.\n\nAs with climate and biodiversity matters, however, the indirect impacts involving the /financed activities appear as most signi/ficant. They are assessed and managed as shown below. The Bank's CSR sector policies refer speci/fically to the International Labour\n\nOrganisation (ILO) fundamental conventions, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC) performance standards.\n\nSince  2016,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  CIB  maps  the  sectors  and geographical regions which are most exposed to risks of human rights violations in both their own operations and within their supply chains. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has included this criterion of analysis in its CSR scoring system described below. An arti/ficial intelligence tool was developed in 2021 to help account managers read the documents published by clients and identify their responses to this issue.\n\n## Assessing and managing the risks arising from the environmental and social impacts of financing\n\nThe environmental and social impacts resulting from the /financing activity appear to be substantially higher than the Bank's direct environmental footprint. Taking these indirect impacts into account is one of the main sustainable development challenges for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. The system which manages these environmental and social business risks is based on three pillars:\n\n- y applying the Equator Principles to transactions which are directly related to a project;\n- y CSR sector policies;\n- y assessment of the environmental and social aspects of the transactions.\n\nFrom 2013, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also introduced a scoring system for all its corporate clients.\n\nEnvironmental and social risks are /first assessed and managed by the account manager. For project /financing, account managers are backed by a network of local correspondents, who provide the necessary support in each regional structuring centre and remain in constant communication with a coordination unit. It comprises operating staff from the Project Finance business line and coordinates the practical aspects of the implementation of the Equator Principles. It manages the network of local correspondents  and  implements  specialised  training  for participants.\n\nGroup Economic Research (ECO) is an integral part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and provides additional support and clari/fication for all types of transactions and clients by contributing its expertise on environmental and technical issues, thereby making it possible to /fine-tune the analysis and identify the risks for each business sector.\n\nEven  though  its corporate client  base  comprises  mostly SMEs, Wealth Management integrates environmental and social components into its risk analysis based on the sector policies de/fined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and the Group. The noncompliance risk grid for credit transactions covers these issues, supported by a special opinion if necessary.\n\n## The Equator Principles\n\nThe Equator Principles were developed in response to limitations and triggers related to project /financing, as de/fined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Although they cannot always be applied in their current state to other types of /financing, they nevertheless represent a useful and globally recognised",

These criteria mainly re/flect the issues of concern to civil society that appear to be the most relevant for a corporate and investment bank, particularly those relating to human rights, /fighting climate change and preserving biodiversity. The goal of the CSR sector policies is therefore to clarify the non-/financial principles and rules relating to /financing and investments in the corresponding sectors, in accordance with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group policy.\n\nThe current sector policies and their implementation are described on the website.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been assessing the environmental or social sensitivity of transactions since 2009. It re/flects either questions on managing environmental or social impacts that are deemed critical, or controversy related to transactions or clients.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Clients are rated each year on a scale that includes three levels (advanced, compliance and sensitive), with these ratings based on:\n\n- y compliance with existing sector policies;\n- y existence of reputational risk for the Bank (sensitive rating);\n\n- y client's inclusion in leading global CSR indexes (advanced rating).\n\nThis scoring system is evolving following the service contract signed with a non-/financial rating agency. The tests conducted in 2016 and 2017 on the use of ratings from this agency led to a CSR scoring system being introduced in 2018 with three due diligence levels: light, standard and reinforced.

PROMOTING EMPOWERMENT\n\nCommitted and empowered employees close to clients is one of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Human Project ambition and the aim of the Bank's empowerment approach since 2020. This approach, which involves employees, managers and senior management, promotes the development of authentic leadership and employee empowerment by relying on a strengths-based management approach and the involvement of teams through dialogue circles. In 2021, the process continued to be rolled out in the Finance, Operations, Compliance and International Trade & Transaction Banking teams. It will gradually be rolled out to all the Bank's teams by 2023.\n\n## 5.1.1  Listening to our employees and fostering commitment\n\nIn 2021, initiatives that encourage employee participation were  strengthened  in  order  to  reflect  the  numerous transformational  challenges  linked  to  the  development of the  company  and  our  organisational  methods. Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  CIB  and  Indosuez  Wealth  Management participated, as they do every year, in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Engagement and Recommendation Index (ERI) survey, sent to all their employees worldwide, from 4/uni00A0October to 12 November 2021. At Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, this initiative /fits in with commitment surveys continued since 2015 and allows to assess the positive development of results. In 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB achieved its best ERI score with 79% favourable responses, i.e. a score identical to 2020 and its highest participation rate with a 73% response rate, i.e. an increase of 3 points compared to 2020. The results of this survey reveal that strong progress has been made on topics related to strategy, con/fidence in the decisions taken by management and organisational ef/ficiency. They also demonstrate the strong commitment of employees and the collective spirit that have driven the teams since the start of the health crisis. As part of the Human Project, this year the Group rolled out a new ERI indicator, the Empowerment Index, for which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB received 75% favourable responses. This new index will allow us\n\nto measure, over time, perceptions of autonomy, empowerment and the ability to propose new ideas to meet clients' needs.\n\nFinally, as part of its NOW project on new ways of working and in order to initiate joint discussions among all its employees worldwide, the Bank asked employees to answer a speci/fic questionnaire from 17 to 29 June 2021. The questionnaire covered topics including remote working, managerial practices and the corporate culture, tools and applications, and the Smart-Of/fice. 52% of employees answered the questionnaire and the analysis of responses allowed us to measure very positive perceptions concerning ef/ficiency, performance, con/fidence and productivity thanks to the experience of the past year and the empowerment of employees. These results also show that the crisis led Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's employees and managers to adapt their working methods and that they now feel ready to work in a hybrid manner.\n\n## 5.1.2  Accelerating the development of our employees' skills in an environment undergoing rapid transformation\n\nIn a highly competitive and constantly changing environment, the development of employees' skills is a key element in the Bank's strategy and the transformation of its business lines. As part of its Human Project, the Bank is doing everything possible to ensure that each position in the organisation is held by a motivated employee whose skills and performance meet the requirements and challenges of his or her position, for now and for the future. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is committed to enabling all employees to develop their skills and employability. This approach is applied and harmonised globally to take into account the international dimension of the Bank's business and corporate culture.\n\nBy offering an enhanced employee experience with digital solutions, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has strengthened its remote training offer and launched the 365 Talents solution so that every employee can develop and enhance autonomously their empowerment skills.",

The Bank encourages all employees to continuously adapt their skills to the fast and complex changes in the economic, regulatory and technological environment.\n\nThe HRE-Learning global training portal, launched in 2016 and accessible to all employees, currently offers thousands of digital modules. This portal encourages employees to take ownership of their training and represents a veritable invitation to curiosity.\n\nIn 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB supported the business lines in their transformation by offering new training courses, in particular on sustainable /finance and data. New learning experiences were also offered to employees through global virtual classes, challenges in the area of language learning and innovative modules such as a web series on hydrogen.\n\nIn addition, in order to meet regulatory requirements and following a successful initial trial of 'My Mandatory Learning Camp', the\n\n## f Number of employees trained\n\nScope covered: 97%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnew format for mandatory training courses was renewed in 2021. This empowers employees by giving them autonomy to plan their mandatory and regulatory training according to their availability, over a longer period of time.\n\nThe overall training approach, in conjunction with the forward planning of employment and skills and the Human Pillar of the Medium-Term Plan, pursues the following objectives:\n\n- y meet the needs and challenges of the business lines in order to develop the skills of their employees;\n- y meet the Bank's regulatory and security requirements;\n- y support mobility and career changes through dedicated training plans;\n- y implement the training and awareness raising measures required under the various collective agreements signed;\n- y use available new technologies and educational methods to promote access to training;\n- y incorporate training reform into the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB policy.\n\nIn 2021, training hours for France were mainly spent on compliance, Banking-Finance, personal development and communication.\n\nScope covered: 98%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## f Training themes\n\n| In number of hours                           | 2021    | 2021   | 2021       | 2021               | 2020    | 2020        |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|--------|------------|--------------------|---------|-------------|\n| Topics                                       | TOTAL   | %      | O/w France | O/w  international | TOTAL   | %           |\n| Knowledge of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.            | 5,814   | 2.8    | 1,939      | 3,875              | 1,962   | 1.5         |\n| Management of people and activities          | 7,340   | 3.5    | 2,504      | 4,836              | 3,485   | 2.7         |\n| Banking, law, economy                        | 25,124  | 12.0   | 6,528      | 18,596             | 13,713  | 10.7        |\n| Insurance                                    | 1,360   | 0.7    | 883        | 477                | 1,269   | 1.0         |\n| Financial Management (accounting, tax, etc.) | 9,795   | 4.7    | 6,395      | 3,400              | 1,861   | 1.5         |\n| Risks                                        | 3,500   | 1.7    | 1,470      | 2,030              | 3,438   | 2.7         |\n| Compliance                                   | 80,541  | 38.6   | 28,895     | 51,646             | 62,282  | 48.6        |\n| Method, structure, quality                   | 4,429   | 2.1    | 2,320      | 2,109              | 1,955   | 1.5         |\n| Purchasing, marketing, distribution          | 207     | 0.1    | 151        | 56                 | 17      | 0.01        |\n| IT, networks, telecoms                       | 7,183   | 3.4    | 3,909      | 3,274              | 2,536   | 2.0         |\n| Languages                                    | 24,091  | 11.6   | 3,905      | 20,186             | 18,028  | 14.1        |\n| Of/fice automation, software, NICT           | 12,265  | 5.9    | 5,005      | 7,260              | 5,101   | 4.0         |\n| Personal development, communication          | 16,247  | 7.8    | 9,135      | 7,112              | 6,522   | 5.1         |\n| Health and safety                            | 5,088   | 2.4    | 1,591      | 3,497              | 4,242   | 3.3         |\n| Human Rights and Environment                 | 3,502   | 1.7    | 707        | 2,795              | 761     | 0.6         |\n| Human resources                              | 2,091   | 1.0    | 1,144      | 947                | 971     | 0.8         |\n| TOTAL                                        | 208,577 | 100.0  | 76,481     | 132,096            | 128,143 | 100.0       |\n| Scope covered                                | -       | 97%    | -          | -                  |         | 98/uni00A0% |\n\n<!-- image -->",

This training course offered to around thirty employees in 2021 also allows to form a /first pool of data scientists within the Bank. New sessions will be rolled out in 2022. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has also developed data training programmes, in partnership with innovation teams, which will be included in the Bank's training offer for 2022.\n- y As part of the partnership signed with Netexplo in 2019, employees were able to learn about the digital innovations of the year by attending the Innovation Forum in April 2021.\n\nIn order to support the Bank's transformation projects, the partnership with the Pluralsight platform was renewed this year, thereby allowing more than 400 employees to receive training in web development, IT security, data and various other IT areas.\n\nFurthermore, 'IS MOOC Security' training programmes speci/fic to each business line have also been put in place to support Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's experts in the development of their information security skills and thus better anticipate and manage risks.\n\n## y Developing cross-functional, behavioural and managerial skills\n\nThe training offer at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is designed to encourage curiosity. All employees are involved in determining their own training and can freely access the HRE-Learning online portal, which offers thousands modules. In line with the Bank's digital transformation over the past few years, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is continuing to expand its digital training offer to enable all its employees to continue developing soft skills, linguistic and managerial skills.\n\nAs key players in developing their employees' skills and implementing the Bank's strategy, managers - regardless of their level of experience - receive speci/fic support. Since 2012, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been rolling out its Management Academy training programme in France and abroad, in order to develop a shared managerial culture. The Management Academy is structured around 3 levels. The 'Novice Learners' level is open to all employees who then have free access to digital modules on managerial topics via the Bank's international training portal. The 'Expert Learners' and 'Master Learners' levels are offered to operational managers and managers of managers.\n\nIn 2021, the Management Academy was redesigned and its format and content were adapted to remote learning in order to respond to changes in the bank and the health environment.\n\nThe empowerment approach, launched in 2020 as part of the Human Project, complements the Management Academy system by strengthening the themes of authentic leadership and strengths-based management. The roll-out of this approach continued in 2021 and will continue until 2023.\n\nIn addition and in order to promote cross-functionality and skills development using a different approach, the Bank launched in 2019 the skills sponsorship programme, Startup Mission. By enhancing the employee experience and promoting social innovation, this programme reinforces the commitment of our teams and is fully aligned with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Human Project. It allows employees to experience a one-month immersive experience in a startup at the Village by CA to share their expertise while discovering new ways of working. There is a system in place to match the skills of the volunteer employees with the needs of the startups. Since its launch, 22 employees have already tried\n\nthe Startup Mission adventure. The results are very positive both for the participants - who are immersed in an agile, cutting-edge environment -, the startups, who bene/fit from the skills-based sponsorship, and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB - who also gains from the exchange.\n\n## y Developping and empowering employees by o/ffering them a professional pathway - which they prepared with their manager and HR manager\n\nEach year, the appraisal and objectives setting meetings provide an opportunity to take stock of individual and collective performance, each employee's achievements and their development needs.\n\nWithin the framework of this worldwide campaign in 2021, 98.03% of the annual assessments between employees and managers have been realised. Once again this year, all employees in France, with at least 6 years' service at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, were given a Recap Professional Interview to address career development issues and training needs.\n\nIn addition to these campaigns, two other development initiatives have been introduced at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB:\n\n- y the Cross-Feedback tool, intended for the most cross functional positions by providing objective feedback from the people with whom the employee is working on a daily basis. This tool helps to promote better cooperation between the Bank's teams and to develop a culture based on feedback. In 2021, 1,314/uni00A0employees received individual Cross Feedback reports shared with their manager;\n- y the 360\u00b0, an individual development tool, enables members of the Executive Committee and their direct reports to receive feedback from their managers, peers and direct reports. In order to promote empowerment for all employees, participants can choose to share some or all of the results of their 360\u00b0 report with their manager, the Human Resources department or their teams.\n\n## 5.1.2.2 PROMOTING EMPLOYEE MOBILITY\n\nInternal mobility is a major aspect in employee skills development, by enabling them to evolve within the Bank and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nIn a world where the business and skills are changing rapidly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB gives all employees the opportunity to become the key player in their development by encouraging them to take the initiative in increasing their employability, as part of the Human Project.\n\nThe dedicated MyJobs portal, which can be accessed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's employees in France and abroad, covers all available positions within the Corporate and Investment Bank and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole the Group. In addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses different systems to support employees in their mobility approaches: mobility Committees, events and workshops, individual support and digital pathways (for example, Jobmaker). These initiatives also create a more cross disciplinary approach and develop the mobility culture.",

Using Arti/ficial Intelligence, the tool maps employees' skills to suggest opportunities within the company based on their pro/file and interests. The roll-out of the 365Talents solution is organised into stages with the various departments worldwide and will be completed in 2022.\n\nIn order to promote mobility and the HR set-ups and support, the Bank also held its fourth Mobility Week in France, bringing together 330 participants in a digital format. This event allows the business lines to present their opportunities and enables participants to speak to the HR teams in order to receive personalised advice.\n\nIn 2021, the D\u00e9clic Mobilit\u00e9 programme, organised with a /firm specialised in providing professional support, was again held remotely. This programme combines one-on-one interviews and group sessions to encourage the sharing of experiences, and has enabled 165 employees since its creation in 2017 to discuss their mobility plans and to get them underway.\n\nIn addition, 100 employees took part this year in remote mobility workshops organised each month and received advice to help them re/flect on their career plan, write their CVs and prepare their recruitment interviews.\n\n## 5.1.3  Attracting talent, developing our employees, preparing succession plans\n\n## y Promoting the employer brand and growing our talent\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has an active recruitment and talent identi/fication policy, in France and abroad, to meet businesses' needs. By strengthening its partnerships with universities and schools as well as its presence on campuses, the Bank wants to promote its expertise and its international network in order to attract future talents. For this reason, in 2021, 60 digital and face-to-face forums were organised in collaboration with schools and universities in France and abroad. To reinforce interactions between both academic and professional worlds, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also organises conferences and case studies.\n\nClose to 170 managers and employees joined the HR teams again in France in 2021 for these events to share their experience with students and to receive applications for the various positions to be /filled.\n\nThe Bank is setting up speci/fic educational partnerships in France and internationally. In 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB joined forces with CFA DIFCAM to create a new 'Insurance, Banking, Finance Back Of/fice - Middle Of/fice in Corporate and Investment Banking' professional diploma in partnership with the University of Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines. The /first class of 16 students was welcomed in September 2021, and 12 students are working on work-study programmes in the Operations Department at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. Some of the teaching is also provided by experts from this Department.\n\nMindful of reaching out to as many people as possible, the Employer Brand of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB spreads out on the Bank's social media, LinkedIn and Twitter. With more than 80 publications in 2021, the Bank was able to promote its commitments, share experiences from recently recruited employees and display career opportunities to potential candidates.\n\n## y Employee induction\n\nIn 2016, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB rolled out its Global Induction Programme, to help new employees integrate into the company. The programme allows new entrants to learn about all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB business lines and to receive all useful information when they arrive. The Bank's intranet has a dedicated area wherein a large number of documents helping the integration process are available. Digital resources are also available on the Bank's international training portal, HRE-Learning. An individual programme of mandatory training courses is in place to develop and promote the compliance and risks culture, helping new employees to adopt the appropriate and expected behaviours in regulatory matters. Depending on the business line, new employees may also follow additional training courses to help them ease into their new position.\n\nDuring their /first year within the Bank, new joiners are also invited to the Induction Day to gain a better understanding of the interaction between the Bank's different business lines and to meet their peers who have recently joined Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB teams. Since its inception in 2016, more than 2,500 participants have taken part in this integration event.\n\nFor the /first time in 2021, all 1,400 employees who began working at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's locations around the world over the last two years were invited to the same event, which was remote and digital to respect restrictions imposed by the health crisis.These Induction Days brought together participants from more than 25 countries. The history of an emblematic deal was presented by experts from the Bank's various business lines; the experiences they shared allowed new joiners to better understand how the Corporate and Investment Banking department operates.\n\nDepending on their location and business line, new hires may\n\nalso be invited to participate in speci/fic integration programmes. This is the case in the United States, where videos presenting the various departments are offered to new joiners, allowing them to familiarise themselves with the Bank's organisation.\n\nAs part of its digitalisation transformation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB offers a digital onboarding procedure enabling employees online access to their digital HR documents from both personal and professional computers. In order to facilitate the search for information, the HR intranet in France has a chatbot which answers employees' questions.\n\n## y Developing and supporting our talents\n\nAt Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, the members of the Management Committee, managers and Human Resources have been working to identify and manage talents for several years now. Part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group policy, it aims to retain and develop employees with signi/ficant potential and anticipate, prepare and ensure coherent succession plans for strategic positions at the Bank.\n\nThe Bank talents are offered special development opportunities which combine Groupwide programmes and speci/fic Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB programmes. Initiatives for high-potential employees are also offered locally, by region or country.\n\nDespite the health situation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB wanted to maintain the momentum initiated in recent years by adapting to the context of remote working for employees.",

        "page_content": "AMBITION IN TERMS OF HUMAN RESOURCES: STRENGTHENING AUTONOMY AND EMPOWERMENT\n\nSince 2017, the Corporate Mentoring Programme has enabled Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's talent in our various locations worldwide to bene/fit from the support of members of the Executive Committees\n\nor Business Line and Country Management Committees. This experience-sharing programme also aims to promote greater diversity within the teams.\n\n## 5.2. ORGANISATIONAL TRANSFORMATION TO REMAIN CLOSE TO THE CLIENT\n\nThe Group and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB undertake to offer their clients direct access to a local relationship manager. Local relationship managers are discerning and have greater responsibilities in terms of responding more quickly to customer needs. Internally, this requires more cross-functionality and collective agility while adapting to the digital transformation that is impacting ways of working.\n\n## More empowerment and cross-functionality\n\nIn 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB continued to simplify its organisation and process in order to strengthen proximity with clients by changing the governance of some businesses. This evolution of the organisation allows to reposition the technical and functional expertise at the centre of its system, to gain in responsiveness on the implementation of projects impacting the entire value chain and to shorten decision making. The simpli/fication of hierarchy levels also enables a better team coordination to better meet clients' needs.\n\nMoreover, in order to strengthen everyone's empowerment and commitment to the clients and society, the Bank rolls out since 2020 an empowerment approach. The latter aims to develop authentic leadership and employee empowerment by relying on a strengths-based management approach and the involvement of teams through dialogue circles. This approach will be gradually rolled out to all the Bank's teams by 2023.\n\n## 5.3.  STRENGTHENING THE FRAMEWORK OF TRUST BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND THE COMPANY\n\n## 5.3.1  Ensuring constructive social dialogue within the Group\n\nThe Group promotes dynamic and constructive social dialogue\n\nwith its employees and their representatives when existing locally. The international framework agreement signed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group with UNI Global Union on 31 July 2019 lays the foundations of the social pact which recognises at global level the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining and the prioritisation of social dialogue which supports the Group's growth and performance.\n\nIn France, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group sealed its commitment to its social pact through an agreement mapping out the employee representative path to create an environment that is likely to encourage employee engagement and investment in the role.\n\nFully subscribing to the Group approach, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is keen on maintaining effective and constructive social dialogue so that each year it can enter collective agreements that contain genuine commitments which re/flect the Bank's social policy.\n\nThroughout 2021, still marked by the health crisis, the Bank continued to bring its social bodies to life and continued discussions with employee representative bodies on all social issues, particularly issues relating to the management of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nIn parallel with the meetings of the Social and Economic Committee (CSE) and the work of the three committees (Social Policy Committee, Economic and Strategic Committee and Committee on Health, Safety and Working Conditions), negotiations took place and resulted, in 2021, in nine agreements relating to compensation, equality and remote working.\n\n## f Number of agreements signed during the year by subject\n\n|                                      | 2021   | 2021          | 2021   | 2020   | 2020          | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|---------------|--------|--------|---------------|--------|\n|                                      | France | International | TOTAL  | France | International | TOTAL  |\n| Compensation and bene/fits           | 17     | 4             | 21     | 16     | 6             | 22     |\n| Training                             | 0      | 0             | 0      | 0      | 0             | 0      |\n| Employee representative institutions | 0      | 0             | 0      | 2      | 0             | 2      |\n| Employment                           | 1      | 2             | 3      | 0      | 0             | 0      |\n| Working hours                        | 4      | 3             | 7      | 1      | 2             | 3      |\n| Diversity and equality at work       | 3      | 0             | 3      | 0      | 0             | 0      |\n| Health and safety                    | 2      | 0             | 2      | 0      | 0             | 0      |\n| Other                                | 2      | 1             | 3      | 6      | 3             | 9      |\n| TOTAL                                | 29     | 10            | 39     | 25     | 11            | 36     |\n| Scope covered                        | -      | -             | 97%    | 99%    | -             | -      |",

In this respect, measures such as the Behaviour Charter and regular initiatives to raise awareness of diversity have been in place at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB for many years.\n\nAs a committed and responsible employer, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB bases its Human Project on a strong conviction: the diversity of its employees is a major asset for the Bank.\n\nIn addition to being essential to re/flect the diversity of its clients and the society, this diversity is a performance and innovation factor for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, which operates in more than 34/uni00A0countries, has 16 business lines, employees of 100 nationalities and more than 43.9% women among its teams.\n\nBoth in France and abroad, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB rolls out a speci/fic initiative by organising every year, in November, the Diversity Month. In 2021, conferences, workshops and video testimonials focussed on 5 topics: inclusive culture, intercultural issues, disabilities, diversity and intergenerational issues. As part of its Human Project, the Bank is also working to strengthen the inclusive dimension of all of its processes: recruitment, talent selection, succession plans and development programmes.\n\nTo continue the collective efforts to promote equality in recruitment processes and to ensure that the procedures for hiring employees comply with this fundamental principle of equal opportunities and fairness, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has implemented digital training, 'Recruiting without discriminating', for all human resources managers and employee-managers involved in recruitment processes.\n\n## 5.3.3  Gender equality at work\n\nConvinced that diversity is a powerful driver of performance and innovation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has for several years now been following a proactive diversity policy.\n\nTo identify the main issues and measure the effectiveness of its diversity policy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB regularly analyses its gender distribution indicators in view of de/fined goals.\n\nFor several years now, the Bank has implemented action plans to promote professional equality between women and men. The main focuses of the professional gender equality agreement, renewed in France in 2021 for a period of 3 years, are to ensure balanced job recruitment and equal pay, train employees on the principles of professional equality and non-discrimination and raise their awareness of the issues involved, help all employees to boost their employability, and roll out initiatives in favour of parenthood. The Bank also supports its female talent, both in France and abroad, through a range of leadership development programmes./uni00A0 The programmes' objectives are to provide women with the keys to strengthening their strategic positioning,\n\ndeveloping their networks and progressing within management bodies.\n\nUnder the 'Corporate Mentoring programme', Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has set itself gender equality targets when selecting 'mentees', ensuring that women represent more than 50% of the participants (to date, 99 women employees have bene/fited from the/uni00A0'Corporate Mentoring Programme', or 54% of 'mentees'). In addition, each year female employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB are selected to participate in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's mentoring programme.\n\nIn line with these action plans, and to accelerate the feminisation and internationalisation of its management bodies (EXCOM and MANCOM, Circles 1 and 2), in 2020 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB conducted a global review of its strategic talent pool. To meet the objectives set by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB aims to reach 50% women and 40% foreign nationals in this pool by the end of 2022.\n\nIn addition, as the long-standing partners of the Financi'Elles federation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB reaf/firmed their commitment to introducing ambitious Human Resources policies in the area of gender equality by signing, in November 2021, the Financi'Elles Charter of Commitments on 10-year anniversary of the federation of the Banking, Finance and Insurance networks.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also pays particular attention to actions in favour of parenthood in its business locations. In France, paternity leave was increased from 11 to 25 days in 2021, with employees continuing to receive 100% of their salary in addition to the compensation paid by the social security department. The Bank also offers its employees discussion workshops on the 'Careermotherhood balance'.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also offers its employees, 40/uni00A0nursery places in partnership with the Babilou network of nurseries in France, and 30 nursery places in the Petits Chaperons Rouges nursery near the SQY Park campus. All these nursery places are allocated according to social criteria. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also offers its employees casual childcare arrangements in over 450/uni00A0creches for children from four months to three years, also in partnership with the Babilou network.\n\nThe effects of all these initiatives are re/flected in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's gender equality index in France, which stood at 85 out of 100 once again in 2021.\n\nLastly, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also supports the networks created by female employees, such as CWEEN launched in 2008 in India, Potentielles in France, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Women's Network (CWN) in New York in 2010, SPRING in London in 2015, RISE in Hong Kong in 2016, WING in Tokyo in 2017, CARE in South Korea, MORE in Taiwan, Gulf Women's Network in Dubai in 2018 and EQUAL launched in Singapore in 2020. In Italy, the partnership with PWN Milan (Professional Women Network) allows employees to access a speci/fic mentoring programme, participate in remote workshops and training, and discuss their careers with other women.",

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's remuneration policy is based on principles of fairness, performance incentives in line with risk management and the sharing of the Company's values. This policy is deployed taking into account the economic, social and competitive context of the markets in which the Bank operates, as well as applicable legal and regulatory obligations. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB places a great importance on the principle of equal treatment at work. Provisions can be made locally to reduce possible gender wage gaps, for example as in France under the agreement on gender equality at work.\n\n## y Particular attention paid to the internationalisation of our talent pools\n\nWith  nearly  half  of  employees  working  abroad,  the internationalisation of talent pools is a key goal for the Bank. To step up the internationalisation of its management bodies (EXCOM and MANCOM, Circles 1 and 2), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB conducted a global review of its strategic talent pool in 2020 allowing to enrich its succession plan. As a result of a special focus on diversity criteria, 37% of identi/fied talents are international.\n\nTo meet the objectives set by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB aims to reach 50% women and 40% foreign nationals in this pool by the end of 2022.\n\n## y Inclusion of young people and access to employment (work-study employees and trainees)\n\nKeen to support young people in /finding employment, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  CIB  pursues  an  active  policy  in  favour  of  their occupational integration in France and abroad. In 2021, despite the complex health situation, the Bank maintained an ambitious policy on the recruitment of young people to prepare for the future, integrate new generations and attract talent. This resulted in an increase in the number of work-study employees hired in France. In 2021, 397 trainees, 223 work-study employees and 27 VIEs (International Volunteers in Business) joined the Bank.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also participated in the /first Mobilijeunes event organised by CASA, which aims to support young people in /finding jobs by offering workshops (pitches, CV preparation, etc.), conferences, and promoting /fixed-term and permanent contracts to this group of people.\n\nThrough its internships, work-study placements and VIE positions, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB identi/fies the highest-potential employees and creates a Global Junior Pool. In France, more than 60% of junior permanent-contract positions were /filled in 2021 by individuals from this pool.\n\nIn some of its locations, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also offers students the opportunity to join the Bank through dedicated pathways which may involve internships lasting from 10 weeks to 2 years. This is the case for example in New York, London, Hong Kong SAR and Frankfurt. In Hong Kong SAR, the Bank is supporting young graduates as they embark on their careers as a member of the 'Banking Talent' programme of the Hong\n\nKong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Through this programme, the young professionals join a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB department for a six-month period, supplementing the training provided by the HKMA.In accordance with the Group policy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB participates in numerous activities promoting the diversity of the recruited pro/files. In this context, the Bank has renewed its partnership with Handiforma/finance, initiated by the French Management Association (AFG), which offers disabled people the chance to train for back-of/fice jobs in capital markets, whilst also studying for a professional diploma from Universit\u00e9 de Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines.\n\nTo ensure fairness, job offers are published on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group job sites. They are also published on specialist recruitment sites and on JobTeaser, a recruitment platform in schools and universities. After having applied online, the candidates for internships, work-study contracts, VIEs or permanent contracts for young graduates must pass online aptitude tests before being invited for interview.\n\nAs part of the Human Project and their societal commitments, the Group and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB are committed as a responsible employer to fostering diversity and integrating young people and individuals excluded from employment. In 2021, the Bank strengthened its partnerships with committed players such as ' Nos Quartiers ont du Talent ' (NQT) and the 'A Network for All' alliance by LinkedIn and LinkedOut led by the Entourage organisation. At a conference organised as part of the Diversity Month, these players presented their actions, raised employee awareness of the importance of the network, and called on them to commit to greater professional equality.\n\n## f Trainees and work-study employees (average monthly FTE)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group in France has been actively promoting the employment of people with disabilities through job retention and awareness initiatives and also through recruitment from the sheltered and disability friendly sectors. The sixth agreement, signed in January 2020, is a logical continuation of the efforts made over the previous /fifteen years and covers all of the Group's entities.\n\nHealth prevention and retention of persons with disabilities are at the heart of the Bank's concerns. A dedicated multidisciplinary team (head of disability integration and occupational health service) ensures the proper integration and retention of employees in conjunction with the Group's central disability team.\n\nTo support employees with disabilities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB plans to adjust workstations and the working environment: ergonomics studies, specially adapted computer equipment (screens, special software for employees with visual impairment), use of the Tad\u00e9o and Roger Voice telephone support for hearing-impaired employees, introduction of working from home and developing the use of sign language translation for conferences and training courses. This individual support can also take the form of tailored training, psychological monitoring, or coaching.\n\n## 5.3.5   Health, safety and quality of life in the workplace\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB pays particular attention to the quality of life in the workplace, working conditions and the work-life balance of its employees.\n\n## y Ensuring an environment and working conditions for employees to pursue activities safely\n\nThis  year,  the  Occupational  Health  Department,  Human Resources, Communications and managers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB were again highly involved in managing the challenges related to the health crisis, the protection of employees and the organisation of work. The exceptional measures deployed in mid-March 2020 have been extended to:\n\n- y providing local support to management and employees during the health crisis;\n- y de/fining and communicating health protocols to ensure full ownership and compliance with barrier measures by employees;\n- y strengthening social dialogue by organising regular remote interaction with all staff representatives, particularly with the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee of the CSE;\n- y maintaining social links by communicating at each new phase of the crisis, and proposing an HR Q&A detailing the work organisation measures;\n- y holding regular discussions on matters relating to the health crisis with the Bank's Covid representatives.\n\nIn order to protect employees and comply with the health protocols put in place for private sector companies, work organisation was adapted and remote working was made widespread until midJune 2021 for all functions that were able to do so. A gradual return to the workplace began in June and transitional work organisation arrangements were put in place.\n\nSpeci/fic arrangements have also been made to protect employees in the workplace: distribution of sanitary kits including hydroalcohol gel and surgical masks, adapting the layout of our premises to ensure compliance with safety distances and barrier measures. In addition to these measures, employees at\n\nrisk of a serious form of Covid-19 were invited to speak to the Occupational Health Department in order to de/fine, for each situation, the best possible work organisation.\n\n## y Supporting employees in these unprecedented work situations\n\nIn order to provide additional support to employees, many support systems have been rolled out, in addition to prevention and support actions carried out by the medical teams.\n\nIn France, employees have been able to access to a free medical consultation service since the beginning of the health crisis, as well as the Stimulus anonymous and con/fidential psychological support unit to help them better understand this period and the complicated situations related to professional or personal life. A similar mechanism, the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), is also in place in Germany, the United States, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom and since 2021 in India and Japan.\n\nThroughout the year, the Occupational Health Department organised Covid-19 vaccination campaigns, as well as a seasonal /flu vaccination campaign. Employees in India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and the United Kingdom have bene/fited from similar initiatives or extra days off so that they can be vaccinated.\n\nIn addition to these enhanced measures to deal with the health crisis, the Bank is continuing its commitments to employees who face dif/ficult family situations. The Bank offers Responsage services, a con/fidential and free telephone platform providing guidance and advice to employees on procedures related to the status of a family member-carer.\n\nIn 2017, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB set up a system for donating rest days between colleagues to take care of a sick loved one (child, spouse, civil-union partner or ascendants). In 2021, donations amounted to 130 available days that could be allocated to employees where necessary.\n\nIn addition, a psychosocial risk monitoring system involving everyone at the company and serving to relay any dif/ficulties encountered by employees supplements the Behaviour Charter, a document setting out a concrete framework for identifying and managing inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour at the company.\n\n## BUILDING NEW WAYS OF WORKING WITH EMPLOYEES\n\nAs part of its Human Project, in 2021 the Bank launched the global project 'New ways Of Working (NOW)' with a view to establishing together with its employees a new hybrid and inclusive working environment. It is based on 4 interdependent pillars and seeks to address changes in the work organisation, spaces (Smart-Of/fice), tools and applications and management culture.\n\nIn June 2021, more than 4,000 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB employees took part in the NOW global survey, sharing their experiences and ideas on the 4/uni00A0aspects of the project. In France, workshops were organised to collect the ideas, needs and suggestions of employees on the management and operational principles of hybrid work methods, best practices, team rituals, and achieving a work-life balance and disconnection. More than 240 employees took part in this initiative.\n\nIn October 2021, the signing of the new remote-working agreement for France marked a /first step in the implementation of new ways of working at the Bank. The agreement is based on four main principles: double volunteering and reversibility,\n\n<!-- image -->",

It offers a common base, respecting the DNA of the Group and of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, on which the international entities can rely to establish or adapt their respective agreements, taking into account local cultural and regulatory speci/ficities. For example, Germany also signed a new agreement on remote working in November 2021.\n\nAs part of the 'Smart-Of/fice' pillar of the NOW project, the Bank is experimenting with new interior layouts to enhance the /flexibility and diversity of workspaces for employees when on site. Implemented at the Coverage and Finance teams, this experiment is regularly reported on to the Social and Economic Committee, the latter being accompanied by an expert on the work environment and equipment who will be called upon to issue an opinion. Workspace transformation projects have also been launched in Frankfurt, New York and Taipei.\n\nSpecial communication tools have been put in place to inform employees throughout the NOW project. To support the cultural and managerial transformation stemming from these changes, a change management set-up has been introduced for managers and employees in addition to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's empowerment process.\n\n## EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nAs a responsible employer that cares about the well-being of its employees, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB promotes a large range of employee bene/fits worldwide. The Bank takes particular care to ensure that its employee bene/fits are:\n\n- y ethical and re/flect the Group's values;\n- y attractive and reasonable in terms of local practices in the banking sector;\n- y appropriate for the targeted recipients.\n\nThe Bank contributes to the funding of health cover programmes in many countries in order to offer its employees access to health care.\n\n2021 was marked by an improvement in health insurance in India and the United States, as well as health insurance for expatriate employees.\n\nEnsuring family protection in the event of death or a work stoppage is also important to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, which fully funds the schemes put in place by its entities. In terms of preparing for retirement, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been a pioneer in many countries by helping its employees build up savings. In France, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States, this type of scheme has been in place for over 20 years.\n\nThrough its employee savings schemes, employees share in the Bank's results and performance. Worldwide, Group's employees are regularly offered the opportunity to share in capital increase operations. In 2021, this programme covered 9 countries (including France) in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is located.\n\nIn addition, employees on international positions bene/fit from speci/fic bene/fits.\n\nSince  2016,  the  profit-sharing  agreement  in  France  has incorporated the Bank's CSR indicator, FReD, to take account of the joint commitment of the Bank and its employees to the success of the CSR policy.\n\nAs part of its approach to continuous improvement of FReD, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is committed to strengthening its CSR commitments by involving all employees. Since 2020, the Bank has offered its employees a payroll giving initiative, offering employees (CDI, /fixed-term and work-study employees) the ability to make a donation of up to \u20ac5 per month to an NGO via a deduction from their salary. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB doubles each of the donations and covers the operating costs of the platform so that 100% of these donations are paid to associations chosen by employees: Pure Ocean, Institut Curie, H\u00f4pital NeckerEnfants malades (Children's Hospital) and Les restos du c\u0153ur. In 2021, 341 employees participated in the salary donation scheme enabling the Bank to pay \u20ac31,231.42 to partner associations.\n\n- f Collective variable compensation paid during the year on the basis of the previous year's results in France\n\n|                                     | 2021                                | 2021                      | 2021                    | 2020                               | 2020                      | 2020                    |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                     | Total amount  (thousands of  euros) | Number of  bene/ficiaries | Average amount  (euros) | Total amount (thousands of  euros) | Number of  bene/ficiaries | Average amount  (euros) |\n| Pro/fit-sharing                     | 1,540                               | 524                       | 2,939                   | 941                                | 537                       | 1,751                   |\n| Incentive plans                     | 34,203                              | 5,917                     | 5,780                   | 33,291                             | 5,978                     | 5,569                   |\n| Employer's additional  contribution | 16,506                              | 5,673                     | 2,910                   | 16,028                             | 5,488                     | 2,921                   |\n| TOTAL                               | 52,249                              | -                         | -                       | 50,260                             | -                         | -                       |\n| France scope covered                |                                     |                           | 99%                     |                                    |                           | 99%                     |",

DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's main economic and social impacts on local areas (both positive and negative) are indirect, through its /financing activity, and do not come directly from its sites. Its business services do not therefore have a signi/ficant impact on neighbouring and local populations.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's indirect impacts re/flect its role as a major /financier of the global economy and major player in debt markets. The principles listed under the 'General environmental policy' heading are therefore intended to maximise the positive effects and minimise the negative impacts of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's business by:\n\n- y implementing its system to assess and manage environmental or social client and transaction related risks;\n- y promoting so-called 'responsible' /financing transactions, in which issuers and investors factor social and environmental considerations into their investment decisions.\n\nOffering clients a diversi/fied range of socially responsible investments is also one of the objectives set by Wealth Management.\n\n## 6.2. EMPLOYEES' INVOLVEMENT IN SOLIDARITY INITIATIVES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB actively encourages the commitment of its employees to social causes in the /fields of social solidarity and inclusion. To this end, in 2021 the Bank renewed its 'Solidaires by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB' programme.\n\n## Solidarity initiatives in France and abroad\n\nDuring regular events or one-off assignments, employees shared some very rewarding moments in the service of the cause of public interest. These experiences, organised in a number of countries where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB operates, give employees opportunities to engage with and help charities to present their projects to other Bank employees.\n\nIn France, employees continued to donate their time to holding sporting events, such as the Financial Community Telethon. Due to the health context, which remains unstable, this race turned into a virtual event. Employees of 9/uni00A0Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group entities participated in this unprecedented edition, and walked or ran individually to collect donations for the AFM-T\u00e9l\u00e9thon. The Group's runners covered 14.000 kilometres thanks to the United Heroes sport app. Against the backdrop of the health crisis and in compliance with barrier measures, participation in the telethon - which was founded on the principles of contribution and solidarity - was high.\n\nSince April 2020, the salary donation allows French employees to make a donation to a selected association by donating cents from their salary via a monthly deduction made when preparing their pay. Employees can also add between \u20ac1 and \u20ac5 per month to their donation, with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB adding to each donation made. In 2021, \u20ac31,231.42 were collected through employee donations (including contribution from the Bank). 100% of these donations were donated to one of the 4 selected associations: H\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants malades (Children's Hospital), Institut Curie, Les Restos du C\u0153ur or Pure Oc\u00e9an. These associations held a forum for associations to demonstrate to employees the importance of these donations in support of their projects.\n\nThrough its ' Coups de Pouce ' programme, the Bank provides /financial support for charitable projects to which employees are\n\npersonally committed. The designated /fields of activity are social solidarity, social inclusion, environment, education and health in France and abroad. In 2021, 12 employees in France and 12/uni00A0abroad bene/fited from these ' Coups de Pouce ' to help carry out their projects.\n\nIn total, since 2013, 329 charitable projects supported by employees  have  been  supported  by  the  Bank,including 108/uni00A0abroad.\n\nIn the United States, in the healthcare and medical research sector, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB supports The Bowery Mission, CAF America and the American Cancer Society, as well as New York Cares working in the /field of education and children.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Bank helps to combat poverty, instability and exclusion through the Charity programme.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB supports the WeR Family Foundation.\n\nIn Cambodia, the Bank continues its partnership with the Enfants du M\u00e9kong (Children of the Mekong) association.\n\nIn 2021, Indosuez Wealth Management continued its sustainable and responsible commitment, driven in particular by the concrete solidarity initiatives of its employees:\n\n- y since 2012, the Indosuez Foundation in France, under the auspices of the Fondation de France , has been involved in concrete charitable initiatives to support vulnerable people: elderly people, disabled people, teenagers or young adults who are victims of addiction or high-risk behaviour. Almost 80/uni00A0associations, including around /fifteen social impact start-ups, have thus bene/fited from skills sponsorship and donations of professional time by almost 50% of staff in France;\n- y since its establishment in 2012, the Indosuez Foundation in Switzerland has funded 30 environmental projects with a high economic and social impact for vulnerable communities in Switzerland and around the world. They aim to support local communities through projects that promote the dissemination of knowledge, the emancipation of young people and the protection of natural heritage. Through its national company volunteering programme (Citizen Days) each year, it offers Indosuez Group employees in Switzerland (Indosuez and Azqore) the",

It also supported associations that are actively helping people who are extremely vulnerable during the Covid-19 crisis;\n\n- y in  partnership  with Plan\u00e8te  Urgence ,  Indosuez  Wealth Management offers its employees the opportunity to take solidarity leave and actively participate in projects created and managed by local players in different countries around the world. For 2 weeks (over the period of their leave), the selected employees provide technical assistance (transfer of skills) to solidarity projects, and projects involving cooperation, development or protection of the environment, thereby helping to strengthen the autonomy of the populations concerned. In 2020 and 2021, volunteer assignments abroad were suspended and deferred until 2022. However, a proportion of Indosuez Wealth Management's donations were allocated to reforestation initiatives;\n- y since 2016, CFM Indosuez, a subsidiary of Indosuez in Monaco, has worked with AMADE Mondiale (World Association of Children's Friends), which was established more than 50 years\n\n## 6.3. CULTURAL SPONSORSHIP\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB France continues to actively pursue a policy of cultural sponsorship supporting projects that encourage artistic creation, the discovery of the world's cultures and the transmission of cultural heritage. Despite the health situation, which remains complex, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has decided to maintain its commitments to the Op\u00e9ra de Paris and the Festival d'Aix-en-Provence .\n\nago by Princess Grace of Monaco. It seeks to support access to education in Burundi;\n\n- y CFM Indosuez also supports projects aimed at children and young people in Monaco and France (PACA region), led by associations recognised for their professionalism and the relevance of their actions. They are selected by a decision-making committee from among the applications received following a call for projects, with the /final candidates selected in advance by employee volunteers under a standardised selection and instruction process. The Bank is also committed to protecting the oceans as part of its partnership with the Institut Oc\u00e9anographique de Monaco . In 2021, it donated \u20ac171,000 to the institute, corresponding to the solidarity share of the responsible investment solution, CFM Indosuez Oc\u00e9ano, built in collaboration with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nIn 2021, CFM Indosuez sought to consolidate its collective commitments as well as its societal and environmental initiatives through a Social Charter that was rolled out to its employees in January 2022.\n\nInternationally, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB maintained its support for:\n\n- y the National Gallery in London,\n- y the Royal Opera in Madrid,\n- y the Museum of Modern Art 'MoMA' and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) in New York.\n\n## 6.4. LINKS WITH SCHOOLS AND SUPPORT FOR UNIVERSITY RESEARCH\n\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB ensures a strong presence in schools, particularly through the ' Capitaines d'\u00e9cole ' project led by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A..\n- y Since 2006, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been a partner of the Chair of Quantitative Finance and Sustainable Development at Paris Dauphine University and \u00c9cole Polytechnique. This multidisciplinary project, supported from its inception by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, is unique in that it brings together specialists in quantitative /finance, mathematics and sustainable development. One research area studied by this Chair since 2010 involves the quanti/fication of indirect impacts of the /financing and investment activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions induced by the activities of the Bank's clients. This partnership was renewed at the end of 2021 for 5 years.\n- y One of the solid achievements of this research is the SAFE (previously, P9XCA) methodology referred to above. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has played an important role in disseminating this work to other /financial institutions. In 2014, the Bank took an active role in the sector approach recommended by French organisations promoting corporate social responsibility (ORSE, ADEME and ABC). This approach seeks to produce a practical guide listing the methodologies and tools to help the various /financial stakeholders (banks, insurance companies, asset managers) assess their direct and indirect GHG emissions.\n- y A new PhD begun in 2018, overseen by the Chair, was supported at the end of 2021 on the subject of the climate risks which could affect banks, particularly in relation to the assessment of scenarios and country risk. This work is focused on assessing the transition risk by country category based on quantitative data and qualitative analysis and aims to go beyond the contributions taken into account at the national level (NDC).\n- y Since 2019, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has also been a partner of the Fintech/Digital Finance Chair at Universit\u00e9 Paris Dauphine\n\nthrough a partnership agreement aimed at the emergence of an ecosystem combining research, teaching and entrepreneurship on the topic of digital /finance. This agreement also enhances relations between partners, academic institutions and students from Paris Dauphine.\n\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is also a partner of the HEC Foundation as part of /financing a/uni00A0 'Corporate Initiative'/uni00A0 training course dedicated  to  mergers  and  acquisitions.  Thanks  to  the Corporate lnitiative (M&A certi/ficate), HEC Paris students will acquire new skills and have access to new professional opportunities. HEC Paris's teaching will enrich exchanges within  an  innovative  and  unique  academic  ecosystem. The M&A certi/ficate is a one-month course, reserved for students at HEC Paris, covering all major aspects of M&A practices. This multidisciplinary training is taught by a faculty composed primarily of professionals and covers all major areas of M&A. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB will be able to submit a subject for re/flection on all general management topics for a student assignment.\n- y In 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB became a partner of the ' La Physique autrement ' Chair at Paris-Saclay University, which explores new ways of popularising and teaching physics, with a view to communicating with the general public.\n- y In 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole became a partner of the EDHEC Business School's 'Climate Change & Sustainable Finance' Master of Science programme. This course, developed jointly by the EDHEC Business School and Mines ParisTech, aims to train future /finance professionals on sustainable /finance objectives and integrate environmental, social and governance factors into their future decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

BUILDINGS AND CARBON FOOTPRINT MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\n## Certification of buildings\n\nThe Montrouge and Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines campuses again received the 'HQE Exploitation' label in 2021 with a very good level of performance. The Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines campus has had its EcoJardin label renewed.\n\n## O/ffsetting operational greenhouse gas emissions\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB offset 43,000 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent by cancelling VCU (Veri/fied Carbon Units) certi/ficates corresponding to dividends received in 2021 in connection with its investment in the Livelihoods Fund. The Livelihoods Carbon Fund gives investors carbon credits which have a major social impact and help to promote biodiversity. The Fund also /finances large scale projects in the areas of reforestation, sustainable agriculture and clean energy generation. These projects are implemented for and by deprived rural agricultural communities in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\nCerti/ficates were received for four projects in 2021:\n\n- y In Burkina Faso, with the NGO Tiipaalga, providing 30,000 families with improved wood stoves built by women themselves. Rolled out in 9 municipalities covering 222 villages in the north of the country, this project started in 2014 will save 40,000 tonnes of wood and avoid the emission of 689,000 tonnes of CO 2 into the atmosphere over 10 years. In addition to having a real impact on women's health by reducing exposure to toxic smoke and improving their daily lives, this project improves the status of women in their villages by putting them at the centre of the project. The 2,000 project participants bene/fit from self-managed microcredit that allows them to develop income-generating activities such as fattening sheep. The\n\n## 7.2. POLLUTION AND WASTE MANAGEMENT\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB does not generate signi/ficant pollution directly. The Bank nevertheless devotes substantial effort to waste recycling.\n\nSeveral actions have been implemented to reduce environmental impacts on the campuses of Montrouge and Saint-Quentin-enYvelines: zero phytosanitary products, eco-products for interior maintenance, and limitation of food waste (display, self-service for fruit and vegetables). Service providers were asked to reduce the amount of waste by prioritising wholesale purchases without overwrapping (HEQ approach and internal 'clean worksite' charter). Actions to raise awareness amongst employees are also regularly organised (energy saving, waste management).\n\nThe creation of waste sorting centres in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines has improved waste monitoring, sorting and recycling rates. In 2021, 78% of the 268 tonnes of waste collected were reused, recovered or recycled.\n\n- project also strengthens the food security of villagers in a region where malnutrition affects nearly 20% of the population.\n- y In Kenya, the 'Hifadhi' project, which means 'preserving' in Swahili, has made it possible to distribute 60,000 cooking stoves in three districts at the foot of Mount Kenya. These improved stoves are made from highly energy-ef/ficient local ceramic, allowing a signi/ficant 60% reduction in wood consumption compared with traditional stoves. This will save 13,000 tonnes of wood and avoid emissions of more than one million tonnes of CO 2 over the 10-year duration of the project.\n- y A similar project, launched in 2016 in the Huancavelica and Ayacucho regions in Peru, involves equipping 30,000 households with improved stoves, which will also save emissions of one million tonnes of CO 2 . The local NGO partner, ITYF, also provides communities with kits and training to raise awareness among families and children of health and hygiene issues (hand washing, consumption habits such as drinking clean water).\n- y In India, the NEWS (Nature Environment and Wildlife Society) NGO project involves planting 16,000 mangrove trees to rebuild mangrove swamps in the Sundarban Islands. Women are at the heart of the project: they have been trained by NEWS to manage nurseries used in the plantings that they themselves have made. The project thus helps to strengthen their status within the communities. Mangroves increase food security and villages' income by allowing populations of /fish, shell/fish and crustaceans to grow. They also improve safety for local populations by strengthening existing dikes. Finally, they will capture nearly 700,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases over the course of 20 years.\n\nCFM Indosuez has signed the Pacte pour la Transition \u00c9nerg\u00e9tique (Energy Transition Pact), which seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% between 1990 and 2030, and places the Principality of Monaco on a trajectory of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nThe Indosuez Wealth Management Group is also determined to reduce its direct impact on the environment and continues to take action to raise the awareness of its employees of eco-friendly behaviour and the implementation of resource management activities and recycling. In 2021, CFM Indosuez received a certi/ficate from the Principality of Monaco's Environment Department for participating in the European Week for Waste Reduction.\n\nIndosuez Wealth Management in Luxembourg signed the 'Zero Single Use Plastic' manifesto and has committed to implementing all the necessary actions to achieve this objective and the removal of products targeted by this manifesto, namely various single-use plastic objects. This initiative is now shared by the other Group entities.",

Committee, the Board of Directors reviewed the list of Independent Directors at its meeting of 8 February 2022. Based on the information available, there were /five Independent Directors at 31 December 2021: Mrs Dorland Clauzel, Mrs Gri, Mrs Maestre Cortadella, Mrs Noat and Mrs Pourre.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the proportion of Independent Directors on the Board of Directors was more than one third of the total number of Directors appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders. This complies with Recommendation 9.3 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, which states that at least one third of the Directors appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders, in companies whose capital is held by a majority shareholder, must be Independent Directors.\n\nThe composition of the Board of Directors re/flects the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's wish for Chairmen or Chief Executive Of/ficers of regional branches of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole to be represented on the Boards of Directors of some of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s subsidiaries.

Diversity within the Board of Directors and the governing bodies of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB\n\n## DIVERSITY WITHIN THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n- \u008a Balanced representation of men and women on the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Board of Directors had six female members, i.e. 42.85% of the Directors appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nIn accordance with Article 435[2 c] of EU Regulation No. 575/2013 and Article L. 511-99 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, the Appointments and Governance Committee reviewed the objective of a balance between the genders on the Board of Directors, and the policy required to achieve it.\n\nIt is recalled that pursuant to Article L. 225-17 of the French Commercial Code, there must be a balanced representation of\n\nwomen and men on the Board of Directors. In accordance with Article L. 225-18-1 of the French Commercial Code, this balanced representation on the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB must result in at least a 40% proportion for each sex.\n\nThe Appointments and Governance Committee also noted that the proportion of women among the Directors appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was 42.85%. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has an objective of maintaining this ratio at 40% minimum for each sex. The policy developed involves actively seeking suitable high-quality candidates - both men and women - in order to ensure that this ratio is respected if the members of the Board of Directors changes, whilst ensuring complementarity between the Directors' careers, experiences and skills.\n\n## \u008a Diversity policy within the Board of Directors\n\nIn keeping with its Social Responsibility policy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB aims to promote diversity at all levels, particularly among members of its Board of Directors.\n\n## SELECTION OF CANDIDATES FOR DIRECTORSHIPS\n\nTo this end, when considering new appointments, the Board of Directors takes diversity into account to ensure a suf/ficient range of qualities and skills allowing a variety of points of view relevant to the decision-making process.\n\nPriority  is  given  to  the  candidate's  ability  to  maintain  a complementarity in career paths, experiences and skills within the Board of Directors, in particular by taking into account their",

For this reason, the legal and regulatory requirements naturally lead to the selection of candidates with recognised skills and experience in accordance with the applicable texts.\n\nThe search for Director candidates is carried out by gathering suggestions from the members of the Board of Directors and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nThis approach aims to ensure that the composition of the Board of Directors re/flects the shareholding structure of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, which is 100% owned by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group companies, as well as to attract Directors with diversi/fied and complementary pro/files in terms of training, skills and professional experience while respecting the legal minimum proportions in terms of gender equality (40% representation for each sex) and the number of Independent Directors (one third of board members) pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n## DIRECTORS ELECTED BY EMPLOYEES AND ADVISORY MEMBERS OF THE BOARD\n\nThe Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, in accordance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-27 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, must also include at least two directors elected by employees and may appoint one or more non-voting advisory members of the Board of Directors in accordance with Article 17 of the articles of association (see Chapter 8 of the present Universal Registration Document). These provisions help to enhance diversity within the Board of Directors.\n\nJean-Guy Larrivi\u00e8re (management salaried employee body) and Abdel-Liacem Louahchi (non-management salaried employee body) were elected as Directors on 25 November 2020 to represent employees in accordance with Articles L. 225-27 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and Article 9 of the Company's Articles of Association (see Chapter 8 of the present Universal Registration Document).\n\n\u00c9mile Lafortune and Christian Rouchon were appointed as Advisory members of the board by the Board of Directors, on 4/uni00A0May 2020 and on 7 May 2019 respectively, for a period of three years each, in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of the Company's Articles of Association (see Chapter 8 of the Universal Registration Document) to assist the development of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's relations with the Regional Banks, particularly with regard to the monitoring of Mid-caps clients.\n\n## NATIONALITY OF DIRECTORS\n\nFifteen of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Directors are French nationals, and one Director is an Andorran national, opening up internationally the Board of Directors more international.\n\n## DIVERSITY WITHIN THE GOVERNING BODIES\n\nConvinced that diversity is a powerful driver of performance and innovation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has for several years now been following a proactive diversity policy so its corporate culture becomes more inclusive.\n\nTo identify the main issues and measure the effectiveness of its diversity policy, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB regularly analyses its gender distribution indicators within its management.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, women accounted for 43.6% of the global workforce and 32.6% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB managers. The Executive Committee and the Management Committee were made up of 9.1% and 18.8% women respectively.\n\nMoreover, in terms of gender diversity within the top 10% of high-level positions of responsibility, the results show that the feminisation of Circle 1, comprising 27 people, is 18.5%, and Circle 2, comprising 132 people, is 20.5%.\n\nFor several years, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been rolling out an action plan aimed at increasing the number of women sitting on its management bodies:\n\n- y The main areas of the professional gender equality agreement renewed in France in 2021 for a period of 3 years are: to ensure balanced job recruitment and equal pay, train employees in, and raise their awareness of, the principles of professional equality and non-discrimination, support all employees in the promotion of their careers with particular attention paid to women, to continue to offer support for women on their return to work after maternity leave and to promote paternity and childcare leave.\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB supports its female talent, both in France and abroad, through a range of leadership development programmes. The programmes' objectives are to provide women with the keys to strengthening their strategic positioning, developing their networks and progressing within management bodies.\n- y In 2017, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also launched its \"Corporate Mentoring Programme\" on a global scope, enabling Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's talents to be supported by members of the Executive Committees or Business Line and Country Management Committees. This experience-sharing programme's aim is to promote greater diversity within the teams. As such, since its launch, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has set itself gender equality targets when selecting mentees, ensuring that women represent more than 50% of the participants (to date, 99 employees have bene/fited from the/uni00A0Corporate Mentoring Programme, or 54% of mentees). In addition, each year female employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB are selected to participate in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's mentoring programme.\n- y Awareness-raising initiatives for all employees are also organised as part of Diversity Month, and throughout the year with the Diversity Academy. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's teams work closely with the 'Potenti'elles' network and the diversity promotion networks created at its various sites.\n\nTo supplement this action plan and build up a pool of women that may then increase the number of women on the Management Committee and the Executive Committee, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has set itself the objective of increasing the proportion of women within Circle 1 to 30% by 2024. To achieve this, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is committed to:\n\n- y Systematically including a woman in the candidates for management and Circle 1 or Circle 2 roles, it being speci/fied that, above, all, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB looks for candidates with the requisite experience and skills for the position to be /filled.\n- y Put in place succession plans for management and executive positions that incorporate diversity and equal opportunity objectives.\n- y Align all HR processes (recruitment, mobility, etc.) with these objectives.",

As a result of a special focus on diversity criteria, particularly gender diversity, 40% of identi/fied talents are women. In line with the objectives set by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB aims to achieve 50% women and 40% foreign nationals in this pool by the end of 2022.

Assessment of the expertise and functioning of the Board of Directors\n\n## ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL EXPERTISE OF THE DIRECTORS ARTICLE L.511-98 OF THE FRENCH MONETARY AND FINANCIAL CODE\n\nThe Appointments and Governance Committee carried out an assessment of the collective and individual expertise of Directors based on a self-assessment undertaken in the fourth quarter of  2021. In this regard, the directors were asked to assess themselves in /fifteen areas of expertise: /financial markets, legal and regulatory requirements, banking activities, strategic planning, risk management, internal audit, /financial accounting, bank governance, the interpretation of /financial information, information technology and security, corporate management, experience abroad, corporate social responsibility, climate and environmental risks, human resources/compensations.\n\nThe conclusions of this assessment, which were presented to the Board of Directors, reveal that all areas of expertise, both banking and non-banking, are covered.\n\nThe Board of Directors has signi/ficant expertise in the following areas:  Human  resources/Compensation,  Corporate  social responsibility, Corporate Management, Interpretation of /financial information, Bank Governance, Internal Audit, Risk Management, Strategic Planning, Banking Activity, Legal and Regulatory Framework, Financial Markets. By way of example:\n\n- y 13 Directors consider that they have signi/ficant expertise in the areas of 'Legal and Regulatory Framework' and 'Knowledge of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB';\n- y 11 Directors consider that they have signi/ficant expertise in the areas of 'Financial Markets' and 'Human Resources/ Compensation';\n- y 10 Directors consider that they have signi/ficant expertise in the areas of 'Risk Management', 'Governance' and 'Interpretation of Financial Information'.\n\nDirectors were also invited to provide their opinion on various issues, such as their understanding of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's business lines and challenges, potential con/flicts of interest, training requirements, their preparation for Board meetings, or the existence of any ongoing proceedings or judicial, administrative or disciplinary decisions that could call their integrity into question.\n\nThe directors did not declare any actual con/flicts of interest and no proceedings or decisions that might result in reputational risk. They all considered that they arrived well prepared for Board meetings.\n\n## ASSESSMENT OF THE FUNCTIONING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS - \u00a710 OF THE AFEPMEDEF CODE\n\nA self-assessment of the performance of the Board of Directors was conducted during 2021, based on a collective questionnaire consisting of 74 questions accessible for the /first time electronically by Board members. The questions concerned the organisation of the Board of Directors, its operation, its composition and the quality of relationships within it, the work of the various Committees of the Board of Directors, and the training and information provided for the Directors. The self-assessment was administered by the Appointments and Governance Committee and presented to the Board.\n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\nThe results obtained in 2021 were satisfactory and stable overall compared to those obtained in 2020.\n\nTransparency of information is recognised together with the completeness and density of the information transmitted.\n\nAs a result of the new questions that were asked, this selfassessment represented an opportunity for directors to share their expectations and proposals on improving the functioning of the Board of Directors and the quality of the discussions. Their feedback revealed some areas that required improvement. Accordingly, the Appointments and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors noted:\n\n- y a shared desire to open up the agenda of Board meetings to strategic issues, information on current projects or the competitive environment,\n- y converging expectations on the conduct of Board meetings to encourage discussions,\n- y a broadly shared view that remote meetings held as a result of the health crisis (Covid-19) were not always conducive to fruitful discussions.\n\n## 1.2.6.

Group on governance and compliance issues.\n\n## TRAINING PROVIDED TO ALL DIRECTORS\n\nIn addition to the programme established for new Directors, training measures for all Directors continued during the 2021 /financial year.\n\nA seminar for Directors, held in September 2021, provided an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the expectations of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's clients by meeting a client and improving their knowledge of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's activities and strategy. A technical training session on CSR/Sustainable Finance and\n\nCompliance was held on 2 November 2021.\n\nDirectors also bene/fit from permanent access to an e-learning programme offering various courses on the theme of compliance.\n\nIf judged opportune, a Director can receive individual training especially on taking up new functions on the Board of Directors or its Committees.",

Ethics, conflicts of interest, and privileged information\n\nIn accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the Board of Directors, in the performance of their duties, Directors, Advisory members of the board and members of the Executive Management are committed to respecting a number of rules, including the Rules of Procedure of the Board (see Article 3 partially reproduced below).\n\n## EXTRACT FROM THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, ARTICLE 3\n\n'Directors ensure that the principles and best corporate gov-\n\nernance practices set out in this article are complied with, in particular to promote the quality of the Board of Directors' work. The director, however appointed, must in all circumstances act\n\nin the Company's interests.\n\nWhen they take of/fice, and throughout their term of of/fice, the director must fully understand their rights and obligations. In particular, the director must be aware of and comply with the legal and regulatory provisions applicable to the Company and those relating to their position. The director must familiarise themselves with applicable governance codes and best practices, including the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Ethics Charter and the Code of Conduct, as well as the Company's own rules set out in its articles of association and the Board of Directors' rules of procedure. The Chairman of the Board shall ensure that the Directors are properly informed, and they must ensure that they have all the information they need to effectively participate in discussions on items included on the Board meeting's agenda or on any items included on the agenda of meetings of the Specialised Committees of the Board of which they are members. The Chairman of each Committee shall also ensure that all members of the Committee are sent the information they need to carry out their duties.\n\nThe director shall devote the necessary attention and time to their duties. They must attend all meetings of the Board and of Committees of which they are members, unless they are genuinely unable to do so.\n\nThe director endeavour to preserve, in all circumstances, their independence and freedom of judgement, decision and action. They must remain impartial and not let themselves be in/fluenced by any element outside the corporate interest, which it is their duty to defend.\n\nThey undertake to inform the Board of any change in their personal or professional situation that could call into question the conditions of their appointment relating in particular to their reputation, availability or independence of mind.\n\nThe director makes all recommendations they believe could improve the operating procedures of the Board. They endeavour, collectively with the other members of the Board, to ensure that the tasks of the Board of Directors are carried out ef/ficiently and smoothly.\n\nThey act in good faith and do not take any initiative that could harm the interests of the Company or other group entities. They alert the Board to any information in their possession that would not be in the interests of the Company. They are bound by a duty to express their questions and opinions. In the event of disagreement, they ensure that these are explicitly recorded in the minutes of the deliberations.\n\nIn addition, they inform the Board of any potential con/flict of interest situation, including potential ones, in which they could\n\nbe exposed directly or indirectly. They shall not take part in the discussions or vote on the items in question.\n\nIn general, the director is bound by the obligations applicable to them in accordance with the French Monetary and Financial Code and the General Regulation of the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers, AMF), notably regarding the use and disclosure of con/fidential and/ or privileged information and con/flicts of interest.\n\nThe director respects the total con/fidentiality of the information they receive, or which is exchanged during the discussions in which they participate within the framework of the Board of Directors or its Committees, as well as the con/fidentiality of the decisions taken.\n\nFor the record, members of the Board of Directors must abstain from using privileged information, on their own behalf or on behalf of others, either directly or indirectly, to acquire or sell, or attempt to acquire or sell /financial instruments to which this information relates as long as the information has not been made public.\n\nIn particular, if in the exercise of their of/fice as Director they obtain privileged information about the Company, they are prohibited from using such information to carry out, or have a third party carry out, any transactions on the Company's /financial instruments.\n\nSince the director holds information on the /financial results of the Company and, consequently, indirectly on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., in accordance with the rules of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, they must limit any transactions in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. securities to each six-week period following the publication of the annual, half-yearly and quarterly results, as long as they are not privy to any inside information during these periods.\n\nIn addition, the Company can prohibit trading in any Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. /financial instruments, including during authorised periods, as well as in any /financial instruments that would be the subject of privileged information within the framework of the meetings of the Board of Directors or one of its Committees (strategic operations, acquisition operations, creation of joint ventures, etc.).\n\nThe director is required to declare to the Con/flicts Management Group within the Compliance Department of the Company, on behalf of themselves and all persons closely related to them, all transactions carried out on any /financial instruments, except those issued by or linked to the Company or to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., that they believe may create a potential con/flict of interest or contain con/fidential information that may be quali/fied as privileged and acquired in the course of their duties as a Director of the Company.\n\nMoreover, when the director is no longer in a position to perform their duties in accordance with the provisions of this article due to their own action or for any other reason including the rules of the Company in which they carry out their duties, they must inform the Chairman of the Board of Directors, seek solutions to remedy the situation and, failing that, take the personal consequences from carrying out their duties.'\n\n## EXTRACT FROM THE RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, ARTICLE 4\n\n'[...] Members of the Executive management and Advisory members of the board commit to complying the provisions of CACIB rules and regulations that are applicable to them, including the provisions related to con/flicts of interest or privileged/con/fidential information of which they would be aware.'",

Regional Banks) with which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has or could have commercial relationships. This may be a source of potential con/flicts of interest. The composition of the Board of Directors is based on the desire to re/flect the capital structure of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, which is 100% controlled by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, as well as the diversity objectives de/fined by the Board of Directors. For your information Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is af/filiated with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network and that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. acts as a central entity in accordance with the provisions of article L. 511-31 of the Monetary and Financial Code.\n\nIn addition, they inform the Board of Directors of any potential con/flict of interest situation, including potential ones, in which they could be exposed directly or indirectly.

COMPENSATION POLICY\n\n## 1.4.1.  General principle of the compensation policy\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has established a responsible compensation\n\npolicy that aims to re/flect its values while respecting the interests of all the stakeholders, including employees, clients and shareholders. In light of the speci/fic characteristics of its business lines, its legal entities, and national and international legislation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has developed a compensation policy which is internally consistent, gender neutral, and externally competitive on its reference markets, to ensure the bank can attract and retain the talents it needs. Benchmarking with other /financial institutions is regularly carried out for this purpose.\n\nCompensation awards, particularly variable ones, aim to reward individual and group performance over time while promoting sound and effective risk management.\n\n## 1.3.4.  Transactions carried out on the securities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (Art. L. 621-18-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code)\n\nGiven that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's shares are not listed on a regulated market, the provisions of Article L. 621-18-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code regarding this category of securities are not applicable to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nFor 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has no knowledge of the existence of transactions conducted on their own account by the persons referred to in Article L. 621-18-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code and relating to debt securities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB or related derivatives or other /financial instruments.\n\nInformation on the ownership structure at 31 December 2021 is provided in Note 6.17 to the consolidated /financial statements (see section 3 of Chapter 6 \"Consolidated /financial statements at 31 december 2021\")\n\n## 1.3.5.

Therefore, the Compensation Policy is designed to avoid con/flicts of interest in accordance and, in particular, to ensure that employees do not favour their own or Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's interests to the detriment of the best interests of the clients. The compensation policy of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB promotes sound risk management in compliance with the bank's risk appetite statement and framework.\n\nThe compensation policy of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is elaborated within a highly regulated framework speci/fic to the banking sector.

Where applicable, adjustments need to be discussed between Head of the entity (subsidiary, branch or representative of/fice), control functions, entity Head of HR and the HR team of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nThis compensation policy was approved by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Board of Directors' meeting of February 8 th 2022.\n\n## 1.4.2. Total compensation\n\nThe total compensation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's employees is made up of the following components:\n\n- y Fixed compensation;\n- y Annual variable individual compensation;\n- y Collective variable compensation;\n- y Long-term variable compensation;\n- y Supplementary pension and health insurance plans; and\n- y Bene/fits in kind.\n\nAn employee may be eligible to all or some of these elements, depending their responsibilities, skills, performance and location.\n\nAttribution of compensation elements is based on internal equity and on external market references, and also takes into account collective and individual qualitative and quantitative performance.\n\nThe qualitative aspect of performance includes notably the evaluation done by the control functions; in case of an incident related to compliance with rules and procedures and risk limits, the attribution of remuneration elements takes it into account. The impact on remuneration in case of conduct risk is reviewed and validated on annual basis by the General Direction.\n\n## A - FIXED COMPENSATION\n\nFixed compensation rewards employees for the responsibilities entrusted to them, as well as for the competencies used to exercise these responsibilities, in a manner that is consistent with the speci/ficities of each business line in their local market.\n\nThese responsibilities are de/fined by a remit and contributions, a level within the organization and expected skills and experience.\n\nFixed compensation is set at a suf/ficient level to allow for variable compensation not to be paid in the case of underperformance.\n\nFixed compensation is reviewed in line with the evolution of the employees' responsibilities and with the development of skills required for the role, appreciated within the framework of annual performance appraisal based on objectives achievement and ful/filment of permanent responsibilities of a position.\n\nWhen an employee takes a new position, /fixed compensation is determined taking into account the change of responsibilities.\n\nFixed compensation includes base salary, as well as of any other recurrent compensation components not linked to performance.\n\n## B -  ANNUAL INDIVIDUAL VARIABLE COMPENSATION\n\nVariable compensation is directly linked to individual and collective annual performance. Individual performance is assessed based on the achievement of qualitative and quantitative objectives de/fined at the beginning of each performance year, and includes an assessment of whether the employee acted in the clients' best interests. More generally, compliance with internal rules and procedures and with the applicable legislation is a key factor of assessment of the employee's performance.\n\nCollective performance is based on the determination of a /firmwide envelope which is then broken down by business line. This envelope is de/fined in a way which does not limit the capacity of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB to strengthen its equity capital as required. It takes into account all risks, including liquidity risk, cost of capital, in line with regulatory principles.\n\nVariable compensation includes bonus, as well as of any other individual compensation component linked to performance, including guaranteed variable compensation.\n\n## \u008a 1 - Definition of variable envelopes\n\nIn order to de/fine its global variable compensation envelope, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses a multi-criteria approach which is based on the analysis of performance and of risks, control objectives and /financial situation, including maintaining a sound capital base and liquidity.\n\nThe variable remuneration envelope is de/fined taking into account all the performance and risks indicators, including:\n\n- y Revenue,\n- y Direct and indirect expenses,\n- y Cost of risk,\n- y Cost of capital,\n\nvia an analysis of the evolution of several aggregate indicators, such as Gross Operating Income, Net Result (Group share), Contribution and Payout ratio.\n\nThe Contribution is de/fined by the following formula, based on standard accounting de/finitions:\n\nNet Banking Income (NBI) - direct and indirect expenses excluding bonuses - cost of risk - cost of capital before taxes\n\n- y NBI is calculated net of liquidity cost.\n- y The cost of risk is understood to be the provisions for default.\n- y The cost of capital, allowing to take into account the return on equity speci/fic to a business line, is calculated by applying the following formula:\n- y Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) X Supply rate of capital (Tier 1 ratio target) X \u00df (the coef/ficient that measures the market risk of a business line and that allows for an adjustment of the Tier 1 ratio according to the capital requirement that is linked to the business line).\n\nThe Payout ratio corresponds to the ratio between the variable compensation envelope and the amount of Contribution.\n\nThe global envelope de/fined as above is then split between business lines, control and support functions of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, depending on criteria relevant for each function or team, de/fined and documented in a detailed manner, and linked to:\n\n- y Quantitative performance, including creation and development of long-term competitive advantage for the Group,\n- y Management of underlying risks,\n- y Qualitative performance of a business line or function,",

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB veri/fies that attribution of variable compensation is compatible with maintaining a sound capital base, and that the bank meets the combined buffer requirement (Art.141 p.2 of the European Directive 2013/36/UE of 26 June 2013).\n\n## \u008a 2 - Individual bonus award\n\nIndividual bonuses are awarded within envelopes attributed by business line or support function; individual attribution by employee is discretionary and decided by the management, taking into account a global evaluation of individual and collective performance, both quantitative and qualitative.\n\nTo avoid a situation of a con/flict of interest, or failure of an employee to take into account the interests of a client, there exists no direct and automatic link between the commercial and /financial results of an employee and their variable compensation.\n\nIndividual attribution of variable compensation takes into account eventual cases of non-compliance with rules and procedures and risk limits, as identi/fied within the framework of Conduct risk evaluation process in place in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nIn certain cases, other elements of variable compensation may be awarded in addition to the individual bonus, as is the case for Senior executives.\n\n## \u008a 3 - Guaranteed variable compensation\n\nGuaranteed variable remuneration is exceptional, and can only be attributed if the bank has a sound and strong capital base. The amount of variable compensation may be guaranteed in the context of external recruitment or a retention. Guaranteed variable compensation can take the form of 'guaranteed bonus', 'sign-on bonus', or 'retention bonus'.\n\nIn the context of external recruitment, variable remuneration guarantee cannot be extended for longer than the /first year of employment.\n\nRetention bonuses may be awarded for a pre-determined period and under speci/fic circumstances (such as restructuring, closure or transfer of activity).\n\nAttribution of guaranteed variable remuneration is subject to the payment conditions applicable for the performance year, and may entail deferral of a part of the remuneration.\n\n## \u008a 4 - Buy-out of deferred variable compensation\n\nIn case of an external recruitment, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB may compensate the loss of unvested deferred variable attributed by the previous employer and forfeited following a termination of the labour contract.\n\n## \u008a 5 - Ratio between fixed and variable remuneration\n\nFor the staff identi/fied as regulated in the sense of Directive 2019/878/UE of the European Parliament and the Council of 20 May 2019, the maximum attributable variable remuneration for the performance year is equal to the employee's /fixed compensation. The maximum ratio may be increased to 200% of the /fixed compensation by the decision of the General Shareholders Meeting. In alignment with the regulated staff, the variable of all other employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is limited at twice the amount of their /fixed compensation.\n\n## \u008a 6 - Payment of the variable remuneration\n\nIn order to align the interests of all employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB with the bank's long-term objectives, and to ensure sound and prudent risk management, a part of the variable compensation of\n\nall employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is deferred over time, if above a threshold.\n\n- (i) The  rules  and  conditions  for  payment  of  the  variable compensation of the regulated staff are described in Chapter III of the Policy.\n- (ii)   For non-regulated staff, the variable remuneration is split into vested part and part deferred over three years.\n\nThe deferred part vests by equal instalments each year: 1/3 in year Y+1, 1/3 in year Y+2 and 1/3 in year Y +3 where the performance year is Y, provided the vesting conditions are met:\n\n- y Performance condition;\n- y Presence condition;\n- y Compliance with internal rules and risk limits.\n\nThe deferred variable compensation is attributed in the form of cash, 50% of which is indexed at the share price of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A..\n\n- (i) If, within /five years after payment of the variable compensation, it is discovered that an employee: (i) participated in, or was responsible for, or contributed to a signi/ficant loss for Credit Agricole or its clients; or (ii) was responsible of a signi/ficant breach of internal or external rules or procedures, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB reserves the right to demand repayment or 'clawback' of all or part of the amounts paid, subject to enforceability under applicable local law.\n- (ii)   The employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB are not authorised to transfer the downside risks of variable remuneration to another party through hedging or any type of insurance to undermine the risk alignment effects embedded in their remuneration arrangements.\n\n## \u008a 7 - Variable compensation of employees whose activities are subject to a mandate (French Banking Law, Volcker rule, etc.)\n\nVariable compensation is awarded so as not to reward or encourage prohibited trading activities, but may reward the generation of revenue or the supply of services to clients. Any award must comply with internal policies and procedures, including but not limited to the Volcker rule compliance manual.\n\nIndividual performance bonuses are based on a number of factors including, but not limited to an assessment of the attainment of pre-de/fined individual and collective targets, which are set for employees in strict compliance with the terms of the mandate they manage.\n\nQuarterly controls performed by the Risk and Permanent Control Division and the Global Market Division are used to verify the correct application of the mandates.\n\nDuring the annual appraisal, managers assess employees' performance based on objectives set in the beginning of the performance year, including compliance with trading mandates. The appraisal takes into account cases of breach of internal rules and procedures, and in particular non-compliance with mandates.\n\n## \u008a 8 - Remuneration of employees participating in providing services to clients\n\nThe remuneration policy of employees involved in the provision of services to clients aims to encourage responsible business conduct, fair treatment of clients as well as to avoid con/flict of interest in the relationships with clients. Notably, the annual performance appraisal and/or the remuneration awarded to employees take into account the inion of the control functions, in case of an incident related to provision of services to clients.",

        "page_content": "## \u008a 9 - Variable compensation of the control functions\n\nIn order to prevent potential con/flict of interests, the compensation of the control functions is de/fined independently of the compensation of the employees of the business lines for which they validate or review the operations. The objectives set for the control functions and the budgets used to determine their variable compensation must not take into account the criteria related to the results and economic performance of the business area that they control. Their variable compensation envelope is de/fined according to market practices.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Compensation Committee, as part of its remits, ensures compliance with the principles of determining the compensation of the Heads of risk and compliance.\n\n## C - COLLECTIVE VARIABLE COMPENSATION\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has been implementing for many years a policy aiming to involve the employees collectively in the results and the performance of the bank. For this purpose, a collective variable compensation system (discretionary and mandatory pro/fit sharing) was set up in France. Similar arrangements aiming to share the bank results with all members of staff may be also set up in the international entities.\n\n## D - LONG-TERM VARIABLE COMPENSATION\n\nThis variable compensation component federates, motivates and increases loyalty. It complements the annual variable compensation mechanism by rewarding the long-term collective performance of the group.\n\nIt consists of several systems that are differentiated according to the level of responsibility in the organization:\n\n- y 'Employee' shareholding, which is open to all employees subject to conditions de/fined by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.;\n- y Long-term compensation in share-linked cash and/or cash subject to performance conditions based on economic, /financial and social criteria de/fined in line with the long-term strategy of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group. It is reserved for Group senior and key executives.\n\n## E - PENSION AND HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS\n\nDepending on the country and the relevant market practices, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB undertakes to provide its employees with social security coverage that is designed to:\n\n- y Assist with setting up retirement income or savings;\n- y Provide a reasonable level of social security coverage for employees and their family.\n\nThese bene/fits are a routine part of the remuneration packages, put in place for all employees of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB including its international entities. Benefits are subject to collective arrangements, complementing the mandatory regimes, speci/fic to each country where a Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB entity is located.\n\n## F - BENEFITS IN KIND\n\nIn certain cases, the total compensation also includes bene/fits in kind. This includes notably:\n\n- y Providing a company car depending on the employee's level of responsibility;\n- y Bene/fits designed to cover the difference in the cost of living for expatriate populations.\n\nDepending on country, these bene/fits may be complemented by other arrangements designed to provide a simulating working environment and ensure a healthy work-life balance.\n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS' REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 1.4.3.  Governance of compensation policy\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB compensation policy is reviewed annually by the Executive Management, following a proposal by the Human Resources Division and in accordance with the main guidelines of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group compensation policy. This policy is also reviewed by the Control Functions. The compensation policy is approved by the Board of Directors, on the basis of a recommendation by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nIn compliance with the principles of the Group policy, the Human Resources Division associates the control functions with the consideration of the risks in the compensation management, notably in identifying the regulated population, compliance with the regulatory norms and the control of the conduct risk.  In addition, as for all the support functions, the variable compensation envelopes of the control functions are de/fined on the basis of objectives speci/fic for the control functions, and independent of the results of the business areas they control.\n\nThe implementation of the compensation policy is subject to annual control of the Group Internal audit.\n\n## 1.4.4.  Remuneration of identified sta/ff\n\nIn line with the regulations applicable to the credit institutions and investment /firms, and in consistency with the general principles of the Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB identi/fies its risk takers, i.e. employees whose professional activities have a signi/ficant impact on the risk pro/file of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nThe identi/fication of risk takers at the level of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is compliant with Article 92 of Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and the Council of 26 June 2013, amended by Directive (EU) 2019/878 of 20 May 2019 (hereafter referred to as 'CRD V'). In the countries where national regulators enforce similar requirements, based on the Guidelines of the Financial Stability Board, the entities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also apply the local remuneration requirements.\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to risk takers aims to promote sound and ef/ficient risk management, and does not encourage risktaking above the limit which is considered acceptable for the bank.\n\n## A - SCOPE OF APPLICATION\n\nThe identi/fication of employees considered as risk takers in the sense of CRD V Directive is a joint process between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., and between the Human Resources department and the control functions of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. This process is subject to annual review.\n\nIn Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, in application of Delegated Regulation of the European Commission (EU) 2021/923 of 25 March 2021, the following categories of personnel are considered identi/fied:\n\n- y Members of the Management body and senior management,\n- y Employees with managerial responsibility over the control functions or material business units,\n- y Heads of key business lines,\n- y Heads of key support functions,\n- y Employees with authority to take decisions on signi/ficant credit risk exposures or trading book transactions,\n- y Employees entitled to signi/ficant remuneration for the preceding performance year,\n- y Any other employee considered as having a signi/ficant impact on the risk pro/file of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, as identi/fied by Risk and Permanent Control, Compliance and Human Resources divisions, and validated by the senior management.",

The Shareholders Meeting can approve a higher maximum ratio, provided that the total variable component does not exceed 200% of each employee's /fixed compensation. The Shareholders Meeting of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB of May 4th 2020 voted a resolution establishing the maximum ratio between the variable and /fixed compensation at 200% for the remuneration attributed for 2020 onwards, until a new decision is voted by the Shareholders Meeting.\n- (iv)   When variable compensation is above 50/uni00A0000 EUR or above 1/3 of total compensation, a part of it representing 40% to 60% is deferred over 4 to 5 years, and is vested on prorata basis in equal instalments, the vesting being subject to performance, presence and risk management conditions. If a national competent authority imposes stricter proportionality criteria, the stricter rules apply to the risk takers within the scope of the national regulation.\n- (v) 50% of the variable compensation is attributed in the form of /financial instruments (indexed on the share of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.). The attribution of 50% in the form of instruments applies both to the vested part and to each instalment of the deferred part of variable compensation.\n\nVesting of variable compensation attributed in the form of /financial instruments is followed by a retention period of six months. It is prohibited for the employees to hedge or use any form of insurance which could undermine the risk alignment effects embedded in the compensation arrangements.\n\nIf during the /five years following the payment of a deferral instalment, the bank discovers that the employee: (i) is responsible for or contributed to actions that led to signi/ficant losses for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB or its clients, or (ii) committed a breach of internal or external rules and procedures, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB reserves the right, subject to feasibility under the applicable local labour legislation, to claw back all or part of the amount already paid to the employee.\n\n## 1.4.5. Remuneration of Senior management\n\nThe compensation policy applicable to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's executive directors is part of the compensation policy for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. senior management.\n\n## A - GENERAL PRINCIPLES\n\nThe compensation policy for the members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Executive Management is approved by the Board of Directors on the basis of a proposal by the Remuneration Committee. This policy is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors in order to take into account changes in the regulatory environment and external market context.\n\nIt is consistent with the compensation policy for the senior executives of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group. This principle allows to bring the Group's senior management together around common and shared criteria.\n\nIn addition, the compensation of members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Executive Management is compliant with:\n\n- y The regulatory framework de/fined by the Monetary and Financial Code and the Ordinance of 3 November 2014 on internal control in credit institutions and investment /firms, which transposes into French law the European provisions on the compensation of identi/fied staff, which includes executive directors;\n- y The recommendations and principles of the Corporate Governance Code for listed companies (the 'AFEP/MEDEF Code').\n\nThe Board of Directors reviews annually the compensation components for members of the Executive Management, following a proposal of the Remuneration Committee, with the principal objective of recognizing long-term performance.\n\n## B - FIXED COMPENSATION\n\nBased on a proposal of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Remuneration Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  establishes  the  fixed compensation of the members of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Executive Management, taking into account:\n\n- y The scope of activities supervised;\n- y Market practice and compensation level for similar roles. At the Group level, surveys are conducted annually with the assistance of specialised /firms regarding the positioning of the compensation of the bank's executive directors compared to other /firms in the /financial sector in order to ensure the consistency of the compensation principles and levels.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code (Section 23.2.2), the /fixed compensation of executive directors is reviewed only at fairly lengthy intervals, unless a change in a person's scope of supervision justi/fies a review of their /fixed compensation.\n\nWhen a new Executive Corporate Of/ficer is appointed, his or her compensation will be determined by the Board of Directors, either in accordance with the principles and criteria approved by the General Meeting or in accordance with the existing practices for of/ficers exercising similar functions, adapted where applicable when the person takes up new functions or a new of/fice with no equivalent in respect of the preceding period.",

The Board of Directors reviews and, if appropriate, approves the /financial and non-/financial criteria proposed by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nPerformance bonus may reach the target level if all the /financial and non-/financial objectives are achieved, and may reach the maximum level in case of exceptional performance. The target and maximum levels are expressed as a percentage of the /fixed salary and are de/fined by the Board of Directors for each member of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Executive Management.\n\nA Long Term Incentive for Group Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. senior executives may complement the performance bonus, to support a sustainable performance beyond /financial results and strengthen the link between performance and compensation, notably including societal impact.

Each criterion accounts for one-third of the vesting. For each year, the\n\npercentage vested is the average percentage vested for each criterion, the average being capped at 100%.\n\nThe non-deferred part of the annual variable compensation, representing 60% to 40% of total variable, is paid in part at the time of award (in March) and in part after a six months' retention period.

OVERVIEW OF CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE CIB GROUP'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Changes to accounting policies\n\nPursuant to EC Regulation No. 1606/2002, the consolidated /financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS/ IFRS and IFRIC applicable at 31 December 2021 and as adopted by the European Union (carve-out version), by using certain exceptions in the application of IAS 39 on macro-hedge accounting.\n\nThe standards and interpretations are the same as those applied and described in the Group's /financial statements at 31 December 2020.\n\nThey have been supplemented by the provisions of those IFRS as endorsed by the European Union at 31 December 2021 and that must be applied in 2021 for the /first time.\n\n## Changes in consolidation scope\n\nChanges in scope between 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021 were as follows:\n\n## COMPANIES FIRST TIME CONSOLIDATED IN 2021\n\nThe following companies entered the scope of consolidation:\n\n- y Credit Agricole CIB Arabia Financial Company\n- y CA Indosuez Wealth (Europe) Italy Branch\n\n## COMPANIES DECONSOLIDATED IN 2021\n\nThe following companies went out of the scope of consolidation:\n\n- y Shark FCC\n- y Tsubaki ON\n- y Tsubaki OFF\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Alg\u00e9rie\n- y Merisma (Universal transmission of Assets)\n- y CA Indosuez Wealth Group (Merger by CA Indosuez)\n- y CA Indosuez Wealth Italy S.P.A\n\n## 1.2. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT\n\n## 2021 RETROSPECTIVE\n\nGlobal economic performance continued to be largely conditioned by the spread of the virus and the health response (roll-out of vaccination, containment strategy), the structure of the economies (relative weight of industry and services, including tourism), and the /fiscal and monetary counter-offensive (extent of support for activity). As with the recessions experienced in 2020, recovery paths have remained uneven. China, boosted by its foreign trade and growing at a rate of 8.1%, the United States and then the Eurozone, which posted very good performances, continued to be contrasted with the half-hearted recoveries or fragile rebounds of many emerging countries, in which the trend towards fragmentation was clearly confirmed.\n\nMoreover, inflation , long forgotten, has returned to the forefront. The very sharp acceleration was the result of a combination of several factors: upstream pressures with strong increases in commodity prices and bottlenecks (1) , downstream pressures from the strong rebound in household consumption supported by substantial /financial aid and high savings inherited from the 2020 crisis, and base effects after very low in/flation in 2020. While supply remained limited at the end of the crisis (lack of labour\n\nor goods), the normalisation of demand led to price increases in speci/fic sectors, particularly those previously heavily penalised by the pandemic (hotels, restaurants or cars, for example).\n\nIn the United States, after Donald Trump's US$2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the largest support plan in US history, and the US$900 billion December plan (a total of about 14% of GDP), Joe Biden's stimulus package (the American Rescue Plan) totalling $1.9 trillion, or about 9% of GDP, was rolled out in March. Households, mainly those with low incomes, were the main bene/ficiaries. Thanks to the strong recovery in consumption, further boosted by the rapid fall in unemployment, growth has stood at 5.7% in 2021. In December, overall year-on-year in/flation reached 7% (the /first time this has happened since the early 1980s), with core in/flation at 5.5%, its highest level since the early 1990s. In addition to the impact of energy and industrial input prices, some speci/fic items (e.g. new cars, but especially used cars) driven by strong demand contributed to the acceleration of in/flation.\n\nThe Eurozone has withstood the latest lockdown phases by limiting the negative effects to the sectors subject to targeted restrictive measures and by bene/fiting from the reactivation of its manufacturing sector. A pleasant surprise came from strong\n\n(1)  As prices can be very volatile, it is preferable to use average annual prices. Between 2020 and 2021, the price of oil (Brent) rose by almost 70%, while the price of gas in Europe quadrupled. The CRB index has risen by 43%. Iron and copper prices rose by 46% and 51% respectively. Food prices were not spared, as evidenced by the 23% rise in wheat prices. Finally, the Baltic Dry Index almost tripled, re/flecting the extremely high level of tension in maritime traf/fic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

After contracting by 6.5% in 2020, GDP is expected to grow by 5.2% in 2021. While excess demand and wage acceleration are much less evident than in the United States, headline in/flation nevertheless picked up signi/ficantly to 5% yearon-year in December, while core in/flation rose less vigorously (2.6%).\n\nAfter suffering an 8% recession in 2020, France started a strong recovery in the second half of 2020 and continued into 2021. The new wave of infections and the spread of the Omicron variant raised new fears about the strength of the recovery in the short term, but the absence of very restrictive measures made it possible to limit the impact. After a marked mechanical rebound in the third quarter, growth slowed in the fourth quarter, while remaining sustained, allowing GDP to rise by 7% in 2021. Driven by the rise in commodity prices (especially energy, which accounts for more than half of the price increase), in/flation accelerated to 2.8% over 12 months in December (1.6% on average).\n\nDespite a shift in the Federal Reserve's rhetoric suggesting a more rapid normalisation of its monetary policy, an accommodative monetary stance was maintained in both the United States and the Eurozone.\n\nIn the United States , at the start of the year, Jerome Powell emphasised the still extremely weakened nature of the labour market and the low employment rate compared to its pre-crisis level. However, concerns gradually shifted from growth to in/flation which, after being considered temporary, became more worrying. At the same time, the Fed announced its strategy of gradual normalisation: gradual reduction of its monthly asset purchases (US$120 billion in force at the time) or tapering and then, without any pre-established timetable, raising its key rate (target range for the Fed Funds rate [0%, 0.25%]).\n\nDuring its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting in June, the Fed made its /first change, which consisted of a rise in its forecasts for the Fed Funds rate, combined with an upward revision of growth and in/flation. The Fed prepared the markets by saying it would spell out in November just how it would carry on its tapering program. In early November the Fed announced it would cut back its monthly purchases by $15 billion, suggesting these would come to an end in June 2022, though the pace of tapering might be adjusted. Finally, the mid December meeting of the FOMC con/firmed that monetary normalisation would go faster still, with tapering occurring at double speed and thus ending in March 2022. The reasons given for the speed-up were the breadth of the in/flation and the quick progress made towards full employment, despite a few persistent disappointments in the participation rate. Jerome Powell also stated that a rate rise was possible before full employment is reached, should in/flationary pressures remain concerning. Moreover, the Dot Plot (1) signalled a more aggressive upward path for the key rate.\n\nIn the eurozone , while the ECB in June also acknowledged the /firming taking place and revised upward its growth and in/flation forecasts, it reiterated the very accommodative and /flexible orientation of its monetary policy. In December the ECB restated its growth and in/flation scenario and presented its monetary strategy.\n\nThe ECB revised its in/flation forecast for 2022 upward (from 1.7% to 3.2%), though much more moderately for 2023 (from 1.5% to 1.8%), and its 2024 projection of 1.8% remains lower than the 2% target. The ECB seems to be saying that in/flation will be transitory, largely caused by supply issues having limited effect on core in/flation (at 1.9% in 2022 and 1.7% in 2023.) The negative impact on growth (revised downward from 4.6% to 4.2% in 2022) is presumed to be moderate and brief. In/flation should temporarily erode purchasing power without derailing growth, which is revised upward to 2.9% in 2023.\n\nIn terms of strategy, the ECB stated that the removal of emergency support would be accompanied by signi/ficant yet /flexible attention to the sovereigns market. The point there is to prevent, on one hand, an over-steepening of the yield curve and on the other, any risk of eurozone fragmentation (2) The ECB reaf/firmed that before its key rate is raised, three conditions must be met: (1) In/flation has to reach the 2% target well before the ECB's forecasting horizon; (2) this target must be reached lastingly, out to the forecasting horizon; and (3) the progress achieved on core in/flation must be suf/ficiently great that it is compatible with stabilising in/flation to its medium-term target level. Respecting the most current forecasts, these conditions have not been met.\n\nBond markets have kept step with a few major themes: an enthusiastic first quarter buoyed by reflation trading, a gloomier second quarter gripped by the reality of the pandemic, and a second half displaying lively growth yet also distinctly more troubling inflation, fuelling a faster monetary normalisation scenario in the U.S.\n\nIn the United States , the two-year interest rates (3) kept pace with the monetary scenario.  They stayed pegged to a low level (0.17% on average) and only started up, slowly, once monetary tightening was spoken of (September) and then more /firmly with the acceleration of tapering late in the year, which they /finished at 0.70%, for a rise on the year of 60 basis points. With re/flation trading, prompted by more sustained expectations for growth and in/flation, increasing vaccination rates and better-than-expected economic data, long rates rose sharply in the United States, and this rise spread into the eurozone. The U.S. 10-year rate, near 0.90% at the start of the year, started to climb and peaked at end-March near 1.75%. Bad news on the public health front then tempered the enthusiasm, and the bond markets took a more conservative position. After that, starting in September, the idea that accelerating in/flation would cause monetary tightening in the U.S. to be more energetic than expected once again pushed interest rates higher. The U.S.10-Year rate ended the year at 1.50%, or a rise on the year of 60 basis points, was not impacted by the attention focused by the markets on in/flation and monetary normalisation.\n\nIn the eurozone , in sympathy with the /first phase of recovery by the U.S. rates, the German 10-year rate (the Bund) rose from nearly -0.60% at 1 January to -0.10% in May. While the Fed proved to be tolerant with respect to the tightening of /financing conditions, a synonym of improvement in economic prospects, the ECB was quick to signal that this tightening was premature and unjusti/fied. The Bund then headed downward. Whilst the German 2-year rate remained virtually level at -0.60% at end-2021 vs. -0.70% at end-2020, the Bund closed the year at -0.30%, or a rise on the year of 40 basis points. As a result of the ECB's statements about its process of purchasing sovereign securities,",

Though the prospect of elections in France does not seem to have affected the spread at this point, the Italian spread has been negatively impacted since November by their coming presidential elections.\n\nThe equity markets , still buoyed by the accommodative /financing conditions, despite the normalisations to come, and by favourable\n\ngrowth prospects, at least in developed countries, have risen nicely, with the average annual rise in the S&P 500, Eurostoxx/uni00A050 and CAC 40/uni00A0indices/uni00A0up +32%, +23%, +27%, respectively. Lastly, after resisting stoutly, the euro fell against the dollar given that monetary normalisation was further along in the U.S. than in Europe. The euro gained 3.6% against the dollar on average but fell late in the year (at 1.14 in December 2021, it losts nearly 7% on the year).\n\n## 1.3.

French GDP grew by 7% in 2021, a 52-year high. In December 2021, in/flation was at its highest level in many years, with 5% in Europe, for example, a 25-year high, amid the sentiment that in/flation would be more sustainable than expected. The economy is growing, with a level of interest rates and liquidity in the system considered too low and too high for liquidity.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, CIB's underlying revenues stood at \u20ac5,109 million in 2021, up +1% at current exchange rates and +2% at current exchange rates compared to 2020. The increase in revenues came from the solid performance of Corporate Banking (+9% at current exchange rates). Capital market banking revenues were down -8% at current exchange rates, mainly due to lower overall customer demand than in 2020. The maintenance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's leading positions in a number of sectors (#1 Syndication France /uni00A0 (1) , #3 EMEA Syndication /uni00A0 (2) , #4/uni00A0 global in Green, Social and Sustainability Bonds /uni00A0 (3) , #5 worldwide on All Bonds in EUR /uni00A0  (4) and #8 worldwide on All Corporate Bonds\n\n- (1) Source: Re/finitiv\n- (2) Source: Re/finitiv R17\n\n(4) Source: Re/finitiv N1\n\n- (5) Source: Re/finitiv N8\n\nin EUR (5) illustrates the intensi/fication of its focus on customer relationships initiated during the crisis.\n\nOperating expenses amounted to -\u20ac2,996 million in 2021, up +7% at current exchange rates (+7% at constant exchange rates). This increase is mainly linked to the larger contribution to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF), which reached \u20ac295 million in 2021 compared with \u20ac232 million in 2020. Excluding the SRF, operating expenses increased +4% in line with the organic growth strategy. IT investments and staff growth are linked to the development of business line initiatives and the strengthening of support functions. Excluding the SRF, the underlying CIB cost/income ratio came out at 52.9% in 2021, compared to 50.8% in 2020. Gross operating income thus stood at \u20ac2,113 million, compared with \u20ac2,265 million in 2020, down -7%.\n\nCIB's cost of risk was down signi/ficantly, compared to 2020 in a crisis situation. Its net allowance stood at -\u20ac49 million in 2021 compared to -\u20ac824 million in 2020.\n\nNet gains or losses on other assets recorded a negative impact of -\u20ac39 million in 2021 linked to the deconsolidation of the Algerian subsidiary.\n\nCIB's underlying net income Group share amounted to \u20ac1,553 million in 2021, compared with \u20ac1,224 million in 2020, an increase of +27%.",

Debt Optimisation and Distribution activities were up despite the negative impact of early repayments observed on Covid-19 transactions in 2020. Revenues from the International Trade and Transaction Banking activity rose sharply, with strong momentum in the Supply Chain business and the continued development of the Private Equity Funds Solutions business in partnership with CACEIS. The recognised structuring expertise in the Trade Finance activity generated a signi/ficant increase in revenues compared to 2020.\n\nThe contribution of Corporate Banking to net income Group share amounted to \u20ac1,147 million in 2021, up 80% compared to 2020, mainly due to the exceptional allocation to the cost of risk recorded in 2020 due to the health crisis.\n\nCR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE CIB GROUP'S BUSINESS REVIEW AND FINANCIAL INFORMA TION\n\n## Capital markets and investment banking\n\n| \u20ac million                         | Under- lying  2021  1   | Under- lying  2020  1   | Change  2021/2020   | Change  2021/2020  constant  rate   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Net banking income                | 2,334                   | 2,530                   | (7.7 %)             | (7.1 %)                             |\n| Operating expenses  excluding SRF | (1,607)                 | (1,528)                 | +5.2%               | +5.5%                               |\n| SRF                               | (193)                   | (150)                   | +28.4%              | +28.4%                              |\n| Gross Operating  Income           | 534                     | 852                     | (37.3%)             | (36.3%)                             |\n| Cost of risk                      | 27                      | (27)                    | nm                  | -                                   |\n| Gain/losses on other  assets      | -                       | -                       | nm                  | -                                   |\n| Pre-tax income                    | 561                     | 825                     | (32.0%)             | -                                   |\n| Corporate income tax              | (156)                   | (237)                   | (34.0%)             | -                                   |\n| Net income                        | 404                     | 588                     | (31.2%)             | -                                   |\n| Non-controlling  interests        | (1)                     | 1                       | nm                  | -                                   |\n| Net income, Group  Share          | 405                     | 587                     | (31.0%)             | -                                   |\n\n- 1 Restated for the impact of DVA, the FVA's liquidity cost and, in 2021, Secured Lending in NBI for +\u20ac6 million in 2021 and +\u20ac11 million in 2020.\n\nCapital markets and investment banking underlying revenues amounted to \u20ac2,334 million in 2021, down -8% compared to 2020 at current exchange rates (-7% at constant exchange rates). 2020 was an exceptional year in terms of client needs, notably in terms of hedging and issuance, due to the /financial crisis caused by the start of the pandemic. Market conditions normalised in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\n- y The Fixed Income business (at \u20ac1,938 million, or -13% compared to 2020) suffered from the compression of margins in an environment marked by the return to a normal level of volatility, overabundance of liquidity and a wait-and-see attitude with regard to long-term rates. On the other hand, securitisation activities performed well compared to 2020 with a recovery in economic activity and sales volumes.\n- y Investment banking posted good revenue growth (\u20ac396 million, +29% compared to 2020) thanks to M&A activities, which carried out several major transactions at the end of 2021. The Primary Equity Capital Markets and Structured Financial Solutions activities also increased compared to 2020. Likewise, the Equity Solutions activities were also up sharply thanks to continued business development.\n\nCapital markets and investment banking contributed \u20ac405 million to net income Group share, down -31% compared to 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Gross operating income rose (+9%).\n\nThe cost of risk recorded an allocation of -\u20ac5 million; it was down compared to 2020, which had been penalised by a speci/fic case. At the end of December 2021, outstandings amounted to \u20ac135/uni00A0billion, up +5% compared to 31 December 2020 primarily due to a favourable market effect, mainly linked to the CAC 40 trend (up +29% at end-December 2021 year-on-year).\n\n## Corporate Centre\n\n| \u20ac million                         | 2021   | 2020   | Change  2021/2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------|\n| Net banking income                | (25)   | 17     | nm                  |\n| Operating expenses  excluding SRF | (4)    | (3)    | nm                  |\n| SRF                               | -      | -      | nm                  |\n| Gross Operating  Income           | (29)   | 13     | nm                  |\n| Cost of risk                      | -      | -      | -                   |\n| Gain/losses on other  assets      | -      | -      | -                   |\n| Pre-tax income                    | (29)   | 13     | nm                  |\n| Corporate income tax              | 56     | 29     | +92.1%              |\n| Net income                        | 27     | 42     | nm                  |\n| Non-controlling interests         | -      | -      | -                   |\n| Net income, Group  Share          | 27     | 42     | (35.8%)             |\n\nThe 'Corporate Centre' division integrates the various impacts not attributable to the other divisions.\n\nIn 2021, revenues amounted to -25 million, and included the impact of the NSFR management operations. In 2020, net banking income included the positive impact of the elimination of the discount on Visa securities. Operating expenses amounted to -\u20ac4 million, mainly comprised of expenses related to the transfer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Banking Services Department's activities to those of OPCs (Operations, Premises & Country COOs) within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB; in 2020, they mainly consisted of the donation to the Covid-19 solidarity fund.

This decrease re/flects the sensitivity of derivatives to long-term euro and USD rates, which rose in 2021.\n\n## FINANCIAL ASSETS AT AMORTISED COST EXCLUDING REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nThe increase in /financial assets at amortised cost stems from corporate banking and securitisation activities.\n\n## REPOS (ASSETS AND LIABILITIES)\n\nRepo transactions were affected by the reduction in net activity of Secured Funding following the overabundance of liquidity injected by the Central Banks on the markets.\n\n## ACCRUAL AND DEFERRED INCOME AND SUNDRY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nAccruals, deferred income and sundry assets and liabilities consist mainly of security deposits on market transactions.

RECENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\nOur scenario calls for a slowdown in growth, which ought to remain strong, as well as a slow moderation in inflation. Such a picture assumes that demand normalises and that supply chain bottlenecks break open. This twofold normalisation will allow inflation (particularly core inflation) to slow and the extraordinary measures of monetary support to be removed unhurriedly and without excessive impact on the bond markets.\n\nObviously, there is room for error in estimating in/flation, which could be both higher and longer-lasting than expected. While the risk of signi/ficant growth in wages and of in/flation settling in for a while at a higher level is more manifest in the United States, the fear in the eurozone arises rather from an erosion of purchasing power that might undermine growth. This, however, is not at present our primary scenario. Furthermore, at least in the advanced economies (thanks to high vaccination rates), the potential variants of the virus seem to hold back economic activity only temporarily and without causing disruption or even great interruption in people's behaviour. The uncertainly produced by the omicron variant was negative in the /first quarter of 2022 but positive in the second quarter of 2022, without upsetting the major thrust of our scenario.\n\nIn the United States , growth should remain vigorous (3.8% in 2022) before gradually converging with its long-term trend (2.3% in 2023). It should bene/fit from strong consumption driven by an improved labour market, from an upward trend in wages (though limited to the sectors most affected by workforce shortages and so not triggering a wage-price spiral) and from the still untapped reservoir of savings, which is a safety net to help absorb a quick pick-up in in/flation. This is a scenario favourable consumption but also to investment, since businesses remain optimistic despite disturbances in the supply-chain and the persistent, though diminishing, lack of labour.\n\nThe engines that most powerfully contributed to accelerating inflation in 2021 will continue to turn, both in the United States and elsewhere, at least during the first-half of 2022: Brisk, high in/flation, particularly with the ongoing crisis in natural gas (whose price is extremely volatile but has more or less 'stabilised' since October); repercussions on retail prices of higher-cost inputs (second-order effects with a maximum impact occurring about three quarters after the jolt to upstream prices); supply-chain problems (including semiconductors and containers); and bottlenecks that though less 'choking' could continue for the greater part of 2022. In the second half-year 2022, assuming a stabilisation in energy prices, the base effects can be expected to be very favourable (i.e., a sharp year-on-year decline in energy prices and subsequently in the prices of goods) and the disturbances in the value chain should gradually subside. In/flation in the United States , boosted by sharp trends in some speci/fic components (such as the component of shelter known as Owner's Equivalent Rent, which does not exist in the eurozone, and more sharply rising wages leading to expectations of 'third order' effects), is thought to remain very high in the /first quarter, peaking near 7.5% year-on-year and yielding core in/flation approaching 6.5%. Total in/flation should then turn down, towards 3% for the 12 months ending 31 December 2022, bringing the yearly average to 5.4% as against 4.7% in 2021.\n\nIn the Eurozone , the strength of the recovery has not yet /filled the negative production gap and the exogenous in/flationary shock does not appear able to alter the scenario of decelerating, if\n\nrobust, growth, which should be 4.3% in 2022 and 2.5% in 2023. Aggregate demand, while running up against weak supply (logistical blockages, strained supply chains, and shortages of inputs and labour), also remains weak its rebound. It is just this weakness that leads one to expect restricted wage increases and temporary, if more persistent, higher in/flation Just as in the U.S., a higher than expected rise in in/flation is plainly the primary risk. This would impair growth through the erosion of purchasing power, rather than through any wage-price spiral. The possibility of a wage-price spiral that is of great concern to investors at the moment seems exaggerated.\n\nApart from the upward pressures already noted, in/flation in the eurozone will be volatile but greatly in/fluenced by technical factors, such as the weighting of components in the price index, the end of the VAT effect in Germany, and country-by-country pricing changes in energy contracts. Total and core in/flation rates should settle on average, respectively, at 4.1% (2.4% in December for the year) and 2.4% (1.9% in December).\n\nIn France , consumer spending should bene/fit from higher purchasing power despite in/flationary pressures. A surge in new jobs and lower unemployment rates should create con/fidence among households, which also enjoy surplus savings from the pandemic estimated at \u20ac150 billion. Investment will bene/fit from the recovery plan announced in the autumn of 2020 and the additional support in the France 2030 plan. Growth is expected to be 3.9% in 2022. As for in/flation, high as it was at the start of the year, it should fall below 2% by year-end and average 2.6% in 2022.\n\nOur scenario assumes high varied efforts at monetary normalisation, which is still preferred to monetary tightening. Depending on the strength of the inflation experienced or feared, and on the anticipated resistance of growth in their respective territories, the central banks are adopting very  diverse  patterns  as  they  withdraw  their  various accommodations, which were as extraordinary as they were generous.\n\nIn the United States , the of/ficials of the Federal Reserve consider in/flation a major risk but in mid-January emphasized recovery in business and employment, judging the risk of setting up a wage-price spiral to be low. According to the Fed, in/flation can be expected to start slowing down in the second half. The Fed began its tapering process, and the markets are now counting on four rises in the fed funds rate in 2022, including 50 basis points at the March meeting. We are counting on a target rate of 1% at end-2022.\n\nIn the Eurozone , in contrast with the forward-moving Fed, the ECB is in no hurry and promises to remain accommodating and /flexible for some time to come, as shown by the thrust of its monetary policy announced in December.\n\nMonetary normalisation would not be accompanied by heavy strain on bonds. 2022 is expected to be divided into two sequences. After a first-half still stamped with both high growth and high inflation, providing the right moment for an upward move in interest rates, would come the motif of deceleration to bring them down.\n\nIn the United States , in/flation /figures have not as yet brought any over-reaction about interest rates. The 10-year Treasury note rate should thus rise before starting to pull back and settling at 1.35% at end-2022.",

        "page_content": "CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE CIB GROUP'S BUSINESS REVIEW AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nIn the Eurozone , the way the ECB and the markets assess the risk of in/flation and, just as much, the credibility of the ECB's diagnosis in the eyes of the markets will be critical. The rise in in/flation and in its volatility should increase time premiums during the /first half of 2022. In sympathy with the ebbing of growth and price pressures, rates should follow a downward slope in the second half. The German 10-year rate should return to zero (or even slightly positive) before falling back to -0.25% at end2022. As the outlook fades for new recovery measures from the ECB, the messaging of the ECB will need to be as subtle as it is convincing to prevent a widening of spreads on peripherals. These could, however, widen slightly for a time. The risk premiums offered by France and Italy should be, respectively, 25 and 130 basis points above the Bund at end-2022.\n\nThe sections on the outlook have been updated subsequent to the closing of the accounts on 8 February 2022 to re/flect recent developments related to the situation in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nAt the end of February 2022, tensions between Russia and Ukraine led to an armed con/flict. The scale and duration of this war, as well as its economic and /financial impacts, are obviously dif/ficult to predict. In addition to its immediate /financial consequences (risk aversion, falling equity markets, falling rates on the safest bonds including the United States and Germany, rising volatility), the Russian-Ukrainian con/flict has resulted in a signi/ficant rise in commodity prices for the production of which the belligerents are major players (1) . In a context of very high uncertainty and faltering of con/fidence, the downturn effect on activity and the increase in already signi/ficant in/flationary pressures will complicate the task of central banks, especially that of the ECB.\n\n## Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB outlook for 2022\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB will continue to strive to be its clients' preferred partner, committed over the long term and facilitating their business with a global approach across Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\n- In Capital Markets and Investment Banking , Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB will continue to consolidate its client relationships formed during the crisis as well as the trend towards market share gains by serving new Corporate clients in Europe, particularly in the healthcare, technology and renewable energy sectors.\n\nA gradual recovery in volatility, the rise in interest rates and a gradual reduction in liquidity supply are expected in 2022, all of which, in theory, carry on client hedging needs that should bene/fit Fixed Income activities. Primary bond and securitisation activities should continue to perform given clients' re/financing needs.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also intends to continue to develop its Equity Solutions business for the Group in Europe and Asia.\n\n- In Corporate Banking activities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB aims to continue to grow its revenues across all the various structured /finance segments, in line with 2021. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also anticipates steady growth in its International Trade activities, which should remain strong, with Trade and Commodity activities expected to bene/fit from dynamic global trade and higher commodity prices. The Debt Optimisation and Distribution activities will continue their development, particularly in the Corporate Acquisitions business line.\n\nAt the same time, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB wants to strengthen its ability to advise its clients on compliance with ESG regulations (European Union taxonomy, ESG disclosures and ratings), to support its Midcap clients on ESG products and, /finally, to develop in the hydrogen sector.\n\n## Medium-Term Plan: 2021 results meet the targets published for the 2022 MTP\n\nIn line with the Group's project and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's 2022 Medium-Term Plan published on 6 June 2019, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB presented on 11 december 2019 the details of its targets for 2022.\n\nIts resilient, pro/fitable and conservative business model is based on:\n\n- y A client-focused organisation, with an automated and systematic measure of the pro/fitability,\n- y High value-added /financing activities generating a strong RONE (corresponding to an RWA allocation of 9.5%),\n- y Market activities which complement the /financing activities for its clients,\n- y A low risk pro/file, supported by an expert and conservative approach on its exposures.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's performance indicators are solid and demonstrate the relevance of its model: an income target exceeded, the maintenance of a low COEX and a low cost of risk level in 2021 made it possible to stay above the pro/fitability target.\n\n| Indicators published  during Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB  Investors workshop on  11/uni00A0december 2019   | 2021  1                      | 2022 MTP  targets                       | Com- ments   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Underlying CIB Net Banking  Income                                                                 | \u20ac5.1 billion                 | \u20ac~5 billion                             | \uf0fc            |\n| CIB Expenses (excluding  SRF)                                                                      | \u20ac2.8 billion                 | \u20ac~2.8 billion                           | \uf0fc            |\n| CIB Cost to Income ratio  (excluding SRF)                                                          | 53.90%                       | < 55%                                   | \uf0fc            |\n| Cost of Risk in amount                                                                             | \u20ac1.013 billion  over 3 years | \u20ac1.1 billion  over 4 years  (2019-2022) | \uf0fc            |\n| Financing cost of risk/ outstanding ratio                                                          | 6 bp                         | [ 20; 25bp]                             | \uf0fc            |\n| RWA                                                                                                | \u20ac122.9 billion               | \u20ac123 billion                            | \uf0fc            |\n|                                                                                                    |                              |                                         | \uf0fc            |\n| CIB RoNE (@9,5%)                                                                                   | 12.4%                        | > 10%                                   |              |\n\n1 For the CIB external communication scope, namely CIB (excluding Private Banking) TOTAL (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB & CASA).\n\nIn 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB achived its commitments by rolling out the various pillars of its strategy.\n\n- \u008a A human-centric project aiming at building the future by onboarding the new generation of experts, at empowering the employees and at significantly communicating the values of the Group\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Human Project places its employees at the heart of its strategy to make them the key players in its performance and transformation.

The speci/fic measures deployed enabled both the protection of the teams and the business continuity through enhanced social dialogue and special attention given to keeping the link with employees.\n\nIn 2021, initiatives that encourage employee participation were strengthened in order to re/flect the numerous transformational challenges linked to the development of the company and organisational methods.\n\nCr\u00e9dit  Agricole  CIB  and  Indosuez  Wealth  Management participated, as they do every year, in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Engagement and Recommendation Index (ERI) survey, sent to all their employees worldwide, from 4/uni00A0October to 12 November 2021.\n\nAt Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, this initiative /fits in with commitment surveys continued since 2015 and allows to assess the positive development of results. In 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB achieved its best ERI score with 79% favourable responses, i.e. a score identical to 2020 and its highest participation rate with a 73% response rate, i.e. an increase of 3 points compared to 2020. The results of this survey reveal that strong progress has been made on topics related to strategy, con/fidence in the decisions taken by management and organisational ef/ficiency. They also demonstrate the strong commitment of employees and the collective spirit that have driven the teams since the start of the health crisis. As part of the Human Project, this year the Group rolled out a new ERI indicator, the Accountability Index, for which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB received 75% favourable responses. This new index will allow us to measure, over time, perceptions of autonomy, empowerment and the ability to propose new ideas to meet clients' needs.\n\n## \u008a Continuously strengthening the expertise of the business lines - the core of the resilience of the model\n\nOnce again this year, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB demonstrated the relevance of its business model, drawing on the complementarity and cooperation of its Corporate Banking and Markets activities, as a bank serving its clients and the economy as a whole. The excellent commercial performance of all the Corporate Banking businesses helped offset the decline recorded in market activities and stemming from wait-and-see behaviour on certain /fixed income/uni00A0transactions, particularly at the end of the year.\n\n## \u008a A data project, the foundation of the digital strategy\n\nThe Data project allowed to meet several goals. First of all, the systematic incorporation of Data challenges in the different projects to bene/fit clients and daily ef/ficiency. The practical implementation of projects to be more ef/ficient in the manner to measure risks, to advise clients. As an example, we can mention the RADaR project which allows to have a global and multidimensional vision of risks. Finally, skills improvement of the actors on this subject now allows to enter in a new steering phase of the strategy and to launch a strategy of digital transformation.\n\n## \u008a Consolidating its role as a leader in green and sustainable finance, extending its o/ffering of sustainable solutions to all business lines\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB offers its customers a range of speci/fic services to support them in their energy transition.\n\nWith its own dedicated Sustainable Banking team, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is in line with its objective of remaining in the world Top 5 in green and sustainable /finance. Il occupe une position de leader en se pla\u00e7ant #4/uni00A0global in Green, Social and Sustainability Bonds (source/uni00A0: Monde, all currencies in 2021 - Bloomberg) and remains #2 in Green, Social and Sustainability Bonds - EUR in 2021 (source/uni00A0: Bloomberg).\n\nIn 2021 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was involved in several transactions in green and sustainable /finance. The two following transactions are good examples:\n\n- y The European Commission's Green Bond NextGenerationEU: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB acted as co-lead manager of this /first historic bond issue. This is the world's largest green bond issue, which supports the European Union's determination to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 (\u20ac12 billion, 15-year maturity).\n- y Fleury Michon's sustainable securitisation programme: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole supported Fleury Michon in setting up its securitisation programme, the /financing cost of which is indexed to its non-/financial performance (with indicators on workplace safety, the energy transition and health/nutrition). As a result of this transaction, it became the /first agri-food company in Europe to make the /financing margin of a securitisation agreement conditional on the achievement of multi-year CSR targets.",

This increase was offset by the signi/ficant drop in repurchase agreements (-\u20ac8.5 billion).\n\nIn terms of liabilities, repos fell -\u20ac12.6 billion (-16.7%). Conversely, other amounts due to clients rose +\u20ac5.2 billion (+6.7%).\n\n## Securities and debt securities\n\nSecurities transactions under assets were up +\u20ac5.8/uni00A0 billion (+16.7%). This increase was attributable to bonds and other /fixed-income securities +\u20ac4.6/uni00A0billion, and was con/firmed in trading and investment portfolios.\n\nDebt securities were up +\u20ac6.2 billion (+19.7%), primarily due to negotiable debt securities.\n\n## Accrual and deferred income and miscellaneous assets and liabilities\n\nThis item principally records the fair value of derivative instruments. As a reminder, these are covered in 'Financial assets and liabilities at fair value' in the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nThe decrease in 'Accruals, prepayments and sundry assets and liabilities' was -\u20ac44.5 billion on the assets side (-24.6%) and -\u20ac35.3 billion on the liabilities side (-16.5%).\n\nOther assets fell -\u20ac13.9 billion and other liabilities -\u20ac7.8/uni00A0billion. These aggregates mainly consist of premiums on options and miscellaneous accounts payable and receivable.\n\nAccruals and prepayments, mainly representing the fair value of derivatives, also declined by -\u20ac30.6 billion on the assets side and -\u20ac27.6 billion on the liabilities side.\n\n## Provisions and subordinated debt\n\nProvisions were down slightly by -\u20ac0.2 billion and subordinated debt rose +\u20ac3.1 billion (+34.8%). This increase is mainly due to the back of EUR-denominated perpetual subordinated debt (+\u20ac3 billion).",

RISK FACTORS\n\nThis section sets out the main types of risks to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed, as well as certain risks related to holding Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB securities. Other parts of this chapter discuss Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB 's risk appetite and the set-ups put in place to manage and control these risks. The information on the management of risks is presented in accordance with IFRS/uni00A07, relating to disclosures on financial instruments.\n\n## Identification of risks\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB identi/fies its risks using a comprehensive, ex-ante and ongoing approach, then a selective ex-post approach, via a list of 'major risks' that is updated annually. First, all risks are identi/fied and their materiality assessed on an ex ante basis, and on an ongoing basis, whenever Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB develops a new business activity, develops a risk strategy or plans a new transaction. Second, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB categorises the risks identi/fied using a uniform classi/fication for the entire Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, then selects those considered to be 'major' risks. The assessment is realised based on two joint\n\n## 1. CREDIT RISK\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Corporate and Investment Bank largely focuses on debt-related business: credit risk is therefore central to its activities and represents the greatest risk.\n\n## \u008a A - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to credit risk on its Corporate & financial institutions counterparties\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to credit risk in relation to its counterparties such as corporates and /financial institutions. Credit risk impacts Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's consolidated /financial statements when counterparties are unable to honour their obligations and when the carrying amount of these obligations in the bank's records is positive. Counterparties may be banks, /financial institutions, industrial or commercial enterprises, governments and their various entities, or investment funds. The rate of counterparty defaults may increase compared to recent historically low levels; Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB may be required to record signi/ficant charges and provisions for possible bad and doubtful loans, affecting its pro/fitability. These provisions are accounted for in its pro/fit and loss account in the 'cost of risk' accounting item. Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB provisions' level is established depending on loss historic data, volumes, types and maturities of loans granted, economic trend and other factors related to the loan recovery perspectives. The cost of risk includes both charges on defaulted loans (ECL stage 3 under IFRS9), but also charges in case of signi/ficant deterioration in a counterparty's risk pro/file (ECL stage 1 and stage 2 under IFRS9).\n\nIn relation to corporates, the credit quality of borrowers could experience a deterioration, primarily from increased economic uncertainty and, in certain sectors, the risks associated with trade policies of major economic powers. The risks could be exacerbated by the recent practice by which lending institutions have reduced the level of covenant protection in their loan documentation, making it more dif/ficult for lenders to intervene at an early stage to protect assets and limit the risk of nonpayment. On the sectors which appear to be particularly vulnerable to the sanitary crisis, the counterparties risk pro/file continued to deteriorate in 2021. This is the case for shipping\n\ncriteria: on the one hand the assessment of the negative impact magnitude, and on the other hand, the assessment of the risk occurrence probability. Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB Risk Department, which is independent from the business lines, makes a proposal to the Board of Directors based on expert judgement, and taking into account both the impacts and occurrence probability. The Board of Directors approves the list of major risks for the year, at the same time as the risk appetite. The risk factors listed below are taken from this list of 'major risks'.\n\nThe main risks speci/fic to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's activity are presented below and are expressed through risk-weighted assets or other indicators when risk-weighted assets are not appropriate.\n\n(notably ports, bulkers, cruise, tankers), aviation (in particular airline companies), real estate (hotels), oil & gas (Oil services, offshore), and automotive (rental companies).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has exposure to many counterparties in the /financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients with which it regularly executes transactions. Many of these transactions expose Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to credit risk in the event of default or /financial distress. In addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB cannot be disposed of or is liquidated at prices not suf/ficient to recover the full amount of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's exposure under the loans or derivatives in default. The exit or termination of public support schemes, increased market volatility, expectations of in/flation, rising interest rates and government debt levels, could generate further deterioration in the risk pro/file of client banks and insurance companies.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB seeks to reduce its exposure to credit risk by using risk mitigation techniques such as collateralisation, obtaining guarantees, entering into credit derivatives and entering into netting contracts. Only a portion of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's overall credit risk is covered by these techniques.\n\nThe average portfolio quality remains good with a proportion of investment grade ratings of 86% at 31 December 2021.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the amounts of risk-weighted assets (RWA) related to credit risks, except those related to securitisation (covered in \u00a7D) and except sovereign assets (covered in \u00a7E), was \u20ac71.9 billion, equal to 54% of total risk-weighted assets.\n\n## \u008a B - Any significant sector or individual concentration could impact Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB financial situation\n\nLike Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's competitors, the Corporate and Investment Bank's clients are often large multinationals or major /financial institutions which by their very nature, in addition to individual creditworthiness issues, generate a concentration risk, which is normal for a corporate and investment bank. The refocusing strategy applied since the /financial crisis has slightly",

        "page_content": "reduced the number of counterparties and geographical sites, and has therefore resulted in a relative increase in the portfolio concentration. Any downgrade of the rating, or any default or insolvency of such a large counterparty could have a negative impact on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's business activities, results and /financial position.\n\nHowever, the Bank is still active in a large number of countries and economic sectors, thus bene/fiting from the positive effect of sectoral and geographical diversi/fication. Nevertheless, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is subject to the risk that certain events may have a signi/ficant impact on a particular industrial sector to which it is signi/ficantly exposed. For example, energy sector borrowers are subject to risks relating to volatility in energy prices.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the four major economic sectors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB were those of Banks accounting for \u20ac85 billion or 20.3% of total commitments net of export credit guarantees, Oil & Gas for \u20ac37 billion (8.8%), Other non banking /financial activities for \u20ac27 billion (6.3%) and Real estate for \u20ac19 billion (4.5%).\n\n## \u008a C - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is subject to counterparty risk on market transactions\n\nCounterparty risk on market transactions is the manifestation of credit risk in connection with market transactions, investments and/or settlements. While Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB often obtains collateral or uses setoff rights to address these risks, these may not be suf/ficient to protect it fully, and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB may suffer signi/ficant losses as a result of defaults by major counterparties.\n\nThe amount of this risk varies over time with changes in market parameters affecting the potential future value of the transactions concerned.\n\nRisk-weighted assets speci/fic to this risk amounted to \u20ac18.2 billion as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## \u008a D - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0 CIB is exposed to credit risk related to securitisation transactions\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to credit risk in connection with its securitisation transactions on behalf of clients. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB (through the Global Markets Division) acts as originator and sponsor for its Corporate or Financial institutions clients.\n\nThe vast majority of the product line's exposures come from the securitization conduit business, in which Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is one of the leading global players. The conduits are designed to /finance Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB's large clients, primarily in Europe, by issuing Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) to external investors, primarily in the United States. Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB fully supports these multi-seller issuance programs through liquidity lines, thus fully guaranteeing liquidity and credit risks. Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB notably sponsors the LMA conduit in Europe and the Atlantic and Lafayette conduits in the US. Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB favors traditional asset classes, notably trade receivables and auto loans/leases, over complex and atypical ones.\n\nThe  credit  risk  arising  from  securitization  transactions  is composed of two major risk families. On the one hand, portfolio risk corresponds to credit risk exposure related to assets (default risk of debtors, concentration risk). Secondly, seller/servicer risk relates to the customers /financed, and comprises commingling risk (risk that collections cannot be transferred to the securitization structure in the event of the seller/servicer's bankruptcy), dilution\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nrisk (risk that the seller grants the assigned debtor a reduction in the value of the securitized receivables) and set-off risk (risk that the securitized receivables are offset by claims from the obligors). Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB has put in place mechanisms to protect against these risks (e.g., insurance of the assets); however, the materialization of these risks could result in credit losses for Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB.\n\nRisk-weighted assets related to this risk amounted to \u20ac9.9 billion as at 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\n## \u008a E - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to country and sovereign risks\n\nAs a result of its exposure on numerous countries on all continents, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to country risk when the deterioration in the environment or the economic, /financial, political or social situation of a country affects the Bank's activities and the quality of the counterparties in that country. Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB monitors country risk and takes it into account in the fair value adjustments and cost of risk recorded in its /financial statements. However, a signi/ficant change in political or macroeconomic environments may require it to record additional charges or to incur losses beyond the amounts previously written down in its /financial statements. In addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has signi/ficant exposures in countries outside the OECD, which are subject to risks that include political instability, unpredictable regulation and taxation, expropriation and other risks that are less present in more developed economies.\n\nCr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's exposures are distributed between the following geographic regions: France, other Western European countries, and North America. On all sectors, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB exposures' amount is respectively as at 31 December 2021 of \u20ac120 billion, \u20ac120 billion and \u20ac70 billion representing respectively 28%, 29% and 17% of the total exposures. Besides, commercial commitments in the countries which are rated as non investment grade on the internal rating scale amounted to 14% of total exposures.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is also exposed to sovereign risk under its various commitments to sovereign counterparties (in the event that they default or are unable to meet their contractual obligations). The rise in sovereign debt due to the sanitary crisis increases this risk. Risk-weighted assets speci/fic to this risk amounted to \u20ac2.3 billion as at 31 December 2021.\n\nAt the end of February 2022, the tensions between Russia and Ukraine led to a military con/flict. The magnitude and duration of this war, as much as the /financial and economic impacts, both local and global are hard to predict. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB may be subject to losses due to its direct and indirect exposure to Russia. In Russia, the exposures booked in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB AO subsidiary represent \u20ac540 million at 31 December 2021. All of the credit portfolio is locally re/financed. The capital of the subsidiary amount to approximately \u20ac150 million, of which \u20ac80 million in equity and \u20ac70 million in subordinated debt. The bulk of assets consists in loans to local corporates, mainly in rubles, onethird of which bene/fits from the parent company's guarantee and of a sovereign exposure corresponding to the excess liquidity of the subsidiary deposited short term at the Central Bank of Russia in the context of its regulatory liquidity and ratio requirements. The exposures booked outside of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB AO, so-called off-shore exposures, can be split into on-balance sheet and offbalance sheet. The on-balance share of off-shore exposures",

This portfolio mainly pertains to /fifteen large Russian corporates, notably producers and exporters of commodities, leaders on the market in key economic sectors of their country. Its quality is strong: 96% of the portfolio is rated investment grade in the internal rating scale as of end December 2021. It is mainly corporate /finance for 62%, trade /finance for 25% and the rest corresponds to asset /financing (aerospace, project, shipping). The off-balance sheet share of off-shore exposures amounts to around \u20ac1.5 billion as of 31 December 2021. It is mainly corresponding to shortterm trade /finance activities (in particular documentary credit\n\nand /financial guarantees), and, to a lesser extent, to con/firmed un-drawn credit facilities. Forward foreign exchange transactions were also contracted with Russian counterparties. The market value of this transactions, sensitive to ruble/dollar parity reached \u20ac60 million as of 31 December 2021. This /figure represented the counterparty risk associated with this date. Moreover, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez Wealth Management Russian exposures amounted around \u20ac250m as of 31 December 2021. All in, these exposures, which are of a limited size and of good quality, are under a close monitoring.\n\n## 2. FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nFinancial risks cover the risks associated with the environment in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB operates, in particular market risk, risk of change in the value of equity investments, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, risk of change in the value of the securities portfolios (or issuer risk) and global interest rate risk.\n\n## \u008a A - The evolution of financial market conditions could impact Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB results\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's businesses are materially affected by conditions in the /financial markets, which in turn are impacted by current and anticipated future economic conditions in France, Europe and in the other regions around the world where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB operates. In particular, the risks to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is therefore highly exposed include /fluctuations in interest rates, security prices, foreign exchange rates, its own issuer spread and the prices of oil, precious metals and other commodities.\n\nProtracted market movements, particularly asset price declines, may reduce the level of activity in the market or reduce market liquidity. Such developments can lead to material losses if Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB cannot close out deteriorating positions in a timely manner. This may especially be the case for assets held by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB that are not very liquid at the outset. Assets that are not traded on stock exchanges or other public trading markets, such as derivatives contracts between banks, may have values that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB calculates using models other than publicly-quoted prices. Monitoring the deterioration of prices of assets like these is dif/ficult and could lead to losses that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has not anticipated.\n\nIn the course of 2021, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB was strongly mobilized to prepare for the new benchmark indices which replaced BOR indices. This reform generates new types of market risks. Indeed, the abundance of replacement indices generates not only risks related to the valuation of these new indices and their correlation, but also uncertainty about their quality and sustainability.\n\nRisk-weighted assets speci/fic to market risk amounted to \u20ac9.1/uni00A0billion as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## \u008a B - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to the risk of change in the value of its securities portfolio\n\nSecurities held in the banking book and recognised at fair value are purchased by Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB primarily for the purpose of managing liquidity reserves. Their value may fall as a result of changes in interest rates or in the credit quality of the issuer, in respect of debt securities (Credit Spread Risk in the Banking Book (CSRBB)) or as a result of a fall in the stock market price, in respect of listed shares.\n\nThe carrying amount of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's securities and derivatives portfolios and certain other assets, as well as that of its own debt, in its balance sheet are adjusted at each /financial statement date. Most of the adjustments are made based on changes in the fair value of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's assets or liabilities during an accounting period, with the changes recorded either in the income statement or directly in shareholders' equity. The fact that fair value adjustments are recognised in one accounting period does not mean that further adjustments will not be necessary in subsequent periods.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the gross outstanding debt securities held by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB were close to \u20ac34 billion. Accumulated impairments and reserves and negative fair value adjustments due to credit risk were \u20ac37 million.\n\n## \u008a C - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB is exposed to Foreign exchange risk\n\nCr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is not exposed to operational foreign exchange risk, resulting from results in non-euro currencies, as results in non-euro currencies are systematically hedged.\n\nStructural foreign exchange risk results from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's long-term  investments  in  assets  denominated  in  foreign currencies, mainly the equity of its foreign operating entities, whether they result from acquisitions, transfers of funds from head of/fice or the capitalisation of local earnings. These positions are not fully hedged. The Group's policy for managing structural foreign exchange positions aims at achieving two main goals: i/ regulatory, to protect the Group's solvency ratio against currency /fluctuations; ii/ proprietary interests, to reduce the risk of loss of value for the assets under consideration. The unhedged part is subject to structural foreign exchange risk.\n\nAny unfavourable change in exchange rates will affect the value of unhedged long-term investments.\n\nCr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB main structural foreign exchange gross positions are in US dollars, in currencies linked to the US dollar - mainly Middle East currencies and some Asian currencies - in UK pound and in Swiss francs.",

        "page_content": "## \u008a D - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB is exposed to liquidity availability and liquidity price risks\n\nLiquidity risk has two aspects: liquidity availability risk and liquidity price risk. With regard to liquidity availability risk, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB is exposed to the risk that its equity and liabilities, including clients' deposits, short-term market funds and long-term market funds, are insuf/ficient to cover its assets. If this were the case, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB would be at risk of not having the necessary funds to meet its commitments. This situation may result from a systemic crisis (a /financial crisis impacting all operators), an idiosyncratic crisis (speci/fic to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group or Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB) or a combination of both. The Group's primary objective in managing liquidity is to ensure that it has suf/ficient resources to meet its requirements in the event of any type of severe, prolonged liquidity crisis, at a reasonable price. As at 31/uni00A0December 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), the prudential ratio to ensure the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk pro/file, was 164%, greater than the regulatory minimum of 100%, and greater than the target of 110% under the medium-term Plan.\n\nLiquidity price risk is the risk of additional /financial costs caused by a change in re/financing spreads. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding from market investors, is directly related to its credit spread (the amount paid to investors in debt instruments issued by Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB, in excess of the interest rate of government securities of the same maturity). Changes in credit spreads are continuous, market-driven, and subject at times to unpredictable and highly volatile movements. Credit spreads are also in/fluenced by market perceptions of the issuer's creditworthiness, re/flected in its credit rating.\n\nCredit ratings have a signi/ficant impact on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's liquidity, both in terms of availability and price. A signi/ficant rating downgrade could have a signi/ficant adverse impact on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's liquidity and competitiveness. In relation to availability, ratings in/fluence the amount of liquidity Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB can borrow on the markets; they may also, in the event of a signi/ficant deterioration, generate an additional liquidity requirement impacting obligations under certain trading, derivatives and hedging contracts. In relation to price, a better rated issuer will bene/fit, everything else being equal, from a lower price.\n\nThe Group's ratings from Moody's, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings are Aa3 [stable perspective], A+ [stable perspective] and AA- [stable perspective], respectively, at 31 December 2021.\n\n## 3. OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from faulty or inadequate internal processes (particularly those involving staff and IT systems) or from external events, whether deliberate, accidental or natural (/floods, /fires, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, etc.).\n\nWithin operational risk, non-compliance risks and legal risks can be distinguished (A) from the other risks of losses arising from inadequate or de/ficient internal processes, staff and systems or from external events which are grouped into 'Other operational risks' (B).\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\n## \u008a E - Any significant variation in the the value of equity investments could impact Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB results\n\nCr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB holds equity securities in various Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities (for instance, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Egypt), but also in external entities as part of its activities (for instance in stock exchanges). Equity securities held by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB in strategic investments could fall in value, requiring it to recognise impairment charges in its consolidated /financial statements, which could negatively impact its results of operations and /financial position. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's degree of control may be limited, and any disagreement with other shareholders or with management may adversely impact the ability of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to in/fluence the policies of the relevant entity.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the carrying amount of securities owned by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB was around \u20ac0.2 billion, principally in relation to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Egypt.\n\n## \u008a F - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to variations in interest rates\n\nOverall interest rate risk or interest rate risk in the banking book of a /financial institution (IRRBB) is the risk incurred when a change in interest rates occurs, as a result of all balance sheet and offbalance sheet transactions, other than transactions subject to market risk. Any signi/ficant change in interest rate could adversely affect Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's consolidated revenues, equity or pro/fitability.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's exposure to overall interest rate risk on client transactions is limited given that the majority of loans and deposits are at variable rates, and given the interest rate matching rule for each customer /financing with the Treasury. Interest rate risk is primarily derived from equity capital and equity investments, the modelling of non-interest-bearing liabilities and from maturities of less than one year from the Treasury activities of the banking book. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is mainly exposed to changes in interest rates\n\nin the eurozone and, to a lesser extent the US Dollar.\n\nThus, in terms of net banking income sensitivity for the /first year, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB could lose \u20ac163 million of revenues in case of a 200-basis-point decrease in interest rates, excluding TLTRO, i.e. a 2.75% sensitivity for a reference net banking income of \u20ac5,913/uni00A0 million in 2021. Based on these same sensitivity calculations, the net present value of the loss incurred in the next ten years in the event of an adverse 200 basis point movement in the yield curve equals 0.74%, i.e.\u20ac206 million of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB equity.\n\nRisk-weighted assets speci/fic to these risks amounted to \u20ac22.2/uni00A0billion as at 31 December 2021.\n\n- \u008a A - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB is exposed to noncompliance risks and legal risks\n\n## a)  Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to the risk of fraud\n\nThe mission of the Compliance function is to act as second line of defence, in partnership with the businesses, to protect the bank, its employees and its clients, in particular by combating /financial crime and more particularly by preventing money laundering, terrorist /financing and fraud.",

Businesses invest in research and development to reinforce the tools deployed to combat external fraud, through innovative solutions and the development of client service on means of payment.\n\nOver  the  period  2019-2021,  the  breakdown  of  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's operational losses due to internal and external fraud amounted to around 53% of its total operating losses. The 'internal fraud' category represented 52% of operational losses. External Fraud represented 1% of operational losses, excluding cross-border credit risk, consisting of external fraud incidents committed by or at clients that generated or aggravated credit losses. According to Basel principles, those losses were recognised in cost of credit risk.\n\n## b)  Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to the risk of paying high damages or fines: risk arising from legal, arbitration or administrative proceedings which could be initiated against it\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to signi/ficant legal proceedings (including class action lawsuits), arbitrations and regulatory proceedings. When determined adversely to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, these proceedings can result in awards of high damages, /fines and penalties. Legal and regulatory proceedings to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has been subject involve issues such as collusion with respect to the manipulation of market benchmarks, violation of international sanctions, inadequate controls and other matters. While Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB in many cases has substantial defences, even where the outcome of a legal or regulatory proceeding is ultimately favourable, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB may incur substantial costs and have to devote substantial resources to defending its interests.\n\nOrganised as a business line, the Legal Affairs Department has two main objectives: to control legal risk, which can give rise to disputes and civil, disciplinary or criminal liabilities, and to provide the legal support needed by entities to enable them to carry out their activities.\n\nAt the end of December 2021, provisions on operational risks amounted to \u20ac414 million for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. This amount includes legal risks costs.\n\nThe international scope of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's operations exposes it to risks inherent in foreign operations, including the need to comply with multiple and often complex laws and regulations applicable to activities in each of the countries in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is active, such as local banking laws and regulations, internal control and disclosure obligations, data privacy restrictions, European, US and local anti-money laundering  and  anti-corruption  laws  and  regulations  and international sanctions. Breaches of these laws and regulations could damage Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's reputation, result in litigation, civil or criminal penalties, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business activities. At end-2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB had operations in 37 countries. This scope includes the parent entity, its subsidiaries and their branches. It does not include held-for-sale and discontinued operations, nor any entities consolidated using the equity method. At the end of 2021, 71% of Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB net banking income (excluding intragroup eliminations) came from France and Europe.\n\nTo illustrate, in October 2015, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and its parent company, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., reached agreements with the US federal and New York State authorities that had been conducting investigations regarding US dollar transactions with countries subject to US economic sanctions. The events covered by this agreement took place between 2003 and 2008. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., which cooperated with the US federal and New York State authorities in connection with their investigations, have agreed to pay a total penalty in the amount of $787.3 million (i.e., \u20ac692.7 million).\n\n## \u008a B - Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB is exposed to other operational risks including Information System Security risks\n\nOther operational risks include risks of losses resulting from inadequate or defective processes, staff and internal systems or external events, excluding fraud which is covered in A. Over the period 2019 to 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's operational risk incidents covered the following: the 'Execution, delivery and process management' category represented 34% of operational losses, the 'employment practices' category represented 10% of operational losses and the 'clients and commercial practices' category represented 3%. Finally, 'business disruptions and system failures' incidents accounted for 1% of operational losses. The remaining part of operational losses comes from events related to fraud which is covered in A.\n\nRisks related to the security of information systems have become a priority, not because of the historical losses (in the 'business disruptions and system failures' category referred to above), but due to the emergence of new forms of risk. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is subject to cyber risk, i.e., the risk of a virtually committed malicious and/or fraudulent act aimed at manipulating information (personal, banking/insurance, technical or strategic data), processes and users with a view to causing signi/ficant losses to companies, their employees, partners and clients.\n\nLike most other banks, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB relies heavily on communications and information systems throughout the Group to carry out its business. Any failure or interruption or breach of security of these systems could result in failures or interruptions in its client relationship management, general ledger, deposit, servicing and/or loan organisation systems and give rise to signi/ficant costs.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is also exposed to the risk of an operational failure or interruption of one of its clearing agents, foreign exchange markets, clearing houses, custodians or other /financial intermediaries or external service providers that it uses to execute or facilitate its securities transactions. As its interconnectivity with its clients grows, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB may also become increasingly exposed to the risk of operational failure of its clients' information systems.\n\nThe risk of non-continuity of operations did not materialize during the Covid crisis: the business continuity plan and the use of teleworking allowed production capacities to be maintained. However, the persistence of teleworking raises the question of respect for con/fidentiality in remote work, without any incident identi/fied at this stage, and the question of reviewing the speci/fic authorizations granted in this context. Psycho-social risks are monitored with vigilance.",

BUSINESS RISK\n\nBusiness risks covers on the one hand the systemic risk: global risk related to the macroeconomic, political and regulatory environment (in particular, the prudential and tax environment), and on the other hand the strategic risk: the risk linked to losses or falls in revenue or pro/fits due to decisions over Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB strategic choices and/or competitive positioning.\n\n## \u008a A - Potential negative impact of adverse economic and financial conditions could expose Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB to systemic risk which would impact its activities and financial situation\n\nThe businesses of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB are speci/fically and signi/ficantly exposed to changes in /financial markets and to the development of the economic conditions in France, Europe and the rest of the world. In the /financial year ended 31 December 2021, 41% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's net banking income were generated in France, 30% in Europe, 29% in the rest of the world. A deterioration in economic conditions in the markets where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB operates could have one or more of the following impacts:\n\n- y adverse economic conditions would affect the business and operations of clients of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, which could decrease its revenues and increase the rate of default on loans and other receivables, generating additional cost of risk for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB;\n- y a fall in bond, equity and commodity prices could impact a signi/ficant proportion of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's business activities;\n- y macro-economic policies adopted in response to actual or anticipated economic conditions could have unintended effects, and may impact market parameters such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates, which in turn could affect the businesses of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB that are most exposed to market risk;\n- y perceived favourable economic conditions generally or in speci/fic business sectors could result in asset price bubbles which could in turn exacerbate the impact of corrections if conditions became less favourable;\n- y a signi/ficant economic disruption (such as the global /financial crisis of 2008 or the European sovereign debt crisis of 2011) could have a severe impact on all of the activities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, particularly if the disruption is characterised by an absence of market liquidity that makes it dif/ficult to sell certain categories of assets at their estimated market value or at all;\n\nOver 2021, uncertainties related to the health situation were perpetuated  in  Europe,  with  improvements  coming  from vaccination and booster vaccination campaigns being offset by the emergence of new and more contagious variants of the virus. New restrictive measures were put in place in some European countries (limitations, curfews, lockdown measures and border closures, etc.) which have caused economic slowdown and have weighted on economic agents' con/fidence. It cannot be excluded that other measures have to be rolled out in the future, even in countries where the vaccination rate is high. Moreover, there is still strong uncertainty over the effective damages caused by the crisis to the system of production (business failures, bottlenecks on the worldwide supply chains) and to the labour market (unemployment), which are currently limited by the impact of\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nbudgetary and monetary measures to support the economy. The pace at which governments and central banks (and notably the European Central Bank) will phase out these measures generates uncertainties. In this context, the European commission revised its growth forecasts for the year 2022 last October, to 4.3% for the Euro zone and to 3.8% for France. Moreover, the pandemic spreads unequally over the globe, in particular in some emerging countries which are struggling to control the virus. Restrictive governmental measures were thus maintained, which disrupt world trade, supply chain and international mobility.\n\nDespite economic support measures put in place in numerous countries, the pandemic impact on economy and /financial markets at international level have had and may still have a negative impact on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's results and /financial situation. In this respect, the government controls and travel bans implemented around the world as a response to the health crisis have caused:\n\n- y Travel bans or restrictions to freedom of assembly, which impacted a large range of sectors: air transport, cruise, restaurants, international tourism, events;\n- y Slowdown or complete disruption to global supply chains and a slowdown in investment (in the automotive sector for instance), causing shocks in supply and demand that have given rise to a marked slowdown in economic activity;\n- y Structural changes in consumer habits, for instance in the sectors of non-food retailing. Besides, commercial real estate is also subject to increased vigilance, as the crisis accelerated pre-existing threats in some segments, as malls which face the competition from on-line purchases, and of/fices which have to cope with increased remote working;\n- y Finally, Signi/ficant impacts on /financial markets, with increased volatility, stock market indices declining precipitously, falls in commodity prices and credit spreads widening for many borrowers and issuers.\n\nThe diversi/fication in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB business lines and investments already initiated have limited these risks: the year 2021 shows that certain businesses or sectors are taking over when others are lagging behind. This was the case both in capital markets activities, where the growth of equity activities is already producing very promising results, and in commercial banking. However, the economic sectors in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB operates have been affected in different ways by the health and economic context. Those in which the deterioration of risk pro/file is most marked include: the maritime sector (notably ports, bulkers, cruises, tankers), which represents 2.6% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's exposures, aeronautics (in particular airlines), which represents 3.6% of exposures, real estate (and notably hotels), representing 4.5% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB 's exposures, the Oil & Gas sector (Oil services, offshore), representing 8.8% of exposures, and the automotive sector (rental companies), representing 3.2% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB 's exposures at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe deterioration of the risk pro/file in the various sectors mentioned above is re/flected in the cost of risk for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, and in additional risk-weighted assets re/flecting a decline in the internal credit ratings of clients. These two factors combined reduce Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB 's pro/fitability. The year 2020 was characterized by a very high cost of risk (824 million euros for corporate and investment banking), including the negative outlook",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 5 - Risks and Pillar 3\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nfor these sectors: most of the cost of risk came from stages 1 & 2 on non-defaulted loans (IFRS9 forward-looking provisioning). The cost of risk for 2021 is lower (49 million euros for corporate and investment banking. In terms of risk-weighted assets, an increase was registered in the year 2020 of +5.4 billion euro generated by the deterioration of clients' internal ratings and by +2.2 billion euros for the year 2021. At end December 2021, the CET1 ratio of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was 11.7%, stable compared to end December 2020. The cost of risk and internal ratings of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB clients could continue to be impacted by the evolution of the sanitary and worldwide economic situation in 2022.\n\nMoreover, the con/flict between Russia and Ukraine, as well as economic sanctions measures against Russia adopted in response by a number of countries (including France, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States) may have widespread economic and /financial repercussions. The con/flict has exacerbated the global markets instability with a negative impact on stock market indices, rising commodity prices (particularly oil, natural gas and agricultural products such as wheat), the worsening of supply chains disruption, the rising production costs and additional in/flationary pressures beyond those already observed in recent months. These dif/ficulties for the global economy and the /financial markets could have signi/ficant negative impact for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and its clients, notably on the cost of risk. These conditions may continue or worsen progressively as the con/flict evolves.\n\nBeyond the Covid-19 crisis and the Russia-Ukraine, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's operations could be disrupted and its activities, results and /financial position could therefore be materially adversely impacted by other sources:\n\n- y A deterioration in the global landscape would lead to further easing of monetary policies, combined with higher risk aversion leading to prolonged maintenance of very low interest rates in the countries judged riskless (including Germany and France);\n- y The political and geopolitical context - more divisive and tense - is a source of greater uncertainty and increases the overall level of risk. This can lead, in the event of rising tensions or the materialisation of latent risks, to some major market movements and can weigh on economies: trade wars, tensions in the Middle East, in Eastern Europe, social and political crises around the world, etc.;\n- y In Italy, a political crisis, against the backdrop of already low growth and high public debt, would have a negative impact on con/fidence and the economy, and could also cause a rise in interest rates and in the cost of re/financing for the government and the banks. It could also lead to losses on the sovereign portfolios of banks and insurers.\n- y In France, there could also be a signi/ficant fall in con/fidence in the event of a more marked deterioration of the social context which could lead households to consume less and save more as a precaution, and companies to delay investments, which could be harmful to growth and to the quality of credit.\n- y The very low level of interest rates leads investors, seeking yield, to move towards riskier assets; it leads to the formation of bubbles in /financial assets and in certain real estate markets. It also leads private clients and governments to take on debt at sometimes very high levels. This increases the risks in the event of a market downturn.\n\n- \u008a B - Potential unfavourable impact of changes in laws and regulations could expose Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB to systemic risk which could a/ffect its activities and results\n\nA variety of regulatory and supervisory regimes apply to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB in each of the jurisdictions in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB operates.\n\nBy way of illustration, such regulations pertain to, in particular:\n\n- y regulatory and supervisory requirements applicable to credit institutions, including prudential rules on capital adequacy and minimum capital and liquidity requirements, risk diversi/fication, governance, restrictions on the acquisition of holdings and compensation (CRR and CRD4);\n- y rules applicable to bank recovery and resolution (BRRD);\n- y regulations governing /financial instruments (including bonds and other securities issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB), as well as rules relating to /financial information, disclosure and market abuse (MAR);\n- y monetary, liquidity, interest rate and other policies of central banks and regulatory authorities;\n- y regulations governing certain types of transactions and investments, such as derivatives, securities /financing and money market funds (EMIR);\n- y regulations on market infrastructure, such as trading platforms, central counterparties, central securities depositories and securities settlement systems;\n- y tax and accounting laws, as well as rules and procedures relating to internal control, risk management and compliance;\n\nIn addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is supervised by the ECB, and contributes to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's recovery plan submitted each year, in accordance with applicable regulations.\n\nFailure to comply with these regulations could have signi/ficant consequences for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB: signi/ficant interventions by regulatory authorities and /fines, international sanctions, public reprimands, reputational damage, enforced suspension of its operations or, in extreme cases, withdrawal of its authorisations to operate. In addition, regulatory constraints could signi/ficantly limit the ability of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to expand its business or to carry on certain existing business activities.\n\nFurthermore, some legal and regulatory measures have come into force in recent years or could be adopted or amended with a view to introducing or reinforcing a number of changes, some permanent, in the global /financial environment. While the objective of these measures is to avoid a recurrence of the global /financial crisis, the new measures have changed substantially, and may continue to change, the environment in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and other /financial institutions operate. The measures that have been or may be adopted include more stringent capital and liquidity requirements (particularly for large global institutions and groups such as Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.), taxes on /financial transactions, caps or taxes on employee compensation over speci/fied levels, limits on the types of activities that commercial banks can undertake (particularly proprietary trading and investment and holdings in private equity funds and hedge funds), ring fencing requirements relating to certain activities, restrictions on the types of entities permitted to enter into swaps, restrictions on certain types of activities or /financial products such as derivatives, mandatory write-downs or conversions into equity of certain debt instruments in the event of resolution",

Some of the new measures adopted after the /financial crisis are expected to soon be modi/fied, impacting the predictability of the regulatory regimes to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is subject.\n\nAs a result of some of these measures, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has been compelled to reduce the size of certain of its business activities in order to comply with the new requirements created by the measures. These measures also lead to increased compliance costs and are likely to continue to do so. In addition, some of these measures may also signi/ficantly increase Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's funding costs, particularly by requiring Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to increase the portion of its funding consisting of capital and subordinated debt, which carry higher costs than senior debt instruments.\n\nNevertheless, a number of adjustments and regulatory changes (as well as delays regarding the date of application of certain rules, particularly those relating to prudential requirements) were made by the national and European authorities in the /first half of 2020 linked to the current Covid-19 health crisis. Some of these measures will be reversed at a short-term horizon, but it is still unclear if the other adjustments, developments and changes in regulations as a result of the health crisis will be long-term or temporary, and it is therefore impossible at this stage to determine or measure their impact on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB.\n\n## 5. CLIMATE RISK\n\n## \u008a Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to the risks incurred by climate change.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is mainly subject to climate risk through counterparties to which it is exposed. Accordingly, when Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB lends to businesses that carry out activities that produce signi/ficant quantities of greenhouse gases, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is subject to the risk that more stringent regulations or limitations on the borrower's activities could have a material adverse impact on its credit quality, causing Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to suffer losses on its loan portfolio (energy transition risk). As the transition to a more stringent climate change environment accelerates, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB will have to adapt its activities appropriately in order to achieve its strategic objectives and to avoid suffering losses.\n\nBy way of example, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Corporate Social Responsibility Project, published on December 1, 2021, provides for a program plan with 10 commitments, at the heart of all its activities. For Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the most signi/ficant commitments include the total cessation of all project /financing\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\n## \u008a C - Strategic risk: Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB could potentially fail to achieve the objectives set out in its medium-term plan\n\nOn 6 June 2019, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. announced its medium-term plan up to 2022 (the '2022 medium-term Plan'). 2022 is the last year of this medium term plan.\n\nOn 11 December 2019, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB published details of this plan for its corporate and investment banking activities. The 2022 Medium-term Plan sets out a number of initiatives, including a distinctive and pro/fitable business model based on (i) targeted geographical development in order to capture growth notably in Asia , and (ii) selective growth in a limited number of businesses, as well as being in line with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's project trajectory.\n\nThe 2022 Medium-term Plan includes a number of /financial targets relating to revenues, expenses, net income and capital adequacy ratios. These /financial targets were established primarily for purposes of internal planning and allocation of resources, and are based on a number of assumptions with regard to business and economic conditions. The /financial targets do not constitute projections or forecasts of anticipated results. The actual results of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB are likely to vary (and could vary signi/ficantly) from these targets for a number of reasons, including the materialisation of one or more of the risk factors described elsewhere in this section.\n\nFor example, at the end of 2022, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB targets to generate revenue of around \u20ac5 billion, with pro/fitability of more than 10%.\n\nThe plan's success depends on a very large number of initiatives (some signi/ficant and other modest in scope) within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB. The 2022 medium-term Plan also provides for signi/ficant investments, but if the objectives of the plan are not met, the return on these investments will be less than expected. If Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB fails to reach the objectives that were de/fined in its 2022 Medium Term Plan, its /financial situation and its results could be impacted signi/ficantly.\n\ndirectly related to the extraction of unconventional hydrocarbons as of January 2022; the protection of the Arctic zone where Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0 Agricole/uni00A0 CIB excludes all direct /financing of oil and gas projects; and the signi/ficant reduction of exposure to oil extraction by 20% by 2025. As part of the promotion of renewable energy /financing, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB also commits to increase its exposure to non-carbon energy by 60% by 2025 and to accelerate the development of its platform dedicated to consulting and /financing of hydrogen projects. Finally, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB will integrate extra-/financial performance criteria in the analysis of 100% of its corporate /financing.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is also subject to physical risks, i.e., the risk that acute weather episodes or a long-term change in climate models (leading to a rise in water levels, for example) damage its own facilities or those of its clients. However, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0CIB is mainly present in countries which would have /financial capacity to deal with the costs triggered by such phenomena, both in terms of prevention and of damage repair.",

RISKS RELATING TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE GROUP\n\n- \u008a A - If any member of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Network encounters future financial di/fficulties, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. would be required to mobilise the resources of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Network (including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's resources) to support that member\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. is the central body of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Network, consisting of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., the Regional Banks and the Local Banks, pursuant to Article R. 512-18 of the French Monetary and Financial Code ('CMF'), as well Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and BforBank as af/filiate members (the 'Network').\n\nUnder the legal internal /financial solidarity mechanism enshrined in Article L. 511-31 of the CMF, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., as the central body, must take all measures necessary to ensure the liquidity and solvency of each af/filiated credit institution, as well as the Network as a whole. As a result, each member of the Network bene/fits from and contributes to this internal /financial solidarity. The general provisions of the CMF are re/flected in the internal provisions setting out the operational measures required for this legal internal /financial solidarity mechanism. More speci/fically, they have established a Fund for Bank Liquidity and Solvency Risks (FRBLS) designed to enable Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to ful/fil its role as central body by providing assistance to any members of the Network that may experience dif/ficulties.\n\nAlthough Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. is not currently aware of any circumstances that may require it to use the FRBLS to support a member of the Network, there can be no assurance that there will no need to use the Fund in the future. In such circumstances, if the resources of the FRBLS were to be insuf/ficient, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., as part of its role as the central body, would be required to make up the shortfall from its own resources and, where appropriate, those of the other members of the Network, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB.\n\nAs a result of this obligation, if a member of the Network were to face major /financial dif/ficulties, the event underlying these /financial dif/ficulties could impact the /financial position of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the other members of the Network (including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB) that are relied upon for support under the /financial solidarity mechanism.\n\nThe European banking crisis management framework was adopted in 2014 by EU Directive 2014/59 (known as the 'Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive - BRRD'), incorporated into French law by Order 2015-1024 of 20 August 2015, which also adapted French law to the provisions of European Regulation 806/2014 of 15 July 2014 establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment /firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund. Directive (EU) 201/879 of 20 May 2019, known as 'BRRD2', amended the BRRD and was incorporated into French law by Order 2020-1636 of 21 December 2020.\n\nThis framework, which includes measures to prevent and to resolve banking crises, is intended to preserve /financial stability, to ensure the continuity of activities, services and operations of institutions whose failure could signi/ficantly impact the economy,\n\n- 1 Articles L. 613-48 and L. 613-48-3 of the CMF\n\n2\n\nArticles L. 613-55 and L. 613-55-1 of the CMF\n\nto protect depositors, and to avoid or limit the use of public /financial support as much as possible. In this context, the European Resolution Authorities, including the Single Resolution Board, have been granted extensive powers to take all necessary measures in connection with the resolution of all or part of a credit institution or the group to which it belongs.\n\nFor cooperative banking groups, the 'extended single point of entry' ('extended SPE') resolution strategy is favoured by the resolution authorities, whereby resolution tools would be applied simultaneously at the level of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the af/filiated entities (including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB). In this respect, and in the event of a resolution of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, the scope comprising Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. (in its capacity as the corporate centre) and its af/filiated entities (including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB) would be considered as a whole as the expanded single-entry point. Given the foregoing and the solidarity mechanisms that exist within the network, a member of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network cannot be put individually in resolution.\n\nThe resolution authorities may initiate resolution proceedings against a credit institution where it considers that: the institution has failed or is likely to fail, there is no reasonable prospect that another private measure will prevent the failure within a reasonable time, a resolution measure is necessary, and a liquidation procedure would be inadequate to achieve the resolution objectives mentioned above.\n\nThe resolution authorities may use one or more resolution tools, as described below, with the objective of recapitalising or restoring the viability of the institution. The resolution tools should be implemented in such a way that equity holders (shares, mutual shares, CCIs, CCAs) bear losses /first, with creditors following up immediately, provided that they are not excluded from bail-in legally speaking or by a decision of the resolution authorities. French law also provides for a protective measure when certain resolution tools or decisions are implemented, such as the principle that equity holders and creditors of an institution in resolution may not incur greater losses than those they would have incurred if the institution had been liquidated in the context of a judicial liquidation procedure under the French Commercial Code (NCWOL principle referred to in Article L. 613-57.I of the CMF). Thus, investors are entitled to claim compensation if the treatment they receive in a resolution is less favourable than the treatment they would have received if the institution had been subject to normal insolvency proceedings.\n\nIn the event that the resolution authorities decide to put the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group in resolution, they will /first write down the CET1 instruments (shares, mutual shares, CCI and CCA), additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments, in order to absorb losses, and then possibly convert the additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments into equity securities/uni00A0 (1) . Then, if the resolution authorities decide to use the bail-in tool, the latter would be applied to debt instruments/uni00A0 (2) , resulting in the partial or total write-down of these instruments or their conversion into equity in order to absorb losses.\n\nWith respect to the corporate centre and all af/filiated entities, the resolution authorities may decide to implement, in a coordinated manner, impairment or conversion measures and,",

In such an event, the impairment or conversion measures and, where applicable, Bail-ins measures would apply to all entities within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network, regardless of the entity in question and regardless of the origin of the losses.\n\nThe creditor hierarchy in resolution is de/fined by the provisions of Article L 613-55-5 of the CMF, effective as at the date of implementation of the resolution.\n\nEquity holders and creditors of the same rank or with identical rights in liquidation will then be treated equally, regardless of the group entity of which they are creditors.\n\nThe scope of this bail-in, which also aims to recapitalise the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group, is based on capital requirements at the consolidated level.\n\nInvestors must then be aware that there is therefore a signi/ficant risk that holders of shares, mutual shares, CCIs and CCAs and holders of debt instruments of a member of the network will\n\nRISK FACTORS\n\nlose all or part of their investment if a resolution procedure is implemented on the Group, regardless of the entity of which they are a creditor.\n\nThe other resolution tools available to the resolution authorities are essentially the total or partial transfer of the activities of the institution to a third party or to a bridge institution and the separation of the assets of the institution.\n\nThis resolution framework does not affect the legal internal /financial solidarity mechanism enshrined in Article L. 511-31 of the CMF, which applies to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network, as de/fined in Article R. 512-18 of the same Code. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. considers that, in practice, this mechanism should be implemented prior to any resolution procedure.\n\nThe implementation of a resolution procedure to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole group would thus mean that the legal internal solidarity mechanism had failed to remedy the failure of one or more network entities, and hence of the network as a whole.",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThis section of the management report presents the risk appetite of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group, the nature of the main risks the Group is exposed, the magnitude and the arrangement put in place to manage these risks.\n\nThe information presented in accordance with IFRS 7, relating to disclosures on /financial instruments covers the main following risk types (1) :\n\n- y Credit risks;\n- y Market risks;\n- y Structural risk of balance sheet management: global interest risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk, including risks of the issuance sector.\n\nTo cover all the inherent risk to the banking activity, additional information is provided concerning:\n\n- y Operational risks;\n- y Legal risks;\n- y Non-compliance risks.\n\nIn accordance with regulatory provisions and the profession's good practices, the risk management within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group results in governance in which each role and responsibility is clearly identi/fied, as much as in methodologies and effective and reliable risk management procedures in order to measure, monitor and manage all the risks incurred at the Group level.\n\n## 2.1. CONCISE STATEMENT ON RISKS\n\nStatement prepared in compliance with Article 435(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has learned from the 2007/2008 crisis and has considerably reduced its risk appetite, primarily by suspending or cutting back on some of its market activities. Its strategic guidelines and management and control systems have therefore been scaled in such a way as to maintain a controlled risk profile which is adapted to well thought out commercial ambitions, an uncertain economic climate and greater regulation.\n\nThis model has proven its resilience since 2011 by generating sustainable profitability, with recurring revenue, while retaining little exposure to market volatility. The risk profile is low, as it is based on a conservative approach.\n\nThe Board of Directors approved Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk appetite for the first time on 30 July 2015. It is updated regularly and at least annually by the Board to ensure that it remains consistent with the financial objectives of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and that it reflects the regulatory constraints, in particular Pillar II. The 2021 risk appetite was approved by the Board on 10/uni00A0December 2020.\n\n## 2.1.1 RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK\n\n## CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE GROUP APPROACH AND RISK LEVELS\n\nIn accordance with the Group's approach, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB expresses its risk appetite qualitatively as well as quantitatively based on key indicators, the most signi/ficant of which are broken down into several risk levels:\n\n- y appetite is used for managing normal everyday risk. It is expressed in budget targets for solvency and liquidity, and in operational limits for market and counterparty risks, any breach of which is immediately /flagged up and then reported to Executive Management for a decision, within the designated committees or bodies, depending on the indicator;\n- y tolerance is used for exceptional management of an increased level of risk. Any breach of tolerance thresholds triggers an immediate report both to the Group Risk Management Department (DRG) and to the Chairman of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB Board of Directors Risk Committee, which is then, if necessary, referred up to the Board of Directors;\n- y capacity is the maximum risk that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB could theoretically take on without infringing its operational or regulatory constraints\n\n## ROLE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk appetite must be approved by its Board of Directors, following a proposal by Executive Management and after it has been examined by the Board of Directors Risk Committee. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk pro/file is examined on a regular basis (at least quarterly) by the Risk Committee and by the Board of Directors to ensure that it is still compliant with the risk appetite which has been de/fined and, where necessary, the risk appetite should be adjusted to be in keeping with changes to the economic climate, regulatory constraints and with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's commercial and /financial goals.\n\n## RISK APPETITE, SPECIFIC RISK STRATEGIES AND SECTOR POLICIES\n\nEvery business line, country or signi/ficant sector of the Bank de/fines periodically a risk strategy that is speci/fic to it and consistent with its /financial objectives and its competitive positioning. These risk strategies are approved by the Strategies and Portfolios Committee (CSP) chaired by the Executive Management and, if necessary, by the Group Risk Committee (CRG) chaired by the Executive Management of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. for risk strategies which the shareholder wishes to authorize at its level, and then lastly, in compliance with the Ministerial Order of 3 November 2014, by the Board of Directors.\n\n(1) This information is an integral part of the consolidated /financial statements as of 31 December 2021 and, as such, it is covered by the Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated /financial statements.",

        "page_content": "Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB has also introduced Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) sector policies in cooperation with the Group as a whole to manage the reputational risks stemming from the social and environmental impacts of its activities. These policies set out analysis criteria for these speci/fic risks, which may cause Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB not to complete a transaction which displays (or in some cases does not display) certain (required or excluded) characteristics in certain sectors such as armaments, nuclear or coal (see Chapter 2). Much like the speci/fic risk strategies, these sector policies are approved by the Strategy and Portfolio Committee (CSP) and then by the Board of Directors.\n\nUltimately, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk appetite therefore comprises the following /five components which form a coherent whole and incorporate the Bank's commercial strategy:\n\n- i. the overall risk strategy;\n- ii.  the dashboard of key indicators broken down into three risk levels, monitored quarterly;\n- iii.  this concise statement;\n- iv.  the speci/fic risk strategies (updated periodically);\n- v.  the sector policies.\n\n## TYPES OF RISK: RISKS CHOSEN AND ASSUMED VERSUS RISKS INCURRED\n\nIn order to achieve its commercial and /financial goals, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB choses and assumes most of its risks: counterparty risks, market risks and liquidity risks are taken on intentionally to generate income and pro/fit. Therefore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB de/fines its appetite by ensuring that risks are in proportion with its commercial strategy and /financial objectives, taking into account its previous performance, competitive position and the current economic cycle, while ensuring that all regulatory requirements (particularly those related to solvency and liquidity) are met.\n\nOther risks such as operational and certain non-compliance risks are essentially incurred, although the implementation of protective measures and control systems limits their occurrence and possible consequences. The Bank has no appetite for these risks. The Bank's appetite is then expressed by indicators that best re/flect certain control and monitoring processes designed to reduce the impact of those risks to an incompressible and tolerated minimum.\n\n## 2.1.2  Overall risk profile at 31 December 2021\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's strategic choices, expressed within the MTP 2020-2022, have been con/firmed by the sanitary crisis,which persists since the beginning of 2020. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's strategy remains therefore globally unchanged, without major adjustments. Thus, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB does not plan to close entities or exit some businesses. Development choices of the MTP are not questioned, including development plans in Asia and on the repos activities.\n\nHowever, limited strategy adjustments were decided. In the course of 2020, the Global Commodity Finance product line has gone through a severe crisis which exposed a signi/ficant number of frauds, and required a tightening of the credit granting policy and of the clients' classi/fication, as well as an in-depth review of operational and documentary processes. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB also put in place heightened vigilance on geopolitical situations and on the sectors which appear to be particularly vulnerable to the sanitary crisis: shipping (notably ports, bulkers, cruise, tankers), aviation (in particular airline companies), real estate (hotels), oil & gas (Oil services, offshore), and automotive (rental companies).\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the overall risk pro/file of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for the risks listed below, was below the tolerance level approved\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nby its Board of Directors, except for the operational risk indicators on the Wealth Management perimeter.\n\n## GLOBALLY MANAGED RISKS: SOLVENCY AND LIQUIDITY\n\n## SOLVENCY\n\nKey solvency risk indicators include:\n\n- y the Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA) calculated using regulatory methods;\n- y the economic capital originating from the 'Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process' (ICAAP - see section 3.1 of Basel III Pillar 3 disclosures 'Internal view of capital adequacy';\n- y the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio; and\n- y the leverage ratio.\n\nThe regulatory RWAs are used to quantify nearly all of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's risks: credit risks, market risks and operational risks. This key indicator fully expresses the overall quantity of risk that the Bank is willing to take on (appetite), does not wish to exceed under any circumstances (tolerance), and the maximum risk in accordance with the regulatory constraints (capacity).\n\nAt 31 December 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's regulatory RWAs stood at \u20ac131.1 billion (see section 3.2.1.1 of 'Basel III Pillar 3 disclosures') and were below the Bank's tolerance threshold.\n\nThe internal economic capital needs are calculated using methodologies more adapted to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB than the regulatory approaches. This calculation considers risks not included in Pillar 1, and quanti/fies them using in-house methodologies. The internal economic capital needs of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB are below its tolerance level.\n\nCET1 ratio corresponds to the ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, divided by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's risk-weighted assets. At 31 December 2021, the CET1 ratio stood at 11.7% (see section 3.1.6 of 'Basel III Pillar 3 disclosures') and is above the Bank's tolerance threshold.\n\nThe leverage ratio is de/fined as Tier 1 capital divided by the leverage exposure. Leverage exposure is composed of balance sheet assets and restated off balance sheet assets (restatements notably relate to conversion factors and derivatives). This regulatory constraint has to be respected at all time since the 28 th of June 2021. At 31/uni00A0December 2021, the leverage ratio stood at 4.0% (see 'Impact of the application of IFRS 9 transitional provisions' of section 3.1.6 of 'Basel III Pillar 3 disclosures') and was above the Bank's tolerance level.\n\n## LIQUIDITY\n\nKey liquidity risk indicators include:\n\n- y resistance periods for short-term liquidity stress;\n- y the Stable Funding Position (PRS);\n- y the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) ; and\n- y The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).\n\nShort-term liquidity stress is applied based on crisis scenarios that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB believes that it could face should an event affect the Group (idiosyncratic crisis), the whole of the inter-bank market (systemic crisis), or a combination of the two (global crisis).\n\nThe stable funding position, de/fined as a long-term surplus of resources over stable assets, aims to protect business lines from the consequences of market stress.\n\nThe LCR requires the Bank to retain suf/ficient unencumbered High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash easily and immediately, on private markets, assuming a liquidity crisis lasting 30 calendar days.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 5 - Risks and Pillar 3\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe NSFR is a one-year liquidity ratio, putting a limit on the transformation the bank can do, by requiring stable assets to be /financed by a minimum amount of stable liabilities.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, all of these indicators were compliant with the Bank's tolerance in this area. Note that the LCR of 164% and the NSFR of 113% far exceed the regulatory requirement of 100%.\n\n## RISKS SPECIFICALLY MANAGED WITHIN THE CORPORATE AND INVESTMENT BANKING (CIB) AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT BUSINESS LINES\n\n## CREDIT RISKS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's focuses on debt-related business: credit risk is therefore central to its activities and is by far the greatest risk. Like Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's competitors, CIB clients are often large multinationals or major /financial institutions which by their very nature, in addition to individual creditworthiness issues, generate a concentration risk in this area. This risk should however be put into perspective by viewing the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group as a whole. The refocusing strategy applied since the /financial crisis slightly reduced the number of counterparties and geographical sites, and therefore resulted in a relative increase in the portfolio concentration.\n\nHowever, the Bank is still active in a large number of countries and economic sectors, thus bene/fiting from the positive effect of sectoral and geographical diversi/fication. This effect is measured and monitored under ICAAP.\n\nOn the other hand, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Wealth Management (WM) generates few credit risks, as the majority of its credits are Lombard loans which are secured against collateral such as: cash, securities, life insurance contracts, etc.\n\nTherefore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's risk appetite is de/fined in accordance with six key indicators:\n\n- y expected losses (EL) within one mid-cycle year for all of its exposures using the internal ratings-based approach (IRBA), excluding defaulted exposures (separate thresholds for CIB and Wealth Management);\n- y the share of defaulted outstandings in total outstandings (separate thresholds for CIB and Wealth Management) and their coverage rate (CIB only);\n- y unexpected losses due to the sudden and simultaneous default of several investment grade counterparties (CIB only);\n- y the 'underwriting risk for corporate clients', whose thresholds are de/fined according to the credit quality of the borrower, which limits the temporary credit risk incurred by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for any corporate group during an underwriting transaction on debt instruments (CIB only);\n- y the proportion of unsecured credit (Wealth Management only).\n\nAt 31 December 2021, all six indicators were below the Bank's tolerance thresholds.\n\n## MARKET RISKS\n\nA series of refocusing and adaptation plans have reduced Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's market activity and the resulting risk. This redimensioning plan followed the response to the /financial crises of 2007/2008, and then 2011, and the choice to discontinue activities which were deemed to be non-strategic or below their critical size. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has put in place a resilient model based on a balanced business model in which capital markets\n\nactivities are part of the continuity of /financing activities with a diversi/fied client portfolio. The Bank also suspended its ownaccount activities and, under the French Banking Law (LBF), was not required to set up an ad-hoc subsidiary. Finally, the Bank's Treasury activity is responsible for the sound and prudent management of cash within the Finance department, as required under the LBF.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has retained appetite for market risks in its CIB activities, when such risks are generated by supplying corporate clients and /financial institutions with the investment products and services that they require (including some structured products), and by assuming its role as a market maker for certain market segments and instruments. Wealth Management on the other hand is only exposed to a very low level of market risks.\n\nTherefore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's market risk appetite is de/fined in accordance with two key indicators:\n\n- y maximum one-day loss within a con/fidence interval of 99%, or Value-at-Risk ('VaR' see section 2.5.1.2 'Market risk measurement and management methodology'; and\n- y adverse and extreme stress (see section 2.5.1.2), to quantify maximum loss in theoretical extreme market conditions which systematically contradict the Bank's positions.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, these indicators were below the Bank's tolerance threshold, in particular with a VaR of \u20ac9.0 million (see section 2.51.2).\n\n## INCURRED OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's incurred operational risks are de/fined in accordance with two key indicators, while setting speci/fic thresholds for the CIB and Wealth Management business lines:\n\n- y the share of the cost of operational risk in net banking income; and\n- y signi/ficant operational risk incidents.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, these indicators were below the Bank's tolerance thresholds for CIB. Wealth Management incurrent a signi/ficant operational risk incident in 2020, which generated breaches of its tolerance thresholds in 2020, and in 2021 due to additional provisions.\n\n## LEGAL AND NON-COMPLIANCE RISKS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has no appetite for legal and non-compliance risks. However, any banking activity which generates income may lead to administrative or disciplinary sanctions in the event of a failure to comply with the rules relating to this activity, whether they be laws, regulations, professional or ethical standards, or even instructions from the Bank's managers. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB manages the non-compliance risk situations inherent to income generation by measuring:\n\n- y the proportion of activities performed with the riskiest clients from a /financial security viewpoint;\n- y the proportion of activities performed for the most complex products on the market;\n- y KYC Compliance rate on new relationships;\n- y Screening Alert Processing Rate aiming at identifying possible breaches of the international sanctions measures;\n- y Conduct risk, which is the risk of inappropriate behavior, with regard to regulation and ethics, of one or more employees, in their relations with customers, /financial markets, third parties (suppliers, partners, etc.) or other employees, the /financial or non-/financial consequences of which would be detrimental to the image or the sustainability of the entity.",

STRUCTURE OF THE RISK FUNCTION\n\nThe Risk and Permanent Control (RPC) Department is in charge of the supervision and permanent control of risks across the whole Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group's scope of consolidated supervision. It carries out second-level supervision and permanent control of counterparty risks, market risks, country and portfolios risks, physical, operational and technical risks, and societal and environmental risks.\n\nThe structure of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Risk and Permanent Control function is integrated into the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's Risk and Permanent Control business line.\n\nRisk management is delegated to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB under formally adopted subsidiarity and delegation principles.\n\nWithin this framework, RPC regularly reports its major risks to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Group Risk Department, and has Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Group Risk Committee (CRG) approve those cases which exceed its authorised limits as well as substantial risk strategies at the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group level.\n\n## 2.2.1 Global structure\n\nRPC is based on a global structure with the following attributes:\n\n- y all risk management tasks and business lines, whatever their nature or location, are grouped together within one division;\n- y all Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's local and regional RPC managers within the international network report directly to the managers at the RPC head of/fice;\n- y the operational risk managers at the Head Of/fice report to the Operational Risk Management Department;\n- y the Head of Risk and Permanent Control of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB (i) reports to the Group Chief Risk Of/ficer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and (ii) is functionally subordinate to the Chief Executive Of/ficer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB;\n- y the Head of Risk and Permanent Control of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is a member of the Executive Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB.\n\nIt comprises:\n\n## 1.

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Group Risk Department (DRG) is systematically a member of this committee and receives all applications. Exposures involving amounts in excess of the limits granted to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB are submitted for a decision to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Executive Management, after obtaining an opinion from the DRG;\n- y the Market Risk Committee (CRM), which is also chaired by a member of Executive Management, monitors market exposures twice a month. The CRM sets the limits and carries out controls on compliance accordingly.\n\n## ANTICIPATION OF COUNTERPARTY DETERIORATION\n\nAnticipation of the potential deterioration of counterparties is addressed under:\n\n- y monthly Early Warning meetings, scheduled by the Early Detection team of the SCS department, which aim to identify early signs of potential deterioration of counterparties previously considered to be sound. After reviewing the information gathered, the purpose of these meetings is to draw the most appropriate operational consequences, depending on whether its conclusions are positive (ultimately deemed harmless or benign, not calling for mistrust of the client at this stage) or negative (con/firmation of an actual concern calling for a reduction in our risk exposure);\n- y early detection by means of ongoing monitoring of portfolios and sub-portfolios to detect counterparties demonstrating various alert signals identi/fied from information passed on by the risk teams and front of/fice staff, data obtained from internal databases and market information;\n- y stress scenarios performed to enable measurement of the impact of a shock on a portfolio or sub portfolio (for application of Pillar 2 of Basel II) and to identify the sectors/segments requiring provisions.\n\nThe objective is to identify any potential deterioration in client risk pro/files as early as possible, in order to implement preventive actions on our exposures where possible.\n\n## CONTROL OF SENSITIVE CASES\n\nThe control of sensitive cases is carried out by a dedicated department. Debts that are under special supervision or classi/fied as in default are revised quarterly.\n\n## OPERATIONAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE\n\nIn addition to the Committees in charge of risks (CRC and CRM), risk management reports are also regularly presented to the following Executive Management committees:\n\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Committee, with debates and discussions dedicated to risk management;\n- y the Internal Control Committee which is responsible for monitoring market and counterparty limits, controlling operational risks and following-up recommendations from internal and external audit committees;\n- y the Topmost Permanent Control Committee, which supervises the operation of the Permanent Control system and operational risk management of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group.\n\n## CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE S.A.'S RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is included within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s risk process which is structured around the following committees:\n\n- y the Group Risk Committee, which is chaired by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Chief Executive Of/ficer. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB mainly submits to the committee its one-off approval requests, its main risk strategies, its budgets and commitments on emerging countries, corporate authorisations of high amounts, large individual exposures, sensitive cases, limits as well as the market risk situation;\n- y the Risk Monitoring Committee which sits within the CRG. Chaired by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Chief Executive Of/ficer, it examines counterparties that show signs of deterioration or a need to arbitrate between several Group entities, as well as, more broadly, points of attention of any kind that may impact the Group's risk pro/file, net income or solvency (risk factors linked to a sector of the economy, country, product category, business activity, regulatory change, etc.);\n- y the Standards and Methods Committee (CNM) chaired by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Head of Risk Management and Permanent Control, to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB submits for approval any proposal for a new method or an existing method for measuring or classifying Basel II risks before their application within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB;\n- y /finally, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Group Risk Department is a permanent member of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Internal Control Committee (CCI).",

INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES\n\n## 2.3.1 Definition of the internal control system\n\nThe internal control system is de/fined within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group as the set of systems used to control activities and all forms of risk and to ensure the legality, security and ef/ficiency of operations, in accordance with the reference texts set out in the paragraph below. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, complies with the requirements of French and international regulations and the rules enacted by its parent company.\n\nThe internal control system and procedures can therefore be classi/fied by the objectives assigned to them:\n\n- y application of instructions and guidelines determined by Executive Management;\n- y /financial performance through effective and adequate use of the Group's assets and resources, and protection against the risks of loss;\n- y comprehensive, accurate and ongoing awareness of the data required to make decisions and manage risks;\n- y compliance with internal and external rules;\n- y prevention and detection of fraud and errors;\n- y accuracy and completeness of accounting records and timely production of reliable accounting and /financial information.\n\nHowever, this system and these procedures have limits, relating in particular to technical problems and staff shortcomings.\n\nUnder the systems implemented within this standardised framework, certain resources, tools and reporting documents are made available to the Board, to Executive Management and to other managers so that they can assess the quality of the internal control systems and their adequacy.\n\n## 2.3.2  Reference texts relating to internal control\n\n## LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\nThe  internal  control  procedures  implemented  by  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB comply with the laws and regulations governing French credit institutions and investment companies, and namely with:\n\n- y the French Monetary and Financial Code;\n- y the Decree of 3 November 2014, relating to the internal control of banks, payment services companies and investment companies, under the control of the French Prudential Supervisory and Resolution Authority (ACPR), as amended on 25 February 2021;\n- y all texts relating to the exercise of banking and /financial activities (a set of documents produced by the Banque de France and the C.C.L.R.F.); /uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0\n- y the General Regulation of the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers).\n\nThe Company's internal control system also takes account of the following international reference documents:\n\n- y the Basel Committee's recommendations on banking control;\n- y local applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which the Group operates;\n- y European and international regulations (EMIR, DFA, etc.) applicable to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's business activities.\n\n## MAIN INTERNAL REFERENCE DOCUMENTS\n\nThe main internal reference documents are:\n\n- y Procedural memo 2022-04 on the organisation of internal control within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group;\n- y Procedural memos dealing with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.

These Committees ensure the decentralised implementation of the Order of 3 November 2014. They enable the Internal Control functions at the Head Of/fice (RPC, CPL, LGL, IGE) to be involved in the operation of Internal Control within a given scope and alert its manager as a matter of priority in the event of any anomalies and then alert the highest level of corporate governance in the event of non-resolution.\n\nIn addition, a Topmost Permanent Control Committee, chaired by the Head of RPC, is responsible for:\n\n- y supervising the operation of the Permanent Control system and operational risk management of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group;\n- y investigating all matters related to this assignment, either for information or decision-making purposes;\n- y resolving any discrepancies or interpretations relating to the Permanent Control system.\n\nThis committee comprises in particular the head of Risk Management and Permanent Control (RPC), the head of Operational Risk Management, the head of Global Compliance, the head of Legal Functions and the head of Group Internal Audit.\n\nThe Head of Group Risk Management ( Direction des risques Groupe or DRG) Operational & IT Risks at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. is a permanent guest. For this committee: two committees meetings were held face-to-face and one was an E-committee in 2021.\n\nIn addition to the permanent control committees established in the head of/fice departments, local committees have been established in the subsidiaries and branches in France and abroad. Meetings\n\nare held monthly (other than in months when a ICC is being held), either face to face or online.\n\n## \u008a Role of the supervisory body: the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors decides on strategy and controls the implementation of oversight by the Executive Directors. It approves and regularly reviews the Bank's risk appetite and risk strategies. It is noti/fied of the structure, work and results of internal control, and of the main risks facing the Bank.\n\nThe Board of Directors has four specialised committees to assist in carrying out its duties: the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee, the Appointments and Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee. The main responsibilities of the Board of Directors and its Committees are listed below and described in further detail in chapter 3, paragraph 1.2.4 of the present Universal Registration Document:\n\n- y the Board of Directors reviews and approves the Bank's risk appetite at least once a year, after review by the Risk Committee;\n- y every quarter, the Board of Directors reviews and approves, after review by the Risk Committee, the speci/fic risk strategies by country, business or sector, which have been de/fined during the previous quarter by the Strategy and Portfolios Committee or by the Group Risk Committee;\n- y in addition to the information regularly sent to the Board of Directors, particularly on the overall risk limits and exposures, compliance, legal risks and liquidity, a report on internal control is presented to it twice a year, as well as a quarterly status report on risk management and exposure. This quarterly report speci/fically includes a presentation on market risks, counterparty risks, operational risks and a review on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's situation with regard to risk appetite. This information and these reports are reviewed beforehand by the Risk Committee;\n- y the Board of Directors is informed of any signi/ficant fraud event or any other event detected by internal control procedures in accordance with the criteria and thresholds that it has set. A reminder of the feedback procedure for this information to the corporate bodies is provided in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's internal documentation;\n- y a presentation of periodic control reports is made twice a year to the Board of Directors, after being reviewed by the Risk Committee;\n- y an annual report (corporate and consolidated basis) on the organisation of internal control systems for combating money laundering and terrorist /financing, and asset freezing, is submitted to the Board of Directors for approval each year;\n- y the report to the AMF by the head of Compliance for Investment Services (RCSI) is presented to the Board of Directors each year.\n\n## \u008a Role  of  the  Executive  Directors:  Executive Management\n\nThe Executive Directors are directly involved in the organisation and operation of the internal control system.\n\nThey ensure that risk strategies and limits are compatible with the /financial situation (capital levels, results) and the strategies adopted by the Board of Directors. The Executive Directors de/fine the general organisation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and oversee its effective implementation by the competent staff.\n\nThey assign clear roles and responsibilities in terms of internal control and allocate the appropriate resources. They oversee the implementation of risk identi/fication and measurement systems that are appropriate for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's activities and structure.",

The system is intended to supervision and control of activities, measurement and monitoring of risks on a consolidated basis.\n\nEach entity within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group applies this principle to its own subsidiaries, thus creating a logical internal control structure pyramid and strengthening the consistency between the Group's various entities.\n\nIn this way, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB ensures that it has an adequate system within each of its risk-bearing subsidiaries, and those activities, risks and controls are identi/fied and monitored on a consolidated basis within these subsidiaries, particularly as regards accounting and /financial information.\n\nIn 2018, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB governance document was updated to take account of the new Group Procedural Memo on the structure of internal control (see above, 'Main Internal Reference Documents'). This document introduces the notion of a 'Consolidated Supervision Scope', by de/fining its rules for determining supervision and governance information procedures.\n\n## BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE COMPANY\n\n## \u008a General description\n\nDetailed information on credit, market, operational and liquidity risk management is provided in the 'Risk factors and Pillar 3' section and in the notes to the /financial statements.\n\nThe internal control system is based on three levels of controls, which distinguish permanent control from periodic control.\n\nPermanent control is carried out as follows:\n\n- y /first degree: permanent controls are carried out when a transaction is initiated and while the transaction is being validated. They are carried out by the operators themselves, by the hierarchy within the unit or by automated transaction processing systems;\n- y second degree, /first level: permanent controls are carried out by employees who are separate from those who initiated the transactions and who may perform operational activities;\n- y second degree, second level: permanent controls are carried out by staff working exclusively at the /final level of specialist permanent control with no authorisation to make risk-taking commitments (Operational Risk Managers of Departments, which report to RPC, credit or market risk control, accounting control, compliance control).\n\nThe periodic (third-degree) controls cover occasional on-site audits of accounting records relating to all of the Company's activities and functions by the Group Control and Audit Department.\n\nThe system of permanent controls is based on a platform of operational controls and specialised controls. Within the\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\ndepartments at the head of/fice, the branches and the subsidiaries, procedural manuals describe the controls to be performed and the related operational permanent controls.\n\nThe  controls,  which  can  be  integrated  into  automated transaction processing systems, are identi/fied and updated based on operational risk mapping (now called Risk and Control Self-Assessment).\n\nThe results of the controls are formalised through control sheets and centralised in the RPC Operational Risk Management OLIMPIA tool. They are summarised in periodic reports at the appropriate hierarchical level (in the network and at the head of/fice) and, on a consolidated basis, to the Head of Permanent Control and to the Topmost Permanent Control Committee.\n\nThis system is continuously updated. It must speci/fically cover the entities of the consolidated supervision scope along with changes related to the activity, the organisation and the IT system. In that regard, careful attention is paid to maintaining the quality of operations and a suitable internal control system.\n\nThe OLIMPIA tool now covers all operational risk issues: collection of incidents and losses, provision of essential outsourced services, Risk and Control Self-Assessment, Supervisory Controls.\n\nSince 2016, the Qualitative aspect of the ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy and Assessment Process) has been fully included within the annual Internal control report (ICR).\n\n## \u008a Detailed description\n\n## FIRST-DEGREE CONTROLS\n\nThey are performed in a hierarchical environment where the technical actions which are the subject of the control are carried out. The de/finition of these controls and the analysis of their results is /first and foremost the responsibility of management of the scope where they are applied, under the '4 eyes' principle. First degree permanent controls are applied to the tasks carried out by all Departments of the Bank. It is the Departments themselves that de/fine them and implement them whilst delegating responsibility to the operational staff within their scopes.\n\nOperational staff are therefore expected to remain vigilant at all times to the transactions they handle. This vigilance cover all procedures introduced to ensure the compliance, security, validity and completeness of transactions. Each line manager must check, for the activities for which he/she has responsibility that his/her staff are aware of and comply with the rules and internal procedures for processing transactions.\n\n## SECOND-DEGREE, FIRST-LEVEL CONTROLS\n\nThey are performed in a hierarchical environment which is independent from the environment in which the action being audited was carried out. This is what they are described as 'second degree' controls. They are applied to situations considered to be suf/ficiently sensitive to require, under regulations or as a result of a management decision, a segregation of tasks in the implementation phase, or an independent perspective.\n\nIn certain con/figurations, permanent level 2.1 controls may be activated in the absence of permanent level 1 controls.\n\n## SECOND-DEGREE, SECOND-LEVEL CONTROLS\n\nThey are performed in a hierarchical environment which is independent from the environment in which the action being audited was carried out, hence the 'second degree' description.",

This operational independence is re/flected in the 'second level' suf/fix added to their second degree status.\n\nThe second level, second degree (more frequently referred to as '2.2') controls apply in different situations:\n\n- y performing /final controls and analysis based on the results of level 2.1 controls. This is part of a chain of permanent controls comprising the three pillars;\n- y Checking the quality of a specialised second degree, /first level control relating to aggregated elements or a set of processes, if the risk represented by these elements or these processes is considered suf/ficiently sensitive;\n- y In the case of an unexpected audit or when there is an incident, checking the quality of a /first degree control when there is no second degree, /first level control.\n\nThe systematic 'triplication' of permanent control (levels 1, 2.1 and 2.2) is not standard and must be justi/fied by the level of risk of the action. Neither should a level 2.2 control compensate for the absence of a level 1 or 2.1 control in situations in which one or the other should normally exist, except for in very exceptional cases (closure of a unit, unexpected absence of a particular person, user back-up plan, etc.).\n\n## RISK AND PERMANENT CONTROL DEPARTMENT\n\nThe roles and responsibilities in respect of risk management are outlined in the section above, entitled 'Structure of the Risk function'.\n\n## \u008a Risk projects\n\nThe Credit & Counterparty Operations Domain Committee is managed by the APM (Architecture & Project Management) team, a project team which reports to the 'Risk and Permanent Control' Department of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. This programme meets the objective of signi/ficantly and continuously improving the counterparty risk control mechanism, while meeting new regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Credit & Counterparty Operations Domain Committee, chaired by the Head of Risk, who is a member of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Committee, brings together risk department managers, representatives of the business lines concerned and from IT, and monitors the projects selected:\n\n- y The purpose of Project RADaR (Risk Analytics Data Reporting)/ PRISM is to provide users with a single platform covering all data, easy access to consistent data (and data sources), creation of calculation libraries developed by quantitative risk research teams. Interface via the SAP BI systems for the production of internal and regulatory reporting and PRISM for exploratory analysis, simulations and real-time adjustments.\n- y Processing of technical obsolescence/upgrades: a project that aims to technically improve and upgrade systems requiring development to facilitate functional maintenance and operability and reduce operational risk, such as: Decommissioning of Mainframe Infocentres (SDP and RADaR)\n- y Project DAFNE: Overhaul of the CA Group counterparty rating system, aimed at replacing Anade/fi, a tool that no longer meets the needs of the risk business lines.\n- y Regulatory & CA Group projects: various functional or technical developments related to changes in the CA Group and regulatory requirements such as: Group changes in CRR V4.3,\n\n- regulatory changes (CRD5/CRR2, COREP 2021, SACCR (June 2021), Default, leveraged /financing, TRIM, Basel 4 reforms, etc.).\n- y Ongoing projects: all major changes to existing systems with a minimum system to be maintained (rating, credit approval, authorisation tools, certi/fications, calculation engines, control and monitoring tools for outstandings/authorisations, operational risk tools) aimed at meeting new business needs, regulatory requests, recommendations arising from various inspections and various requests for contributions.\n- y Project MASAI FRTB: led by RPC and sponsored by GMD and RPC, aiming to introduce:\n- - A new market risks ecosystem based on Big Data technology to address a strong increase in data volumes and signi/ficant complexity of market risk indicators;\n- - Compliance with the regulations of BCBS 239 principles with the introduction of a new Market Risks Operating Model;\n- - the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), which applies to the trading portfolio, with an initial deliverable covering the FRTB-Standardised Approach (/first report in September 2021);\n- - Daily Stress: new project aimed at signi/ficantly improving stress capacities in market activities.\n\n## \u008a Credit risks\n\nAny counterparty or group of counterparties is subject to limitations within the framework of speci/fic procedures.\n\nThe decision process is based on two authorised signatures from the front of/fice (one as responsible for the application, the other being the relevant Delegatee) as well as an independent RPC opinion issued by an Authorised Signatory. If the RPC's opinion is negative, the decision-making power is passed on to the Chairman of the Committee immediately above.\n\nCredit decisions are governed by risk strategies de/fined for each signi/ficant scope (country, business line, sector) specifying the main guidelines (target clients, types of authorised products, overall envelopes and projected unit amounts, etc.) within which each geographical entity or business line must record its activity.\n\nWhen a case is considered to be outside the framework of the risk strategy in force, the normal authorisations do not apply and a decision can only be made by the Executive Management level Committee (CRC). The RPC also identi/fies, as soon as possible, assets that may deteriorate and initiates the most suitable measures to protect the Bank's interests.\n\nThe process for monitoring receivables is enhanced by a system of portfolio and sub-portfolio analyses on group-wide business line, geographical or sector basis. Analysing concentrations and, if applicable, recommendations for the reorganisation of the portfolio are an integral part of this exercise.\n\nIn parallel, the new activities and new products management mechanism (NAP Committee) ensures that all requests made by the business lines are in line with the strategies and risks involved.\n\nIn addition, sensitive cases and major risks are monitored quarterly; other risks are reviewed annually. The adequacy of the level of reserves in relation to risk is assessed every quarter by the Executive Management, on RPC's recommendation.\n\nThis approach is supplemented by stress tests aimed at test the impact of unfavorable macroeconomic assumptions and to quantify the risks to which the bank could be exposed in a degraded environment.",

The country rating, which is reviewed at least once every six months, has a direct impact on the limits set for countries for the purpose of validating their risk-strategy and on the rating of counterparties.\n\n## \u008a Market risks\n\nThe ex-ante management of market risks is organised around the operation of several committees, which assess the risks associated with activities, products and strategies before they are implemented or used:\n\n- y the New Activity or New Product Committees, organised by Business Line, allow the Market Risk teams, among others, to validate business developments before they are launched;\n- y the Market Risk Committee (CRM) meets once a month and oversees the entire market risk framework; it approves market risk limits;\n- y the purpose of the Liquidity Risk Committee (CRL) is to supervise and manage Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's liquidity risks and to ensure the operational implementation of Group standards relating to liquidity risk monitoring;\n- y the Pricer Validation Committee is responsible for presenting and formally validating the pricers that were validated during the year.\n\nRisk  management  is  carried  out  using  diversified  risk measurements:\n\n- y global measurements with market risk supervision centred on Value at Risk (VaR), Stressed VaR (SVaR) and stress measurements; VaR and SVaR measurements are established with a daily probability of occurrence of 1%; stress scenarios include global stress tests (historical, hypothetical or adverse) as well as speci/fic stress tests for each activity;\n- y speci/fic measurements with sensitivities indicators and notional measurements.\n\nFinally, the Valuation and Pricing Committees de/fine and monitor the application of portfolio valuation rules for each product line.\n\nIn 2021, the project to overhaul market risks carried forward with several components including the /filing of the /first FRTB SA reports with the regulator, the switch to new risk-free rates, the continued decommissioning of risk tools and transition to the MASAI central data platform.\n\n## \u008a Operational risks\n\nOperational risk management relies mainly on a network of Permanent Control correspondents coordinated by RPC.\n\nOperational risks are monitored for each business line, subsidiary incidents, as well as their analysis, by Internal Control Committees.\n\nand each region, which ensure the reporting of losses and In addition to actual losses, the operational risk scorecard methodology takes into account provisions, speci/fically for legal disputes since the end of 2013 and tax disputes since the end of 2015.\n\nEach quarter, RPC produces an operational risk scorecard showing movements in operational risk-related costs and associated key events.\n\nRemedial action following signi/ficant incidents is monitored closely, in conjunction with the relevant departments.\n\nOperational risk mapping is now called Risk and Control SelfAssessment. It covers all Departments at the head of/fice, in the\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\ninternational network and at subsidiaries and is reviewed annually. Together with the Compliance and Legal functions, it covers noncompliance risks and legal risks.\n\nRPC Operational Risk Management also monitors French and international regulations concerning capital market activities (Volcker Rule, French Banking Act) and information system security (Information Systems Risk Pilot).\n\n## \u008a Provision of essential outsourced services\n\nAny service or operational task classed as essential must meet certain monitoring requirements de/fined as part of a procedure that sets forth the way in which outsourcing decisions are taken, the elements to be included in the contract and the supervision procedures required to ensure that all associated risks are managed and that the service runs smoothly.\n\nA dedicated governance body (the Outsourcing Committee) keeps track of the services at Executive Management level, complemented by specialist monitoring in the areas that use outsourcing the most (computing and back of/fice).\n\nIn addition, a review of all essential services, including a report on service quality (i.e. analysis of the main incidents and dysfunctions), and contract compliance is presented to the Topmost Permanent Control Committee.\n\n## PERMANENT CONTROL OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nPermanent accounting controls are intended to provide adequate protection against the major accounting risks that may damage the quality of accounting and /financial information in terms of:\n\n- y compliance of the data with laws, regulations and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group standards;\n- y reliability and accuracy of the data, allowing a true and fair view of the results and /financial condition of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and entities within its scope of consolidation;\n- y security of data preparation and processing methods, limiting operational risks in view of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's commitments regarding published information;\n- y prevention of fraud, corruption and accounting irregularities.\n\nIn response to these objectives, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB applied the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's recommendations in this area.\n\nThe Risk Department is responsible for permanent second-degree, second-level (2.2) and consolidated second-degree, second-level (2.2.C) controls of accounting and /financial information, while the Finance and Procurement Department is responsible for second-degree, /first-level controls (see Finance and Procurement Department). For second-degree, second-level controls (2.2), the Risk Department:\n\n- y ensures that the key accounting indicators de/fined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. are adapted to the environment of a Corporate and Investment Bank, deployed in a consistent manner and listed in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's operational risk management tool for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's head of/fice, branches and subsidiaries;\n- y consults the Group's branches and main subsidiaries quarterly through an accounting certi/fication questionnaire in which the Chief Financial Of/ficers (CFO) commit to compliance with accounting standards;\n- y performs documentary checks in accordance with a control plan validated annually by the Finance Department's Internal Control Committee;",

In addition, all PD and LGD models were backtested in 2021, and the results of this work will be presented to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Committee and validated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Standards and Methodology Committee. In addition, benchmarking of our internal ratings was performed on the Low Default Portfolio scopes (Large Corporates, Banks and Sovereigns) with respect to external agency ratings and ratings of other European banks participating in the annual RWA benchmarking exercise organised by the EBA. It should be noted that the purpose of the changes to our existing models and the development of new models is to measure our risks as accurately as possible and to keep pace with the regulatory changes required of banks.\n\nCorrect application of the Basel system is regularly monitored by a Basel Requirements Review Committee.\n\n## \u008a The Finance and Procurement Department: control system for accounting and financial information, global interest rate and liquidity risks\n\n## ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nIn accordance with the Group's current rules, the roles and organisational principles of the Finance and Procurement Department's functions are described in an organisational memo updated in 2021.\n\nWithin the Finance and Procurement Department of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB, Group Financial Control is in charge of drawing up the /financial statements (the individual accounts of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB, the consolidated /financial statements for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group, and regulatory statements for the Company and for the Group). The Department is also responsible\n\nfor providing Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. with all of the data it needs to prepare the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's consolidated /financial statements.\n\nThe Finance and Procurement Departments of the entities that fall within the scope of consolidation are responsible for drawing up their own /financial statements under local and international standards. They operate within the framework of the instructions and controls of the Head Of/fice's Finance and Procurement Department.\n\n## PROCEDURES FOR THE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nThe organisation of IT procedures and systems used for the preparation and processing of accounting and /financial information is provided in procedure manuals and in an accounting risk map updated progressively over time. The Finance and Procurement Department also oversees the consistency of the architecture of the /financial and accounting information systems and ensures the monitoring of the major projects in which they are involved (accounting, regulatory, prudential, liquidity).\n\n## ACCOUNTING DATA\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB closes its results monthly. Parent company and consolidated /financial statements are established using the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's accounting standards, which are circulated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Accounting and Consolidation Department. The accounting treatment of complex instruments and transactions undergoes prior analysis by the Accounting Standards unit of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Finance and Procurement Department.\n\nEach Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group entity produces a consolidation package which is used to populate the general Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group system managed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group Financial Control issues quarterly closing instructions to the Finance and Procurement Departments of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB entities to de/fine the reporting schedules and to specify certain accounting treatments and the type of information to be collected over the period, particularly with a view to preparing the notes to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## MANAGEMENT DATA\n\nMost /financial information published by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is based on accounting data and on management data.\n\nAll management data is checked to ensure that it has been properly reconciled with the accounting data and that it complies with the management standards set by the governance bodies.\n\nEach entity reconciles the main items of its management results with the intermediate income statement balances produced from accounting data. Group Financial Control ensures the same balance at the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB level of consolidation.\n\nManagement data are prepared using calculation methods that ensure they are comparable over time. When published data are not extracted directly from accounting information, the sources and de/finition of calculation methods are generally mentioned to facilitate understanding.\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE FINANCE AND PROCUREMENT DEPARTMENT'S ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nThe Finance and Procurement Department provides seconddegree, /first-level supervision of the permanent control system",

        "page_content": "for accounting and /financial information on a worldwide basis to ensure adequate coverage of major accounting risks that may affect the quality of accounting and /financial information.\n\nAt the Head Of/fice, the work involved in the preparation and control of accounting and /financial information is formalised and reviewed with the Permanent Control Department through the quarterly rating of 2.2 indicators and through the thematic control plan based on documents de/fined annually.\n\nIn the entities, the accounting teams rate the key accounting indicators  defined  by  the  Risk  Department  in  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB operational risk management tool every quarter. Their ratings are subject to spot checks by the Risk Management Department locally and/or at the Head Of/fice.\n\n## RELATIONS WITH THE STATUTORY AUDITORS\n\nIn accordance with French professional standards, the Statutory Auditors examine signi/ficant accounting choices and implement procedures they deem appropriate on published /financial and accounting information:\n\n- y audit of the parent company and consolidated /financial statements;\n- y limited review of the interim consolidated /financial statements;\n- y review of all published /financial information.\n\nAs part of their statutory assignment, the Statutory Auditors submit the conclusions of their work to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Where necessary, they also point out the signi/ficant weaknesses of the internal control concerning the procedures relating to the production and treatment of the accounting and /financial information.\n\nFinally, the Finance and Procurement Department, under a delegation granted by the Audit Committee, approves non-audit services. The fees paid to the Statutory Auditors and the auditors' independence are discussed quarterly during Audit Committee meetings.\n\n## FINANCIAL COMMUNICATIONS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB contributes to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. /financial communications published for shareholders, investors, analysts and rating agencies. The /financial and accounting information for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB activities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB in those reports is prepared by the /financial communication team of the Finance and Procurement Department. It is consistent with that used internally and validated by the Statutory Auditors and presented to the supervisory body of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB.\n\n## GLOBAL INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nTo measure the global interest-rate risk, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses the statistical-gap method, by calculating an interest-rate gap, and draws up stress scenarios. The interest-rate gaps and the results of the stress tests are presented to the ALM Committee which decides on the management and/or hedging measures to be taken.\n\nAs part of the annual review of the Group's risk strategy, the RTIG limits were reviewed by the Group Risk Committee both in relation to the /fixed-rate risk and the NPV (Net Present Value) limit for basis risk. Internal gap limits for interest rate positions in the main currencies other than the euro and the dollar were implemented. For basis risk, given the Index Reform, only basis risk in euros is subject to the index NPV limit.\n\nAs regards the control system, the RTIG management unit is split into a unit in charge of measuring risk and de/finition of risk\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nhedges and a unit in charge of executing the hedges de/fined by the Capital Markets Department.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK\n\nThe management of liquidity risk within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group has been placed under the responsibility of the Supervision Department, which reports to the Assets and Liabilities Committee.\n\nThe existing system for management and control of the risks of illiquidity, availability and prices mainly concerns:\n\n- y the resilience to /financial crises in systemic, idiosyncratic and global risk scenarios over 12 months, 3 months and 1 month. Stress tests are carried out on the position in all currencies and the equivalent in euros and for the Group's main currencies;\n- y the exposure to short-term market re/financing (short-term limit);\n- y balance sheet stability indicators (Stable Resource Position and Credit Collection De/ficit);\n- y the concentration of long-term re/financing maturities;\n- y the medium-/long-term liquidity transformation gap for all currencies and for the main currencies.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has a liquidity risk management platform linked to the Bank's accounting data, which measures regulatory liquidity ratios and Internal Liquidity Model indicators./uni00A0 For the bank's management needs, the LCR and liquidity stress tests (all currencies and dollars) are measured on a daily basis using the management tool, Liquid.\n\nThe main advances made over the course of 2021 in liquidity risk management were the following:\n\n- y Strengthening the stress system, with a review of the liquidity stress standard aimed at incorporating the effects of the Covid crisis.\n- y Continuing to secure the production of liquidity stress tests via an agile platform and enhancement of process automation.\n- y The creation of a dedicated task force to increase the reliability of the daily LCR signal.\n\nRegarding liquidity, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Permanent Control procedure is similar to that of the Group. The minimum control indicators are the same and apply to all major processes in the same way.\n\n## \u008a 'Global Compliance' department\n\nThe roles and organisation of compliance are outlined below in section 2.6.3. Non-compliance risks.\n\n## \u008a 'Legal' department\n\nThe Legal Department's main duties include managing legal risk within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB in accordance with the Decree of 3 November 2014, as amended by the Decree of 25 February 2021, and providing the necessary support to the Bank's Cross-Business Departments and Functions to enable them to operate with minimal legal risk, the mandate and monitoring of the relations with the Bank's external legal consultants and the implementation of an alert system in case of a negative or quali/fied opinion (opinion in which the Legal function discourages completion of a market transaction/deal and indicates the legal risks taken by the Bank if this opinion is not taken into account). The Head of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Legal Department reports back on the work of the Legal Function to the Group's Legal Head and functionally to the Chief Executive Of/ficer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and the Deputy Chief Executive Of/ficer responsible for Finance.",

It reviews the legal risks arising from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's activities, products, services and transactions, and ensure the permanent control of the operational risks generated on its own perimeter.\n\nIt also provides legal consultations to the functional Functions and Divisions, involvement in legal negotiations of operations/ transactions, legal watch, staff training, standard contract modelling, legal policies and procedures issuing, the collaboration to decision-making bodies and procedures as required by the Bank's governance rules. The Legal Function systematically takes part in the process of approving new products, activities and uses in major commitment decisions.\n\nIn 2021, the Legal function continued to improve its permanent control and legal risk monitoring system, in particular through the following actions:\n\n- y updating its operational risk map;\n- y updating its control plan;\n- y following up and implementing the recommendations of the Group Control and Audit Department and more speci/fically those resulting from the 'Management of legal risks' inspection carried out in early 2021;\n- y expanding it documentation base, particularly internationally;\n- y continuing the Innovation project, which is one of the /five\n- pillars of its 2022 MTP; continuing deployment - within the entire Legal Function and\n- for all its activities - of electronic signatures, both internally with the Bank's Business Lines and externally with counterparties, implementing an electronic document management solution covering the Paris-London scope securing the production of legal documentation with the deployment of a contract automation tool, deploying a new legal watch tool at head of/fice and in New York.\n\n## \u008a Information  System  Security  and  Business Continuity Plan\n\nInformation System Security and Business Continuity Plan\n\nThe protection of the IT system and ability to overcome a large scale accident are essential to defending the interests of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB. Within this framework, two units dedicated to dealing with information security and business continuity issues exist:\n\n- y ISS (Information System Security);\n- y BCP (Business Continuity Plan).\n\nIn order to ful/fil their permanent control missions, they rely on a network of correspondents in France and abroad.\n\n## ISS DIVISION\n\nAs regards information security, ISS determines the governance, rules (Information Systems Security Policies), coordinates maintenance of a suitable security level, ensures correct implementation of DRP (Disaster Recovery Plan) systems, management of environments enabling identity control and authorisation management standards, de/finition of security standards, security scans and audits. ISS also acts as an IT security manager on behalf of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on environments that serve Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., in relation with the\n\nCISO (Chief Information Security Of/ficer) of that entity. Moreover, systems and applications connected to the internet and internal servers vulnerable to fraud are covered by special, large-scale veri/fications. ISS also coordinates periodic reviews of employees' access rights to applications.\n\n2021 saw the /finalisation of the second component necessary to comply with French regulations and the follow-up of action plans resulting from the various projects in the cyber security programme. The enhancement of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's main administrative networks, as well as those already operated for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, has been considered and entrusted to CA-GIP as part of a multi-year programme.\n\nThe main achievements and work carried out can be summarised as follows:\n\n- y continued improvement of the new tool for monitoring level 1 and 2.1 controls, with international coverage;\n- y audit and penetration testing of all application resources of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB Group and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., whether visible from the Internet or belonging to a regulated scop (regulatory monitoring);\n- y continued deployment of internet access containerisation tool for back of/fice payment populations;\n- y deployment of a proactive and behavioural protection tool for workstation environments;\n- y regular awareness-raising sessions for existing employees and systematic sessions for new employees, with for example awareness-raising sessions in all Business Line Management Committees. Moreover, the 24 additional awareness-raising sessions was set up for persons having failed phishing exercises (12 in French and 12 in English), and an e-learning module was made available on how to detect phishing attempts, etc.;\n- y campaigns by managers to re-certify the access credentials of all employees (more than 130,000 access credentials) (all access credentials to sensitive applications recerti/fied, around 900 applications, with security exemptions also taken into account);\n- y deployment of the tool used to industrialise access credentials recerti/fication campaigns;\n- y continued deployment of strong authentication (token and certi/ficate holding access cards) on the payment applications scope;\n- y initiation of a pilot phase on the application of strong authentication to workstations;\n- y continued roll-out of NAC (Network Access Control) with the Asia region;\n- y deployment of technical account management Work/flow tools to manage requests and life cycle of the accounts;\n- y deployment of a new identity and authentication management platform to replace the old architecture (new Usignon platform, deployment in conjunction with the implementation of applications for customers);\n- y effective resumption by the CA-GIP/COC teams of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB SOC SIEM with the /finalised migration to the Group solution;\n- y integration of new code analysis tools in CI/CD chains, multi-year 'Security by Design' approach. Doubling of the scope of applications covered;\n- y reinforcement of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB IS compliance management system with French and international regulatory requirements;\n- y roll-out of a portal and mainframe authentication chains;\n- y creation of a technical test environment to assess the capacity to rebuild application chains in the event of a disaster.",

For the head of/fice, the BCP Division puts redundancy measures in place to ensure that business is able to recover within the time required by the business lines in the event of an incident. It supports its correspondents in the international network to ensure that business continuity systems meet the standards de/fined by the head of/fice and by local regulators. Annual tests are carried out to verify Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's recovery capacity both in France and internationally and to validate the mechanism.\n\nThe aim of these systems is to ensure the safety of employees, by adopting special protective measures, and to ensure the continuity of the Bank's essential business activities. An annual assessment veri/fies the effectiveness of the business continuity system. The BCP Division reports on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's level of security at a quarterly committee meeting chaired by the Deputy Chief Executive Of/ficer in charge of IOS (IT & Operations Services).\n\nAs in 2020, 2021 was dominated by the health crisis, which was managed without any major incidents thanks to our BCP systems:\n\n- y regular monitoring of employee location (home/production site/back-up site);\n- y activation, when necessary, of back-up sites, thus enabling critical teams to be divided;\n- y massive use of teleworking.\n\nThe health crisis did not prevent operational maintenance being carried out on the BCP in 2021 either at the Head Of/fice or in the international network. Such work covered:\n\n- y a review of the sizing of the fall-back systems through the BIA (Business Analysis Impact) campaign;\n- y user back-up and IT recovery tests with the stoppage of one Datacentre, recovery on the emergency DC, and endto-end processes, to ensure the correct functioning of all the applications associated with these processes. The results of the tests carried out con/firmed the operational nature of our continuity systems.\n\nIn terms of outsourcing projects (outsourcing, cloud, etc.), BCP is involved in de/fining and validating the service providers' backup solutions.\n\nThe main objectives for 2022 will be:\n\n- y to establish a new head of/fice back-up strategy in the event of the unavailability of local working environments, staff or the mass unavailability of workstations;\n- y to continue awareness-raising and communication initiatives involving all of the Bank's employees;\n- y to improve the resilience of the IT Disaster Recovery Plan in collaboration with GIT and in particular to review our backup solutions in the event of the unavailability of the information system.\n\n## THIRD-DEGREE CONTROLS\n\n## \u008a Periodic controls\n\nThe Group Control and Audit Department carries out periodic controls on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB at all entities falling under its consolidated scope of supervision. The Group had 146 audit\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nemployees, 58 of whom were based at head of/fice at the end of 2021.\n\nAs a third line of defence, the Group Control and Audit Department:\n\n- y analyses the control mechanisms referred to in Article 12 of the Decree of 3 November 2014 and Article 13 of the Decree of 6 January 2021, and those ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the /financial, management and operational information of the areas audited;\n- y ensures that the actual risk level is controlled (identi/fication, recording, control, hedging), particularly credit, market and exchange rate risks, liquidity, global interest rate-risk, intermediation risk, payment-delivery risk, and the various components of operational risk, including the risk of internal or external fraud, the risk of discontinuation of operations, legal and non-compliance risk and those mentioned for the /first time in the aforementioned decree (basis risk, dilution risk, securitisation risk, systemic risk, model risk and excessive leverage risk);\n- y ensure that transactions are compliant;\n- y ensures that procedures are followed;\n- y ensures that the corrective measures decided upon are correct implemented;\n- y assesses the quality and effectiveness of operations.\n\nThe Group Control and Audit Department may also conduct investigations when signi/ficant internal or external fraud is suspected or con/firmed.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Group Control and Audit Department is part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's Internal Audit Business Line (LMAI). Therefore, the Head of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Group Control and Audit Department reports directly to the Head of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Group Control and Audit Department and functionally to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Deputy Chief Executive Of/ficer. The Head of the Group Control and Audit Department bene/fits from unrestricted access to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Management and the Risk and Audit Committees of the Board of Directors. Moreover, the Group Control and Audit Department has no responsibility or authority over the activities it controls, which guarantees its independence.\n\nIn carrying out its work, the Group Control and Audit Department is structured into global business lines. The Group Control and Audit Department's teams are based at head of/fice and some international entities and/or subsidiaries. All Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB internal audit teams report hierarchically to the Head of the Group Control and Audit Department, unless prohibited by local laws or regulations, in which case the local internal audit is functionally supervised by the Group Control and Audit Department.\n\nDuring the 2021 /financial year, the Group Control and Audit Department's audits covered various entities and units in France and abroad on a single-entity or single-subsidiary basis, reviews of business lines and thematic or cross-functional audits, including IT and regulatory audits. The Group Control and Audit Department also carries out speci/fic missions at the request of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Management, its Risk Committee or the Group Control and Audit Department.\n\nAuditing work essentially stems from the annual audit plan determined using an updated risk mapping approach as well as information provided by Executive Management, the other control functions, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's statutory auditors, the risk and audit committees of the Board of Directors, as well as the objectives of Executive Management in terms of internal control and the instructions of the Board of Directors. The Head of the Group Control and Audit Department submits the annual audit plan for the pre-validation of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's Head of General Inspection. It is then presented to the Internal Control Committee before being examined by the Board of Directors' Risk Committee",

The audit plan is then approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nFor work with a global scope or work the conclusions of which are deemed globally relevant, a summary is sent to the Chairman of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Board of Directors, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Management and the head of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's Control and Audit Department. A summary of the main conclusions of the audit reports is presented to the Risk Committee and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's Board of Directors by the Head of the Group Control and Audit Department or their representative, and to the Board of Directors and/or the internal control committees of the controlled departments, as relevant.\n\nThe work carried out by the Group Control and Audit Department and by any external auditing team is subject to a formalised system in which recommendations are monitored. The progress made in implementing the recommendations is monitored by the Group Control and Audit Department:\n\n- y at least twice a year during monitoring assignments;\n- y during thematic monitoring of audit assignments, or as part of investigations conducted as part of a planned audit;\n- y at the request of a department via an 'open-ended' process, in close partnership with its permanent Controller. This process allows the progress of action plans to be recorded between two semi-annual follow-ups.\n\n## 2.4. CREDIT RISKS\n\nA credit risk occurs when a counterparty is unable to ful/fil its obligations and when the book value of these obligations in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group's records is positive. The counterparty may be a bank, an industrial or commercial corporate, a government or government entity, an investment fund or an individual.\n\nThe exposure may be a loan, debt security, title deeds, performance swaps, guarantees given, unused con/firmed commitments or market transactions. The risk also includes the settlement risk inherent in any transaction entailing an exchange of cash or physical goods outside a secure settlement system.\n\nCredit risks were the subject of a taxonomy established at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group level and adapted for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, which is presented in the preamble to the 'Risk Factors' section. This taxonomy is used below.\n\n## 2.4.1 Objectives and policy\n\nRisk-taking in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is done through the de/finition of risk strategies approved by the Strategy and Portfolio Committee (CSP), chaired by Executive Management. The risk strategies are set for each country, business/product line or sector carrying a signi/ficant risk for the Bank within the scope of control of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. They aim to de/fine the principal risk guidelines and to establish the risk budgets within which each business line or geographical entity must conduct its activities, and cover: industrial sectors included (or excluded), type of counterparty, nature and duration of transactions and activities or authorised product types, category or intensity of risks incurred, existence and value of guarantees, overall portfolio volume, de/finition of individual and overall risk level, diversi/fication criteria.\n\nBy establishing a risk strategy for each scope deemed signi/ficant by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the Bank is able to de/fine its risk appetite and quality criteria for the commitments that it subsequently makes. It also prevents undesirable excessive concentrations and allows the risks associated with the portfolio to be diversi/fied.\n\nAd hoc committee meetings to escalate recommendations by business line were also held in 2021 in the presence of Executive Management, the head of the Group Control and Audit Department, the head of the department, business line or support function, along with its permanent controller. They aim to review the state of progress of implementation of the most sensitive recommendations.\n\nThe results of the follow-up of the recommendations are presented to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Internal Control Committee. Where necessary, this process results in the Head of the Group Control and Audit Department exercising his duty to alert the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors' Risk Committee pursuant to Article 26 b) of the Decree of 3 November 2014.\n\nIn accordance with the organisational arrangements shared with the entities of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, described above, and with the arrangements and procedures within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the Board of Directors, Executive Management and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's relevant units are given detailed information about the internal control and risk exposure, the progress made in these areas, and the state of implementation of the adopted remedial measures, as part of an ongoing improvement approach. This information is contained in the Annual report on internal control, risk measurement and risk supervision, but also in regular reporting documents covering business activities, risk and control.\n\nConcentration risks are managed by using speci/fic indicators for certain portfolios that are taken into account when granting loans (individual concentration grid). Concentrations are then monitored a posteriori for the affected portfolios, by analysing the quantitative measure assigned to this use, based on the Bank's internal model. Finally, portfolios are actively managed within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to reduce the main concentration risks and also to optimise its uses of shareholders' equity. FIN/EXM uses market instruments such as credit derivatives or securitisation mechanisms to reduce and diversify counterparty risks. The management of credit risk using derivatives is based on the purchase of credit derivatives on single exposures (see 'Information under Pillar 3 Basel III' Credit risk - Use of credit derivatives section). Use of the securitisation mechanism is described in 'Information under Pillar 3 Basel/uni00A0III'. Similarly, credit syndication with external banks and the attempt to hedge risks (credit insurance, derivatives, MRPAs, etc.) are other solutions used to mitigate concentrations.\n\nMore speci/fically, with regard to counterparty risk in market transactions, the policy on the establishment of credit reserves for this type of risk is similar to credit risk with, for 'performing' exposures, a CVA (Credit Valuation Adjustment) risk assessment mechanism economically comparable to a collective provision, and for customers in default an impairment appropriate to the derivative's situation and taking into account the existence of the CVA established before default.\n\nIn the event of default, the depreciation is assessed in accordance with the same principles as those governing the credit risk provisioning policy: expected loss amount depending on the derivative instrument rank in the waterfall, taking into account the CVA process, with two possible outcomes: either derivatives are left in place (CVA or individual provision), or they are terminated (individual write-off).",

        "page_content": "## 2.4.2 Management of credit risk\n\n## GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF RISK-TAKING\n\nCredit decisions are based on the upstream risk strategies that are described above.\n\nLimits are set for all counterparties and groups of counterparties, in order to control the amount of commitments, irrespective of the type of counterparty (corporate, sovereign, banks, /financial institutions, local authorities, SPVs, etc.). Authorisations vary according to the quality of the risk, assessed by an internal rating of the counterparty. The credit decision must form part of the formally approved risk strategies.\n\nSecond-degree controls on compliance with limits are carried out by the 'Risk and Permanent Control' Department, supplemented by a process for monitoring individual and portfolio risks, notably to detect any deterioration in the quality of counterparties and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's commitments as early as possible.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nIf the risk has deteriorated signi/ficantly since the date that a commitment was established, the impairment policy under IFRS 9 provides for an increase in the hedging of the commitment in the form of a provision.\n\nNew transactions are approved in accordance with a decisionmaking process based on two front of/fice signatures, one from a manager authorised to make such a request and the other from a manager with the authority to make a credit decision.\n\nThe decision is supported by an independent opinion by the RPC approved by an authorised RPC signatory and must take Basel II parameters into account, including the internal rating of the counterparty and the predictive Loss Given Default (LGD) attributed to the proposed transactions. An ex ante calculation of pro/fitability must also be included in the credit /file. In the event that the risk management team's opinion is negative, the decisionmaking power is passed up to Front Of/fice delegatee who chairs the immediate higher committee.\n\n## f Comparison between internal ratings and those of rating agencies\n\n| Groupe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole       | A+   | A       | B+     | B     | C+   | C    | C-   | D+   | D   | D-   | E+    | E   | E-       |\n|------------------------------|------|---------|--------|-------|------|------|------|------|-----|------|-------|-----|----------|\n| Moody's equivalent           | Aaa  | Aa1/Aa2 | Aa3/A1 | A2/A3 | Baa1 | Baa2 | Baa3 | Ba1  | Ba2 | Ba3  | B1/B2 | B3  | Caa/Ca/C |\n| Standard & Poor's equivalent | AAA  | AA+/AA  | AA-/A+ | A/A-  | BBB+ | BBB  | BBB- | BB+  | BB  | BB-  | B+/B  | B-  | CCC/CC/C |\n\n## METHODOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS USED TO MEASURE AND EVALUATE RISK\n\n## \u008a Internal rating system\n\nThe internal rating system covers all methods, procedures and controls used to calculate credit risk, borrower ratings and loss given default /figures for all of our exposures.\n\nIn late 2007, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB received authorisation from the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR) to use its internal credit risk rating system to calculate regulatory capital requirements.\n\nThe methods used cover all types of counterparty and combine quantitative and qualitative criteria. They are developed by calling on the expertise of the various /financing business lines of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB or the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group if they cover clients shared by the entire Group. The rating scale has 15 positions. It has been established on the basis of a segmentation of risk so as to provide a uniform view of default risk over a full business cycle. The scale comprises 13 ratings (A+ to E-) for counterparties that are not in default (including 3 ratings for counterparties that have been placed under watch) and 2 ratings (F and Z) for counterparties that are in default.\n\nThe relevance of ratings and reliability of data used are assured through a process of initial validation and maintenance of internal models, based on a structured and documented organisation applied to the Group and involving the entities, the Risk and Permanent Control Department and the Audit-Inspection business line.\n\nAll internal models used by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB were presented to the Standards and Methodology Committee (CNM) for validation prior to an internal audit and rating by the Group Control and Audit Department. They were also validated by the ACPR on 1 January 2008. In addition, a new internal model review system has been in place since 2014. Each change in internal model is now subject to a second review by the Group Risk Department's validation team before even being presented for validation to the CNM.\n\nInternal ratings of companies are monitored under a system common to the entire Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, serving to guarantee a uniform rating within the Group and to organise backtesting on shared customers.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has ensured that the risk parameters required by Basel II, allowing the calculation of capital requirements, are used as part of the Bank's internal management. They are used by all people involved in the process of granting loans and measuring and monitoring credit risks.\n\nThe data used for granting loans and determining ratings is monitored every two months by a Basel Requirements Review Committee. This committee, coordinated by the Risk Management Department and attended by representatives of all business lines, monitors a set of indicators concerning the quality of the data used for rating purposes, as well as the calculation of other Basel II parameters when granting loans, such as loss given default (LGD), credit conversion factor (CCF), risk reduction factor (RRF), etc. This committee strengthens the implementation by the business lines of the Basel II system and, where necessary, decides on corrective actions when anomalies are detected. It provides important help in checking that the Basel II system is used properly by the business lines.\n\n## \u008a Backtesting system\n\nBacktesting aims to ensure the robustness, performance and predictive power of the Bank's internal models over time. It also serves to detect signi/ficant changes in the structure and behaviour of portfolios and clients. It then leads to decisions to adjust or even recast models in order to take account of these new structural elements.\n\nOn the backtesting of the PD (Probability of default) scope, the following analysis is carried out:\n\n- y consistency between observed long run average (LRA) default rates and the master scale PDs (based on the calculation of a con/fidence interval around the LRA default rate);\n- y analysis of defaults (including discriminating power and more qualitative analysis in the case of low default portfolios (LDPs);",

At the very least, the LGD backtesting of a scope will compare the predictive and historical LGD quantitatively and or qualitatively based on volumes.\n\nThere are three main types of LGD scopes detailed as follows:\n\n- y the specialised /financing scope: in relation to the /financing of assets (Aeronautics, Real Estate/Hotels, Rail and Shipping), predictive LGD is obtained using a theoretical model based on the diffusion of asset values, unlike project /financings, transactional trading and structured commodities, for which predictive LGD is obtained from a grid speci/fic to each model and based on the quality of the sponsor, the asset's liquidity, the recourse phases in relation to the goods or the /final buyer;\n- y the unsecured corporate, bank and sovereign /financing scope: the predictive LGD is obtained using an LGD grid speci/fic to each scope (corporate, bank, insurance, etc.) involving third-party variables such as business sector, level of turnover, risk country, etc.;\n- y the secured corporate, bank and sovereign /financing scope: the predictive LGD is obtained by applying Risk Reduction Factors to the elements secured by a personal guarantee or by collateral and using the unsecured LGD grids for the non-secured elements.\n\nThe  backtesting  of  default  rates  carried  out  on  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Large Clients portfolio in 2021 thus ensures the relevance of PD models. The one-year estimated PD is con/firmed by the default rates actually observed over the period in question, and an even greater period.\n\nFor models within its area of responsibility, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB reports back to the Group annually on the backtesting results, through both the Validation Technique Committee and the CNM, thereby con/firming the proper application of the selected statistical methods and the validity of the results. The summary document recommends, where necessary, appropriate corrective measures (methodology review, recalibration, training effort, control recommendations, etc.).\n\n## \u008a Credit risk measurement\n\nThe  measurement  of  credit  risk  exposures  covers  both drawn facilities and con/firmed unutilised facilities. To measure counterparty risk on capital markets transactions, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses an internal method for estimating the underlying\n\nrisk of derivative /financial instruments such as swaps and structured products.\n\nCounterparty risks in capital market activities are assessed for potential risk linked to /fluctuations in the market value of derivative instruments for the remainder of their life. This is determined according to the nature and remaining maturity of agreements, based on a statistical observation of changes to underlyings. When the netting and collateralisation agreements with the counterparty allow, counterparty risk is measured for the portfolio net of eligible collateral. This method is used for the internal management of counterparty risks.\n\nTo reduce exposure to counterparty risks, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB implements netting and collateralisation agreements with its counterparties (see section 2.4.4 'Credit risk mitigation mechanism').\n\nThe /figures on credit risks are presented in section 2.4.5 et seq. of this chapter and in Note 3 to the consolidated /financial statements (cf. Chapter 6 'Consolidated /financial statements at 31 December 2021' of the present Universal Registration Document).\n\n## \u008a Concentration risks\n\nDecision-making and individual risk monitoring within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB are backed up by a portfolio risk monitoring system that enables the Group to assess counterparty risks for its overall portfolio and for each of the constituent sub-portfolios, according to a breakdown by business line, sector, geographic region, or any delineation that brings out speci/fic risk characteristics in the overall portfolio.\n\nIn principle, portfolio reviews are carried out yearly on each signi/ficant scope in order to check that the portfolio is consistent with the risk strategy in force, to assess the various segments of the portfolio against one another and against any aspects of the operating environment or external factors that may be in/fluencing them.\n\nDifferent tools have been implemented to detect any concentration deemed to be excessive for the entire portfolio, sub-portfolios or at a unit level:\n\n- y unit concentration scales were implemented to give reference points according to the nature, the size, the rating and the geographic region of the counterparty. They are used in the granting process, and subsequently applied periodically to certain portfolios to detect concentrations which may later appear excessive;\n- y regular monitoring and ad hoc analysis are regularly carried out on sectoral and geographical concentrations with recommendations for action then made. Concentration risks may be taken into account to analyse the risk strategies of the business lines or geographic entities;\n- y information is fed back to Executive Management where necessary on the concentration status of the portfolio.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses credit risk modelling tools and in particular an internal portfolio model that calculates risk indicators such as: average loss, volatility of potential losses and economic capital. Average loss and volatility /figures enable Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to anticipate the average risk-related cost in its portfolio, and changes therein. Economic capital is an additional measurement of Basel II regulatory capital, to the extent that it allows a more detailed view of the portfolio through a correlation model and parameters calibrated using internal data bases.\n\nThe internal portfolio model also takes into account the impact of protection (Credit Default Swaps, securitisations) purchased by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Credit Portfolio Management unit. Finally, it measures the effects of concentration and diversi/fication within",

        "page_content": "our portfolio. These effects are studied based on individual and geo-sectoral criteria.\n\nStress scenarios are the /final type of counterparty risk assessment tool. They are regularly produced to estimate the impact of economic scenarios (central, adverse) on some or all parts of the portfolio.\n\n## \u008a Sector concentration risk\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's portfolio is analysed by major industrial sector at regular intervals. Risks within each sector in terms of commitments, level of risk (expected loss, economic capital) and concentration are examined.\n\nConcentration is assessed on two levels: idiosyncratic and geosectoral. The detail of these analyses can be increased depending on the analyst's needs.\n\nMeanwhile, the economic and /financial risks of each signi/ficant sector are analysed and leading indicators of deterioration are monitored.\n\nSpeci/fic stress scenarios are also prepared where necessary, for instance during the strategic review of an entity of the Bank. In the light of these various analyses, measures to diversify or protect sectors at risk of deterioration are recommended.\n\n## \u008a Country risk\n\nCountry risk is the risk that the economic, /financial, political, legal or social conditions of a foreign country will affect the Bank's /financial interests. It does not constitute a different type of risk from 'basic' risks (credit, market, operational), but rather an aggregation of the risks resulting from vulnerability to a speci/fic political, social, macroeconomic and /financial environment.\n\nThe system for assessing and monitoring country risk within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is based on a proprietary rating methodology. The internal rating assigned to each country is based on criteria of /financial strength of the country's government, banking system and economy, capacity and willingness to pay, governance and political stability.\n\nAny regions in which we plan to do business are subject to the implementation of a risk strategy ad initio. Therefore, any region in which authorisations are used must have a previously validated country limit. Risk strategies, validated by the appropriate committee, de/fine country limits. These are de/fined as often as necessary and generally once a year.\n\nThis approach is supplemented by scenario analyses aimed at testing the impact of adverse macroeconomic and /financial assumptions and provide an integrated view of the risks to which the Bank could be exposed in situations of extreme stress.\n\nThe scenarios de/fined by the ECB are analysed.\n\nThe Group's country risk management and control audits are based on the following principles:\n\n- y acceptable exposure limits in terms of country risk are determined when country strategy reviews are performed, based on the assessment of the portfolio's degree of vulnerability to the materialisation of country risk. This degree of vulnerability is determined by the nature and structure of the transactions, the quality of the counterparties and the duration of the commitments. These exposure limits may be reviewed more frequently if made necessary due to developments in a given country. These strategies and limits are validated according to risk issues by the 'Strategies and Portfolios' Committees (CSP) of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and the Group Risk Committee\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n(CRG) of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. in addition to being validated by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB;\n\n- y A country risk system is maintained by the institution and the rating of each country/region in which the Group holds commitments or interests is updated every six months. Speci/fic types of events may call for a review of the rating outside this schedule.\n\nWithin the Risk and Permanent Control Department, the entity in charge of country risk must issue an opinion on transactions whose size, maturity or degree of intensity in respect of country risk are liable to affect the quality of the portfolio using a grid: supervision and management of exposure to country risk, both from a quantitative (amount and duration of exposure) and qualitative (vulnerability of the portfolio) standpoint, thanks to speci/fic and regular reporting on all country exposures.\n\nExposures to sovereign risk are detailed in Note 6.7 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## \u008a Counterparty risk in market transactions\n\nDerivatives  and  repo  transactions  carried  out  by  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB as part of its capital market activities generate a risk of credit in relation to the counterparties to the transaction. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses an internal methodology to estimate the inherent risk in these instruments, taking a net portfolio approach at the level of each client:\n\n- y current risk corresponds to the sum owing by the counterparty in the event of instantaneous default;\n- y potential future risk is the estimated maximum value of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's exposure within a given con/fidence interval.\n\nThe  methodology  used  is  based  on  'Monte  Carlo'  type simulations, enabling the risk of change over the derivatives' remaining maturity to be assessed based on statistical modelling of the change in underlying market parameters.\n\nThe model also takes account of various risk mitigation factors such as the netting and collateralisation arrangements provided for in the documentation negotiated with counterparties prior to transactions being carried out. It also includes exchanges of collateral on the initial margin for non-cleared derivatives, in accordance with the thresholds in force.\n\nSituations with a speci/fic risk of unfavourable correlation (risk that an exposure to a derivative is positively correlated with the counterparty's probability of default as a result of a legal link between this counterparty and the underlying of the derivative) are monitored regularly to identify and integrate such risks in the exposure measurement as recommended by regulations. Situations with a general risk of unfavourable correlation (risk that market conditions have a correlated effect on a counterparty's credit quality and derivative exposures with this counterparty) are monitored through ad hoc exercises in 2021. The internal model is used to manage internal limits on transactions with each counterparty and to calculate Basel II Pillar 2 economic capital via the average risk pro/file (Expected Positive Exposure) using a global portfolio approach.\n\nAs allowed by the regulatory framework, the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR) authorised Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, on 31 March 2014, to use the internal model method to calculate its capital requirements in respect of counterparty risk. This method uses the model described above to determine Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EEPE) and is applied to all derivatives. The same method is used to calculate the value exposed to credit risk for capital requirement purposes to address the risk of credit value adjustment.",

The aim is to adopt practical initiatives as early as possible so as to protect the Bank's interests.\n\n## \u008a Commitment monitoring methods\n\nThe main methods used in this monitoring are:\n\n- y day-to-day controls on credit decision compliance, in terms of amount and maturity date, for commercial transactions as well as capital market transactions, for all types of counterparty and all categories of counterparty risk encountered (in the market activities scope: risk of change, delivery, issuer, cash, intermediation, initial margin and default funds with clearing houses for the capital market scope, loan syndication risk and late payment for the /financing scope, etc.);\n- y the presentation of detected anomalies at the committee meetings to which the relevant Business Lines and Risk & Permanent Control (RPC) departments contribute;\n- y breaches are monitored and may give rise to corrective measures and/or special monitoring with the Business Lines. The frequency of these committee meetings varies depending on the scope: bimonthly for the market transactions scope and quarterly for the /financing transactions scope;\n- y communication to Executive Management of a monthly summary and a quarterly presentation to the Internal Control Committee on anomalies for the market scope.\n\n## \u008a Permanent monitoring of portfolio businesses\n\nSeveral bodies permanently monitor portfolio businesses, to detect any possible deterioration or any risk concentration problem as early as possible:\n\n- y monthly 'Early warning' meetings are held, which endeavour, by various means, to identify early signs of potential deterioration in loans which are healthy but deemed sensitive, in order to reduce or cover the risk exposure;\n- y quarterly reviews of major risks are carried out, regardless of the nature of the borrowers in question;\n- y regular research on excessive unit, sector and geographic concentrations is carried out;\n- y a risk situation is established for counterparty risks on market transactions (variation risk calculated under normal and stressed market conditions), issuer risks, risks on bond repos, and guarantee risks on credit derivatives. Reports on risk management relating to the unfavourable correlation risk on credit derivatives, equity derivatives, mandatory repos and equity loans and borrowing are also produced. These documents are presented to and analysed in the committees dedicated to such matters.\n\nThese steps result in:\n\n- y changes to the internal ratings of counterparties, which are, where necessary, classi/fied as 'sensitive cases';\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- y practical decisions to reduce or cover at-risk commitments;\n- y loans and receivables possibly being transferred to the specialised collections unit.\n\n## \u008a Identification of forbearance measures\n\nSince 2014, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB has identi/fied in its information systems the outstanding amounts that have been the subject of a 'forbearance' measure, as de/fined in Article 47b of Implementing Regulation 2019/630 of the European Parliament and of the Council. A pre-identi/fication procedure is /first carried out, during the loan approval process, in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB studies its clients' credit restructuring requests. Once the forbearance measure has actually been implemented, the outstanding amounts subject to the forbearance measure are declared as such, regardless of their internal rating or their status (performing or non-performing). If the forbearance measure results in a reduction of 1% or more in the present value of the restructured outstandings calculated at the original effective interest rate, it is classi/fied as an 'emergency restructuring', a reason for a Basel default. Outstanding amounts are no longer reported as having been the subject of a forbearance measure after veri/fication at an annual review or an ad hoc credit committee meeting that they meet the exit conditions de/fined in the aforementioned regulation.\n\nOutstanding amounts subject to a forbearance measure are\n\nreported in Note 3.1 to the consolidated /financial statements. A forbearance measure indicates a signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk under IFRS 9. The accounting principles that apply to these outstanding amounts are described in Note 1.3 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## SENSITIVE CASE MONITORING AND IMPAIRMENT\n\nSensitive cases, whether 'under Special Supervision' or bad debts, are closely monitored by the entities, and enhanced surveillance is carried out on a regular basis.\n\nThis review takes the form of quarterly sensitive case committee meetings chaired by the Risk and Permanent Control Manager Sensitive Cases and Impairment, which review the classi/fication of these cases as sensitive cases and determine whether they should be transferred to a specialised team (DAS, UGAM for ship /financing or SGADS for aircraft /financing) and the appropriate level of speci/fic impairment which is reported to Executive Management, which must validate it and then transfer it to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A..\n\nThe de/finition of default that is used complies with the provisions of European Regulation No. 575/2013 of 26 June 2013. Stringent default identi/fication processes and procedures have been put in place on these bases. These are updated as and when regulations change, and were updated at the end of 2019 to incorporate European Banking Authority Guidelines No. 2016-07.\n\n## STRESS SCENARIOS\n\nCredit stress tests are carried out to assess the potential impact the Bank may face (in terms of loss, provisioning and capital) in the event of a serious deterioration in the economic and /financial environment.\n\nThere are three categories of stress test:\n\n- y the /first aims to re/flect the impact of a macroeconomic deterioration affecting the entire portfolio in terms of cost of risk, regulatory capital requirements and impact on the solvency",

Such a scenario is mandatory as part of the strengthened prudential supervision required under Pillar 2 of Basel II. Since 2014, this has been led by the ECB and the EBA, with the aim of testing the /financial solidity of the banks and/ or the banking system as a whole. Since 2016, the results of the regulatory stress tests are taken into account in the calibration of capital requirements under Pillar 2;\n\n- y the second takes the form of budget simulations and aims to stress-test the central budget of the bank on the basis of an economic scenario communicated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. in the budget process;\n- y the third involves targeted stress tests on a particular sector or geographical zone that constitutes a homogeneous group in terms of risks. This type of stress test is carried out on a case-by-case basis as part of the management of risk strategies. It provides an insight into losses and/or capital requirements in the event that an adverse scenario de/fined for the speci/fic purposes of the year should materialise; thus, the selected strategy and notably the amount of the requested budgets may be challenged in light of the creditworthiness of the portfolio to date, and the impact of economic situations potentially adverse to the portfolio in question may also be taken into account. Sensitivity tests may be carried out in addition to these stress tests.\n\nThe economic scenarios used for the projection of risk parameters have been adapted to factor in the beginning of the end of the pandemic. The central scenario included the lifting of mobility restrictions from mid-2021 and a return to pre-crisis levels of activity by mid to late 2022 depending on the business sector.\n\nThe adverse scenario addressed economic overheating, which generated signi/ficant in/flation in the United States as well as economic deterioration in France amid the presidential elections.\n\n## 2.4.4   Credit risk mitigation mechanism\n\n## COLLATERAL AND GUARANTEES RECEIVED\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB requires guarantees and collateral from a signi/ficant number of its counterparties to reduce its risks on both /financing and market transactions.\n\nThe Basel II eligibility principles on accepting and managing guarantees and collateral are de/fined by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Standards and Methodology Committee.\n\nThis common framework ensures a consistent approach across the Group's various entities. The committee documents aspects including the regulatory treatment, valuation and revaluation methods and all credit risk mitigation techniques used within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB then devises its own operational procedures and arrangements for the detailed management of these guarantees and collateral.\n\nCommitments given and received are described in Note 8 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\n## USE OF NETTING AGREEMENTS\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the Basel Committee and the CRD IV European Directive on regulatory capital, the French Regulatory and Prudential Supervisory Authority (ACPR) requires strict compliance with several conditions in order to trigger close-out netting and for it to be included in the calculation of a /financial institution's capital requirements.\n\nThese conditions include: Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB obtaining recent written and reasoned legal opinions as well as proceedings 'in order to ensure at any time the validity of the novation agreement or the netting agreement in the event that applicable regulations are revised'.\n\nClose-out netting is de/fined as the possibility, in the event of default by the counterparty (including in the event of bankruptcy procedures), to terminate ongoing transactions in advance and to be able to calculate a net balance of the reciprocal obligations, using a calculation method stipulated in the contract.\n\nThus, close-out netting is an early netting mechanism with three stages:\n\n- 1.  early termination of transactions under a 'master' agreement in the event of a default or a change in circumstances;\n- 2.  calculation of the market value (positive or negative) of each transaction at the date of termination (and the valuation of any collateral);\n- 3.  calculation and payment of the net single termination balance including the valuation of the terminated transactions, all collateral and outstanding amounts due (by the party liable for the net amount).\n\nCollateral (or collateralisation) represents a /financial guarantee mechanism used in OTC markets, which allows securities or cash to be transferred by way of security or with full title transferred, during the period of the hedged transactions. In the event of default by either party, the collateral will be included in the calculation of the net balance of the reciprocal obligations under the master agreement that has been signed with the counterparty.\n\nThe implementation of the close-out netting and collateralisation mechanism is analysed in each country by reference to the type of contract, counterparty and product. Countries are classi/fied as either A or B.\n\nCountries classi/fied as A are those where the laws and regulations are deemed to provide suf/ficient certainty for the recognition and effective implementation of the close-out netting and collateralisation mechanisms, including in the event of bankruptcy of the counterparty. Conversely, countries classi/fied as B are those where there is a risk that these mechanisms are not recognised or in respect of which no legal opinion has been provided.\n\nThe conclusions of these analyses and the proposals of classification  by  countries  are  presented  for  approval  at meetings of the Netting and Collateral Policy Committee (or PNC Committee).\n\n## USE OF CREDIT DERIVATIVES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB uses credit derivatives and a range of risk transfer instruments, including securitisation, in managing its banking book (see Basel III Pillar 3 disclosures).\n\nAt 31 December 2021, outstanding protection purchased in the form of credit derivatives amounted to \u20ac7.2 billion (\u20ac6.8 billion at 31 December 2020), the notional amount of the short positions was null (identical to 31 December 2020).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB trades credit derivatives with around ten top-tier investment grade , competent and regulated banks as counterparties. Moreover, 64% of these derivatives are processed through a clearing house (60% at 31 December 2020), which acts as a guarantor of these credit risk hedging transactions. Bilateral transactions (i.e. processed outside the clearing house) are conducted with investment grade counterparties, which are competent and regulated, located in France, the United Kingdom",

This segment brings together a diverse range of underlying assets, companies and /financing types, certain of which, such as RBL (Reserved-based Lending, being run down in the US) are usually secured by assets. Most of the exposure in the oil sector relates to operators that are structurally less sensitive to the fall in oil prices (public sector companies, large international companies, transportation/ storage/re/finery companies). Conversely, clients focused on exploration/production and those dependent on industry investment levels (oil services) are the most sensitive to market conditions. After a severe crisis affecting the oil sector in 2016 and amid oil price volatility observed since the /first half of 2020, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB did not record any major problems in its portfolio, which showed good resilience... The 'Oil & Gas' sector, already closely watched for several years, is still extensively monitored and is subject to a very selective exposure approach, and any new signi/ficant transactions are subject to an in-depth analysis of credit risk and CSR when necessary;\n- y the 'Electricity' sector is another component of 'Energy' exposure but has its own characteristics, which are not directly associated with the oil and gas segments. Half of our exposure relates to major integrated or diversi/fied groups;\n- y the 'Property and Tourism' portfolio mainly consists of specialised /financings of quality assets granted to real estate investment professionals. Other corporate-based /financing is mainly granted to major real estate companies and is often accompanied by interest rate hedges. The balance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's commitments includes guarantees issued on behalf of leading French property developers and interest rate hedges for social housing market participants (mainly public sector agencies) in France. The health crisis has weighed heavily on investments and leases. Retails stores have been hit hard by the consequences of lockdowns and the tourism industry has been heavily impacted internationally. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's portfolio, which was of excellent quality before the crisis, has shown its resilience but remains under close monitoring;\n- y 'Aeronautics' sector /financing involves either asset /financing of very high-quality assets, or the /financing of major, worldleading manufacturers;\n- y the 'Automotive' portfolio has been the focus of special attention since the end of 2018 and is focused mainly on large manufacturers, with limited development in the automotive supplier sector. After a signi/ficant increase in our sector commitments in 2020 (+\u20ac5 billion vs. 2019), mainly stemming from the establishment of an exceptional budget for a 24-month period intended to help our top clients meet their liquidity needs in the current health crisis, commitments decreased slightly in 2021 and totalled \u20ac13.5 billion;\n- y the current position of the 'Shipping' segment is the result of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's expertise and background in mortgage /financing for ships, which it provides to its international shipowning clientele. After 10 challenging years, shipping has been showing signs of recovery since 2018 and, aided by a major improvement in tonnage supply, saw a sharp rebound in 2021, although it remained uneven and fragile depending on the sector. However, our portfolio remained relatively well protected thanks to its diversi/fication (/financing of oil tankers, gas carriers and off-shore facilities, cargo ships, container ships, cruise ships, etc.), and by the quality of its /financing structure for ships, secured by mortgage loans and cover from credit insurers;\n- y the 'Heavy Industry' sector mainly includes large global companies in the steel, metals and chemicals sectors. In this sector, commitments to the Coal segment continued to be reduced, in line with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's CSR policy;\n\n- y exposure to the 'Telecoms' sector fell compared with 2020. The sector has commitments to operators and suppliers. It is mainly made up of corporate /financing. The telecommunications sector has shown very good resilience during the Covid-19 health crisis;/uni00A0\n- y the 'Production and distribution of consumer goods' sector mainly comprises large French retailers with a global footprint. Their ratings remain strong despite the competitive environment in which they operate.\n\n## \u008a Breakdown of outstanding loans and receivables by economic agent/uni00A0\n\nConcentrations by economic agent of loans and receivables and commitments to credit institutions and customers are presented in Note 3.1.4 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nOutstanding loans and receivables amounted to \u20ac252.2/uni00A0billion at 31 December 2021.\n\n## \u008a Concentration of the top ten counterparties (clients)\n\nIn terms of commitments, excluding export credit guarantees, these accounted for 6.1% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's total exposure at 31 December 2021, stable compared to 31 December 2020.\n\n## \u008a Quality of portfolios exposed to credit risk\n\nAt December 31, 2021, performing exposures amounted to \u20ac418/uni00A0billion in net outstanding loans. Their ratings broke down as follows:\n\n| Breakdown in %                             | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| AAA (A+)                                   | 21.72%       | 21.24%       | 22.1%        |\n| AA (A)                                     | 4.18%        | 4.96%        | 4.4%         |\n| A (B+ et B)                                | 27.14%       | 27.34%       | 28.7%        |\n| BBB (C+ \u00e0 C-)                              | 33.02%       | 32.08%       | 33.2%        |\n| BB (D+ \u00e0 D-)                               | 10.16%       | 10.57%       | 8.9%         |\n| B (E+)                                     | 1.31%        | 1.10%        | 0.5%         |\n| Commitments under  surveillance (E and E-) | 1.02%        | 1.09%        | 1.0%         |\n\nSource: risks (excluding UBAF, commercial commitments on the balance sheet and offbalance sheet commitments of customers and banks, net of export credit guarantee).\n\nIn 2021, the quality of the portfolio remained broadly stable compared to 2020. The proportion of investment grade ratings held steady at 86% of the portfolio, still re/flecting the high quality of the portfolio.\n\n## \u008a Application of IFRS 9\n\nThe principles used to calculate expected credit loss (ECL) are described in the accounting policies and principles (Credit Risk section) which include, in particular, the market inputs, assumptions and estimation techniques used.\n\nIn order to calculate expected credit loss in the next 12 months and for the entire remaining life, and in order to determine whether the credit risk of /financial instruments has increased signi/ficantly since their initial recognition, the Group draws mainly on data used as part of the regulatory calculation system (the internal rating system, evaluation of risk reduction factors and loss given defaults).\n\nTwo distinct types of forward-looking macroeconomic information are used when estimating expected loss: central forward-",

The baseline scenario, which is based on budget assumptions, is supplemented by three other scenarios (adverse, moderate and favourable). Quantitative models for assessing the impact of macroeconomic data on the evolution of ECL are also used in internal and regulatory stress tests.\n\nThe economic variables are updated quarterly and contain the factors that affect the Group's main portfolios (for example: change in French and Euro zone countries' GDP, unemployment rate in France and Italy, household investment, oil prices, etc.).\n\nThe economic outlook is reviewed each quarter by the IFRS 9 Coordination Committee which brings together the main Group entities as well as any departments of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. that are involved in the IFRS 9 process.\n\nThe central scenario used in the Group's and its entities' central forward-looking forecasting models can be summarised as follows:\n\nThe lifting of travel restrictions, particularly in France from Q2 2021, and the rapid ramp-up of vaccination campaigns, led to a sharp rebound in consumer spending and growth from Q2 2021. This trend carried over into 2022, on the back of resilience to the new waves of the epidemic and despite the supply chain disruptions affecting certain sectors.\n\nIn line with 2021, in/flation will continue to affect the United States and, to a lesser extent, the eurozone.\n\n## \u008a Impairment and risk hedging policy\n\nAccounting standard IFRS 9 came into effect on 1 January 2018, replacing IAS 39. It speci/fies the new accounting classi/fication rules for /financial assets, rede/fines the model and principles of credit risk impairment of /financial assets, speci/fies the methods for recognising the effects of credit risk on liabilities, and /finally details the new hedge accounting methods.\n\n## INDIVIDUALLY IMPAIRED ASSETS\n\nThe breakdown by economic agent and geographic area of impaired loans and receivables due from credit institutions and customers is presented in Note 3.1 to the consolidated /financial statements. These /financial statements describe in detail the impairment on doubtful and irrecoverable loans and receivables.\n\n## ECL BUCKET 1 & 2\n\nImpairment for credit risk under IFRS 9 has the following characteristics:\n\n- y the impairment applies to all asset transactions recognised at amortised cost or at fair value through equity;\n- y impairment under IFRS 9 is estimated based on losses expected from the date of origination;\n- y the ECL estimate is forward-looking, with credit risk parameters that incorporate the bank's outlook on the evolution of the economy and its impact on the portfolio;\n- y a mechanism for allocating performing exposures to two distinct risk categories known as Buckets 1 and 2: a healthy exposure whose risk deterioration from the beginning is deemed signi/ficant will be placed in Bucket 2 resulting in impairment\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\ncalculated over a horizon equal to the remaining contractual term of the transaction. Conversely, when the deterioration is considered insigni/ficant, the exposure is placed in Bucket/uni00A01 and impairment is calculated over a risk horizon of 1 year.\n\nThe amount of ECL Buckets 1 and 2 was \u20ac1,119 million at 31 December 2021.\n\n## \u008a Country risk policy\n\n2021 was dominated by the persistence of the global coronavirus pandemic. Emerging and less developed countries continued to present a mixed bag, with all entering a challenging period (though in no particular order) marked by increased uncertainties: everpresent epidemics, in/flation, rise in US interest rates, slowdown in China, the end of an export cycle for some, the end of the commodities 'super cycle' and supply chain problems.\n\nWhile emerging countries posted an average contraction of 1% in 2020 (-4.7% excluding China), in 2021 economies were on the verge of returning to pre-crisis activity levels, as is already the case for many.\n\nThese countries grew 6% in 2021 and China, which successfully managed the health crisis according to the authorities, was one of the few countries to experience strong growth, reaching 8.2%.\n\nWith regard to developed countries, the United States saw a recovery (5.6%) stronger than that of multiple partners, due to very substantial support measures. US growth rebounded in the wake of the slowdown due to the Delta variant in the third quarter. The eurozone was less affected by the /fifth wave of Covid thanks to its high immunization coverage rate. Nevertheless, it continued to struggle with supply chain issues (weak supply, shortages) that made its economies more vulnerable to any shocks. Even so, fullyear growth reached 5.2% in 2021.\n\nHowever, the end of the health crisis is proving to be an uneven process, due to signi/ficant disparities in the progress of vaccination. Immunization coverage is and will remain one of the main sources of divergence between countries, as it determines the reopening of their economies. This is a key factor that will impact the tourism, aviation and hospitality sectors, which were hit hardest by the pandemic. It has also widened the gap between developed and emerging countries, while also increasing fragmentation in the 'emerging world'.\n\nThe crisis had more devastating and lasting impacts in 2021, particularly in the least developed countries (75 million people estimated to be in poverty), making it dif/ficult to de/fine a global 'emerging' scenario. The pandemic has exacerbated existing political tensions. Rising unemployment, deteriorating social indicators and rising income inequality laid fertile ground for political shocks and the spread of social movements, particularly in emerging countries.\n\nIn/flation has already picked up signi/ficantly, its expected peak has climbed ever higher and its return to central bank targets is now more distant. Global food prices pushed indices higher, along with transport, housing and energy prices (average oil price in 2021: USD 70.7 per barrel, INSEE). Indirect effects multiplied, including impacts on growth, /fiscal balances (and thus debt); and with a particular impact on the social and political climate of different countries.\n\nFinally, the vast majority of governments appear to have grown aware of the climate emergency. However, in this area, what works for advanced countries will not always be the best solution for the least developed countries, and each country will have to make its own assessment and de/fine local solutions to build change. The energy transition thus accentuated this fragmentation between advanced and emerging countries and within the emerging world.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 5 - Risks and Pillar 3\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nAgainst this overall backdrop, the bank downgraded its ratings. In 2021, 11 countries saw their ratings downgraded and 3 saw them upgraded.\n\n## \u008a 2022 Outlook (1)\n\n2022 should be seing the economic recovery move forward, with persistently robust growth for the United States (3.8%) and slowly decelerating yet still robust for the eurozone : 4.4% in 2022 to 2.5% in 2023.\n\nThe main risk for 2022 is the rise in in/flation, above expectations, which could exacerbate growth by eroding purchasing power. Oil, natural gas and electricity prices will remain at high levels, at least in 2022. The year will be divided into two distinct periods. The /first half, in which in/flation and growth are likely to remain strong, favouring an upward trend in interest rates. A second period could begin insofar as central banks, aware of current trends, would step in to keep interest rate hikes under control. Thus, in/flation for the eurozone in/flation could return to 1.5% by end-2022. In the United States , the situation follows the same pattern: a peak of 7% at the beginning of the year, then decelerating to under 3% by the end of the year.\n\nChina is expected to grow 5% in 2022. In 2021, China's growth model was mainly boosted by foreign trade. A slowdown is expected in 2022 with a view to normalising consumption practices sparked by the end of the crisis. The country's growth should therefore be supported by its domestic market, which has to deal with the challenges of the current real estate crisis and reviving domestic consumption.\n\nFor other emerging countries (excluding China), 2022 will also divided, with an initial period marked by high in/flation and additional rate hikes, restricting growth in Latin American and Eastern European countries already experiencing high rates. The /first half of the year is thus likely to be tense, while the second should see constraints relax with less in/flation and fewer supply/ demand imbalances.\n\nGlobal growth could be hampered by the massive resurgence of Covid-19 cases (particularly with the presence of new variants) and additional health measures in several countries. However, the massive deployment of the Covid-19 vaccine in 2021 (which remains slower in emerging markets than in developed markets) reduces the risk of deadly new waves, thus improving business and consumer con/fidence and supporting domestic demand.\n\nIn 2021, the level of debt worldwide exceeded that of 2020. Median debt/GDP rose further from 62% to 64% between 2020 and 2021. Finally, 2022 should be a year of monetary normalisation, with central banks committed - at varying rates to withdrawing the exceptional accommodations established to help countries cope with the health crisis.\n\nIn 2022, the gap will continue to widen between advanced and emerging countries, due to highly divergent vaccination rates. The fragmentation of the emerging world will continue, or perhaps even deepen. In addition, in/flation remains high, particularly in terms of energy prices, jeopardising consumer purchasing power and increasing the risk of social tensions (Kazakhstan). Regional con/flicts, potential sanctions and multiple elections are also risk factors. In many countries, 2022 will bring politics back into economic scenarios.\n\nFinally, Joe Biden's election as President of the United States does not seem to have generated radical changes for emerging countries. Tensions between China and the US are likely to persist.\n\nIn this uncertain environment, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB will continue actively working to support its local and international customers in their business developments, including internationally, while ensuring that the rules of compliance in force are observed and adopting a prudent and selective approach, strengthening exposure to business lines/sectors more invested in CSR and paying very close attention to climate risks.\n\n## \u008a Change in the level of exposure to emerging countries\n\nAs of December 2021, the share of 'Investment grade' countries (i.e. countries with a rating between A and C) both emerging and non-emerging, was relatively stable at 86.1% of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's portfolio (85.6% at end-year 2020).\n\nThe amount of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's exposures (2) to countries quali/fied as emerging countries, excluding those rated A and B amounted to 49.7 billion euros at 31 December 2021, versus 41.3 billion euros at 31 December 2020 (+17.5% over the period including a EUR/USD exchange rate effect and +9.4% excluding this change effect), with predominantly the Asian area and the Middle-East to a lesser extent, recording the largest increases. Within this scope, these exposures are broken down as follow:\n\n- y Asia represents 39.8% (vs. 37.6% at end-year 2020). The portfolio grew by +15.9% over the year (in USD), it is primarily concentrated in China and India.\n- y The Middle-East and North Africa account for 34.4% of the risks of this group (35.2% in 2020). The main exposures are concentrated in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.\n- y Latin America: this region accounts for 13.5% of this scope, down comparing to 2020 (14.5%). This decrease is mostly due to a fall in commitments in Brazil and Mexico which represented the highest concentration of exposures in this area, exposures being marginal on Argentina.\n- y Other Central and Eastern European countries, represent 12.3% of this scope (vs. 12.7% in 2020), mainly in Russia.",

FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nFinancial risks were the subject of a taxonomy established at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group level and adapted for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, which is presented in the preamble to the 'Risk Factors' section. This taxonomy is used below.\n\n## 2.5.1 Market risks\n\nMarket Risks are managed by the Market and Counterparty Risks (MCR) Department. MCR is in charge of identifying, measuring and monitoring market, liquidity and counterparty risks in market transactions as well as the independent valuation of results.\n\nFor example, several relevant market risks for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB can be identi/fied, potential losses associated with:\n\n- These risks are assessed in detail: maturity, underlying interest\n- y Changes in interest rates rate indices, currencies;\n- y Changes in share prices\n- Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Equity Risk is mainly concentrated in European Large Corporates (/financing, equity investment guarantee,  management  of  Company  Savings  Plans, convertible issues, loans/borrowings) and EMTNs on equity indices;\n- y Deterioration in credit quality Due to its market-making activity on the main debts of OECD countries as well as on client issues, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is exposed to changes in the risk premiums on the securities in which it trades;\n- y Changes in exchange rates\n- Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's business with our Investor or Corporate clients exposes it to foreign exchange market /fluctuations. Its operations in multiple countries also results in structural foreign exchange positions managed by the Asset and Liability Management Committees;\n- y Interest rate and currency volatility Some derivatives see their market value change due to the volatility of the underlying, rather than market volatility. These risks are governed by speci/fic limits.\n\n## 2.5.1.1 MARKET RISK CONTROL SYSTEM\n\n## \u008a Scope of authority\n\nMCR's scope of authority covers all trading portfolios of consolidated entities in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's accounts subsidiaries or branches - in France and abroad; the main\n\nbusiness lines are: Macro Trading, Non-Linear, Credit and Equities. MCR also monitors the market risks of Treasury and Credit Portfolio Management (CPM), whose dual role is to manage Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's macro counterparty risk and to minimise the cost of capital of the banking books.\n\n## \u008a Market risks - structure and responsibilities\n\nMCR's structure complies with the regulatory environment and the development of market activities.\n\nThe basic principles that prevail in the organisation and operation of MCR are:\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- y independence of the Risk function from the operational divisions (Front Of/fices) and other functional departments (Back Of/fices, Middle Of/fices, Finance);\n- y organisation that guarantees both the appropriate and specialised processing of each type of market activity and the consistent deployment of methodologies and practices, regardless of where the activity is conducted or where it is recorded for accounting purposes.\n\nIts various responsibilities are broken down as follows:\n\n- y Market Activity Monitoring is responsible for:\n- - daily validation of operating results and market and liquidity risk indicators for all activities governed by market risk limits;\n- - control and validation of market parameters in an independant environment from the Front Of/fice.\n- - Finally, as part of its joint responsibility with the Finance Department, it participates in the monthly reconciliation between the operational and the accounting results;\n- y Risk Management monitors and controls market risks for all product lines, i.e.:\n- - setting limits, monitoring limit breaches and their resolution, as well as signi/ficant changes in results, which are noti/fied to the Market Risk Committee;\n- - analysis of risks incurred by product line;\n- - second-level validation of risks and monthly reserves;\n- y the cross-functional teams round out this system by ensuring the harmonisation of methods and accounting treatments between lines/products. They include the following functions:\n- - the IPV (Independent Price Valuation) team notably in charge of validating valuation parameters and mapping observability;\n- - the MRA (Market Risks Analytics) team responsible for validating pricers;\n- - the teams in charge of the Quantitative Internal Model:\n- - the Econometrics team in charge of historical series used in risk measurements;\n- - the Methodologies team in charge of methodologies for market risk measurements;\n- - the Stress Models and CCR (Credit & Counterparty Risks) team in charge of methodology and regulatory subjects related to market activities;\n- - the COO team coordinates cross-business topics (projects, new activities, budgets, reports and committees) and produces the department's consolidated information.\n\n## \u008a Market risk decision-making and monitoring committee\n\nThe entire system is placed under the authority of a set of committees:\n\n- y The Group Risk Committee (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.) sets overall limits within the framework of the Group's risk appetite.\n- y The Strategies & Portfolios Committee (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB) validates the strategic guidelines and acceptable risk management criteria, in line with the Group's and the Bank's risk appetite policy. This Committee, chaired by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Executive Management, includes, among others, a member representing the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.

This Committee, chaired by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's Executive Management, includes a member representing the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group Risk Department, the Market Activities Risk Managers and Market Activities Front Of/fice representatives.\n- y The Liquidity Risk Committee (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB) monitors and analyses liquidity risks and their trends. It ensures compliance with monitoring indicators, speci/fic management rules, established limits and the proper application of Group standards. It also serves as the Liquidity Emergency Plan Committee in the event of a crisis. Chaired by the Executive Management, the CRL also includes the Head of Group Financial Risk, the Head of Group Treasury, the heads of GMD, Treasury and Foreign Exchange, the heads of the Finance Department and ALM and the heads of Market Risk Management.\n\n## \u008a 2021 highlights a/ffecting the market risk scope\n\nUpon various regulators requests, the shift to the new risk-free rates (Benchmarks project) aims to strengthen the benchmark indices in order to control the risks of con/flict of interest, guarantee the reliability of the methods and data used to calculate benchmarks, avoid manipulation risk and protect consumers. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB spent considerable effort on this project throughout the year, calling for a number of internal and external adjustments, resulting in the discontinued publication of LIBOR GBP, CHF, JPY and EUR after 31/12/2021.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB also continued to roll out its new Market Risk ecosystem (MASAI). Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB decommissioned several activities (structured interest rate product scope + local scopes in Asia) and implemented a number of cross-business functionalities (FRTB SA, observability mapping and initial batches of automated reserve calculations). The implementation of this new system includes the following elements: implementation of data management principles, centralisation of valuation methods, industrialisation, audit trail and measures for analysing and monitoring market risk indicators.\n\nIn line with the Decree of June 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB implemented the new SA-CCR standard methodology for calculating counterparty credit risk exposure provided for by European Regulation CRR2. This methodology is used for scopes not eligible for the internal counterparty credit risk model (IMM), as well as for the assessment of the leverage ratio and large exposures.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is continuing its remediation work following the ECB Targeted Review of Internal Models (TRIM):\n\n- y 2017 on Value-at-Risk (VaR), Stressed Value at Risk (SVaR) models, models for incremental default and migration risks (IRC). This remediation work is almost complete.\n- y 2018 (TRIMX) regarding counterparty credit risk (CCR) models. The remediation of certain recommendations is in progress.\n\n## 2.5.1.2 MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT AND MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGY\n\n## \u008a Value at Risk (VaR)\n\nVaR is calculated on daily basis across all positions. It represents the potential on-day horizon loss with a con/fidence interval of 99%. As extreme market conditions are not captured by VaR, it should not be confused with the concept of maximum loss. Stressed VaR and stress scenarios round out the system for measuring extreme risks.\n\n## \u008a Change in regulatory VaR over 2021\n\nChart 1 Regulatory Var over the period 2020-2021 shows the change in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's VaR in the regulatory scope over the course of 2020-2021.\n\nOver 2021, the regulatory VaR averaged \u20ac8 million (a sharp decrease compared to the average of \u20ac14 million in 2020), /fluctuating within a range of \u20ac5 million and \u20ac19 million.\n\nAs from end-March 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's regulatory VaR /fluctuated at much lower levels vs. 2020, as the strong market variations observed at the peak of the Covid-19 crisis (March 2020) were removed from the VaR history.\n\nAt end-December, six VaR backtesting exceptions were recorded over a rolling 12-month period, with theoretical losses - theoretical P&L equivalent to daily P&L excluding reserves and new transactions - exceeding VaR (excluding transactions recorded at D). These exceptions must be considered in determining the amount of Own Funds.\n\nChart No. 2 (Evolution of quarterly averages over the period 20202021) shows the change in the quarterly averages of regulatory VaR and the VaR for each of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's business lines since 1 January 2020.\n\nAll of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's activities are based on the internal model, with the exception of a few isolated products, which still use the standardised approach.\n\n## f Change in regulatory VaR\n\n|                 | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2020   |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| \u20ac million       | Minimum      | Average      | Maximum      | End of year  | Minimum      | Average      | Maximum      | End of year  |\n| Total VaR       | 5            | 8            | 19           | 9            | 7            | 14           | 24           | 9            |\n| Netting Effect  | (4)          | (8)          | (16)         | (7)          | (2)          | (9)          | (20)         | (10)         |\n| Rates VaR       | 3            | 6            | 16           | 6            | 5            | 11           | 16           | 8            |\n| Equity VaR      | 1            | 2            | 4            | 2            | 1            | 2            | 3            | 2            |\n| Fx VaR          | 2            | 3            | 7            | 4            | 1            | 3            | 13           | 5            |\n| Commodities VaR | 0            | 0            | 0            | 0            | 0            | 0            | 2            | 0            |\n| Credit VaR      | 2            | 4            | 8            | 3            | 3            | 7            | 12           | 4            |",

This shock can be economic (economic slowdown, for example) or geopolitical (con/flict between countries).\n\nIn order to meet the regulator's requirements and to supplement VaR measurements, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB applies stress scenarios to its market activities in order to assess the impact of particularly severe disruptions (which cannot be anticipated or modelled in VaR) on the value of its books. These scenarios are based on three complementary approaches:\n\n- 1.  Historical approaches, which consist in replicating the effect of major crises from the past on the current portfolio. The following historical scenarios are used:\n- - 1994 crisis: bond crisis scenario;\n- - 1998 crisis: credit market crisis scenario, the assumptions of which are the decline in the equity markets, the sharp rise in interest rates and the decline in emerging currencies;\n- - 1987 crisis: stock market crash scenario;\n- - October and November 2008 crises (replicating market conditions following the failure of Lehman Brothers).\n- 2.  Hypothetical scenarios, which anticipate likely shocks, developed in collaboration with economists. Hypothetical scenarios are:\n- - economic recovery (rally on the equity and commodity markets,\n\nsharp rise in short-term rates and depreciation of the USD, tightening of credit spreads);\n\n- - tightening of liquidity conditions (sharp rise in short rates, widening of credit spreads, decline in equity markets);\n- - a scenario representing economic conditions amid international tensions between China and the United States (increase in volatility and falling prices on the equity markets, rise in the commodity market, steepening of yield curves, depreciation in the US dollar against other currencies, widening of credit spreads).\n- 3.  Two 'adverse' approaches (a ten-year scenario and an extreme scenario), which consist in adapting assumptions to simulate the most unfavorable situations according to the structure of the portfolio at the time the scenario is calculated:\n- - a '10-year adverse stress' approach, which assesses the impact of large-scale and unfavourable market movements for each activity taken individually. The calibration of shocks is such that the scenario has a probability of occurring approximately every 10 years and the period in which the bank incurs events without reacting is around 10 days. Losses measured by this scenario are subject to limits;\n- - an 'extreme adverse' approach that measures the impact of market shocks with a intensity and duration greater than the ten-year adverse stress scenario, in order to simulate events that are rarer but still have a probability of occurring.

In other words, the IRC captures 2 risk measurements:\n\n- y Default risk (or potential losses or gains, following the default of the issuer);\n- y Migration risk, which represents potential losses or gains resulting from a migration of the issuer's credit rating and the associated spread shock.\n\nIRC is calculated with a con/fidence interval of 99.9% over a oneyear risk horizon using Monte Carlo simulations.\n\nSimulated default and credit migration scenarios are then measured using Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB pricers. These values give a distribution, based on which a 99.9% quantile calculation is used to obtain the IRC.\n\nAt the end of December 2021, the IRC capital requirement amounted to \u20ac188 million.\n\n| \u20ac million   |   31.12.2021 |   Minimum |   Maximum |   Average |   31.12.2020 |\n|-------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| IRC         |          188 |       119 |       239 |       153 |          116 |\n\n## \u008a Requirements under the CRD 3 standardised method\n\nThe CRD 3 standardised method is an additional capital requirement for issuer risk not covered by the IRC and CRM (Comprehensive Risk Measure). The /final measure required by the supervisory authorities is the standardised method for securitisation positions in the trading book. The standardised method capital requirement was \u20ac5/uni00A0million at December 31, 2021.\n\n| \u20ac million             |   31.12.2021 |   Minimum |   Maximum |   Average | 31.12.2020   |\n|-----------------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| Standard CRD 3 method |            5 |         4 |         5 |         5 |              |\n\n## \u008a Prudent Valuation capital requirements\n\nUnder CRD IV, the Basel III Committee requires the implementation of an additional prudent measure (Prudent Valuation) to the accounting market valuation. It applies to all trading book and banking book positions recognised at fair market value with a con/fidence interval of 90%.\n\nPrudent Valuation is broken down into 9 accounting adjustments: price uncertainty, liquidation costs, model risk, concentrated positions,  prepaid  credit  margins,  financing  costs,  early termination, future administrative costs and operational risk. All the different categories are then aggregated and deducted from Common Equity Tier 1.\n\nThe calculation of adjustments based on regulatory requirements gave an impact on own funds at end-December 2021 of \u20ac772 million for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB (o/w \u20ac538 million for market risks).\n\n## 2.5.2 OTHER FINANCIAL RISKS\n\n## 2.5.2.1 OVERALL INTEREST RATE RISK\n\nGlobal interest rate risk or interest rate risk on the banking book of a /financial institution is the risk of a change in interest rates in any on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet transaction, except transactions subject to market risk.\n\n## \u008a Objectives and policy\n\nGlobal interest rate risk management aims to protect commercial margins against /fluctuations in rates and to ensure better stability over time in the intrinsic value of equity and long-term /financing components.\n\nThe intrinsic value and the interest margin are linked to the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the net present value and cash /flows of on- and off-balance sheet /financial instruments. This sensitivity arises where the dates on which the interest rates\n\nof assets and liabilities are recalculated are different.",

This committee:\n\n- y examines the consolidated positions determined at the end of each quarter;\n- y ensures that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB complies with its limits;\n- y decides on management measures based on propositions made by the Financial and Strategic Steering Department.\n\n## \u008a Method\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB uses the interest rate gap method, in accordance with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group Standard, to measure its overall interest rate risk.\n\nThis consists in determining maturity schedules and interest rates for all assets, liabilities and hedging derivatives at /fixed or adjustable interest rates:\n\n- y until the contractual date for /fixed-rate transactions; and until up to the rate revision date for adjustable-rate transactions;\n- y according to the economic maturities of transactions indexed to different tenors;\n- y according to implicit or behavioural options sold to customers; and\n- y using model-based conventions for items without a contractual maturity.\n\nThe gap measurement includes the rate hedging effect on fair value and cash /flow hedges.\n\nThis measurement system is adapted for the relevant major currencies.\n\n## \u008a Exposure\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's exposure to overall interest rate risk on client transactions is limited given the interest rate matching rule for each client /financing with Treasury.\n\nThe interest rate risk mainly derives from capital, investments, modelling of non-interest-bearing liabilities and from maturities of less than one year from the Treasury activities of the banking book.\n\nThe Group is mainly exposed to eurozone and, to a lesser extent US Dollar, interest rate variations.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB manages its exposure to interest rate risk using gap exposure limits and based on the net present value of all currencies de/fined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nInterest rate gaps express the surplus or de/ficit on /fixed-rate loans. Conventionally, a positive gap represents an exposure subject to the risk that interest rates will fall over the period in question.\n\nThe results of these measures at 31 December 2021 therefore show that the Bank is exposed to a fall in interest rates beyond the /first year.\n\n| \u20ac billions            | 0-1 year   | 1-5 years   | 5-10 years   |\n|-----------------------|------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Average US dollar gap | (2.53)     | (0.1)       | (0.01)       |\n| Average Euro gap      | +3.59      | + 0.121     | + 0.250      |\n\nIn terms of net banking income sensitivity for the /first year, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB could lose \u20ac163 million inrevenue in the event of a 200-basis-point fall in interest rates over the year, i.e. 2.75% sensitivity for reference net banking income of \u20ac5,913/uni00A0million in 2021, below the limit of 3.5% of reference net banking income set by the Group.\n\nBased on these same sensitivity calculations, the net present value of the loss incurred in the next ten years in the event of an adverse 200 basis point movement in the yield curve is equal to 0.74% i.e. \u20ac206/uni00A0million of the Group's capital at book value, below the \u20ac500 million limit set by the Group.\n\nIn addition, the income impacts of eight stress scenarios (/five historical and three hypothetical) regarding the interest rate gap are measured on a quarterly basis and reported to the Asset and Liability Management Committee.\n\nThe scenarios are those used by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Treasury Department:\n\n- y the historical scenarios include: a major equity market crash (Black Monday in 1987); a surge in interest rates (bond crash in 1994); a sharp increase in issuer spreads (rise in credit spreads in 1998); the 2008 /financial crisis linked to the US mortgage market (two scenarios);\n- y the hypothetical scenarios are based on: the assumption of an economic recovery (rise of the equity market, rates in general, the USD spot rate and oil and a decrease in issuer spreads); a liquidity crisis following the Central Bank's decision to increase its key rates; frictions in international relations as a result of stalled business relationships between China and the United States (increase in US rates, collapse of the US equity market, widening of credit spreads and depreciation of the US Dollar compared to other currencies, especially the euro).\n\nSimulations are calculated based on the sensitivity of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's interest rate gap. This sensitivity is calculated in EUR and USD. The calculation is based on average outstandings.\n\nThe shocks contained in these scenarios are calculated on a 10-day basis, according to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's stress scenario methodology. Sensitivity is 'shocked' in various ways. The result of a stress test corresponds to the net present value in the event of changes in the most adverse scenario's characteristics.\n\nThe application of stress scenarios highlighted relatively limited impacts since the net present value of the maximum potential loss incurred represented \u20ac36/uni00A0million, i.e. 0.13% of capital at book value, and 0.62% of net banking income at 31 December 2021.\n\n## \u008a Internal capital requirement assessment\n\nA measurement of the Pillar 2 capital requirement assessment is carried out to assess currency risks taking into account:\n\n- y a change in the economic value resulting from the application of a set of internal scenarios;\n- y one-year net interest margin driven by interest rate shocks.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the estimated internal capital requirement for interest rate risk was \u20ac62/uni00A0million.",

It is primarily assessed by measuring net residual exposure, taking into account gross foreign exchange positions and hedging and differentially between structural and operational foreign exchange risk.\n\n## \u008a Structural foreign exchange risks\n\nThe Group's structural foreign exchange risk results from its longterm investments in assets denominated in foreign currencies, mainly the equity of its foreign operating entities, whether they result from acquisitions, transfers of funds from head of/fice or the capitalisation of local earnings.\n\nThe Group's policy is to borrow the currency in which the investment is made in order to protect the investment against foreign exchange risk. These borrowings are documented as investment hedging instruments. In certain cases, and particularly for less liquid currencies, the investment leads to the relevant currency being purchased with the foreign exchange risk being hedged depending on the portfolio management policy adopted.\n\nThe Group's main gross structural foreign exchange positions are denominated in US dollars, in US dollar linked-currencies (mainly Middle Eastern and some Asian currencies), in sterling and in Swiss franc.\n\nIn overall terms, the Group's policy for managing structural foreign exchange positions aims at achieving two main goals:\n\n- y regulatory (by way of exception) to protect the Group's solvency ratio against currency /fluctuations; for this purpose, unhedged structural currency positions will be scaled so as to equal the proportion of risk weighted assets denominated in the currencies concerned and unhedged by other types of equity in the same currency; at 31 December 2021, the immunisation ratio of the CET 1 solvency ratio for the US dollar and related currencies block was 77%.\n- y proprietary interests, to reduce the risk of loss of value for the assets under consideration.\n\nStructural foreign exchange risk hedging is centrally managed and implemented on the recommendations of the Structural Exchange Rate Committee and decisions of the Bank's Asset and Liability Management Committee.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB's structural currency positions are also included with those of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., which are presented four times a year to its Assets and Liabilities Committee, chaired by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Chief Executive Of/ficer. They are also presented once a year to the Group Risk Committee.\n\n## \u008a Operational foreign exchange risks\n\nThe Bank is further exposed to operational exchange rate positions on its foreign currency income and expenses, both at head of/fice and in its foreign operations.\n\nThe Group's general policy is to limit net operational exchange rate positions as far as possible by periodically hedging them, without prior hedging of earnings not yet generated except if they have a high probability and a high risk of impairment.\n\nThe Group Risk Committee sets a limit aimed at authorising frictional foreign exchange positions that may arise between the date on which the pro/fit to be hedged is recorded for accounting purposes and the date on which it is hedged against a foreign currency, once known. At 31 December 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's operational foreign exchange position was \u20ac26m within a limit of \u20ac110m.\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nThe rules and delegations applicable to the management of operational positions fall within the scope of the annual meeting of the Group Risks Committee (limits) or the quarterly meetings of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Asset and Liability Committees.\n\nThe contributions of the various currencies to the consolidated balance sheet can be found in Note 3.2 'Market risks.'.\n\n## 2.5.2.3  LIQUIDITY RISK\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB Group is, like all credit institutions, exposed to the risk that it will not have suf/ficient funds to honour its commitments. This risk is realised in the event, for example, of a massive withdrawal of deposits from customers or investors or during a crisis of con/fidence or general market liquidity (access to interbank, money market and bond markets).\n\n## \u008a Objectives and policy\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's primary objective in managing liquidity is to always be able to cope with any prolonged, high-intensity liquidity crises.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group is an integral part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's scope when it comes to liquidity risk management and uses a system for managing, measuring and containing its liquidity risk that involves maintaining liquidity reserves, organising its re/financing activities (limits on short-term funding, staggered scheduling of long-term funding, diversi/fication of funding sources) and balanced growth in the assets and liabilities sides of its balance sheet. A set of limits, indicators and procedures aims to ensure that this system works correctly.\n\nThis internal approach incorporates compliance with all local regulations on liquidity.\n\n## \u008a Risk management\n\nAt Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, responsibility for liquidity risk management is shared by a number of departments:\n\n- y the Steering Department manages liquidity risk (framing liquidity needs, anticipating regulatory changes, formalising the /financing plan, etc.);\n- y the Execution Management department carries out market transactions in accordance with the instructions of the Steering Department and the Financing Plan approved by the Scarce Resources Committee;\n- y the Risk Division is responsible for validating the system and monitoring compliance with rules and limits.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group's Scarce Resources Committee de/fines and monitors the asset and liability management policy. Together with the Executive Management Committee, it constitutes the executive governance body and de/fines all operational limits applicable to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. It is a decisionmaking body, particularly in relation to the monitoring of MLT fundraising and short-term and long-term limits.\n\nThe Liquidity Risk Committee oversees the implementation of Group standards for monitoring liquidity risk at operational level. It de/fines limits for liquidity risk indicators speci/fic to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, monitors breaches of limits and alert thresholds and, where applicable, approves proposals for managing overruns. It also serves as the Liquidity Emergency Plan Committee in the event of a crisis. The internal methods are validated by COTEC.\n\n## OPERATIONAL STEERING\n\nThe Steering Department manages scarce liquidity resources within a framework subject to regulations, the Group's standards",

Liquidity risk management is part of the risk appetite level approved by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Board of Directors. This department is responsible for managing and monitoring liquidity risk, anticipating regulatory changes and, where applicable, related hedging needs, planning issuance programmes and invoicing liquidity to the consuming business lines.\n\nThe Execution Management department is responsible for the operational management of liquidity re/financing.\n\nThe Treasury department is responsible for overall day-to-day management of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group's short-term re/financing activities, and for coordinating issue spreads and managing the Treasury department's liquid asset portfolio. Within each cost centre, the local Treasurer is responsible for managing funding activities within the allocated limits. He/she reports to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Treasurer and the local Assets and Liabilities Committee. He/she is also responsible for complying with local regulatory constraints applicable to short-term liquidity.\n\nThe operational management of medium- and long-term funding is delegated to ALM Execution, which is responsible for monitoring the long-term liquidity raised by the Bank's market desks and issuance programmes, and for checking the consistency of issue prices.\n\n## \u008a Refinancing conditions\n\nIn addition to conventional sources of short-term liquidity (sight and term deposits for Corporate and Private Banking clients), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB implements an active policy of diversifying its sources of /financing, by maintaining diversi/fied access to these markets via multiple-format issuance programmes (Commercial Paper/Certi/ficate of Deposit) and aimed at various geographic areas (New York, London, Tokyo, Australia, Hong Kong, etc.).\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's long-term liquidity resources are mainly derived from interbank borrowing and debt issues that take various forms.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB makes use of its Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) programmes: at 31 December 2020, the amounts issued under long-term EMTN programmes amounted to around \u20ac23.8/uni00A0billion.\n\nBarring exceptions, issues under these programmes for the purposes of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's international and domestic clients are referred to as 'structured', meaning that the coupon paid and/or the amount redeemed at maturity includes a component indexed to one or more market indices (equity, interest rates, foreign exchange or commodities). Similarly, certain issues are referred to as credit-linked notes, meaning that repayment is reduced in the event of default by a third party contractually de/fined at the time of issue.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB also still holds covered bonds issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and backed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's export credit loans.\n\n## MAINTAINING A WELL-BALANCED BALANCE SHEET\n\nIn 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB continued to strengthen its balance sheet structure, with balance sheet strength resulting in surplus stable funding over long-term assets of +\u20ac50.4bn at 31 December 2021.\n\n## \u008a System\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's liquidity management and control system is structured around several risk indicators, the de/finition and control of which are the subject of standards approved by the governance bodies of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group:\n\n- y short-term indicators comprising mainly stress scenario simulations (all currencies and the dollar) the aim of which is to regulate the liquidity risk based on the tolerance levels de/fined by the Group. Short-term debt allows the maximum net amount of short-term market /financing to be controlled. The measurement of static gaps and the monitoring of diversi/fication indicators supplement this system;\n- y medium to long-term indicators used to manage the move towards one year for all currencies as well as the major currencies; the concentration of MLT re/financing maturities, the purpose of which is to allow for renewal at maturity without undue market solicitation;\n- y balance sheet structure indicators, including the stable funding position de/fined as the surplus of stable sources over longterm assets, which is used to protect business lines against reliance on money market re/financing.\n\nThe system incorporates the following regulatory indicators:\n\n- y the purpose of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is to ensure that banks have suf/ficient reserves of high-quality liquid assets (HQLAs) to cover net cash out/flows in the event of a 30-day liquidity crisis. A minimum of 100% compliance with this ratio is required as from 1 January 2018. It averaged 125.4% in 2021;\n- y additional liquidity analysis reports called Additional Liquidity Monitoring Metrics (ALMMs) attached to the LCR;\n- y the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a balance sheet structure ratio, that measures the balance between the stability of funding sources and stable /financing requirements. The de/finition of the NSFR assigns a weighting to each balance sheet item that re/flects its potential to have a maturity of more than one year. The /final text of the NSFR, which was included in the CRR2 banking package, was adopted by the European Parliament on 14 May 2019. The NSFR came into force on 28 June 2021. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB complies with the regulatory constraint, with a ratio of 113% at 31/uni00A0December 2021.\n\nThe liquidity risk associated with securitisation activities is monitored by the responsible business lines and also centrally by the Market Risks Department and the Asset and Liability Management (ALM) Departments. The impact of these activities is incorporated into the Internal Liquidity Model indicators, including the stress scenarios, liquidity ratios and liquidity gaps.\n\n## 2.5.2.4   GLOBAL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK HEDGING\n\nIn managing its financial risks, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB uses instruments (interest rate swaps and forex transactions) for which a hedging relationship is established based on the management intention pursued.\n\nNote 3.4 to the Group's consolidated /financial statements presents the market values and notional amounts of hedging derivatives.\n\n## \u008a Fair value hedges\n\nThe aim is to protect the intrinsic value of /fixed-rate /financial assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates, by hedging them with instruments that are also at /fixed rates. Where the hedging uses derivatives (swaps), the derivatives are described as fair value hedge derivatives.\n\nHedges carried out by Asset and Liability Management cover outstanding unremunerated Wealth Management customer deposits, which are analysed as /fixed-rate /financial liabilities.",

OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from shortcomings in internal procedures or information systems, human error or external events that are not linked to a credit, market or liquidity risk.\n\nOperational risks were the subject of a taxonomy established at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group level and adapted for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, which is presented in the preamble to the 'Risk Factors' section. This taxonomy is used below.\n\n## 2.6.1 Management of operational risks\n\nThe Risk and Permanent Control/Operational Risk Management Department is responsible for supervising the system, and it is overseen by Executive Management through the operational risk section of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Internal Control Committee.\n\n## GOVERNANCE\n\nOperational risk management speci/fically relies on a network of Operational Risk Managers (ORMs) that cover all the Group's subsidiaries and business lines.\n\nThe system is monitored by Internal control committees under the authority of each entity's management. Head of/fice Control functions are invited to the meetings of these Committees.\n\n## IDENTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF QUALITATIVE RISKS\n\nIn accordance with principles in force within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB's Risk and Permanent Control Department has implemented a qualitative and quantitative system designed to identify, assess, prevent and monitor operational risk, as required by the Basel II reforms.\n\nThe Risk and Control Self-Assessment process applies to all Group entities. These risk maps allow Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB to supervise the most sensitive processes and to draw up control plans. They are updated annually.\n\n## IFRS DOCUMENTATION OF FAIR VALUE AND CASH FLOW HEDGES\n\nThe hedging relationships in relation to macro-hedges managed by the Asset and Liability Management Department are documented from the outset and veri/fied quarterly by carrying out forwardlooking and back-looking tests.\n\nFor this purpose, hedged items are classi/fied by maturity, using the characteristics of contracts or, for items without contractual maturities (such as demand deposits), runoff models based on each product's behaviour. The comparison between this maturity schedule and that of the derivative instrument allows the ef/ficiency of the hedging to be assessed.\n\n## \u008a Net investment hedges\n\nThe instruments used to manage structural foreign exchange risk are classi/fied as net investment hedges. The effectiveness of these hedges is documented quarterly.\n\n## DETECTION OF OPERATIONAL LOSSES AND REPORTING OF SIGNIFICANT INCIDENTS\n\nA uni/fied procedure for loss detection and for reporting signi/ficant incidents has been introduced for the entire scope. The data required by the internal model that calculates the allocation of economic capital (in accordance with the advanced Basel II method) are consolidated into a single database that provides historical data for a rolling six-year period.\n\n## CALCULATION AND ALLOCATION OF ECONOMIC CAPITAL\n\nCapital requirements are calculated annually at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB level based on historical losses and supplemented by risk scenarios.\n\nThe capital requirement is calculated by applying the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) model for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB scope, a model that was validated at the end of 2007 by the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR).\n\n## PRODUCTION OF DASHBOARDS\n\nRPC/MRO produces a quarterly operational risk dashboard that highlights signi/ficant events and changes in the cost of these risks. These dashboards contain the main sources of risk (litigation with clients, management of processes relating to market transactions) used to determine preventive or corrective action plans.",

Group's business line subsidiaries, manages smaller risks itself. Highfrequency and low intensity risks that cannot be insured on satisfactory /financial terms are retained in the form of excesses or are insured on a pooled basis within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group by one of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's insurance companies.\n\nThis general framework may vary according to local regulations and  the  specific  requirements  of  countries  in  which  the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB Group operates. This system is generally supplemented by local insurance.\n\n## 2.6.2   Main ongoing legal and tax proceedings\n\nThe main legal and tax proceedings outstanding at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB) and its fully consolidated subsidiaries are described in the 2020 management report.\n\nWith respect to the exceptional events and the litigations set out in this report and updated in the /first quarter of 2021 in the A02 the new developments are mentioned:\n\n- y In the penultimate paragraph of the part relating to 'Euribor/ Libor and other indexes',\n- y In the third paragraph of the part relating to 'Bonds SSA',\n- y In the pre-penultimate and last paragraphs of the part relating to 'Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ('ICE')',\n\nThe main ongoing legal and tax proceedings in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB) and its fully consolidated subsidiaries are described in the management report for the 2020 /financial year.\n\nThe cases presented below are those that are born or have evolved since 24 March 2021, the date on which the 2020 Universal Registration Document was /filed with the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s /financiers (AMF). Are also mentioned the pending cases which have not evolved since that date.\n\nThe main ongoing legal and tax proceedings at 31 December 2021 that may have negative impact on the Group's asset have been covered by provisions equal to the best estimate by the Executive Management based on the information available to it. They are referred to in Note 6.15 to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nTo date, to the best of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's knowledge, there are no other governmental, judicial or arbitration proceedings (including any proceedings of which the Company is aware that are pending or threatened), that may have or have had a signi/ficant effect on the /financial position or pro/fitability of the Company and/or the Group in the previous 12 months.\n\n## EXCEPTIONAL EVENTS AND DISPUTES\n\n## \u008a O/ffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)\n\nIn October 2015, Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB) reached agreements with the US and New York authorities that had been conducting investigations regarding US dollar transactions with countries subject to US economic sanctions. The events covered by this agreement took place between 2003 and 2008.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and Cr\u00e9dit/uni00A0Agricole/uni00A0S.A., which cooperated with the US and New York authorities in connection with their investigations, have agreed to pay a total penalty amount of $787.3 million (i.e., \u20ac692.7 million). The payment of this penalty has been allocated to the pre-existing reserve that had already been taken and, therefore, has not affected the accounts for the second half of 2015.\n\nThe agreements with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Fed) and the New-York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) are with CASA and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB. The agreement with the Of/fice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury is with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB also entered into separate deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with the United States Attorney's Of/fice for the District of Columbia (USAO) and the District Attorney of the County of New York (DANY), the terms of which are three years. On October 19, 2018 the two deferred prosecution agreements with USAO and DANY ended at the end of the three-year period, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB having complied with all its obligations under the DPAs.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole continues to strengthen its internal procedures and its compliance programs regarding laws on international sanctions and will continue to cooperate fully with the US and New York authorities with its home regulators, the European Central Bank and the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR), and with the other regulators across its worldwide network.\n\nPursuant to the agreements with NYDFS and the US Federal Reserve, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's compliance program is subject to regular reviews to evaluate its effectiveness, including a review by an independent consultant appointed by NYDFS for a term of one year and annual reviews by an independent consultant approved by the Federal Reserve.",

These demands covered several periods from 2005 to 2012.\n\nAs part of its cooperation with the authorities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB carried out investigations in order to gather the information requested by the various authorities and in particular the American authorities - the DOJ (Department of Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading Commission) - with which they are in discussions. It is currently not possible to know the outcome of these discussions, nor the date when they will be concluded.\n\nFurthermore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB is currently under investigation opened by the Attorney General of the State of Florida on both the Libor and the Euribor.\n\nFollowing its investigation and an unsuccessful settlement procedure, on 21 May 2014, the European Commission sent a statement of objection to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB pertaining to agreements or concerted practices for the purpose and/or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in derivatives related to the Euribor.\n\nIn a decision dated 7 December 2016, the European Commission jointly /fined Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB \u20ac114,654,000 for participating in a cartel in euro interest rate derivatives. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB are challenging this decision and have asked the General Court of the European Union to overturn it.\n\nThe Swiss competition authority, COMCO, has conducted an investigation into the market for interest rate derivatives, including the Euribor, with regard to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and several Swiss and international banks. This investigation was closed following a settlement procedure under which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A agreed to pay a penalty of CHF 4.465.701 and proceedings costs amounting to CHF 187.012 without any admission of guilt.\n\nMoreover, in June 2016 the South Korean competition authority (KFTC) decided to close the investigation launched in September 2015 into Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and the Libor index on various currencies, Euribor and Tibor indices. The investigation into certain foreign exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF) has been closed by the KFTC according to a decision noti/fied to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB on 20 December 2018.\n\nConcerning the two class actions in the United States of America in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB have been named since 2012 and 2013 along with other /financial institutions, both as defendants in one ('Sullivan' for the Euribor) and only Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. as defendant for the other ('Lieberman' for Libor), the 'Lieberman' class action is at the preliminary stage that consists in the examination of its admissibility; proceedings are still suspended before the US District Court of New York State. Concerning the'Sullivan' class action, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB introduced a motion to dismiss the applicants' claim. The US District Court of New York State upheld the motion to dismiss regarding Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB in /first instance. On 14 June 2019, the plaintiffs appealed this decision.\n\nSince 1 July 2016, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, together with other banks, are also party to a new class action suit in the United States ('Frontpoint') relating to the SIBOR (Singapore\n\nRISK MANAGEMENT\n\nInterbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer Rate) indices. After having granted a /first motion to dismiss /filed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, the New York Federal District Court, ruling on a new request by the plaintiffs, excluded Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. from the Frontpoint case on the grounds that it had not contributed to the relevant indexes. The Court considered, however, taking into account recent developments in case law, that its jurisdiction could apply to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, as well as to all the banks that are members of the SIBOR index panel. The allegations contained in the complaint regarding the SIBOR/USD index and the SOR index were also rejected by the court, therefore the index SIBOR/Singapore dollar alone is still taken into account. On 26 December, the plaintiffs /filed a new complaint aimed at reintroducing into the scope of the Frontpoint case the alleged manipulations of the SIBOR and SOR indexes that affected the transactions in US dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, alongside the other defendants, objected to this new complaint at the hearing held on 2 May 2019 before the New York Federal District Court. On July 26, 2019, the Federal Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs /filed a notice of appeal on August 26, 2019.\n\nOn March 17, 2021, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal of the 2 nd Circuit reversed the dismissal and returned the case to the District Court. The defendants, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB, requested the Second Circuit Court to rehear the case 'en banc' (all the active judges of the Court). This motion was denied by the Second Circuit Court on May 6, 2021. Another motion was /filed on May 12, 2021 by the defendants seeking a stay of this decision remanding the case to the District Court, which was rejected on May 24, 2021. On October 1, 2021, the defendants /filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the US Supreme Court, which decided on January 10, 2022 not to hear the case. A new petition, currently under review, has been /filed by the defendants before the District Court in an attempt to stop this action.\n\nThese class actions are civil actions in which the plaintiffs claim that they are victims of the methods used to set the Euribor, Libor, SIBOR and SOR rates, and seek repayment of the sums they allege were unlawfully received, as well as damages and reimbursement of costs and fees paid.\n\n## \u008a Bonds SSA\n\nSeveral regulators requested information to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for investigations relating to activities of different banks involved in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA (Supranational, Sub-Sovereign and Agencies) denominated in American dollars. Through the cooperation with these regulators, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB proceeded to internal inquiries to gather the required information available. On 20 December 2018, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections to a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB within its inquiry on a possible infringement of rules of European Competition law in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA denominated in American dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB became aware of these objections and issued a response on 29 March 2019, followed by an oral hearing on 10-11 July 2019.\n\nIn a decision dated 28 April 2021, the European Commission jointly /fined Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0 CIB \u20ac 3,993,000 for participating in a cartel in the secondary trading market of Bonds SSA denominated in American dollars. On 7 July 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB appealed this decision to the General Court of the European Union.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB was included with other banks in a putative consolidated class action before the United States District",

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB as well as the other defendants /filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. An order issued on 30 September 2019 dismissed the class action against Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB for lack of personal jurisdiction and, in a subsequent ruling, the Court held that the plaintiffs had in any event failed to state a claim for violation of US antitrust law.

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's risk management system and exposure levels are described in this section and in the 'Risk Management' section of the present 2021 Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Basel 3 agreements are structured around three pillars:\n\n- y Pillar 1 determines the minimum capital adequacy requirements and ratio levels in accordance with current regulatory framework;\n- y Pillar 2 supplements the regulatory approach with the quanti/fication of a capital requirement covering the major risks to which the Bank is exposed, based on the methodologies speci/fic to it (see 'Internal view of capital adequacy' section);\n- y Pillar 3 introduces new standards for /financial disclosures to the market. These must detail the components of regulatory capital the assessment of risks, both with regard to the regulations applied and the activity during the period.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has opted to disclose its Pillar 3 information in a separate section from the Risk Factors and Risk Management section in order to isolate the information that is required to be disclosed under the regulations.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions set out by the CRR 2 Regulation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB publishes the qualitative and quantitative information required for a large listed institution, included in the consolidation scope of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nSolvency management is primarily aimed at assessing capital and ensuring it is suf/ficient to cover the risks to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is or may be exposed in light of its activities. The objective is to secure customer deposits and give the Group access to the /financial markets under the sought-after conditions.\n\nTo that end, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB group measures regulatory capital requirements (Pillar 1) and manages regulatory capital by relying on short- and medium-term forward-looking measures, consistent with budget projections, based on a central economic scenario.\n\nIn addition, the Group employs an internal process called ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy and Assessment Process), developed in accordance with the interpretation of the regulatory texts speci/fied below. The ICAAP includes in particular:\n\n- y governance of capital management, tailored to the speci/fic features of Group subsidiaries and enabling centralised and coordinated oversight at Group level;\n- y measurement of economic capital requirements, based on the risk identi/fication process and a quanti/fication of capital requirements using an internal approach (Pillar 2);\n- y performance of ICAAP stress tests, aimed at simulating capital destruction after three years of an adverse economic scenario;\n- y economic capital management (see 'Internal view of capital adequacy' section);\n\n- y a qualitative ICAAP that formalises the major areas for risk management improvement.\n\nThe ICAAP is highly integrated with the Group's other strategic processes such as the ILAAP (Internal Liquidity Adequacy and Assessment Process), risk appetite, the budget process, the recovery plan and risk identi/fication.\n\nLastly, solvency and leverage ratios are an integral part of the risk appetite system applied within the Group (described in the chapter entitled 'Risk factors and risk management') within the present 2021 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 3.1.1  Applicable regulatory framework\n\nThe Basel 3 agreements have tightened up the regulatory framework by enhancing the quality and level of regulatory capital required and by adding new risk categories to the regulatory framework. In addition, a speci/fic regulatory framework, which provide for an alternative to bank default, was introduced following the 2008 /financial crisis.\n\nThe texts on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment /firms were published in the Of/ficial Journal of the European Union on 26 June 2013. They include Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive, aka CRD 4) and Regulation 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation, aka CRR) and came into force on 1 January 2014, in accordance with the transitional provisions provided for in the texts.\n\nDirective 2014/59/EU (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive) was published on 12 June 2014 in the Of/ficial Journal of the European Union and has been applicable in France since 1/uni00A0 January 2016.

In that regard, the ACPR has provided Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB with an exemption on an individual basis.\n\nThe transition to single supervision on 4 November 2014 by the European Central Bank did not call into question the individual exemptions previously granted by the ACPR.\n\nThe detailed list of entities showing a difference in treatment between accounting scope and prudential scope is presented in the 'Notes to the regulatory capital requirements' section.\n\n## 3.1.3  Capital policy\n\nAt the Investor Day held on 6 June 2019, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB group unveiled its /financial guidance for the Group Project and the 2022 Medium-Term Plan. Targets in terms of income and scarce resources were speci/fied at that time.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s subsidiaries under exclusive control and subject to compliance with capital requirements, including the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group, are allocated capital at a consistent level, taking into account local regulatory requirements, the capital requirements needed to /finance their development and a management buffer tailored to the volatility of their CET1 ratio.\n\n## 3.1.4  Governance\n\nThe Scarce Resources Committee meets each quarter. Meetings are chaired by the Deputy Chief Executive Of/ficer in charge of /finance and are also attended by the Chief Risk Of/ficer, the Head\n\nof Oversight the Head of Cash Management and representatives of the business lines and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. representatives.\n\nThe main tasks of this committee are to:\n\n- y review Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's solvency, leverage ratio and resolution projections for the short and medium term;\n- y validate the main assumptions affecting solvency in line with the Medium-Term Plan;\n- y set the rules for capital management and allocation between the bank's various business lines within the Group;\n- y decide on liability management transactions (subordinated debt management);\n- y keep up to date with supervisory and regulatory developments;\n- y examine relevant issues relating to subsidiaries;\n- y prepare any decisions to be submitted to the Board of Directors' Asset-Liability Committee;\n- y examine any other matters impacting the solvency and resolution ratios at Group level.\n\nRegulatory capital is managed using a process known as capital planning.\n\nThe purpose of capital planning is to provide projections of capital and consumption of scarce resources (risk-weighted assets and balance sheet size) over the horizon of the current Medium-Term Plan, with a view to establishing guidance for the solvency ratios (CET1, Tier 1, total capital ratio), and the leverage and resolution ratios (if applicable).\n\nIt covers the budget components of the /financial trajectory, including structural transaction plans, accounting and prudential regulatory changes, and the reviews of models applied to risk bases. It also re/flects the issue policy (subordinated debt and TLAC/MREL-eligible debt) and distribution policy with regard to the capital structure objectives de/fined in line with the Group's strategy.\n\nIt  determines  the  leeway  available  to  the  Group  for  the development of the business lines.\n\nThe capital planning is submitted to various governance bodies and is communicated to the competent authorities, either as part of regular information exchanges or in connection with one-off operations (such as authorisation requests)\n\n## 3.1.5  Prudential capital\n\n## 3.1.5.1 PRUDENTIAL CAPITAL\n\nBasel 3 de/fines three levels of capital:\n\n- y Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital;\n- y Tier 1 (T1) capital, which consists of Common Equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital;\n- y total capital, consisting of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 (T2) capital.\n\nAll tables and comments below include retained earnings for the period.\n\n## \u008a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital\n\nThis comprises:\n\n- y capital;\n- y reserves, including share premiums, retained earnings, income net of tax after dividend payments and accumulated other comprehensive income, including unrealised capital gains or losses on /financial assets held to collect and sell and translation adjustments;",

Instruments may be converted into equity or suffer a reduction in their nominal value. Payments must be totally /flexible (no automatic remuneration mechanisms and/or suspension of coupon payments at the Issuer's discretion are permitted).\n\nAT1 instruments issued by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB include a loss absorption mechanism that triggers when Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's CET1 ratio is below a threshold of 5.125%.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's phased-in CET1 ratio was 11.68%. It thus serves as a capital buffer of \u20ac8.7 billion for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB relative to the loss absorption threshold of 5.125%.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, there was no applicable restriction on the payment of coupons.\n\nCRR2 introduces eligibility criteria. For example, instruments issued by an institution established in the European Union subject to third-country law must include a bail-in clause in order to be eligible. These provisions apply to each category of AT1 and T2 capital instruments.\n\nThese instruments are published and detailed on the website: (https://www.ca-cib.com/about-us/financial-information/ regulated-information) in Appendix II 'Main features of capital instruments'\n\n## \u008a Tier 2 (T2) capital\n\nThis comprises:\n\n- y subordinated debt instruments with a minimum maturity of /five years and for which:\n- - early redemption incentives are prohibited,\n- - a discount is applied during the /five-year period prior to maturity;\n- y deductions of direct holdings of Tier 2 instruments (including market-making instruments);\n- y the provisions in excess of the eligible expected losses determined using the internal ratings-based approach, limited to 0.6% of IRB (internal ratings-based) risk-weighted assets;\n- y deductions of equity instruments held in /financial sector investments of 10% or less (referred to as non-material investments), for the amount exceeding a cap of 10% of the subscriber's CET1 capital, in the proportion of T2 instruments held out of total equity instruments held; non-deducted items are included in risk-weighted assets (variable weighting according to instrument type and Basel method);\n- y deductions of Tier 2 instruments held in /financial sector investments of more than 10% (large investments), mainly from the insurance sector;\n- y Tier 2 capital components or other deductions (including Tier 2-eligible minority interests).\n\nThe amount of Tier 2 instruments used in the fully-loaded ratios is equal to the Tier 2 capital instruments eligible under CRR No. 575/2013 as amended by CRR No. 2019/876 (CRR2).\n\nThese instruments are published and detailed on the website: (https://www.ca-cib.com/about-us/financial-information/ regulated-information) in Appendix II 'Main features of capital instruments'",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 5 - Risks and Pillar 3\n\nBASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURES\n\n## \u008a Transitional provisions\n\nLess stringent transitional provisions were provided for to make it easier for credit institutions to comply with CRR2/CRD 5, thanks to the gradual introduction of the new prudential treatments of capital components.\n\nAll these transitional provisions ended on 1 January 2018, with the exception of the provisions relating to hybrid debt instruments, which will cease to apply on 1 January 2022.\n\nHybrid debt instruments eligible as capital under CRD 3 and are no longer eligible due to the entry into force of CRD 4, may be eligible for a grandfather clause under certain conditions:\n\n- y any instruments issued after 31 December 2011 that do not comply with the CRR have been excluded since 1 January 2014;\n- y instruments with an earlier date of issue may be eligible under the grandfather clause and are gradually excluded over an eight-year period, with a reduction of 10% per year. In 2014, 80% of the total reported at 31 December 2012 was recognised, then 70% in 2015, etc.\n- y The derecognised share may be included in the next-lower capital tier (from AT1 to Tier 2, for example) if it meets the corresponding criteria.\n\nCRR2 rounded out these provisions by introducing a new grandfather clause: ineligible instruments issued before 27 June 2019 remain eligible under transitional provisions until 28 June 2025.\n\nDuring the transition phase, the Tier 1 capital used in the ratios is equal to the sum of:\n\n- y Additional Tier 1 capital eligible under CRR2 (AT1);\n- y Additional Tier 1 capital instruments eligible under CRR issued before 27 June 2019;\n- y a fraction of the CRR-ineligible Tier 1 capital issued before 1 January 2014, equal to at least:\n- - the prudential amount of the ineligible Tier 1 instruments at the end of the reporting period (after any calls, redemptions, etc.)\n- - 10% (regulatory threshold for /fiscal year 2021) of the total Tier 1 capital at 31 December 2012, which stood at \u20ac4,691 million, i.e. a maximum recognisable amount of \u20ac469 million.\n- - The amount of the Tier 1 capital exceeding this prudential threshold is included in the phased-in Tier 2 capital, up to the prudential threshold applicable to Tier 2 capital.\n\nDuring the transition phase, the Tier 2 capital amount used in the ratios is equal to the sum of:\n\n- y CRR2-eligible Tier 2 capital;\n- y Tier 2 capital instruments eligible under CRR issued before 27 June 2019;\n- y a fraction of the CRR-ineligible Tier 2 capital issued before 1 January 2014, equal to at least:\n- - the prudential amount of the ineligible Tier 2 securities on the reporting date and, where applicable, the remainder of the Tier 1 securities exceeding the 10% threshold (threshold for /fiscal year 2021) for ineligible Tier 1 securities,\n- - 10% (threshold for /fiscal year 2021) of CRR-ineligible Tier 2 capital at 31 December 2012, which stood at \u20ac680/uni00A0million, i.e. a maximum recognisable amount of \u20ac68/uni00A0million.\n\nLastly, the 'Quick Fix' regulation of 26 June 2020 has extended, to 2024, the application of the transitional provisions provided for by the CRR relating to the inclusion in solvency ratios of the impact of applying accounting standard IFRS 9. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB did not opt to apply this provision on the /first-time application of IFRS 9 in 2018. Following the publication of the Quick Fix regulation, the decision was made to opt for this provision as from the recording date of 30 June 2020.\n\nDuring the transition phase (until 2024), the impacts associated with the application of IFRS 9 may be included in CET1 capital, based on a calculation consisting of several components:\n\n- y a static component serving to neutralise some of the impact of the /first-time application of IFRS 9. In 2021, neutralisation was carried out based on a rate of 50%;\n- y a dynamic component, serving to neutralise some of the net increase in provisions recorded between 1 January 2018 and 1 January 2020 on performing loans (compartments 1 and 2 of IFRS 9). In 2021, neutralisation was carried out based on a rate of 50%;\n- y A second dynamic component, serving to neutralise some of the net increase in provisions recorded between 1 January 2020 and the reporting date on performing loans (compartments 1 and 2 of IFRS 9). In 2021, neutralisation was carried out based on a rate of 100%.",

This difference is entirely due to a measure under the Quick Fix/uni00A0 Regulation of 26 June 2020, referred to in the paragraph on transitional provisions, which extended the possibility of incorporating the impacts of the application of IFRS 9 in solvency ratios to 2024. During this transitional phase, the impacts related to the application of IFRS 9 may thus be included in CET1 capital, which the CACIB Group has opted to do as of this reporting date.\n\nFully-loaded Tier 1 (T1) capital totalled \u20ac23.3 billion, an increase of +\u20ac4.2 billion versus 31 December 2020, corresponding to the increase in Additional Tier 1 capital (+\u20ac3.4 billion) due to\n\nseveral issues of additional capital instruments carried out in February 2021 ($0.7 billion), March 2021 (\u20ac0.6 billion replacing the redemption of an issue for the same amount) and June 2021 (\u20ac2.6 billion);\n\nPhased-in Tier 1 (T1) capital stood at \u20ac24.0 billion, up +\u20ac4.0/uni00A0billion compared to 31 December 2020, with an increase in Additional Tier 1 capital of +\u20ac2.9 billion;\n\nIneligible AT1 capital instruments with a grandfather clause were down -\u20ac0.5 billion as a result of a partial buy-back. Furthermore, the total amount of securities subject to a grandfather clause under CRR remained lower, making it possible to include, in addition to CRR-eligible instruments, a debt amount corresponding to a maximum of 10% of the total at 31 December 2012.\n\nAt \u20ac3.9 billion, fully-loaded Tier 2 capital was up by +\u20ac0.3/uni00A0billion compared with 31 December 2020. This change is mainly due to an issue carried out in January 2021.\n\nPhased-in Tier 2 (T2) capital amounted to \u20ac4.0 billion, up +\u20ac0.2/uni00A0billion compared to 31 December 2020.\n\nFurthermore, the total amount of securities subject to a grandfather clause under CRR remained lower, making it possible to include, in addition to CRR-eligible instruments, a debt amount corresponding to a maximum of 10% of the total at 31 December 2012.\n\nBASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURES",

Each of these ratios reports an amount of prudential capital and/or instruments eligible for exposure to risk, leverage or balance sheet size. The de/finitions and calculations of these exposures are described in the section/uni00A03.2 'Composition and changes in risk-weighted assets' section. The regulatory view is supplemented by the internal view of capital adequacy, which concerns the coverage of economic capital requirements by internal capital.\n\n## 3.1.6.1 SOLVENCY RATIOS\n\nThe purpose of solvency ratios is to verify the adequacy of the various capital compartments (CET1, Tier 1 and total capital) to risk-weighted assets arising from credit, market and operational risks. These risks are calculated either using the standardized approach or the internal approach (see section 3.2 'Composition and changes in risk-weighted assets' section).\n\n## \u008a Prudential requirements\n\nPillar 1 requirements are governed by Regulation (the CRR). The regulator also sets minimum requirements within the framework of Pillar 2 on a discretionary basis.\n\n## f The overall capital requirement is as follows:\n\n| SREP capital requirement                    | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Pillar 1 minimum CET1  requirement          | 4.50%        | 4.50%        |\n| CET1 additional Pillar 2  requirement (P2R) | 0.84%        | 0.84%        |\n| Combined buffer requirement                 | 2.54%        | 2.54%        |\n| CET1 requirement                            | 7.88%        | 7.88%        |\n| Pillar 1 minimum AT1  requirement           | 1.50%        | 1.50%        |\n| AT1 component of P2R                        | 0.28%        | 0.28%        |\n| Pillar 1 minimum Tier 2  requirement        | 2.00%        | 2.00%        |\n| Tier 2 component of P2R                     | 0.38%        | 0.38%        |\n| Overall capital requirement                 | 12.04%       | 12.04%       |\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB must comply with a minimum CET1 ratio of 7.88%. This level includes Pillar 1, Pillar 2 (P2R) capital requirements, supplemented by total capital buffer requirements (based on the decisions known to date).\n\n## \u008a Minimum Pillar 1 requirements\n\nPillar 1 capital requirements include a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% and a minimum total capital ratio of 8%\n\n## \u008a Minimum Pillar 2 requirements\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group is noti/fied annually by the European Central Bank (ECB) of the minimum capital requirements following the publication of the results of the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP).\n\n- y a Pillar 2 Requirement (P2R) of 1.5%. This requirement applies to all the capital tiers and automatically leads to capital distribution restrictions (coupons of additional Tier 1 capital instruments, dividends, variable remuneration) in the event of non-compliance; this requirement is therefore public. 75% of P2R can be covered by Tier 1 capital, at least 75% of which must be CET1 capital;\n- y Pillar 2 Guidance (P2G) that is not public and must be fully comprised of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital.\n\n## \u008a Combined bu/ffer requirements and distribution restriction threshold\n\nRegulations have provided for the establishment of capital buffers, to be fully covered by Common Equity Tier 1 capital and subject to the following overall requirements:\n\n| Combined buffer requirement            | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Phased-in capital conservation  buffer | 2.50%        | 2.50%        |\n| Phased-in systemic buffer              | 0.00%        | 0.00%        |\n| Countercyclical buffer                 | 0.04%        | 0.04%        |\n| Combined buffer  requirement           | 2.54%        | 2.54%        |\n\n## MORE SPECIFICALLY:\n\n- y the conservation buffer (2.5% of risk-weighted assets in 2021); which aims to absorb losses in a situation of intense economic stress;\n- y the countercyclical buffer (rate in principle set in a range of 0% to 2.5%), which aims to combat excessive credit growth. The rate is set by the competent authorities of each State (the HCSF in France) and the buffer at institution level being an average weighted by the exposures at default (EAD) of the buffers de/fined for each country where the institution has operations; where the rate of a countercyclical buffer is calculated for a country of operation, the effective date is no more than 12 months after the date of publication, except in exceptional circumstances;\n- y the systemic risk buffer (generally between 0% and 3%, and up to 5% with the approval of the European Commission, and higher in exceptional cases) aims to prevent or mitigate the non-cyclical aspect of the risk. It is set by the competent authorities of each State (the HCSF in France) and depends on the structural characteristics of the banking sector, in particular its size, degree of concentration and contribution to the funding of the economy.\n- y systemically important bank buffers (0% to 3% generally, up to 5% with the approval of the European Commission, and higher in exceptional cases); for Global Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs, between 0% and 3.5%) or for other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs, between 0% and 2%). These buffers are not cumulative and, generally speaking, with some exceptions, the highest buffer applies. Only the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group is a G-SII and has had a buffer of 1% since 1 January 2019. The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group is not subject to such requirements. When an institution is subject to a systemically important institution buffer (G-SII or O-SII) and a systemic risk buffer, both buffers are cumulative.\n\nTo date, countercyclical buffers have been activated in six countries by the competent national authorities.\n\nGiven Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's exposures in these countries, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's countercyclical buffer was 0.04% at 31 December 2021.",

It was de/fined by the Basel Committee in connection with the Basel III agreements and transposed into European law through Article 429 of the CRR, amended by Delegated Regulation 62/2015 of 10 October 2014, and published in the Of/ficial Journal of the European Union on 18 January 2015.\n\nThe leverage ratio is de/fined as the Tier 1 capital divided by the leverage ratio exposure, i.e. the on-balance sheet and offbalance sheet assets after certain restatements for derivatives, transactions between Group af/filiates, securities /financing transactions, items deducted from the numerator and off-balance sheet items\n\nSince the publication of the European CRR2 regulation in the Of/ficial Journal of the European Union on 7 June 2019, the leverage ratio has been subject to a minimum Pillar 1 requirement, applicable as from 28 June 2021.\n\nBASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURES\n\nUnder CRR2, certain Central Bank exposures may be excluded from total leverage ratio exposure when justi/fied by exceptional macroeconomic circumstances. Where this exemption is applied, institutions must meet an adjusted leverage ratio requirement of more than 3%. On 18 June 2021, the European Central Bank announced that credit institutions under its supervision may apply this exclusion given the existence of exceptional circumstances since 31 December 2019; this measure is applicable until 31 March 2022. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB applies this provision and must therefore comply with a leverage ratio requirement of 3.06% during this period.\n\nSince 1 January 2015, it has been mandatory to disclose the leverage ratio at least once a year: institutions can choose to disclose a fully-loaded ratio or a phased-in ratio. If an institution decides to change its choice of disclosure option, when it discloses the new ratio for the /first time, it must reconcile the data for all of the ratios previously disclosed with the data for the new ratio chosen.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has chosen to publish the leverage ratio in a phased-in format.",

Applying this measure neutralised Central Bank exposures in the amount of \u20ac41.3 billion at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe leverage ratio rose +0.50 percentage points in 2021, mainly due to the neutralisation of Central Bank exposures and the increase in T1 capital.\n\nThe leverage ratio is not sensitive to risk factors and, as such, it is viewed as a measurement that supplements the system of solvency management and liquidity management already limiting the size of the balance sheet. For the purposes of managing excessive leverage, constraints are set on leverage in certain activities considered volatility yet limited consumers of riskweighted assets.\n\n## f Leverage ratio - common disclosure (EU LR2)\n\n| \u20ac million                                                   | \u20ac million                                                                                                                                   | 31.12.2021   | 30.06.2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| On-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives and SFTs) | On-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives and SFTs)                                                                                 |              |              |\n| 1                                                           | On-balance sheet items (excluding derivatives, SFTs, but including collateral)                                                              | 368,398      | 341,991      |\n| 2                                                           | Gross-up for derivatives collateral provided, where deducted from the balance sheet assets  pursuant to the applicable accounting framework | 5,120        | 8,550        |\n| 3                                                           | (Deductions of receivables assets for cash variation margin provided in derivatives transactions)                                           | (17,852)     | (18,579)     |\n| 4                                                           | (Adjustment for securities received under securities /financing transactions that are recognised as  an asset)                              | -

Accordingly, the measurement of regulatory capital requirements (Pillar 1) is expanded with a measurement of economic capital requirement (Pillar 2), which is based on the risk identi/fication process and an assessment using an internal approach. The economic capital requirement must be covered by internal capital, i.e. the internal view of available capital de/fined by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nThe assessment of economic capital requirement is one of the components of the ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process), which also covers the stress test programme in order to introduce a forward-looking view of the impact of more adverse scenarios on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's risk level and solvency.\n\nThe oversight and management of capital adequacy from an internal perspective are developed in accordance with the interpretation of the main regulatory texts:\n\n- y the Basel agreements;\n- y CRD 5 via its transposition into French regulations by the Order of 21 December 2020;\n- y the European Banking Authority guidelines;\n- y the regulatory requirements for the ICAAP and ILAAP and the harmonised collection of associated information.\n\n## \u008a ICAAP information (EU OVC)\n\nThe following items meet the disclosure requirements of Article 438 (points a and c) of CRR2.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has implemented a system for measuring economic capital requirement at the level of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the Group's main French and foreign entities.",

        "page_content": "The process for the identi/fication of major risks aims, initially, to record, as comprehensively as is possible, all the risks that may impact the balance sheet, income statement, regulatory ratios or the reputation of a particular entity or of the Group and to classify them into categories and sub-categories, using the same terms as those used for the whole of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. Secondly, the objective is to assess the importance of these risks systematically and comprehensively in order to identify the major risks.\n\nThe risk identi/fication process makes use of multiple sources: an internal analysis based on information collected from the Risk function and other control functions, supplemented by an analysis based on external data. It is formalised for each entity and for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, coordinated by the Risk function and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nFor each of the major risks identi/fied, the economic capital requirement is quanti/fied as follows:\n\n- y the risk measures already addressed by Pillar 1 are reviewed and, where applicable, supplemented by economic capital adjustments based on internal approaches;\n- y the economic capital requirements in relation to risks that are not addressed by Pillar 1 are speci/fically calculated, based on internal approaches.\n\nThe consistency of all methodologies used to measure economic capital requirement is ensured by speci/fic governance within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nThe  measurement  of  economic  capital  requirement  is supplemented by a projection for the current year, in line with capital planning forecasts at that date, in order to incorporate the impact of changes in activity on the risk pro/file.\n\nBASEL III PILLAR 3 DISCLOSURES\n\nThe list of major risks is updated and approved annually. The main risk groups are:\n\n- y credit risks;\n- y /financial risks, including in particular market risks and interest rate and foreign exchange risks in the banking book;\n- y operational risks; and\n- y other risks, including activity risk and climate risk.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the economic capital requirements relating to risks subject to quanti/fication at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB level are covered by internal capital.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. entities subject to the measurement of economic capital requirement within their scope are responsible for its deployment in accordance with the standards and methodologies  defined  by  the  Group.  In  particular,  they must ensure that the system for measuring economic capital requirement  is  subject  to  appropriate  organisation  and governance. The economic capital requirement determined by the entities is reported in detail to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nIn addition to the quantitative aspect, the Group's approach also has a qualitative component that supplements the measurement of economic capital requirement with indicators on the exposure to risk and the permanent controls carried out by business lines. The qualitative component has three objectives:\n\n- y to evaluate the risk management and control system of the entities in the scope of deployment in various areas;\n- y if necessary, to identify and formalise areas in which the risk management and permanent control system may be improved;\n- y to identify any items that have not been correctly analysed by the quantitative ICAAP measurements.",

The counterparty risk is treated in Section III followed by Section IV devoted to credit and counterparty risk mitigation mechanisms.\n\n- y credit conversion factor (CCF): ratio re/flecting, at the time of default, the percentage of the outstanding not drawn down one year before the default;\n\n## 3.2.2.1 GENERAL PRESENTATION OF CREDIT AND COUNTERPARTY RISK\n\n## \u008a Exposure by type of risk\n\nThe table below shows the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's exposure to overall risk (credit, counterparty, dilution and settlement/delivery) by exposure class, under the standardised approach and the IRB approach at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020.\n\nThe 16 exposure classes under the standardised approach are combined to ensure a consistent presentation with IRB exposures.\n\n- f Gross exposure and exposure at default (EAD) to overall risk (credit, counterparty, dilution and settlement/ delivery) at 31 December 2021\n\n|                                       | 31.12.2021 IRB    | 31.12.2021 IRB              | 31.12.2021 IRB   | 31.12.2021 IRB   | 31.12.2021 IRB    | 31.12.2021 IRB              | 31.12.2021 IRB   | 31.12.2021 IRB   | 31.12.2021 IRB    | 31.12.2021 IRB              | 31.12.2021 IRB   | 31.12.2021 IRB   | 31.12.2021 IRB       |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n|                                       | Standardised      | Standardised                | Standardised     | Standardised     |                   |                             |                  |                  | Total             | Total                       | Total            | Total            | Total                |\n| \u20ac million                             | Gross exposure  1 | Gross exposure after CRM  2 | EAD              | RWA              | Gross exposure  1 | Gross exposure after CRM  2 | EAD              | RWA              | Gross exposure  1 | Gross exposure after CRM  2 | EAD              | RWA              | Ca pital requirement |\n| Central governments or  central banks | 1,254             | 1,274                       | 1,224            | 1,009            | 108,608           | 120,404                     | 118,045          | 1,268            | 109,862           | 121,678                     | 119,268          | 2,277            | 182                  |\n| Institutions                          | 11,062            | 30,152                      | 29,897           | 818              | 86,907            | 101,125                     | 91,447           | 7,164            | 97,969            | 131,277                     | 121,344          | 7,982            | 639                  |\n| Corporates                            | 22,363            | 3,209                       | 2,431            | 2,298            | 296,126           | 254,504                     | 206,765          | 69,874           | 318,489           | 257,712                     | 209,196          | 72,172           | 5,774                |\n| Retail customers                      | 303               | 246                         | 246              | 185              | 15,091            | 15,091                      | 15,091           | 558              | 15,394            | 15,337                      | 15,337           | 743              | 59                   |\n| Loans to individuals                  | 303               | 246                         | 246              | 185              | 14,930            | 14,930                      | 14,930           | 547              | 15,233            | 15,177                      | 15,177           | 731              | 59                   |\n| o/w secured by real  estate assets    | -

In addition, the ACPR has since 1 January 2008 authorised Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group's main entities to use the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) to calculate their regulatory capital requirements for operational risk. The Group's other entities use the standardised approach, in accordance with regulations.\n\nThe main Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group subsidiaries or portfolios still using the standardised method for measuring credit risk at 31/uni00A0December 2021 were as follows:\n\n- y Union des Banques Arabes et Fran\u00e7aises (UBAF);\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Miami;\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Brazil;\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Canada;\n- y CA Indosuez Wealth Italy S.P.A\n- y the real estate professionals portfolio.\n\nIn accordance with the commitment made by the Group to gradually move toward the advanced method de/fined with the ACPR in May 2007 (roll-out plan), work is ongoing in the main entities and portfolios still under the standard method. An update of the roll-out plan is sent annually to the competent authority.\n\nThe use of internal models to calculate the solvency ratios has enabled Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group to strengthen its risk management. Speci/fically, the development of 'internal ratings based' approaches has led to the systematic and reliable collection of default and loss histories for most Group entities. The establishment of this data history makes it possible to quantify credit risk today by assigning an average Probability of Default (PD) to each rating level, and for the 'advanced internal rating' approaches to assign a loss given default (LGD).\n\nIn addition, the parameters of the 'Internal Ratings-Based' models are used in the de/finition, implementation and monitoring of the entities' risk and credit policies.\n\nThe  internal  risk  assessment  models  thus  promote  the development of sound risk management practices by the Group's entities and improve the ef/ficiency of the capital allocation process by enabling a more /fine-tuned measurement of capital consumption by each business line and entity.\n\n## EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK USING THE STANDARD APPROACH\n\n## \u008a Credit assessment using the standardised approach\n\nThe Group now uses external credit rating agency assessments to calculate its risk-weighted exposures under the standardised approach. The remaining exposures are subject to fixed weightings (like under Basel I).\n\nExposure categories treated by standard method are classi/fied according to the counterparty type and /financial product type in one of the 16 categories set out in Article 112 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 of 26 June 2013. The weightings applied to these same outstandings are calculated in accordance with Articles 114 to 134 of that regulation.\n\nFor the 'Central governments and central banks' and 'Institutions' exposure categories, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group has decided, in the standardised approach, to use Moody's assessments to evaluate the risk.\n\nAs such, where the rating agency's credit assessment of the counterparty is known, it is used to calculate the applicable weighting. With regard to the counterparties of the 'Institutions' or 'Corporate' exposure categories where the credit assessment is not known, the weighting applied takes account of the credit assessment of the central authority in whose jurisdiction this counterparty is established, pursuant to the provisions of Articles 121 and 122 of the aforementioned regulation.\n\nWith regard to exposures on banking portfolio debt instruments, the rule used involves applying the issuer's weighting rate. This rate is calculated in accordance with the rules described in the preceding paragraph.",

This category also includes certain exposures to regional and local governments, public-sector entities and\n- multilateral development banks that are not considered as central governments;\n- y the 'Corporates' class is divided into large companies and small and medium-sized businesses, which are subject to different regulatory treatments;\n- y the 'Retail' class distinguishes between mortgage loans, revolving facilities, other loans to individuals and other loans to small and medium-sized businesses;\n- y the 'Equity' class comprises exposures that convey a residual, subordinated claim on the assets or income of the issuer or have a similar economic substance;\n- y the 'Securitisation' exposure class includes exposures to securitisation operations or structures, including those resulting from interest rate or exchange rate derivatives, independently of the institution's role (whether it is the originator, sponsor or investor);\n- y the 'Other non-credit obligation assets' class mainly includes non-current assets and accruals.\n\n## \u008a Credit derivatives used for hedging\n\nCredit derivatives effect used as credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques on risk weighted assets (RWA) in internal ratings.\n\n- f IRB approach - effect on the RWAs of credit derivatives used as CRM techniques (CR7)\n\n|           |                                                                        | 31.12.2021                 | 31.12.2021   |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| \u20ac million | \u20ac million                                                              | Pre-credit derivatives RWA | Actual RWA   |\n| 1         | Exposures under F-IRB                                                  | 1,761                      | 1,761        |\n| 2         | Central governments and central banks                                  | -                          | -            |\n| 3         | Institutions                                                           | -                          | -            |\n| 4         | Corporates                                                             | 1,761                      | 1,761        |\n| 4.1       | of which Corporates - SMEs                                             | 64                         | 64           |\n| 4.2       | of which Corporates - Specialised lending                              | 28                         | 28           |\n| 5         | Exposures under A-IRB                                                  | 65,938                     | 63,467       |\n| 6         | Central governments and central banks                                  | 1,029                      | 1,029        |\n| 7         | Institutions                                                           | 2,802                      | 2,975        |\n| 8         | Corporates                                                             | 61,549                     | 58,905       |\n| 8.1       | of Corporates - which SMEs                                             | 394                        | 394          |\n| 8.2       | of which Corporates - Specialised lending                              | 12,179                     | 12,179       |\n| 9         | Retail                                                                 | 558                        | 558          |\n| 9.1       | of which Retail - SMEs - Secured by immovable property collateral      | -                          | -            |\n| 9.2       | of which Retail - non-SMEs - Secured by immovable property  collateral | -                          | -            |\n| 9.3       | of which Retail - Qualifying revolving                                 | -                          | -            |\n| 9.4       | of which Retail - SMEs - Other                                         | 11                         | 11           |\n| 9.5       | of which Retail - Non-SMEs- Other                                      | 547                        | 547          |\n| 10        | TOTAL (including F-IRB exposures and A-IRB exposures)                  | 67,698                     | 65,228       |",

AN ESSENTIALLY MUTUALIST BANKING GROUP\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Articles L. 511-31 and L. 511-32), as the corporate centre of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A. is responsible for exercising administrative, technical and /financial control over the institutions af/filiated to it in order to maintain a cohesive network (as de/fined in Article R. 512-18 of the\n\nFrench Monetary and Financial Code) and to ensure their proper functioning and compliance with all regulations and legislation governing them. In that regard, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. may take all necessary measures notably to ensure the liquidity and solvency of the network as a whole and of each of its af/filiated institutions.\n\n## 1.4. INTERNAL RELATIONS AT CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE\n\n## Internal financial mechanisms\n\nThe /financial mechanisms that govern reciprocal relations within Cr\u00e9dit Agricole are speci/fic to the Group.\n\n## TLTRO III MECHANISM\n\nThe ECB set out a third series of long-term re/financing operations in March 2019, the terms and conditions of which were reviewed in September 2019 and again in March, April and December 2020, in connection with the COVID-19 situation.\n\nThe TLTRO III mechanism aims to provide long-term re/financing with a subsidy in the event of reaching a lending performance target based on growth of lending to /firms and households, which is applied over the three-year maturity of the TLTRO operation. An additional subsidy, awarding a further and temporary incentive, is applied over the one-year period between June 2020 and June 2021, and a second additional and temporary subsidy over the one-year period between June 2021 and June 2022.\n\nThe accounting treatment used by the Group, with no change compared to that applied in 2020, consists in recognising subsidies as soon as the Group believes that the level of eligible outstandings will render it possible to meet the conditions necessary to obtain these subsidies when they are due to the ECB, i.e. at the end of the TLTRO III operation, and to assign this subsidy to the period to which it relates on a pro rata temporis basis.\n\nThe Group assessed their accrued interest at the rate of the Deposit Facility -50bp /floored at -100bp over the special interest rate period (1 January 2021 - 23 June 2021 for the period relating to the 2021 /financial year), given that thresholds were reached at the /first incentive during the special reference period. Over the special additional interest rate period (24 June 2021 - 31 December 2021 for the period relating to the 2021 /financial year), the interest rate used is also the rate of the Deposit Facility -50bp /floored at -100bp, given the achievement of the criteria for the level of eligible loans speci/fic to the second incentive during the additional special reference period. As such, the Group believes that it will obtain all the subsidies at the end of this loan due to the ful/filment of the conditions to bene/fit from it at 31 December 2021. As a reminder, at 30 June 2021, the interest rate used was the minimum between the Deposit Facility rate and the MRO -50bp given the Group's uncertainty at that date, as to the achievement of the criteria for changes in eligible loans during the additional special reference period.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group subscibed to the ECB for \u20ac162 billion in TLTRO III loans. Given the internal re/financing mechanisms, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB can bene/fit from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. drawings or re/finance itself directly to the ECB.\n\n## Hedging of liquidity and solvency risks and bank resolution\n\nUnder the legal internal /financial solidarity mechanism enshrined in Article L. 511-31 of the French Monetary and Financial Code (CMF), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., as the central body, must take all measures necessary to ensure the liquidity and solvency of each af/filiated credit institution, as well as the network as a whole. As a result, each member of the network bene/fits from this internal /financial solidarity.\n\nThe general provisions of the CMF are re/flected in the internal provisions setting out the operational measures required for this legal solidarity mechanism.\n\nAs part of the initial public offering of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., CNCA (now Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.) signed a protocol with the Regional Banks in 2001 to govern internal relations within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network. This protocol provides in particular for the establishment of a Fund for Bank Liquidity and Solvency Risks (FRBLS) designed to enable Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to ful/fil its role as central body by providing assistance to any af/filiates that may experience dif/ficulties. The main provisions of the protocol are detailed in Chapter III of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s reference document registered with the Commission des Op\u00e9rations de Bourse on 22 October 2001 under number R. 01-453.\n\nThe European banking crisis management framework was adopted in 2014 by EU Directive 2014/59 (known as the 'Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive - BRRD'), incorporated into French law by Order 2015-1024 of 20 August 2015, which also adapted French law to the provisions of European Regulation 806/2014 of 15 July 2014 establishing uniform rules and a uniform procedure for the resolution of credit institutions and certain investment /firms in the framework of a Single Resolution Mechanism and a Single Resolution Fund. Directive (EU) 201/879 of 20 May 2019, known as 'BRRD2', amended the BRRD and was incorporated into French law by Order 2020-1636 of 21/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nThis framework, which includes measures to prevent and to resolve banking crises, is intended to preserve /financial stability, to ensure the continuity of activities, services and operations of institutions whose failure could signi/ficantly impact the economy, to protect depositors, and to avoid or limit the use of public /financial support as much as possible. In this context, the European Resolution Authorities, including the Single Resolution Board, have been granted extensive powers to take all necessary measures in connection with the resolution of all or part of a credit institution or the group to which it belongs.\n\nFor cooperative banking groups, the 'extended single point of entry' ('extended SPE') resolution strategy is favoured by the resolution authorities, whereby resolution tools would be applied simultaneously at the level of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the af/filiated entities. In this respect, and in the event of a resolution of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, the scope comprising Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nN",

        "page_content": "GENERAL FRAMEWORK\n\n(in its capacity as the corporate centre) and its af/filiated entities would be considered as a whole as the expanded single entry point. Given the foregoing and the solidarity mechanisms that exist within the network, a member of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network cannot be put individually in resolution.\n\nThe resolution authorities may initiate resolution proceedings against a credit institution where it considers that: the institution has failed or is likely to fail, there is no reasonable prospect that another private measure will prevent the failure within a reasonable time, a resolution measure is necessary, and a liquidation procedure would be inadequate to achieve the resolution objectives mentioned above.\n\nThe resolution authorities may use one or more resolution tools, as described below, with the objective of recapitalising or restoring the viability of the institution. The resolution tools should be implemented in such a way that equity holders (shares, mutual shares, CCIs, CCAs) bear losses /first, with creditors following up immediately, provided that they are not excluded from bail-in legally speaking or by a decision of the resolution authorities. French law also provides for a protective measure when certain resolution tools or decisions are implemented, such as the principle that equity holders and creditors of an institution in resolution may not incur greater losses than those they would have incurred if the institution had been liquidated in the context of a judicial liquidation procedure under the French Commercial Code (NCWOL principle referred to in Article L. 613-57.I of the CMF). Thus investors are entitled to claim compensation if the treatment they receive in a resolution is less favourable than the treatment they would have received if the institution had been subject to normal insolvency proceedings.\n\nIn the event that the resolution authorities decide to put the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group into resolution, they will /first write down the CET1 instruments (shares, mutual shares, CCI and CCA), additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments, in order to absorb losses, and then possibly convert the additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments into equity securities (1) . Then, if the resolution authorities decide to use the bail-in tool, the latter would be applied to debt instruments (2) , resulting in the partial or total write-down of these instruments or their conversion into equity in order to absorb losses.\n\nWith respect to the corporate centre and all af/filiated entities, the resolution authorities may decide to implement, in a coordinated manner, impairment or conversion measures and, where applicable, internal bailouts. In such an event, the impairment or conversion measures and, where applicable, internal bailout measures would apply to all entities within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network, regardless of the entity in question and regardless of the origin of the losses.\n\nThe creditor hierarchy in resolution is de/fined by the provisions of Article L 613-55-5 of the CMF, effective as at the date of implementation of the resolution.\n\nEquity holders and creditors of the same rank or with identical rights in liquidation will then be treated equally, regardless of the Group entity of which they are creditors.\n\nThe scope of this internal bailout, which also aims to recapitalise the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, is based on capital requirements at the consolidated level.\n\nInvestors must then be aware that there is therefore a signi/ficant risk that holders of shares, mutual shares, CCIs and CCAs and holders of debt instruments of a member of the network will lose all or part of their investment if a resolution procedure is implemented on the Group, regardless of the entity of which they are a creditor.\n\nThe other resolution tools available to the resolution authorities are essentially the total or partial transfer of the activities of\n\n(1) Articles L. 613-48 and L. 613-48-3 of the CMF, projected date: end Q1 2022. (2) Articles L. 613-55 and L. 613-55-1 of the CMF.\n\nthe institution to a third party or to a bridge institution and the separation of the assets of the institution.\n\nThis resolution framework does not affect the legal internal /financial solidarity mechanism enshrined in Article L. 511-31 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, which applies to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole network, as de/fined in Article R. 512-18 of the same Code. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. considers that, in practice, this mechanism should be implemented prior to any resolution procedure.\n\nThe implementation of a resolution procedure to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group would thus mean that the legal internal solidarity mechanism had failed to remedy the failure of one or more network entities, and hence of the network as a whole. It would also limit the likelihood that the conditions for triggering the guarantee covering the liabilities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., granted in 1988 to its third party creditors by the Regional Banks on a joint and several basis and up to the amount of their aggregate capital, are met. It should be recalled that this guarantee may be implemented in the event of an asset shortfall following Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s court-ordered liquidation or dissolution.",

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 1:  GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES, ASSESSMENTS AND ESTIMATES APPLIED\n\n## 1.1 Applicable standards and comparability\n\nPursuant to EC Regulation No. 1606/2002, the consolidated /financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS/IFRS and IFRIC applicable at 31 December 2021 and as adopted by the European Union (carve-out version), by using certain exceptions in the application of IAS 39 on macro-hedge accounting.\n\nThese standards are available on the website of the European Commission at the following address: https://ec.europa.eu/info/ business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting//financial-reporting\\_en\n\nThe standards and interpretations are the same as those applied and described in the Group's /financial statements at 31 December 2020. They have been supplemented by the provisions of those IFRS as endorsed by the European Union at 31 December 2021 and that must be applied in 2021 for the /first time.\n\nThey cover the following:\n\n| Standards, amendments or interpretations                                                         | Date of mandatory /first-time application:  /financial years beginning on or after   | Applicable in the Group   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Amendment to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 | 1 st  January 2021  1                                                                | Yes                       |\n| Amendment to IFRS 16 2 nd  Amendment on Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions                        | 1 st  April 2021                                                                     | Yes  2                    |\n\n- 1 The Group opted for the early adoption of the amendment to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 regarding interest rate benchmark reform - Phase 2 as from 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02020.\n\n## 1.1.1 BENCHMARK REFORMS\n\nIn early 2019, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group implemented a programme to prepare and manage the transition of benchmarks for all its activities, with a breakdown into dedicated projects in each affected entity. This programme is part of the timetables and standards de/fined by market work - some of which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole actively participated in - and the European regulatory framework (BMR).\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the national working groups and the authorities, the Group has focused as much as possible on switching to alternative indices in anticipation of the disappearance of benchmarks while aiming to meet the deadlines set by the marketplace or imposed by the authorities and, as far as possible, incentive milestones. Signi/ficant investments and a strong mobilisation of the operational teams and business lines were implemented to adapt the tools and absorb the workload caused by these transitions, including the modi/fication of contracts. It should be noted that IT developments have been highly dependent on the timing of determining the target LIBOR alternative indices and the emergence of market standards.\n\nThe orderly and controlled completion of these transitions has been ensured by all the actions taken since 2019. In the second half of 2021, the entities focused their efforts on /finalising all IT developments and intensifying information campaigns and interactions with customers in order to explain to them more in detail the transition procedures and continue efforts to prevent conduct risks.\n\nThe work carried out has also enabled the Group's entities to manage new RFR product offerings while maintaining its standards of customer experience and satisfaction.\n\n## \u008a Transition review at 31/12/2021\n\nFor most of the entities and activities concerned, the proactive transition plans were activated as soon as possible in 2021 with an intensi/fication in the second half of the year: cash loans/ borrowing between Group entities, customer deposit accounts, interest rate derivatives offset in bulk via the conversion cycles of clearing houses in October (EONIA) and in December (LIBOR excl. USD).\n\nThe activation of fallback clauses - considered as a 'safety net' - concerned, on the whole, a smaller proportion of the stock of contracts impacted by the changes in the benchmark index. For non-cleared derivatives covered by ISDA, there was increased use of the ISDA fallback.\n\nFor certain scopes of /financing contracts and especially for /financing activities in CHF, speci/fic transition procedures have been adopted. They consist of the use of a /final LIBOR /fixing in 2021 and the use of the replacement rate from 2022.\n\nAt the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group level, few contracts could not be renegotiated before the disappearance of the indices or the switch to an alternative index by activation of the fallback clause. This residual stock of contracts concerns either negotiations that have not been /finalised at 31 December 2021 and which are expected to end in 2022, or contracts that will bene/fit from the legislative measures in force if negotiations fail.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 6 - Consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2021\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 1: GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES APPLIED\n\n## \u008a Risk management\n\nIn addition to preparing and implementing the replacement of benchmarks that will disappear or become non-representative at 31 December 2021 and ensuring compliance with BMR regulations, the project initiatives also aim to manage and control the risks inherent in the benchmark transitions, particularly with regard to /financial, operational, legal and compliance aspects and in particular as regards client protection (prevention of conduct risk).\n\nFor example, on the /financial side, the risk of market fragmentation caused by the use of different types of interest rates (calculation of a predetermined rate at the beginning of the interest period known as 'forward looking' or post-determined interest rate calculation known  as  'backward  looking')  and  different  conventions according to asset/currency classes may lead to /financial risks for players in the sector. It is nevertheless expected that these risks, clearly identi/fied within the Group, should tend to reduce as market standards emerge and that the private sector - with the support of banks - will be able to manage this fragmentation.\n\n## \u008a LIBOR USD\n\nIn 2022, the transition programme continued, notably to prepare for the cessation of the publication of the LIBOR USD or its nonrepresentative effect in June 2023. For the transition of USD LIBOR, the implementation of a legislative framework will be con/firmed at a later stage by the UK authorities, with the US authorities having already approved the designation of statutory replacement rates for contracts governed by New York law.\n\nSo that the hedging relationships affected by this interest rate benchmark reform can be maintained despite the uncertainties\n\nabout the timetable and the arrangements for the transition between the current and future benchmarks, the IASB has published amendments to IAS 39, IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 in September 2019 that were adopted by the European Union on 15 January 2020. The Group will apply these amendments as long as uncertainties about the future of the benchmarks have an impact on the amounts and payment dates of interest /flows and, as such, considers that all of its hedging contracts, and mainly those linked to EONIA and LIBOR rates (USD, GBP, CHF and JPY), are eligible for the relief afforded by the amendments at 31 December 2021.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the hedging instruments identi/fied as being affected by the reform, and for which there are still uncertainties, amount to a nominal value of \u20ac75.3 billion.\n\nOther amendments, published by the IASB in August 2020, complement those published in 2019 and focus on the accounting consequences of replacing old benchmark interest rates with other benchmark rates following reforms.\n\nThese 'Phase 2' modi/fications mainly concern changes in contractual cash /flows. They allow entities not to derecognise or adjust the carrying value of /financial instruments in order to take account of the changes required by the reform, but rather to update the effective interest rate to re/flect the change in the alternative reference rate.\n\nFor hedge accounting, entities will not have to dequalify their hedging relationships when making the changes required by the reform and subject to economic equivalence.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the breakdown by signi/ficant benchmark index of instruments based on the old benchmark rates, and which must transition to the new rates before their maturity, is as follows:\n\n| \u20ac million                                            | EONIA    | LIBOR USD   | LIBOR GBP   | LIBOR JPY   | LIBOR CHF   | LIBOR EUR   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Total /financial assets (excluding derivatives)      | /uni2010 | 34,053      | 1,278       | 148         | 200         | -           |\n| Total /financial liabilities (excluding derivatives) | /uni2010 | 6,210       | /uni2010    | /uni2010    | /uni2010    | -           |\n| Total notional amount of derivatives                 | /uni2010 | 2,344,084   | 1,269       | 116         | /uni2010    | -           |\n\nIn the absence of announcements regarding the forthcoming replacement of the EURIBOR, WIBOR and STIBOR indices, these indices were excluded from the quantitative data provided.\n\nOutstandings in USD LIBOR are those with a maturity date subsequent to 30/06/2023, the date of disappearance or non-representativeness of tenors DD, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.\n\nFor the other indices, contracts switched to the alternative rate by activating the fallback clause were excluded from the scope. As a result, assets under management in EONIA and CHF LIBOR correspond to contracts whose renegotiation was not /finalised at 31 December 2021 and for which there is no provision for recourse to the existing legislation. Outstandings in GBP and JPY LIBOR correspond to the residual stock of contracts for which renegotiations with customers are in progress and which are expected to end in 2022. These outstandings could be covered by the European Commission's system currently in place, should negotiations fail.\n\nFor non-derivative /financial instruments, exposures correspond to the nominal value of the securities and the outstanding principal of depreciable instruments.\n\n## 1.1.2  ACCOUNTING CONSEQUENCES OF THE APRIL 2021 IFRS IC DECISION ON THE ALLOCATION OF POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TO SERVICE PERIODS FOR DEFINED-BENEFIT PLANS\n\nIn December 2020, the IFRS IC was asked about the methodology for calculating the actuarial liabilities of de/fined-bene/fit plans and the vesting period for the rights to be used for which the number of years of seniority giving rise to the award of entitlements is capped. Following analysis of several approaches, IFRS IC adopted the approach of matching the maximum period prior to retirement age and enabling entitlements to be obtained.\n\nThe plans concerned by the IFRS IC decision on IAS 19 are those for which:\n\n- y The allocation of entitlements is subject to the presence in the company at the time of retirement (with the loss of any right in the event of early retirement);\n\n- y Entitlements depend on seniority, but are capped from a certain number of years of service, with the ceiling, at least for certain employees, being reached largely before retirement.\n\nThis decision constitutes a change in method in the approaches adopted by the Group.\n\nThe impact of this decision, which was recorded at 1 January 2021, was \u20ac40 million in terms of actuarial liabilities (see Note 7 - Employee bene/fits and other compensation).\n\nThe impact on the /financial statements was \u20ac40 million in terms of provisions for employee bene/fits (see Note 6.15 - Provisions) and without surplus assets (recorded in Note 6.11 - Accruals) against shareholders' equity (impact of \u20ac30 million after taking into\n\nN",

Their application will become mandatory from the date speci/fied by the European Union and they were therefore not applied by the Group at 31 December 2021.\n\n## 1.2 Accounting policies and methods\n\n## 1.2.1   USE OF ASSESSMENTS AND ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nBy their nature, the assessments necessary for the production of the consolidated /financial statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to their future occurrence.\n\nFuture achievements can be in/fluenced by a number of factors, including:\n\n- y domestic and international market activities;\n- y /fluctuations in interest and exchange rates;\n- y economic and political conditions in certain business sectors or countries;\n- y changes in regulations or legislation.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list.\n\nAccounting estimates that require assumptions are mainly used for the following valuations:\n\n- y /financial instruments measured at fair value;\n- y non-consolidated investments;\n- y pension plans and other future employee bene/fits;\n- y stock options plans;\n- y impairment of debt instruments at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss;\n- y provisions;\n- y goodwill impairment;\n- y deferred tax assets;\n- y the valuation of companies accounted for by the equity method;\n- y deferred pro/fit-sharing.\n\nThe procedures for using judgements or estimates are set out in the relevant paragraphs below.\n\n## 1.2.2  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS (IFRS 9, IAS 32 AND 39)\n\n## \u008a Definitions\n\nIAS 32 de/fines a /financial instrument as any contract that gives rise to a /financial asset of one entity and a /financial liability or equity instrument of another entity, i.e. any contract representing a contractual right or obligation to receive or deliver cash or another /financial asset.\n\nDerivative instruments are /financial assets or liabilities whose value changes in line with that of an underlying, which require a low or zero initial investment, and which are settled at a future date.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are treated in the /financial statements in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9 as adopted by the European Union, including /financial assets held by the Group's insurance entities.\n\nIFRS  9  sets  out  the  principles  for  the  classification  and measurement of /financial instruments, impairment/provisioning of credit risk and hedge accounting, excluding macro-hedges.\n\nHowever, it is speci/fied that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses the option not to apply the general hedging model of IFRS 9. As a result, all hedging relationships remain within the scope of IAS 39 pending future macro-hedging provisions.\n\n'Green /financial assets' and 'green bonds' comprise a variety of instruments, including loans to /finance environmental projects. It should be noted that not all /financial instruments subject to this quali/fication necessarily have a variable remuneration based on ESG criteria. This terminology may change depending on future European regulations. These instruments are recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 in accordance with the principles set out below.",

Derivatives are always measured at fair value.\n\nAmortised cost corresponds to the amount at which the /financial asset or /financial liability is measured on initial recognition, including transaction costs directly attributable to its acquisition or issue, less principal repayments, plus or minus the accumulated amortisation - calculated using the effective interest method - of any difference (discount or premium) between the initial amount and the amount at maturity. In the case of a /financial asset at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss, the amount may be adjusted if necessary for impairment losses (see paragraph 'Provision for credit risk').\n\nThe effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate that exactly discounts the future cash out/flows or receipts planned over the expected life of the /financial instrument or, as the case may be, over a shorter period in order to obtain the net book value of the /financial asset or liability.\n\n## \u008a Financial assets\n\n## CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nNon-derivative /financial assets (debt or equity instruments) are classi/fied in the balance sheet in accounting categories that determine their accounting treatment and their subsequent valuation mode.\n\nThe criteria for the classi/fication and measurement of /financial assets depend on the nature of the /financial assets, according to whether they are quali/fied as:\n\n- y debt instruments (for example /fixed or determinable-income securities and loans); or\n- y equity instruments (for example, shares).\n\nThese /financial assets are classi/fied in one of the following three categories:\n\n- y /financial assets at fair value through pro/fit or loss;\n- y /financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments only);\n- y /financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (for debt instruments, that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss; for equity instruments, that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss).\n\n## DEBT INSTRUMENTS\n\nThe classi/fication and measurement of a debt instrument depends on two criteria: the business model de/fined at the portfolio level and the analysis of contractual characteristics determined by debt instrument, unless the fair value option is used.\n\nThe three business models:\n\nThe business model is representative of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's management strategy for managing its /financial assets, in order to achieve its objectives. The business model is speci/fied for a\n\nportfolio of assets and does not constitute an intention on a caseby-case basis for an isolated /financial asset.\n\nThere are three business models:\n\n- y The 'hold to collect' model, the objective of which is to collect contractual cash /flows over the life of the assets; this model does not systematically involve holding all of the assets until their contractual maturity; however, the sale of assets is strictly controlled;\n- y The 'hold to collect and sell' model, the objective of which is to collect cash /flows over the life of the asset and to dispose of the assets; under this model, the sale of /financial assets and the collection of cash /flows are both essential; and\n- y The 'other/sell' model, the main objective of which is to sell the assets.\n- In particular, it concerns portfolios whose objective is to collect cash /flows through disposals, portfolios whose performance is assessed on the basis of its fair value, and portfolios of /financial assets held for trading.\n- When the strategy followed by management for the management of /financial assets does not correspond to the 'hold to collect' or 'collect and sell' model, these /financial assets are classi/fied in a portfolio with an 'other/sell' business model.\n\nContractual characteristics ('Solely Payments of Principal & Interest' or 'SPPI' test):\n\nThe SPPI test combines a set of criteria, examined cumulatively, to determine whether the contractual cash /flows meet the characteristics of a simple /financing (principal repayments and interest payments on the principal amount outstanding).\n\nThe conditions for the test are met when the /financing is eligible only for the repayment of the principal and when the payment of interest received re/flects the time value of money, the credit risk associated with the instrument, the other costs and risks of a traditional loan agreement and a reasonable margin, whether the interest rate is /fixed or variable.\n\nIn simple /financing, interest represents the cost of time, the price of credit and liquidity risk over the period, and other components related to the cost of carrying the asset (e.g. administrative costs, etc.).\n\nIn some cases, this qualitative analysis does not make it possible to conclude, a quantitative analysis (or Benchmark text) is carried out. This additional analysis consists of comparing the contractual cash /flows of the asset under consideration and the cash /flows of a reference asset.\n\nIf the difference between the cash /flows of the /financial asset and that of the reference is considered immaterial, the asset is considered as a simple /financing.\n\nIn addition, a speci/fic analysis will be carried out in the event that the /financial asset is issued by special purpose entities setting an order of priority for payment among the holders of the /financial assets by contractually linking multiple instruments and creating concentrations of credit risk ('tranches').\n\nEach tranche is assigned a subordination ranking which speci/fies the order of distribution of the cash /flows generated by the structured entity.\n\nIn this case, the SPPI test requires an analysis of the contractual cash /flow characteristics of the asset in question and the underlying assets according to the look-through approach and the credit risk borne by the subscribed tranches compared to the credit risk of the underlying assets.\n\nThe accounting method for debt instruments resulting from the quali/fication of the business model coupled with the SPPI test can be presented in the form of the diagram below:\n\nN",

The reclassi/fication applies to all /financial assets in the portfolio from the reclassi/fication date. In other cases, the business model remains unchanged for existing /financial assets. If a new business model is identi/fied, it applies prospectively to new /financial assets, grouped into a new management portfolio.\n\n## TEMPORARY PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES\n\nTemporary sales of securities (securities lending, securities sold under repurchase agreements) do not generally meet the conditions for derecognition.\n\nSecurities lent or repurchased are maintained on the balance sheet. In the case of repurchased securities, the amount received, representing the debt to the transferee, is recorded on the liabilities side of the balance sheet by the transferor.\n\nSecurities borrowed or received under reverse repurchase agreements are not recorded on the transferee's balance sheet.\n\nIn the case of repurchased securities, a receivable in respect of the transferor is recorded on the transferee's balance sheet against the amount paid. In the event of subsequent resale of the security, the transferee recognises a liability measured at fair value in respect of its obligation to return the security under the repurchase agreement.\n\nRepurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are recognised at fair value through pro/fit or loss when they are part of the trading activity (managed activity whose performance is measured on the basis of fair value), or at amortised cost.\n\n## DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nA /financial asset (or group of /financial assets) is derecognised in whole or in part:\n\n- y when the contractual rights to the cash /flows linked to it expire;\n- y or are transferred or treated as such because they belong de facto to one or more bene/ficiaries; and when substantially all the risks and rewards of the /financial asset are transferred.\n\nIn this case, all rights and obligations created or retained at the time of the transfer are recognised separately as assets and liabilities.\n\nWhen the contractual rights to the cash /flows are transferred but only a portion of the risks and rewards, as well as control, are retained, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB continues to recognise the /financial asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in that asset.\n\nFinancial assets renegotiated for commercial reasons in the absence of /financial dif/ficulties of the counterparty and for the purpose of developing or maintaining a business relationship are derecognised at the renegotiation date. New loans granted to customers are recorded at fair value at the renegotiation date. Subsequent recognition depends on the business model and the SPPI test.\n\n## \u008a Financial liabilities\n\n## CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nFinancial liabilities are classi/fied in the balance sheet in the following two accounting categories:\n\n- y /financial liabilities at fair value through pro/fit or loss, by type or by option;\n- y /financial liabilities at amortised cost.\n\n## FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS BY TYPE\n\nFinancial instruments issued primarily for the purpose of being redeemed in the short term, instruments that are part of a portfolio of identi/fied /financial instruments that are managed together and which show evidence of a recent short-term pro/fit-taking pro/file, and derivatives (with the exception of certain hedging derivatives) are measured at fair value by type.\n\nChanges in the fair value of this portfolio are recognised through pro/fit or loss.\n\n## FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS BY OPTION\n\nFinancial liabilities corresponding to one of the three cases de/fined by the standard below may be designated for measurement at fair value through pro/fit or loss: hybrid issues including one or more separable embedded derivatives, reduction or elimination of accounting mismatches or groups of managed /financial liabilities for which performance is measured at fair value.\n\nThis option is irrevocable and must be applied at the date of initial recognition of the instrument.\n\nOn subsequent measurements, these /financial liabilities are measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss for changes in fair value not related to own credit risk and against other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss for changes in value related to own credit risk unless this aggravates the accounting mismatch (in which case changes in value related to own credit risk are recognised in pro/fit or loss, as required by the standard).\n\nIssues structured by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB are classi/fied as /financial liabilities designated at fair value through pro/fit or loss. These liabilities are part of portfolios of assets and liabilities managed at fair value and whose performance is measured on a fair value basis. In accordance with IFRS 13, their fair value measurement includes the change in the Group's own credit risk.\n\n## FINANCIAL LIABILITIES EVALUATED AT AMORTISED COST\n\nAll other liabilities that meet the de/finition of a /financial liability (excluding derivatives) are measured at amortised cost.\n\nThese liabilities are recognised at fair value at initial recognition (including transaction income and costs) and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## RECLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nThe initial classi/fication of /financial liabilities is irrevocable. No subsequent reclassi/fication is permitted.\n\n## DISTINCTION BETWEEN DEBT AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\n\nThe distinction between debt and equity instruments is based on an analysis of the economic substance of the contractual arrangements.\n\nA /financial liability is a debt instrument if it includes a contractual obligation to:\n\n- y deliver cash, another /financial asset or a variable number of equity instruments to another entity; or\n- y exchange /financial assets and liabilities with another entity under potentially unfavourable conditions.\n\nAn equity instrument is a non-refundable /financial instrument which offers discretionary return representing a residual interest in an undertaking after deduction of all its /financial liabilities (net assets) and which is not quali/fied as a debt instrument.\n\nN",

Any difference between the carrying amount of the extinguished liability and the new liability will be recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nIf the /financial liability is not derecognised, the original effective interest rate is maintained. A discount/premium is recognised immediately in the income statement at the date of modi/fication and then spread out at the initial effective interest rate over the residual life of the instrument.\n\n## \u008a Negative interest on financial assets and liabilities\n\nIn accordance with the January 2015 IFRS IC decision, negative interest income (expenses) on /financial assets that do not meet the de/finition of income within the meaning of IFRS 15 are recognised as interest expenses in the income statement and not as a reduction in interest income. The same applies to negative interest expenses (income) on /financial liabilities.\n\n## \u008a Impairment/provisions for credit risk\n\n## SCOPE\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB recognises a value adjustment for expected credit losses (ECLs) on the following outstandings:\n\n- y /financial assets of debt instruments at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss (loans and receivables, debt securities);\n- y /financing commitments that are not measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss;\n- y guarantee commitments falling under IFRS 9 and not measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss;\n- y lease receivables subject to IFRS 16; and\n- y trade receivables generated by transactions under IFRS 15.\n\nEquity instruments (at fair value through pro/fit or loss or at fair value through other comprehensive income that will not be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss) are not affected by the impairment provisions.\n\nDerivative instruments and other /financial instruments measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss are the subject of a counterparty risk calculation that is not covered by the ECL model. This calculation is described in Chapter 5 'Risks and Pillar 3'.\n\n## CREDIT RISK AND IMPAIRMENT/PROVISION STAGES\n\nCredit risk is de/fined as the risk of losses linked to the default of a counterparty resulting in its inability to meet its commitments vis-\u00e0-vis the Group.\n\nThe credit risk provisioning process distinguishes between three stages:\n\n- y Stage 1: from the initial recognition of the /financial instrument (loan, debt security, guarantee, etc.), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB recognises 12-month expected credit losses;\n- y Stage 2: if credit quality deteriorates signi/ficantly for a given transaction or portfolio, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB recognises losses expected at maturity;\n- y Stage 3: once one or more default events have occurred on the transaction or on the counterparty, having an adverse effect on\n\nestimated future cash /flows, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB recognises an incurred credit loss at maturity. Subsequently, if the conditions for classifying /financial instruments in Stage 3 are no longer met, the /financial instruments are reclassi/fied to Stage/uni00A02, then Stage 1 depending on the subsequent improvement in the quality of credit risk.\n\nAs of the closing date of 31 December 2021, the term 'Bucket' used since the transition to IFRS 9 is replaced by the term 'Stage' in all /financial statements.\n\nN.B.: this is only a change in terminology, with no impact on the recognition of credit losses adjustments (ECL).\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe de/finition of default for ECL provisioning purposes is identical to that used in management and for regulatory ratio calculations. Thus, a debtor is considered to be in default when at least one of the following two conditions is met:\n\n- y signi/ficant arrears, generally when a payment is more than ninety days past due, unless speci/fic circumstances point to the fact that the delay is due to reasons beyond the debtor's control;\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB considers that the debtor is unlikely to settle its credit obligations in full unless it avails itself of certain measures such as the enforcement of collateral.\n\nA loan is deemed to be non-performing (Stage 3) when one or more events have occurred which have a negative effect on the future estimated cash /flows of this /financial asset. Evidence of impairment of a /financial asset includes observable data about the following events:\n\n- y signi/ficant /financial dif/ficulties for the issuer or borrower;\n- y a breach of an agreement, such as a default or late payment;\n- y the granting by the lender(s) to the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons related to the borrower's /financial dif/ficulties, of one or more favours that the lender(s) would not have considered in other circumstances;\n- y an increasing probability of bankruptcy or /financial restructuring of the borrower;\n- y the disappearance of an active market for the /financial asset due to /financial dif/ficulties;\n- y the purchase or the creation of a /financial asset with a large discount, which re/flects the credit losses incurred.\n\nIt is not necessarily possible to isolate a particular event as the impairment of the /financial asset could result from the combined effect of several events.\n\nThe counterparty in default returns to a performing situation only after an observation period that con/firms that the borrower is no longer in default (assessment by the Risk Division).\n\n## The concept of ECL (Expected Credit Loss)\n\nThe ECL is de/fined as the present value of probability-weighted estimated credit losses (principal and interest). It is the present value of the difference between contractual cash /flows and expected cash /flows (including principal and interest).\n\nThe ECL approach aims to recognise expected credit losses as soon as possible.\n\n## GOVERNANCE AND MEASUREMENT OF ECL\n\nThe governance of the IFRS 9 measurement system is based on the organisation set up under the Basel framework. The Group Risk Management Department is responsible for de/fining the methodological framework and for the supervision of the mechanism for provisioning exposures.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 6 - Consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2021\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 1: GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES APPLIED\n\nThe Group relies primarily on the internal rating system and the current Basel processes to generate the IFRS 9 parameters needed to calculate expected credit losses. The assessment of changes in credit risk is based on a model that anticipates losses, and extrapolation on the basis of reasonable scenarios. All available, relevant, reasonable and justi/fiable information, including forward looking information, must be used.\n\nThe calculation formula incorporates probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default parameters.\n\nThese calculations are largely based on internal models used for prudential monitoring, where they exist, with adjustments to determine an economic ECL. IFRS 9 recommends an analysis at the reporting date (Point in Time) while taking into account historical loss data and forward-looking macroeconomic data, while the prudential view is analysed through the cycle for the probability of default and in a downturn for loss in the event of default.\n\nThe accounting approach also involves recalculating certain Basel parameters, in particular to neutralise internal collection costs or /floors imposed by the regulatory authorities for regulatory loss given default (LGD) calculations.\n\nThe methods for calculating expected credit losses are to be assessed according to the types of products: /financial instruments and off-balance sheet instruments.\n\nThe 12-month expected credit loss is a portion of lifetime expected credit losses, representing the lifetime cash /flow shortfall occurring from a default within 12 months of the reporting date (or a shorter period if the /financial instrument's expected life is shorter than 12/uni00A0months), weighted by the probability of default within 12 months.\n\nThe expected credit loss is discounted using the effective interest rate determined on initial recognition of the /financial instrument.\n\nThe ECL measurement methods take into account assets pledged as collateral and other credit enhancements that form part of the contractual terms and conditions and which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB does not recognise separately. The estimation of the expected cash /flow shortfalls from a guaranteed /financial instrument re/flects the amount and timing of the recovery of the guarantees. In accordance with IFRS 9, the recognition of guarantees and collateral does not affect the assessment of a signi/ficant increase in credit risk: this is based on changes in the debtor's credit risk without taking into account guarantees.\n\nBacktesting of models and parameters used is carried out at least on a yearly basis.\n\nForward-looking macro-economic data are taken into account in a methodological framework applicable at two levels:\n\n- y at the Group level, in determining a shared framework for taking into account forward looking data in the projection of PD and LGD parameters over the transaction amortisation period;\n- y at the level of each entity with regard to its own portfolios.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION OF THE CREDIT RISK\n\nAll Group entities must assess, for each /financial instrument, the increase in credit risk since initial recognition at each reporting date. This assessment of changes in credit risk leads the entities to classify their transactions by risk category (Stages).\n\nTo determine a signi/ficant deterioration, the Group applies a process with two levels of analysis:\n\n- y a /first level using relative and absolute rules and criteria, applied to Group entities;\n- y a second level linked to the expert assessment, based on local forward-looking information, of the risk held by each entity in its portfolios that may lead to an adjustment in the Group Stage 2 reclassi/fication criteria (switching a portfolio or sub-portfolio to ECL at maturity).\n\nSigni/ficant deterioration is monitored, with few exceptions, for every /financial instrument. No contagion is required for a /financial instrument from the same counterparty to be transferred from Stage/uni00A0 1 to Stage 2. Monitoring of the signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk must cover the primary debtor, without taking into account guarantees, even for transactions guaranteed by the shareholder.\n\nFor exposures comprised of small loans with similar characteristics, the review by counterparty may be replaced by a statistical estimate of expected losses.\n\nTo measure the signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition, it is necessary to retrieve the internal rating and the PD (probability of default) applied on initial recognition.\n\nThe date of initial recognition refers to the trading date, when Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the /financial instrument. For /financing and guarantee commitments, the date of initial recognition is the date on which the irrevocable commitment is made.\n\nFor the scope not covered by an internal rating model, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group uses amounts past due for more than 30 days as the ultimate threshold representing a signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk leading to classi/fication in Stage 2.\n\nFor exposures (with the exception of securities) for which internal rating systems have been built (particularly those monitored using authorised methods), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group considers that all of the information included in the rating systems enables a more relevant assessment than the sole criteria of arrears of over 30 days.\n\nIf the signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition is no longer observed, the impairment can be reclassi/fied to 12-month expected credit losses (Stage 1).\n\nIn order to compensate for the fact that certain factors or indicators of a signi/ficant deterioration are not identi/fiable at the level of a /financial instrument considered separately, the standard authorises an assessment of signi/ficant deterioration for portfolios, groups of portfolios or portions of portfolios of /financial instruments.\n\nThe establishment of portfolios for an assessment of collective impairment can be based on common characteristics such as:\n\n- y the type of instrument;\n- y the credit risk rating (including the Basel II internal rating for entities with an internal rating system);\n- y the type of guarantee;\n- y the date of initial recognition;\n- y the term to maturity;\n- y the sector of activity;\n- y the geographic location of the borrower;\n- y The value of the asset allocated as a guarantee in relation to the /financial assets, if this has an effect on the probability of default (for example, in the case of loans guaranteed only by real security in certain countries, or the loan-to-value ratio);\n- y the distribution channel, the purpose of the loan, etc.\n\nThe grouping of /financial instruments for the purpose of assessing changes in credit risk on a collective basis may change over time as new information becomes available.\n\nN",

As such, they concern all debt instruments, regardless of the classi/fication category of the debt instrument based on the\n\nincrease in credit risk observed since initial recognition.\n\nIn accordance with the de/finition of the EBA (European Banking Authority) speci/fied in the 'Risk Factors' chapter, the restructuring of debts due to /financial dif/ficulties of the debtor corresponds to all changes made to one or more credit agreements in this respect, as well as to re/financing granted due to the /financial dif/ficulties encountered by the client.\n\nThis notion of restructuring must be assessed at the level of the contract and not at the client level (no contagion).\n\nThe de/finition of receivables restructured due to /financial dif/ficulties therefore involves two cumulative criteria:\n\n- y Contractual modi/fications or re/financing of receivables (where concessions are granted);\n- y A client in /financial dif/ficulty (a debtor experiencing, or about to experience, dif/ficulties in meeting their /financial commitments).\n\nFor example, 'contract modi/fication' refers to situations in which:\n\n- y There is a difference between the contractual modi/fications and the former terms of the contract, to the bene/fit of the borrower;\n- y The amendments to the contract lead to more favourable terms for the borrower in question than could have been obtained from other borrowers of the bank with a similar risk pro/file at the same time.\n\n'Re/financing' refers to situations in which a new debt is granted to the client in order to enable it to repay all or part of any other debt for which it cannot assume the contractual terms due to its /financial situation.\n\nThe restructuring of a loan (performing or in default) indicates presumption of a proven risk of loss (Stage 3).\n\nThe need to establish impairment on the restructured exposure must therefore be analysed accordingly (a restructuring does not systematically result in the recognition of impairment for incurred loss and classi/fication in default).\n\nThe classi/fication as 'restructured debt' is temporary.\n\nAs soon as the restructuring operation within the meaning of the EBA has been carried out, the exposure maintains this status of 'restructured' for a period of at least two years if the exposure was performing at the time of the restructuring, or three years if the exposure was in default at the time of the restructuring. These periods are extended if certain events occur (new incidents, for example).\n\nIn the absence of a derecognition linked to this type of event, the reduction of future cash /flows granted to a counterparty, or the postponing of these /flows as part of a restructuring, results in the recognition of a discount in the cost of risk.\n\nIt is equal to the difference between:\n\n- y The carrying amount of the receivable;\n- y And the sum of theoretical future cash /flows from the 'restructured' loan, discounted at the original effective interest rate (de/fined at the date of the /financing commitment).\n\nIn the event of the abandonment of part of the capital, this amount constitutes a loss to be recorded immediately in cost of risk.\n\nThe discount recognised when a loan is restructured is recorded under cost of risk.\n\nWhen the discount is reversed, the portion due to the effect of the passage of time is recorded in 'Net Banking Income'.\n\n## IRRECOVERABILITY\n\nWhen a loan is deemed irrecoverable, meaning that there is no longer any hope to recover it in whole or in part, the balance sheet should be derecognised and the amount deemed irrecoverable should be written off as a loss.\n\nDecisions as to when to write off a loan are taken on the basis of expert judgement. Each entity determines this with the Risk Department, based on its knowledge of the borrower's activity. Before any write-off, a Stage 3 impairment must have been recorded (with the exception of assets at fair value through pro/fit or loss).\n\n## \u008a Derivative instruments\n\n## CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nDerivative instruments are /financial assets or liabilities classi/fied by default as derivative instruments held for trading unless they can be quali/fied as hedging derivatives.\n\nThey are recorded on the balance sheet at their initial fair value at the trade date.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value.\n\nAt each reporting date, the contra entry for changes in the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet is recorded:\n\n- y In pro/fit or loss for derivatives held for trading or fair value hedges;\n- y In other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss, if they are cash /flow hedging derivatives or a net investment in a foreign operation, for the effective portion of the hedge.\n\n## HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n\n## General framework\n\nIn accordance with the Group's decision, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB does not apply the 'hedging accounting' component of IFRS 9 according to the option provided by the standard. All hedging relationships remain documented in accordance with the rules of IAS 39, at the latest until the date of application of the macrohedging text when it is adopted by the European Union. However, the eligibility of /financial instruments for hedge accounting under IAS 39 takes into account the classi/fication and measurement principles of IFRS 9.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, and taking into account the hedging principles of IAS 39, debt instruments at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss are eligible for fair value hedges and cash /flow hedges.",

In particular:\n\n- y The Group documents these hedging relationships on the basis of a gross position in derivatives and hedged items;\n- y The effectiveness of the hedging relationships is measured by maturity schedules.\n\nDetails on the Group's risk management strategy and its application are provided in Chapter 5 'Risks and Pillar 3'.\n\n## Assessment\n\nThe revaluation of the derivative at fair value is recognised as follows:\n\n- y fair value hedges: the revaluation of the derivative and the revaluation of the hedged item in the amount of the hedged risk are recorded symmetrically in pro/fit or loss. Only the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in net pro/fit or loss;\n- y cash /flow hedges: the revaluation of the derivative is recognised on the balance sheet with a contra entry in a speci/fic account for gains and losses recognised directly in other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss for the effective portion, and the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in pro/fit or loss where applicable. Gains or losses on the derivative accumulated in other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss at the time the hedged cash /flows are realised;\n- y hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation: the revaluation of the derivative is recorded on the balance sheet with an offsetting entry in other comprehensive income that will be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss and the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in pro/fit or loss.\n\nWhen the conditions for hedge accounting are no longer met, the following accounting treatment must be applied prospectively, except in the event of the disappearance of the hedged item:\n\n- y fair value hedges: only the derivative continues to be remeasured through pro/fit or loss. The hedged item is fully recognised in accordance with its classi/fication. For debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss, changes in fair value after the end of the hedging relationship are recorded in other comprehensive income in full. For hedged items measured at amortised cost, which were hedged against interest rate risk, the revaluation difference is amortised over the remaining life of these hedged items;\n- y cash /flow hedges: the hedging instrument is measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss. The amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income under the effective portion of the hedge remain in other comprehensive income until the hedged /flows of the hedged item affect pro/fit or loss. For items that were hedged against interest rates, income is allocated as interest is paid. The revaluation difference is amortised in practice over the remaining life of these hedged items;\n- y net investment hedge of a foreign operation: The amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income under the effective portion of the hedging remain in other comprehensive income while the net investment is held. The income is recognised when the net investment in a foreign operation exits the scope of consolidation.\n\n## EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES\n\nAn embedded derivative is a component of a hybrid contract that meets the de/finition of a derivative product. This designation applies only to /financial liabilities and non-/financial contracts. The embedded derivative must be accounted for separately from the host contract if the following three conditions are met:\n\n- y the hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss;\n- y separate from the host contract, the embedded item has the characteristics of a derivative;\n- y the characteristics of the derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract.\n\n## \u008a Determination of the fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe fair value of /financial instruments is determined by maximising the use of observable inputs. It is presented according to the hierarchy de/fined in IFRS 13.\n\nIFRS 13 de/fines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid for the transfer of a liability in an ordinary transaction between market participants on the principal or the most advantageous market, at the valuation date.\n\nFair value applies to each individual /financial asset or /financial liability. As an exception, it may be estimated by portfolio if the risk management and monitoring strategy so allow and are subject to appropriate documentation. Thus, certain fair value inputs are calculated on a net basis when a group of /financial assets and /financial liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to market or credit risks.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB considers that the best indication of fair value is the reference to quoted prices in an active market.\n\nIn the absence of such quotations, fair value is determined using valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable data and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nWhen a debt is measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss (by type or using the option), the fair value takes into account the issuer's own credit risk.\n\nN",

        "page_content": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 1: GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES, JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES APPLIED\n\n## FAIR VALUE OF STRUCTURED ISSUES\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 13, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB values its structured issues measured at fair value by taking as a reference the issuer spread that specialised parties agree to receive in order to acquire new issues from the Group.\n\n## COUNTERPARTY RISK ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB incorporates into fair value the assessment of counterparty risk for derivative assets (Credit Valuation Adjustment or CVA) and, using a symmetrical treatment, the non-performance risk for derivative liabilities (Debit Valuation Adjustment or DVA or own credit risk).\n\nThe CVA is used to determine the expected losses on the counterparty from the perspective of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, and the DVA, the expected losses on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group from the perspective of the counterparty.\n\nThe CVA/DVA is calculated on the basis of an estimate of expected losses based on the probability of default and loss given default. The methodology used maximises the use of observable market inputs. It is primarily based on market data such as registered and listed Credit Default Swaps (CDS), Single Name CDS, or index CDS in the absence of registered CDS on the counterparty. In certain circumstances, historical default data may also be used.\n\n## COSTS AND BENEFITS RELATED TO DERIVATIVES FINANCING\n\nThe value of non-collateralised or partially collateralised derivative instruments incorporates a Funding Value Adjustment (FVA) that represents costs and bene/fits related to the /financing of these instruments. This adjustment is measured based on positive or negative future exposure of transactions for which a cost of /financing is applied.\n\n## FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY\n\nIFRS 13 classi/fies fair values into three levels based on the observability of inputs used in the valuation.\n\nLevel 1: fair values corresponding to prices (nonadjusted) in active markets\n\nLevel 1 presents /financial instruments directly quoted on active markets for identical assets and liabilities to which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB may have access at the valuation date. These include equities and bonds listed on an active market (such as the Paris Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, etc.), units of investment funds listed on an active market and derivatives contracted on an organised market, including futures.\n\nA market is regarded as being active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, broker, dealer, pricing service or regulatory agency, and these prices represent actual transactions regularly occurring in the market on an arm's length basis.\n\nFor /financial assets and liabilities with offsetting market risks, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses mid-prices as a basis for establishing fair values for the offsetting risk positions. For net short positions, the market values used are those at current asking price and for net long positions, current bid prices.\n\nLevel 2: fair values measured using directly or indirectly observable data, other than Level 1 inputs\n\nThese data are directly observable (prices) or indirectly observable (price derivative data) and generally meet the following criteria: these data are not speci/fic to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, are available/ accessible to the public and are based on a market consensus.\n\nThe following are presented in level 2:\n\n- y equities and bonds listed on an inactive market, or not quoted on an active market, but for which fair value is determined using a valuation method commonly used by market participants (such as discounted cash /flow methods, the Black & Scholes model) and based on observable market data;\n- y over-the-counter instruments for which valuation is carried out using models based on observable market data, i.e., that can be obtained from several sources independent of internal sources and on a regular basis. For example, the fair value of interest rate swaps is generally determined using yield curves based on market interest rates observed at the reporting date.\n\nWhen the models used are based in particular on standard models and on observable market inputs (such as yield curves or implicit volatility tables), the initial margin generated on the instruments thus valued is recognised in pro/fit or less at inception.\n\nLevel 3: fair value that is measured using a significant portion of unobservable inputs\n\nFor some complex instruments that are not traded in an active market, fair value measurement is based on valuation techniques using assumptions that cannot be observed on the market for an identical instrument. These products are presented in Level 3.\n\nThis mainly concerns complex /fixed income products, equity derivatives and structured credit products whose valuation requires, for example, correlation or volatility inputs not directly comparable to market data.\n\nThe initial transaction price is deemed to re/flect the market value and recognition of the initial margin is deferred.\n\nThe margin generated on these structured /financial instruments is generally recognised in pro/fit or loss over the period during which the inputs are deemed unobservable. When market data become 'observable,' the remaining margin to be deferred is immediately recognised in pro/fit or loss.\n\nThe methodologies and models for valuing /financial instruments presented in Level 2 and Level 3 incorporate all the factors that market participants use to calculate a price. They must /first be validated by an independent control. The calculation of the fair values of these instruments takes into account liquidity risk and counterparty risk.\n\n## \u008a O/ffsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nIn accordance with IAS 32, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB nets a /financial asset and liability and presents a net balance if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and intends to settle the net amount or to realise the asset and the liability simultaneously.\n\nDerivatives and repurchase agreements with clearing houses whose operating principles meet the two criteria required by IAS/uni00A032 are offset on the balance sheet.",

However, they are subject to provisions in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nA /financial guarantee arrangement is a contract that requires the issuer to make speci/fic payments to reimburse its holder for a loss suffered by the issuer due to the default of a speci/fied debtor who fails to make a payment on maturity under the initial or amended terms of a debt instrument.\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at the higher of:\n\n- y the amount of the value adjustment for losses determined in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 9, the 'Impairment' chapter; or\n- y the amount initially recognised less, where applicable, the accumulated income recognised in accordance with IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers'.\n\n## 1.2.3 PROVISIONS (IAS 37 AND 19)\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB identi/fies the obligations (legal or implied) resulting from a past event for which it is probable that an out/flow of resources will be required to settle them, and for which the due date or amount of the settlement is uncertain but can be reliably estimated. Where applicable, these estimates are updated when the impact is signi/ficant.\n\nIn respect of obligations other than those related to credit risk, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has set aside provisions covering in particular:\n\n- y operational risks;\n- y employee bene/fits;\n- y execution risks of off-balance sheet commitments;\n- y disputes and liability guarantees;\n- y provisions for tax risks (excluding uncertainties on income tax);\n\nThe valuation of the following provisions may also be estimated:\n\n- y the provision for operational risks whose assessment, although subject to an examination of identi/fied risks, incorporates Management's judgement with regard to incident frequency and the amount of the potential /financial impact\n- y provisions for legal risks resulting from Management's best assessment, taking into account the information in its possession at the balance sheet date.\n\nDetailed information is provided in Note 6.15 'Provisions'.\n\n## 1.2.4   EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (IAS 19)\n\nIn accordance with IAS 19, employee bene/fits are grouped into four categories:\n\n- y short-term bene/fits, such as salaries, social security contributions, annual leave, pro/fit-sharing and bonuses, are those that are expected to be paid within twelve months of the year in which the services were rendered;\n- y post-employment bene/fits, which themselves fall into two categories described below: de/fined-bene/fit plans and de/fined-contribution plans;\n- y other long-term bene/fits (work awards, bonuses and compensation payable twelve months or more at the end of the /fiscal year);\n- y termination bene/fits.\n\n## POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nAt each closing date, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB determines its pension obligations and similar bene/fits as well as all employee bene/fits under the de/fined-bene/fit plan category.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 19, these obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial, /financial and demographic assumptions, and in accordance with the projected unit credit method. This method consists in booking a charge for each period of service, for an amount corresponding to employee's vested bene/fits for the period. This charge is calculated based on the discounted future bene/fit.\n\nThe calculations relating to pension and future employee bene/fits are based on assumptions made by Management with regard to discount rates, employee turnover rates or changes in salaries and social security charges. (see Note 7.4 'Post-employment bene/fits, de/fined-bene/fit plans').\n\nN",

        "page_content": "The discount rates are determined according to the average duration of the commitment, that is, the arithmetic average of the durations calculated between the valuation date and the payment date weighted by the turnover assumptions. The underlying used is the discount rate by reference to the iBoxx AA index.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 19, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB charges all actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss. Actuarial gains and losses consist of experience adjustments (difference between what was estimated and what happened) and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined on the basis of the discount rates used to measure the de/fined bene/fit obligation. The difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is recognised in gains and losses recognised directly in other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss.\n\nThe amount of the provision is equal to:\n\n- y the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation at the reporting date, calculated using the actuarial method recommended by IAS 19;\n- y less, where applicable, the fair value of the assets allocated to cover these commitments. These may be represented by an eligible insurance policy. In the event that the obligation is fully covered by a policy corresponding exactly, by its amount and period, to all or part of the bene/fits payable under the plan, the fair value of the obligation is considered to be that of the corresponding obligation (the amount of the corresponding actuarial liability).\n\nDefined-contribution plans\n\nThere are various mandatory pension plans to which employers contribute. The funds are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies have no legal or implied obligation to pay additional contributions if the funds do not have suf/ficient assets to provide all the bene/fits corresponding to the services rendered by staff during the current and previous years. As a result, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has no liability in this respect other than the contributions payable for the past /financial year.\n\n## OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nOther long-term employee bene/fits are bene/fits payable to employees, other than post-employment bene/fits and termination bene/fits, but not fully due within twelve months of the end of the /fiscal year in which the related services were rendered.\n\nThis includes bonuses and other deferred compensation paid twelve months or more after the end of the /financial year in which they were earned, but which are not share-based.\n\nThe measurement method is similar to that used by the Group for post-employment bene/fits falling within the de/fined bene/fit category.\n\n## 1.2.5 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS (IFRS 2)\n\nIFRS 2 on share-based and similar payments requires the measurement of transactions remunerated through sharebased payments and similar payments in the company's results and balance sheet. This standard applies to transactions with employees and more speci/fically:\n\n- y share-based payment transactions that are settled in equity instruments;\n\n- y share-based payment transactions that are settled in cash.\n\nIn Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's accounts, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. sharebased payment plans recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 are only cash settled transactions.\n\nOptions granted are measured at fair value on grant using the Black & Scholes model. These are recognised as an expense under Personnel expenses, with an offsetting entry in an equity account over the vesting period.\n\nSubscriptions for shares offered to employees under the Company Savings Scheme are also subject to the provisions of IFRS 2. The shares are offered at a maximum discount of 30%. These plans do not include a vesting period but are subject to a /five-year lock-up period. The bene/fit granted to employees is measured as the difference between the fair value of the share acquired, taking into account the non-transferability condition and the acquisition price paid by the employee at the subscription date multiplied by the number of shares subscribed.\n\nA description of the method of the plans allocated and the valuation  methods  is  detailed  in  Note  7.6  'Share-based payments'.\n\n## 1.2.6 CURRENT AND DEFERRED TAXES (IAS 12)\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is 99.9% owned by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group since 27 December 1996, and some of its subsidiaries belong to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s tax consolidation group.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12, income tax includes all income tax, whether due or deferred.\n\nThis de/fines current tax as 'the amount of income tax payable (recoverable) in respect of taxable pro/fit (tax loss) for a /financial year'. Taxable pro/fit is the pro/fit (or loss) of a /financial year determined in accordance with the rules established by the tax authorities.\n\nThe rates and rules applicable to determining the current tax expense are those in force in each country in which the Group's companies are located.\n\nThe tax payable relates to any income tax due or receivable and the payment of which is not contingent on the completion of future transactions, even if the payment is spread over several /financial years.\n\nTax due, as long as it is not paid, must be recognised as a liability. If the amount already paid in respect of the /financial year and previous years exceeds the amount due for those years, the excess shall be recognised as an asset.\n\nIn addition, certain transactions carried out by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB may have tax consequences not taken into account in determining the tax payable. Differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base are classi/fied under IAS 12 as temporary differences.\n\nThe standard requires the recognition of deferred tax in the following cases:\n\n- y a deferred tax liability must be recognised for all taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base, unless the deferred tax liability arises from:\n- - the initial recognition of goodwill;\n- - the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and does not affect either the accounting pro/fit or taxable pro/fit (tax loss) at the date of the transaction.",

Therefore, the tax expense or real tax savings borne by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in respect of these unrealised capital gains or losses is reclassi/fied as a deduction from these gains.\n\nIn France, capital gains on equity investments, as de/fined by the French General Tax Code, and subject to the long-term tax regime, are exempt from corporate tax (with the exception of a 12% share of the capital gain, taxed at the normally applicable rate). Therefore, unrealised capital gains recognised at the end of the /financial year generate a temporary difference resulting in the recognition of deferred tax in the amount of this share.\n\nUnder IFRS 16 leases, a deferred tax liability is recognised on the right-of-use and a deferred tax asset on the lease liability for leases for which the Group is the lessee.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in net income for the year, except to the extent that the tax is generated:\n\n- y by a transaction or event that is recognised directly in equity, in the same /financial year or in a different /financial year, in which case it is directly debited or credited to equity;\n- y or by a business combination.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if, and only if:\n\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities; and\n- y deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income tax levied by the same tax authority:\n- (a)  on the same taxable entity, or\n- (b)  on different taxable entities that intend to settle the tax liabilities and assets due on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future year in which signi/ficant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\nTax uncertainties relating to the measurement of the amount of income tax give rise to the recognition of a current tax receivable or liability when the probability of receiving the asset or paying the liability is considered more likely than unlikely.\n\nUncertainty risks in the assessment of taxes are also taken into account in the valuation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nIFRIC 23 on the measurement of uncertain tax positions applies when an entity has identi/fied one or more uncertainties about the tax positions they have adopted. It also provides details on their estimates:\n\n- y the analysis must be based on 100% detection of the tax authorities;\n- y the tax risk must be recognised as a liability as soon as it is more likely than unlikely that the tax authorities will call into question the treatment adopted, for an amount re/flecting the Management's best estimate;\n- y in the event of a probability of more than 50% reimbursement by the tax authorities, a receivable must be recognised.\n\nWhen tax credits on income from securities portfolios and amounts receivable are effectively used to pay income tax due for the year, they are recognised under the same heading as the income with which they are associated. The corresponding tax charge is kept under the heading 'Income tax charge' in the income statement.\n\n## 1.2.7  TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETS (IAS 16, 36, 38 AND 40)\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group applies component accounting for all of its property, plant and equipment. In accordance with the provisions of IAS 16, the depreciable base takes into account the potential remaining value of property, plant and equipment.\n\nLand is recorded at acquisition cost less any impairment.\n\nProperty used in operations, investment property and equipment are measured at their acquisition cost less depreciation and impairment losses recorded since the time they were placed in service.\n\nPurchased  software  is  measured  at  purchase  price  less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and any impairment losses noted since their purchase date.\n\nProprietary software is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses noted since their completion date.\n\nIn addition to software, intangible assets mainly include assets acquired in business combinations resulting from contractual rights (distributing agreements, for example). These were assessed on the basis of the corresponding future economic bene/fits or the potential of the services expected.\n\nFixed assets are impaired over their estimated useful lives.\n\nThe following components and depreciation periods have been adopted by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group following the application of component accounting for /fixed assets. These depreciation periods are adjusted according to the type of asset and its location:\n\n| Component              | Depreciation period   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Land                   | Not depreciable       |\n| Structural works       | 30 to 80 years        |\n| Non-structural works   | 8 to 40 years         |\n| Plant and equipment    | 5 to 25 years         |\n| Fixtures and /fittings | 5 to 15 years         |\n| Computer equipment     | 4 to 7 years          |\n| Special equipment      | 4 to 5 years          |\n\n## 1.2.8  FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSACTIONS (IAS/uni00A021)\n\nAt the reporting date, foreign-currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into euros, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's functional currency.\n\nN",

The exchange differences resulting from this translation are recognised in pro/fit or loss. There are three exceptions to this rule:\n\n- y on debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income that can be reclassi/fied, the portion of the exchange difference calculated on amortised cost is recognised in pro/fit or loss; the additional portion is recognised in other comprehensive income that can be reclassi/fied;\n- y for items designated as cash /flow hedges or as part of a net investment in a foreign entity, exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income that may be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss for the effective portion;\n- y for /financial liabilities designated at fair value through pro/fit or loss, exchange differences related to changes in the fair value of own credit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied.\n\nThe treatment of non-monetary items differs according to the accounting treatment of these items before translation:\n\n- y historical cost items remain valued at the exchange rate on the day of the transaction (historical price);\n- y fair value items are translated at the exchange rate at the closing date.\n\nExchange differences on non-monetary items are recognised:\n\n- y in pro/fit or loss if the gain or loss on the non-monetary item is recognised in pro/fit or loss;\n- y in other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss if the gain or loss on the non-monetary item is recorded in other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied.\n\n## 1.2.9  REVENUES FROM CONTRACT WITH CUSTOMERS (IFRS 15)\n\nFee and commission income and expenses are recognised in pro/fit or loss according to the nature of the services to which they relate.\n\nFees and commissions that form an integral part of the return on a /financial instrument are recognised as an adjustment to the remuneration of this instrument and included in its effective interest rate (in accordance with IFRS 9).\n\nFor other types of fees and commissions, their recognition in the income statement must re/flect the rate of transfer of control of the goods or services sold to the customer:\n\n- y the pro/fit or loss on a transaction associated with the provision of services is recognised under Fees, when control of the provision of services is transferred to the client if it can be reliably estimated. This transfer may take place as the service is rendered (continuous service) or on a given date (one-off service).\n- a)  Fees and commissions for ongoing services (for example, on payment instruments) are recognised in pro/fit or loss according to the level of progress of the service rendered.\n- b)  Fees and commissions received or paid as remuneration for one-off services are recognised in full in pro/fit or loss when the service is rendered.\n\nFees and commissions payable or receivable subject to the achievement of a performance objective are recognised in the amount for which it is highly probable that the income thus recognised will not later be subject to a signi/ficant downward adjustment upon resolution of the contingency. This estimate is updated at each closing date. In practice, this condition results in the deferred recognition of certain performance-related fees\n\nand commissions until the expiry of the performance evaluation period and until such fees and commissions have been de/finitively acquired.\n\n## 1.2.10 LEASES (IFRS 16)\n\nThe Group may be the lessor or lessee of a lease.\n\n## \u008a Leases for which the Group is the lessor\n\nLease transactions are analysed according to their substance and /financial reality. They are recognised, depending on the case, either under /finance leases or operating leases.\n\n- y In the case of /finance leases, they are considered equivalent to a sale of /fixed assets to the lessee /financed by a loan granted by the lessor. The analysis of the economic substance of /finance leases leads the lessor to:\n- a)  Remove the leased asset from the balance sheet;\n- b)  Recognise a /financial receivable from the customer as '/financial assets at amortised cost' for a value equal to the present value of lease payments receivable by the lessor under the lease, plus any non-guaranteed residual value accruing to the lessor;\n- c)  Recognise deferred taxes on temporary differences on the /financial receivable and the net book value of the leased asset;\n- d)  Break down the income corresponding to the rents between interest and capital depreciation.\n- y In the case of operating leases, the lessor recognises leased assets as 'tangible assets' on the asset side of its balance sheet and records lease income on a straight-line basis under 'income from other activities' in the income statement.\n\n## \u008a Leases for which the Group is the lessee\n\nLease transactions are recognised in the balance sheet at the date the leased asset is made available. The lessee recognises an asset representing the right-of-use of the leased asset to property, plant and equipment for the estimated term of the contract and a liability for the obligation to pay rents as one of the other liabilities over the same term.\n\nThe lease term of a contract corresponds to the non-cancellable term of the rental contract, adjusted for the option to extend the lease, which the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise and the option of termination that the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise.\n\nIn France, the term used for '3/6/9' commercial leases is generally nine years with an initial non-cancellable period of three years. When the lessee believes that it is reasonably certain not to exercise the exit option after three years, the Group principle applicable to contracts with an inde/finite term or renewed by tacit renewal (i.e. /first exit option after /five years) will be applied to French commercial leases in most cases, at the start date of the lease. Thus, the term will be estimated at six years. The Group principle (/first exit option after /five years) may not be applied in certain speci/fic cases, for example for a lease in which the interim exit options have been abandoned (for example, in exchange for a reduction in rent); in this case, an initial lease term of nine years should be used (unless a tacit extension is expected for a maximum of three years in the general case).\n\nThe lease liability is recognised at an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments over the term of the contract. Lease payments include /fixed rents, variable rents based on a rate or index, and payments that the lessee expects to pay in respect of guarantees of residual value, purchase option or early termination penalty. Variable rents that do not depend on an index or a",

The marginal debt ratio takes into account the rent payment structure. It re/flects the conditions of the lease (term, guarantee, economic environment, etc.) - the Group has applied the IFRS IC decision of 17 September 2019 since the implementation of IFRS 16.\n\nThe expense in respect of leases is broken down into interest on the one hand and the capital depreciation on the other.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is valued at the initial value of the lease liability plus initial direct costs, advance payments, restoration costs and less lease incentives. It is amortised over the estimated term of the contract.\n\nThe lease liability and the right-of-use liability may be adjusted in the event of a change in the lease contract, re-estimation of the lease term or revision of rents linked to the application of indices or rates.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised in respect of temporary differences in the lessee's right-of-use and lease liabilities.\n\nIn accordance with the exception provided for in the standard, short-term leases (initial term of less than twelve months) and leases whose replacement value of the leased asset is low are not recognised on the balance sheet. The corresponding lease expenses are recorded on a straight-line basis in the income statement under operating expenses.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the standard, the Group does not apply IFRS 16 to leases for intangible assets.\n\n## 1.2.11  NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (IFRS 5)\n\nA non-current asset (or a disposal group) is considered to be held for sale if its carrying amount is recovered primarily through a sale rather than through continuous use.\n\nFor this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its current condition and its sale must be highly probable.\n\nThe assets and liabilities concerned are isolated on the balance sheet under 'Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations' and 'Liabilities related to non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations'.\n\nThese non-current assets (or disposal group) classi/fied as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and their fair value less costs to sell. In the event of an unrealised capital loss, an impairment loss is recorded in pro/fit or loss. Moreover, they cease to be amortised as of their downgrading.\n\nIf the fair value of the group of assets held for sale less costs to sell is less than its carrying amount after impairment of non-current assets, the difference is allocated to other assets in the group of assets held for sale, including /financial assets, and is recognised in pro/fit or loss net of tax on assets held for sale.\n\nA discontinued operation is any component that the Group has disposed of, or that is classi/fied as held for sale, and which is in one of the following situations:\n\n- y it represents a separate main business line or geographic area;\n- y it is part of a single and coordinated plan to dispose of a separate main business line or geographic area; or\n- y it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale.\n\nThe following items are presented on a separate line of the income statement:\n\n- y the net income after tax of discontinued operations up to the date of disposal;\n- y the post-tax gain or loss arising from the disposal or measurement at fair value less costs of selling the assets and liabilities comprising the discontinued operations.\n\n## 1.3   Consolidation principles and methods (IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IAS 28)\n\n## 1.3.1 SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements include the /financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and those of all companies over which, in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 10, IFRS 11 and IAS 28, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has control, joint control or signi/ficant in/fluence, except for those that are not material in relation to all companies included in the consolidation scope.\n\n## DEFINITIONS OF CONTROL\n\nIn accordance with international accounting standards, all entities controlled, under joint control or under signi/ficant in/fluence are consolidated, provided that they do not fall within the scope of the exclusions mentioned below.\n\nExclusive control over an entity is presumed to exist when Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is exposed or entitled to variable returns resulting from its involvement in the entity and if its power over the entity allows it to in/fluence those returns. Power in this context means only substantive (voting or contractual) rights. Rights are considered substantive if the holder of the rights can in practice exercise them when decisions about the entity's relevant activities are made.\n\nControl of a subsidiary governed by voting rights is established when the voting rights held give Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB the practicable ability to direct the relevant activities of the subsidiary. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB generally controls the subsidiary when it holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, more than half of the existing or potential voting rights of an entity, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that such holding does not allow it to direct relevant activities. Control also exists where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB owns half or less than half of an entity's voting rights, including potential voting rights, but is able in practice to direct its relevant activities at its sole discretion, notably because of the existence of contractual arrangements, the size of its stake in the voting rights compared to those of other investor, or due to other facts and circumstances.\n\nControl of a structured entity is not assessed on the basis of the percentage of voting rights as these have, by nature, no effect on the entity's returns. The control analysis takes into account contractual agreements, but also the involvement and decisions of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB when establishing the entity, the agreements entered into at that time and the risks incurred\n\nN",

Where there is a management mandate, the extent of the decision-making power relating to the delegation of power to the manager and the remuneration accorded by such contractual agreements shall be analysed in order to determine whether the manager acts as agent (delegated power) or principal (on its own behalf).\n\nThus, at the time when decisions on the entity's relevant activities are to be made, the indicators to be analysed in order to determine whether an entity acts as an agent or as principal are the extent of the decision-making power relating to the delegation of power to the manager over the entity and the remuneration accorded by such contractual agreements, as well as the substantive rights that may affect the capacity of the decision-maker held by the other parties involved in the entity and exposure to variability in returns from other interests held in the entity.\n\nJoint control is exercised when there is contractual sharing of control over an economic activity. Decisions affecting the entity's relevant activities require the unanimous approval of the parties sharing control.\n\nIn traditional entities, signi/ficant in/fluence arises from the power to participate in a company's /financial and operational policies without having control of it. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is presumed to have signi/ficant in/fluence when it holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, 20% or more of the voting rights in an entity.\n\n## 1.3.2 CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nThe consolidation methods are set by IFRS 10 and IAS 28 respectively. They depend on the type of control exercised by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB over the entities that can be consolidated, regardless of activity or whether or not they have legal entity status:\n\n- y full consolidation, for controlled entities, including entities with different account structures, even if their activity is not in line with that of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB;\n- y the equity method, for entities under signi/ficant in/fluence and under joint control.\n\nFull consolidation consists in replacing each of the assets and liabilities of each subsidiary with the value of the shares. The share of non-controlling interests in equity and income is shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement.\n\nNon-controlling interests are as de/fined by IFRS 10 and include instruments that are current interests and entitle them to a share of net assets in the event of liquidation and other equity instruments issued by the subsidiary and not held by the Group.\n\nThe equity method consists in replacing the Group's share in the shareholders' equity and income of the companies concerned with the value of the shares.\n\nThe change in the carrying amount of these shares takes into account changes in goodwill.\n\nDuring additional acquisitions or partial disposals with the maintenance of joint control or signi/ficant in/fluence, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB notes:\n\n- y in the event of an increase in the percentage of interest, additional goodwill;\n- y in the event of a decrease in the percentage of interest, a capital gain or loss on disposal/dilution in pro/fit or loss.\n\n## 1.3.3 ADJUSTMENTS AND ELIMINATIONS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB makes the necessary adjustments to harmonise the valuation methods of consolidated companies.\n\nThe effect on the consolidated balance sheet and income statement of internal Group operations is eliminated for fully consolidated entities.\n\nCapital  gains  or  losses  on  disposals  of  assets  between consolidated companies are eliminated; any impairment measured on an internal disposal is recognised.\n\n## 1.3.4 TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS (IAS 21)\n\nThe /financial statements of entities representing a 'foreign business' (subsidiary, branch, associate or joint venture) are translated into euros into two steps:\n\n- y if applicable, the local currency in which the /financial statements are prepared is converted into the functional currency (that of the main economic environment of the entity). The conversion is carried out as if the information had been recognised initially in the functional currency (same conversion principles as for foreign currency transactions above);\n- y translation of the functional currency into euros, the presentation currency of the Group's consolidated /financial statements. Assets and liabilities, including goodwill, are translated at the closing rate. Equity items, such as share capital or reserves, are translated at their historical exchange rate. Income and expenses on the income statement are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Foreign exchange differences arising from this conversion are recognised as a separate component of shareholders' equity. These translation differences are recognised in pro/fit or loss in the event of the disposal of the foreign operation (disposal, repayment of capital, liquidation, abandonment of operations) or in the event of deconsolidation due to a loss of control (even without disposal) when the result of the disposal or loss of control is recognised.\n\n## 1.3.5  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS - GOODWILL\n\n## MEASUREMENT AND RECOGNITION OF GOODWILL\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, in accordance with IFRS 3, with the exception of business combinations under joint control, which are excluded from the scope of IFRS 3. In the absence of an IFRS standard or an interpretation speci/fically applicable to a transaction, IAS 8 on Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors leaves the possibility of referring to the of/ficial positions of other standardisation bodies. Accordingly, the Group has chosen to apply US standard ASU 805-50, which appears to comply with the general IFRS principles, for the treatment of business combinations under joint control at carrying values using the method of pooling interest.\n\nAt the acquisition date, the identi/fiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity that meet the accounting criteria of IFRS 3 are recognised at fair value.\n\nIn particular, a restructuring liability is only recognised as a liability of the acquired entity if, at the acquisition date, it is obliged to carry out the restructuring.\n\nPrice adjustment clauses are recognised at fair value even if they are unlikely to be realised. Subsequent changes in the fair value of clauses that are /financial liabilities are recognised in pro/fit or loss. Only the price adjustment clauses relating to transactions for which the acquisition of control took place no later than 31 December 2009 may still be recorded against goodwill, because these transactions were recognised in accordance with IFRS 3 pre-revision (2004).\n\n<!-- image -->",

This applies primarily to:\n\n- y transactions that put an end to a pre-existing relationship between the acquired and the acquiring companies;\n- y transactions that compensate employees or selling shareholders of the acquired company for future services;\n- y transactions aimed at reimbursing the acquiree or its former shareholders for costs related to the acquisition they have assumed on behalf of the acquirer.\n\nThese separate transactions are generally recognised in pro/fit or loss at the acquisition date.\n\nThe consideration transferred in connection with a business combination (the acquisition cost) is measured as the total of the fair values transferred by the acquirer at the date of acquisition in exchange for control of the acquired entity (for example, cash, equity instruments, etc.).\n\nCosts directly attributable to the relevant business combination are recognised as expenses, separately from the combination. Where the acquisition is highly probable, they are recorded under 'Net gains or losses on other assets,' otherwise they are recorded under 'Operating expenses'.\n\nThe difference between the sum of acquisition costs and noncontrolling interests and the net balance, at the date of acquisition, of the identi/fiable assets and the liabilities assumed, measured at fair value, is recorded, when it is positive, on the assets side of the consolidated balance sheet, under 'Goodwill' when the acquired entity is fully consolidated, and under 'Investments in associates' when the acquired company is accounted for using the equity method. When this difference is negative, it is immediately recognised in pro/fit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is recorded in the balance sheet at its initial cost denominated in the currency of the acquired entity and translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date.\n\nIn the event of a step-by-step acquisition of control, the participation held before the acquisition of control is remeasured at fair value through pro/fit or loss at the date of acquisition and goodwill is calculated at once, based on the fair value at the acquisition date of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\n\nIn the event of a loss of control, the gain or loss on disposal is calculated for the entire entity sold and any investment share retained is recognised on the balance sheet at its fair value at the date of loss of control.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment as soon as objective indicators of a loss of value are noted and at least once a year.\n\nThe choices and assumptions used to measure non-controlling interests at the date of acquisition may in/fluence the amount of the initial goodwill and any impairment resulting from a loss of value.\n\nFor the purposes of these impairment tests, each goodwill is divided between the Group's various cash-generating units (CGUs) that will bene/fit from the expected advantages of the business combination. The CGUs were de/fined within the Group's major business lines as the smallest identi/fiable group of assets and liabilities operating according to its own business model. During impairment tests, the carrying amount of each CGU, including the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to it, is compared to its recoverable value.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher amount between the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash /flows generated by the CGU, resulting from medium-term plans drawn up for the purposes of the Group's management.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the goodwill associated with the CGU is impaired accordingly. This impairment is irreversible.\n\n## CHANGES IN POST-ACQUISITION INTEREST AND GOODWILL\n\nIn the event of an increase or decrease in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's ownership interest in an entity already exclusively controlled without loss of control, there is no impact on the amount of goodwill recognised at the origin of the business combination.\n\nIn the event of an increase in the percentage interest of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in an entity already exclusively controlled, the difference between the acquisition cost and the share of net assets acquired is recognised in 'Consolidated reserves' Group share.\n\nIn the event of a decrease in the percentage interest of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in an entity that remains exclusively controlled, the difference between the sale price and the carrying amount of the share of the net position sold is also recognised directly in 'Consolidated reserves' Group share. The costs associated with these transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## SALE OPTIONS GRANTED TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS\n\nThe accounting treatment of sale options granted to minority shareholders is as follows:\n\n- y when a sale option is granted to minority shareholders of a fully-consolidated subsidiary, a liability is recognised on the liabilities side of the balance sheet; its initial recognition takes place at the estimated present value of the options granted to minority shareholders. In exchange for this debt, the share of net assets attributable to the minority interests concerned is reduced to zero and the balance is recorded as a reduction in equity;\n- y subsequent changes in the estimated value of the exercise price alter the amount of the debt recorded as liabilities, with a corresponding equity adjustment. Symmetrically, subsequent changes in the share of net assets due to minority shareholders are cancelled and offset in equity.\n\nN",

The request for withdrawal of the banking institution's authorisation, of/ficially /filed last December, was endorsed by the Governor of the Bank of Algeria on 28 March 2021 and was followed by the appointment of a liquidator on 13 April 2021 to which all powers of administration, management and representation were transferred in accordance with Article 115 of the Algerian Banking Act. The liquidator's task is to liquidate the entity; it acts under the supervision of the Banking Commission and has sole control over the liquidation process.\n\nGiven this new context, following the appointment of the liquidator, it appears that the criteria for exclusive control under IFRS 10 are no longer fully met for the purposes of the consolidated /financial statements of 31 December 2021. As a result, the subsidiary CACIB Algeria, which is no longer controlled by CACIB, was excluded from the consolidation scope from 30 June 2021.\n\nThe recognition of the loss of control results in the discontinuation of the full consolidation with all the following accounting impacts:\n\n- y Derecognition of all consolidated assets and liabilities at the date of loss of control at their net book value;\n- y In the absence of non-controlling interests, goodwill or disposal prices, the impact on income is limited to the reclassi/fication of consolidated gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income at their book value at the date of loss of control, or a negative impact on income of -\u20ac40m;\n- y The investment retained in the subsidiary will continue to be recognised in accordance with IFRS 9 until /final liquidation, namely equity securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income that cannot be reclassi/fied to pro/fit or loss. Any subsequent revaluations of the security as well as the impact of the /final repayment of the capital invested will remain in other comprehensive income and will not impact the result.\n\n## Disposal of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (Miami) business to Santander\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (Miami) is a branch of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, which is in turn 97.8% controlled by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nIn 2020, the executive management of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB began the process of putting the goodwill associated with outstanding loans to customers of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (Miami) branch of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (CACIB) up for sale.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (Miami) were thus reclassi/fied under IFRS 5 in the consolidated /financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB as of 31 December 2020.\n\nThe negotiations conducted since January 2021 with Santander bank led to the execution of a sale contract on 17 May 2021 for part of the commercial activity of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (Miami) branch of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and an additional agreement on 14 June 2021 for a total amount of \u20ac27 million, generating a positive impact on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's income of \u20ac12.6 million,\n\nrecognised under 'Net income from discontinued or held-forsale operations'.\n\nOutstanding amounts not sold on 17 May and 14 June 2021, corresponding to loans to customers in the balance sheet amounting to \u20ac3.53 million and amounts due to customers for \u20ac4.12 million, are no longer recognised in accordance with IFRS 5 from 30 June 2021.\n\n## CA Indosuez Wealth (Brazil) S.A. DTVM\n\nCA Indosuez Wealth (Brazil) S.A. DTVM is a subsidiary 97.8% controlled by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. The shares of this company are wholly owned by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, which in turn is 97.8% controlled by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A..\n\nIn 2020, the General Management of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB engaged in the sale process of CA Indosuez Wealth (Brazil) S.A. DTVM.\n\nThe assets and liabilities of CA Indosuez Wealth (Brazil) were reclassi/fied under IFRS5 in the consolidated /financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB at 31 December 2020.\n\nOn 23 April 2021, negotiations with SAFRA led to the signing of a sale agreement with CA Indosuez Wealth (Brazil). The completion of this transaction is subject to regulatory agreements and standard checks.\n\nCA Indosuez Wealth (Brazil) is therefore maintained under IFRS 5 in Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's consolidated /financial statements at 31 December 2021 for \u20ac10 million in 'Non-current assets held for sale' and \u20ac9 million in 'Liabilities related to non-current assets held for sale'. Net income is classi/fied as 'Net income from discontinued operations or those being divested' in the amount of -\u20ac5.7 million.\n\n## COVID-19 health crisis\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has taken action in response to the unprecedented situation caused by the COVID-19 health crisis. The Group has actively participated in economic support measures to assist its customers whose activity is affected by the crisis linked to the Coronavirus.\n\n## GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED LOANS\n\nGiven the COVID-19 health crisis, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group started offering all its business-owner customers access to the government-guaranteed loan scheme from 25 March 2020, regardless of their size or status (whether they are farmers, professionals, shopkeepers, tradespeople or companies), in addition to the measures already announced, including repayment deferrals and accelerated processing for loan applications.\n\nThese loans are in keeping with a 'hold-to-collect' business model and have the necessary contractual characteristics. They are therefore recorded at amortised cost.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's outstanding government-backed loans granted to customers amounted to \u20ac1,807 million, including \u20ac188 million not drawn.",

As a reminder, the initial recognition of the effects of the health crisis and its macro-economic effects was included in reporting as from Q2 2020.\n\n- \u008a Information on the macroeconomic scenarios used for the reporting period ended 31 December 2021\n\nThe Group used four scenarios for calculating IFRS/uni00A09 provisioning parameters in production at 31 December 2021 with projections for 2024. These four scenarios were developed in October 2021 based on the information and data available at that time.\n\nThe first scenario, which is the central one, weighted at 50%, includes a growth profile that continues to depend heavily  on  changes  in  public  health  assumptions  in 2021, but incorporates a consumption-driven rebound in growth.  Significant  but  presumably  temporary inflation in the US, with a transitory acceleration in the eurozone that is kept in check.\n\n- y The growth pro/file continues to depend heavily on public health assumptions in 2021, with the following assumptions for the eurozone and France:\n\nEven in the event of new waves of infections, the lifting of the restrictive health measures last spring would not be questioned because of the ramp-up of the vaccination rollouts. Consolidation of a strong rebound in growth driven by consumption in the second half of 2021 and recovery continuing in 2022:\n\n- - GDP growth in the eurozone forecast at 5.4% in 2021 and 4.4% in 2022 and 2.5% in 2023 after a -6.5% decline in 2020.\n- - GDP growth in France: Annual average growth would reach 6.4% in 2021 and GDP would return to its pre-crisis level by year end. It would increase by 3.9% in 2022. However, some sectors could remain weakened (e.g. the aeronautics, automotive and tourism sectors) with lukewarm demand and supply affected by shortages of certain intermediate goods. There would also be a slight increase in business failures and the unemployment rate (very low in 2020), but the wave of failures feared at the onset of the pandemic would not materialise. In 2023, growth would remain dynamic and would reach 2% and then slow to around 1.5% in 2024 before returning to its long term trend rate (estimated at 1.35% by the French Ministry of the Economy).\n\nAssumptions for the eurozone:\n\nLess sustained pressure but same sources of pressure upstream and speci/fic factors (new weightings, German VAT, base effects, etc.) that could lead to a transitory acceleration with in/flation exceeding the 2% target in the second half of 2021 and /first quarter of 2022. In/flation of 3% in August 2021 with a provisional peak expected around November 2021 when headline in/flation could get close to 4% with core in/flation around 2.4% and 1.6% in 2023. Then most likely a sharp decline with a return to comfortably below the target at end-2022 (around 1.5%). No risk of runaway in/flation based on data available in October 2021. The unemployment assumptions are 8.6% in 2022 and 8.5% in 2023, slightly higher than in 2021.\n\n- y In the central scenario, the /financial forecasts are as follows:\n- In the United States: Cautious and very slow monetary tightening by the Fed (US central bank) alongside a gradual recovery in the labour market. Willingness of the FED to carry out a gradual tapering with a moderation of long-term rates in a context of ample liquidity and high demand for sovereign securities. 10-year UST yields would hover around 1.50% at end-2021 then around 1.25% at end-2022 and 1.4% at end-2023.\n\nIn the eurozone: still very accommodative ECB (European Central Bank) policy:\n\n- - Key  rates  would  remain  unchanged  over  the  2021-2024 period, eliciting a need to support the /fiscal stimulus plans, absorb the net issuance of securities, maintain favourable /financial terms and keep risk premia in check. Consequently, ECB purchases would be extended beyond March 2022: high until end-2022 and extended (but reduced) in 2023.\n- - The ECB's \u20ac1,850 billion Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP), currently to run until March 2022, would be extended until December 2022 with a new envelope of around \u20ac180 billion. The Asset Purchase Programme (APP) would be maintained in 2022-2023 (at least) at a monthly pace of \u20ac30 billion.\n- - Long-term rates: these remain very low given the ECB's activism,  relatively  moderate  in/flationary  pressure,  questions about the output gap and its rapid closure, and the absence of major tensions on the bond markets in the US. Consequently, the Bund yield would be kept at a low level.\n- - Temporary pressure on the OAT/Bund spread (Q4 2021/Q1 2022 ahead of the presidential elections); in 2022 the French spread would narrow following the (supposedly reassuring) outcome of the elections, thanks to the enthusiasm of investors having neglected French securities; thereafter, return to a 'normal' spread (30/uni00A0bp).\n\nAssumptions for the United States\n\nIn/flation in the October-21 scenarios estimated at +4.4% for 2021, +3.5% in 2022 and +2.3% in 2023.\n\nIn/flation was stimulated by strong demand in the post-pandemic recovery phase, with speci/fic pressures on shipping, disruptions to production chains caused by supply dif/ficulties (longer delivery times, shortages of wood, steel and computer chips) and a surge in the price of commodities and intermediate goods;\n\nHowever, this impact is expected to be temporary due to:\n\n- y Legitimate but exaggerated fears of persisting higher in/flation and further upward impulses in the second half of the year, but a disappearance of base effects. 5.5% year-on-year increase by end-2021 then easing from mid-2022. Core and headline in/flation of 2.7% at end-2022.\n\nN",

Consumption surplus is temporary, partly due to the effect of exiting the crisis/restrictions being lifted.\n\nThe second scenario, which is 'moderately adverse', differs from the central scenario in that it features a more lasting and more marked rise in inflation (2.7% in  2022,  2%  in  2023  against  respectively  2.4%  and 1.6% in scenario 1). It includes a significant slowdown in consumption  and  investment  in  the  eurozone and  France  from  mid-2022  onwards  and  a  rise  in unemployment stemming from a more marked trend of bankruptcies. The projection for long-term rates could lead to declines on the equity markets and a correction of residential and commercial real estate.\n\nThe second scenario differs from scenario 1 in the following ways:\n\n- y In/flation shock: The rise in in/flation is more lasting and sharper than in the central scenario.\n\nDemand is very high, particularly from the United States and\n\nChina (demand in the United States boosted by a massive /fiscal stimulus package), while supply is disrupted by the pandemic. Disruptions to production chains, supply dif/ficulties and shortages of certain intermediate goods are more marked than in the central scenario. The rise in the price of oil, other commodities and certain intermediate goods is therefore greater and more sustainable.\n\nFurthermore, there is a type of wage-price spiral, with wage growth primarily due to the sharp increase in prices and to recruitment dif/ficulties. There is a pronounced impact in the United States and a lesser impact in the eurozone.\n\n- y Rates and markets:\n- - Fed:  tightening  of  monetary  policy  in  the  face  of  strong growth (at least at the start of the period) and higher and more sustainable in/flation. Tapering is more signi/ficant and faster than expected in 2022 and there is a hike in the Fed funds rate in 2022.\n- - 10-year UST yield: tightening of monetary policy and investors' concerns about the risk of in/flation taking hold. As a result, substantial rise in long-term rates in the US, despite ample liquidity in the /financial system.\n- - ECB: in the face of rising in/flation, the ECB's asset purchase programme is revised slightly downwards.\n- - Increase in the Bund and 10-year swaps in 2022 due to the rise in US long-term rates and reduction in ECB asset purchases.\n- - Widening of spreads of France and Italy.\n- y Macro indicators in the eurozone/France:\n- - Growth at end-2021, early 2022 but a signi/ficant slowdown in consumption and investment from mid-2022. The strong rise in in/flation is only partially re/flected in wages and leads to a decline in purchasing power. Corporate pro/fits are impacted by the sharp increase in intermediate and payroll costs.\n- - The rise in unemployment and bankruptcies is more pronounced than in the central scenario.\n\n- - The increase in long-term rates leads to a decline in equity markets and a correction in residential and commercial real estate.\n\nThe  third  scenario  is  slightly  more  favourable  than the first scenario and assumes that the pressure on commodities and intermediate goods prices in 2021 will ease quite significantly from 2022 onwards.\n\nGlobal demand remains high, but as the public health situation in\n\nemerging markets improves, disruption to supply chains is limited. The assumption is that production line management becomes more effective and that supply dif/ficulties are reduced. It is also assumed that wage increases remain fairly moderate.\n\nFrom 2022 onwards, households start spending a signi/ficant portion of the savings surplus built up during the pandemic.\n\nGrowth in the eurozone is more sustained than in the central scenario (4.8% in 2022, 2.8% in 2023 against respectively 4.4% and 2.5% in scenario 1). Long-term rates in the eurozone are very low, close to their level in the central scenario.\n\nThe fourth scenario, which is the least likely and most negative, is that used in fiscal stress testing (July 2021). It is characterised by overheating, high inflation and a rise in long-term rates in the United States, on top of multiple crises in various countries. In France, a sharp economic slowdown is projected for 2022 and 2023, combined with a major correction in residential real estate.\n\nUS growth is particularly robust in 2021 and the start of 2022: post-pandemic restart and very strong /fiscal stimulus (massive stimulus packages passed in full, rapid fall in unemployment and recovery in consumption).\n\nThere is an in/flation shock in the United States, soaring commodities and intermediate goods prices (a new rise in oil prices in 2022 - high demand and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East); strong demand in the post-pandemic recovery phase, particularly from the United States and China; production chain disruptions leading to supply dif/ficulties. Recruitment dif/ficulties and wage pressure are observed in some sectors in the United States.\n\nBond markets become concerned about the high in/flation /figures, which are more pronounced than in the central scenario (fear of an in/flation spiral caused by rising intermediate costs and wages) and the size of the US public de/ficit. The Fed is slow to react and 'too late' in raising Fed funds rates in early 2022. Tightening of US monetary policy + fiscal drift + fears of inflation taking hold leading to major concerns among investors and a sharp\n\nrise in US long-term rates.\n\nSeveral crises are piled onto this initial shock:\n\n- y Stock market crash:  the equity markets, which recorded strong gains in 2021 and are almost certainly overvalued, undergo a major correction in the face of the Fed's tightening and the sharp rise in long-term rates in the United States.\n- y Emerging markets: in some emerging markets, major delays in the vaccination process; ongoing public health crisis; some sectors heavily impacted (tourism in Asia); weak growth, particularly in Asia (apart from China) where there is no signi/ficant post-pandemic rebound, unlike in the United States and European Union.\n- y Crisis speci/fic to France: pressures on the /financial markets due to uncertainty about the upcoming presidential election which could lead to social and economic tension (rise in unemployment and bankruptcies in 2022 related to the end of 'whatever it",

No new emergency plan to deal with this social unrest. OAT/ Bund spread becomes very wide. Downgrading of the sovereign rating is envisaged.\n\n- y Crisis speci/fic to Italy: assumption of an end to the legislature in mid-2022 and a victory for a Lega/uni00A0 Nord/Brothers of Italy coalition with a majority in both chambers; tug-of-war with the European Commission, blocking of payments under the Stimulus Plan leading to market concerns about economic policy; major widening of the BTP/Bund spread; downgrading of the sovereign rating.\n\n## Government support measures have been taken into account\n\nin the IFRS/uni00A09 projections: the risk parameter forecast process was revised in 2020 to better re/flect the impact of government programmes in IFRS/uni00A09 forecasts. The effect of this revision was to mitigate the sudden intensity of the crisis and the strength of the recovery, and to spread these over a longer period (three years).\n\nThe variables relating to the interest rates level, and more generally all the variables linked to the capital markets, have not been modi/fied, because their forecasts already structurally include the effects of the support policies.\n\nIn order to take into account local specificities (geographical and/or associated with certain activities/businesses), sectoral supplements are prepared at the local level (local forwardlooking scenarios) by some Group entities, supplementing the macroeconomic scenarios de/fined centrally.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2021, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Group has made an exceptional additional ECL on healthy and impaired loans of \u20ac44 million in cost of risk.\n\nThis exceptional adjustment reduces the effect of provision reversals that occur when the macroeconomic scenarios used in the central parameters for calculating Central ECLs are updated. The adjustment is intended to cover various kinds of broad uncertainties that increased in intensity towards the end of the year. Those uncertainties - the public health situation, in/flation\n\nexpectations, pace of interest rate adjustments, particularly in the eurozone, geopolitical uncertainties - were estimated by experts and cannot be modelled. This level of uncertainty was not included in the October 2021 macro scenarios used to calculate IFRS/uni00A09 provisions for fourth quarter 2021. Therefore, the result of the Q4 provisioning models only re/flects the improvement in the October macro scenarios compared to the previous scenarios used in Q3 and does not incorporate this level of uncertainty.\n\nBy way of example, the January 2022 in/flation forecasts anticipate a 3.9% rise in in/flation in the eurozone, versus 2.4% in the IFRS/uni00A09 scenarios in production.\n\nAt the end of December 2021, including local forward-looking scenarios, the share of Stage/uni00A01/Stage/uni00A02 provisions on the one hand (provisions for performing customer loans) and Stage/uni00A03 provisions on the other hand (provisions for proven risks) represented 32% and 68% of hedging inventories respectively for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nAt the end of December 2021, net additions to Stage/uni00A01/Stage/uni00A02 provisions represented 24% of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB 's annual cost of risk compared to 76% for the Stage/uni00A03 share of proven risks and other provisions.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of IFRS/uni00A09 provisions (Stage/uni00A01 and 2 ECL amounts)\n\nThe /first scenario, called the central scenario, was weighted at 50% for the calculation of IFRS 9 ECL amounts for Q4-2021. By way of example, based on the 31 August 2021 data, a 10-point reduction in the weighting of the central scenario in the Q4-2021 calculations in favour of the more unfavourable second scenario would lead to a rise in expected credit losses (ECL) under the forward looking central scenario of around 0.1% for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nThis anticipated sensitivity under the central scenario is not signi/ficant and could be reduced based on adjustments under the local forward looking scenario.\n\nN",

(A more detailed de/finition of restructured outstandings and their accounting treatment is detailed in Note 1.2 'Accounting policies and principles', Chapter 'Financial instruments - Credit risk').\n\nFor assets restructured over the period, the carrying amount established post-restructuring is:\n\n|                                                    | Performing assets                         | Performing assets                         |                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| \u20ac million                                          | Assets subject to 12-month  ECL (Stage 1) | Assets subject to lifetime ECL  (Stage 2) | Credit-impaired assets  (Stage 3) |\n| Loans and receivables due from credit institutions | -                                         | -                                         | -                                 |\n| Gross carrying amount before modi/fication         | -                                         | -                                         | -                                 |\n| Net gain (loss) resulting from the modi/fication   | -                                         | -                                         | -                                 |\n| Loans and receivables due from customers           | -                                         | 1,033                                     | 835                               |\n| Gross carrying amount before modi/fication         | -                                         | 1,033                                     | 835                               |\n| Net gain (loss) resulting from the modi/fication   | -                                         | -                                         | -                                 |\n| Debt securities                                    | -                                         | -                                         | -                                 |\n| Gross carrying amount before modi/fication         | -                                         | -                                         | -                                 |\n| Net gain (loss) resulting from the modi/fication   | /uni2010                                  | /uni2010                                  | /uni2010                          |\n\nIn accordance with the principles set out in Note 1.2 'Accounting principles and methods,' Chapter 'Financial instruments - Credit risk,' restructured assets classi/fied in Stage 2 (performing assets) or Stage 3 (credit-impaired assets) may be returned to Stage 1 (performing assets).

At Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, it takes the form of the change in its market re/financing cost according to the type of issue.\n\n## CALCULATION OF UNREALISED GAINS/LOSSES DUE TO OWN CREDIT RISK (RECOGNISED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME)\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's preferred approach is based on the liquidity component of issues. It involves replicating all of the issues through a basket of vanilla loans/borrowings. The changes in fair\n\nvalue attributable to changes in own credit risk for all the issues are the same as for the loans/borrowings. They are equal to the changes in the fair value of the loan/borrowing portfolio caused by changes in the cost of re/financing.\n\n## CALCULATION OF REALISED GAINS/LOSSES DUE TO OWN CREDIT RISK (RECOGNISED IN CONSOLIDATED RESERVES)\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has opted to transfer the change in fair value attributable to changes in own credit risk on settlement to consolidated reserves. A sensitivity-based calculation is carried out in the event of a complete or partial early redemption. This consists of measuring the change in fair value attributable to changes in own credit risk for a given issue as the sum of the credit spread sensitivities multiplied by the change in this spread between the issue date and the redemption date.\n\nN",

The determination of value in use was based on the discounting of the CGU's estimated future cash /flows resulting from business forecasts projected over three years (2022-2025) for the Group's management purposes.\n\nThe following assumptions were used:\n\n- y Estimated future cash /flows: data forecasts compiled from projected four-year budgets for /financial oversight purposes. The economic scenario on which the /financial projections are based is one in which the epidemic is gradually brought under control and the successive waves of infection have a gradually diminishing impact on activity. However, the degrees of economic recovery vary widely from country to country, depending on the /fiscal and monetary leeway available to support the economy.  Growth proved very strong in 2021, after declining in 2020, and the outlook is still solid for 2022. US growth has been resilient, despite the blows caused by the health crisis; US GDP growth is sitting above its 2022 potential and should gradually ease back to this level going forward. Meanwhile, although eurozone activity is unlikely to return to normal until mid-2022, the in/flation shock should not alter the scenario in which GDP growth gradually slows while remaining robust.\n\nThese forecasts are based on (i) in/flation pressures, expected to remain limited over time, then gradually easing in 2022 as supply and demand are progressively rebalanced, (ii) a drop in the savings rate accompanying robust growth in consumer spending and offsetting weaker growth in disposable income, and (iii) investment rooted in robust corporate earnings and demand aided by stimulus plans.\n\nMonetary policies should gradually normalise. The ECB is expected to remain accommodative, keeping up its asset purchases at least until end-2022, then gradually tapering them off, resulting in a limited rise in long rates. The Fed, which is gradually abandoning its monetary easing policy by stopping its asset purchases in 2022 before hiking its rates, is nevertheless expected to maintain the size of its balance sheet.\n\n- y Allocated capital: 9.39% of risk-weighted assets for both CGUs (up 51 basis points compared with 31 December 2020), in line with Pillar 2 requirements;\n- y Growth rate to perpetuity: 2%. Growth rates to perpetuity at 31 December 2021 were identical to those used at 31 December 2020 and re/flect the growth forecasts of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB for both CGUs;\n- y Discount rates: 9.50% (up 10 basis points compared to 31 December 2020) for the Corporate and Investment Banking CGU and 8.50% (identical to 31 December 2020) for the Wealth Management CGU. The calculation of discount rates is based on a rolling monthly average over 12 years.\n\nImpairment tests at 31 December 2021 did not give rise to recognition of goodwill impairment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSensitivity tests on goodwill - Group share did not detect any impairment requirements, either for the Corporate and Investment Banking CGU or the Wealth Management CGU:\n\n- y a +50 bp increase in the rate of CGU capital allocation would not lead to recognition of impairment;\n- y a +50 bp increase in the discount rate would not lead to recognition of impairment;\n- y a +100 bp increase in the cost/income ratio in the terminal year would not lead to recognition of impairment;\n- y a +10 bp increase in cost of risk in the terminal year would not lead to recognition of impairment.",

The events covered by this agreement took place between 2003 and 2008.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., which cooperated with the US and New York authorities in connection with their investigations, have agreed to pay a total penalty amount of $787.3 million (i.e. \u20ac692.7 million). The payment of this penalty has been allocated to the pre-existing reserve that had already been taken and, therefore, has not affected the accounts for the second half of 2015.\n\nThe agreements with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Fed) and the New-York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) are with CASA and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. The agreement with the Of/fice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury is with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also entered into separate deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with the United States\n\nAttorney's Of/fice for the District of Columbia (USAO) and the District Attorney of the County of New York (DANY), the terms of which are three years. On October 19, 2018 the two deferred prosecution agreements with USAO and DANY ended at the end of the three year period, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB having complied with all its obligations under the DPAs.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole continues to strengthen its internal procedures and its compliance programs regarding laws on international sanctions and will continue to cooperate fully with the US and New York authorities with its home regulators, the European Central Bank and the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR), and with the other regulators across its worldwide network.\n\nPursuant to the agreements with NYDFS and the US Federal Reserve, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's compliance program is subject to regular reviews to evaluate its effectiveness, including a review by an independent consultant appointed by NYDFS for a term of one year and annual reviews by an independent consultant approved by the Federal Reserve.\n\nN",

These demands covered several periods from 2005 to 2012.\n\nAs part of its cooperation with the authorities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB carried out investigations in order to gather the information requested by the various authorities and in particular the American authorities - the DOJ (Department of Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading Commission) - with which they are in discussions. It is currently not possible to know the outcome of these discussions, nor the date when they will be concluded.\n\nFurthermore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is currently under investigation opened by the Attorney General of the State of Florida on both the Libor and the Euribor.\n\nFollowing its investigation and an unsuccessful settlement procedure, on 21 May 2014, the European Commission sent a statement of objection  to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB pertaining to agreements or concerted practices for the purpose and/or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in derivatives related to the Euribor.\n\nIn a decision dated 7 December 2016, the European Commission jointly /fined Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB \u20ac114,654,000 for participating in a cartel in euro interest rate derivatives. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB are challenging this decision and have asked the General Court of the European Union to overturn it.\n\nThe Swiss competition authority, COMCO, has conducted an investigation into the market for interest rate derivatives, including the Euribor, with regard to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and several Swiss and international banks. This investigation was closed following a settlement procedure under which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A agreed to pay a penalty  of CHF 4.465.701 and proceedings costs amounting to CHF 187.012 without any admission of guilt. Moreover, in June 2016 the South Korean competition authority (KFTC) decided to close the investigation launched in September 2015 into Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and the Libor index on various currencies, Euribor and Tibor indices. The investigation into certain foreign exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF)  has been closed by the KFTC according  to a decision noti/fied to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB on 20 December 2018.\n\nConcerning the two class actions in the United States of America in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB have been named since 2012 and 2013 along with other /financial institutions, both as defendants in one ('Sullivan' for the Euribor) and only Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. as defendant for the other ('Lieberman' for Libor), the 'Lieberman' class action is at the preliminary stage that consists in the examination of its admissibility; proceedings are still suspended before the US District Court of New York State. Concerning the 'Sullivan' class action, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB introduced a motion to dismiss the applicants' claim. The US District Court of New York State upheld the motion to dismiss regarding Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in /first instance.  On 14 June 2019, the plaintiffs appealed this decision.\n\nSince 1 July 2016, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, together with other banks, are also party to a new class action suit in the United States ('Frontpoint') relating to the SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer Rate) indices. After having granted a /first motion to dismiss /filed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, the New York Federal District Court, ruling on a new request by the plaintiffs, excluded Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. from the Frontpoint case on the grounds that it had not contributed to the relevant indexes. The Court considered, however, taking into account recent developments in case law, that its jurisdiction could apply to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, as well as to all the banks that are members of the SIBOR index panel. The allegations contained in the complaint regarding the SIBOR/USD index and the SOR index were also rejected by the court, therefore the index SIBOR/Singapore dollar alone is still taken into account. On 26 December, the plaintiffs /filed a new complaint aimed at reintroducing into the scope of the Frontpoint case the alleged manipulations of the SIBOR and SOR indexes that affected the transactions in US dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, alongside the other defendants, objected to this new complaint at the hearing held on 2 May 2019 before the New York Federal District Court. On July 26, 2019, the Federal Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs /filed a notice of appeal on August 26, 2019.\n\nOn March 17, 2021, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal of the 2 nd Circuit reversed the dismissal and returned the case to the District Court. The defendants, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, requested the Second Circuit Court to rehear the case 'en banc' (all the active judges of the Court). This motion was denied by the Second Circuit Court on May 6, 2021. Another motion was /filed on May 12, 2021 by the defendants seeking a stay of this decision remanding the case to the District Court, which was rejected on May 24, 2021. On October 1, 2021, the defendants /filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the US Supreme Court, which decided on January 10, 2022 not to hear the case. A new petition, currently under review, has been /filed by the defendants before the District Court in an attempt to stop this action.\n\nThese class actions are civil actions in which the plaintiffs claim that they are victims of the methods used to set the Euribor, Libor, SIBOR and SOR rates, and seek repayment of the sums they allege were unlawfully received, as well as damages and reimbursement of costs and fees paid.\n\n## \u008a Bonds SSA\n\nSeveral regulators  requested information to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB for  investigations relating to activities of different banks involved in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA (Supranational, Sub-Sovereign and Agencies) denominated in American dollars. Through the cooperation with these regulators, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB proceeded to internal inquiries to gather the required information available. On 20 December  2018, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections to a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB within its inquiry on a possible infringement of rules of European Competition  law in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA denominated in American dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB  became aware of these objections and issued a response on 29 March 2019, followed by an oral hearing on 10-11 July 2019.\n\nIn a decision dated 28 April 2021, the European Commission jointly /fined Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB \u20ac3,993,000 for participating in a cartel in the secondary trading",

On 7 July 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB appealed this decision to the General Court of the European Union.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was included with other banks in a putative consolidated class action before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. That action was dismissed on 29 August 2018 on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to allege an injury suf/ficient to give them standing. However the plaintiffs  were given an opportunity to attempt to remedy that defect. The plaintiffs /filed an amended complaint on 7 November 2018. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB as well as the other defendants /filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. An order issued on 30 September 2019 dismissed the class action against CACIB for lack of personal jurisdiction and, in a subsequent ruling, the Court held that the plaintiffs had in any event failed to state a claim for violation of US antitrust law.  In June 2020, the plaintiffs took an appeal from both of the Court's orders. On 19 July 2021, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals af/firmed the district court's holding that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim for violation of US antitrust law. Plaintiffs' deadline to seek further review of the district court's decision from the US Supreme Court passed on 2 December 2021 without plaintiffs taking any further action, and the action therefore is concluded.\n\nOn 7 February 2019, a second class action was /filed against CACIB and the other defendants named in the class action already pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  In July 2020, the plaintiffs voluntarily discontinued the action but the claim could be revived.\n\nOn 11 July 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB were noti/fied with other banks of a class action /filed in Canada, before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Another class action has been /filed before the Federal Court of Canada. The action before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice was dismissed on 19 February 2020.\n\n## \u008a O'Sullivan and Tavera\n\nOn November 9, 2017, a group of individuals, (or their families or estates), who claimed to have been injured or killed in attacks in Iraq /filed a complaint ('O'Sullivan I') against several banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate Investment Bank (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB), in US Federal District Court in New York.\n\nOn December 29, 2018, the same group of individuals, together with 57 new plaintiffs, /filed a separate action ('O'Sullivan II') against the same defendants.\n\nOn December 21, 2018, a different group of individuals /filed a complaint ('Tavera') against the same defendants.\n\nAll three complaints allege that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, and other defendants conspired with Iran and its agents to violate US sanctions and engage in transactions with Iranian entities in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism Act and the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act.  Speci/fically, the complaints allege that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, and other defendants processed US dollar transactions on behalf of Iran and Iranian entities in violation of sanctions administered by the US Treasury Department's Of/fice of Foreign Assets Control, which allegedly enabled Iran to fund terrorist organizations that, as is alleged, attacked plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs are seeking an unspeci/fied amount of compensatory damages.\n\nOn 2 March 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and other defendants /filed a motion to dismiss the  'O'Sullivan I' Complaint. On 28 March 2019, the Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss.  On 22 April 2019, the plaintiffs /filed a motion to amend their complaint. Defendants submitted an opposition to that motion on 20 May\n\n2019 and plaintiffs /filed a reply on 10 June 2019. On 25 February 2020 the plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint was denied and their original complaint dismissed with prejudice.\n\nOn 28 May 2020, plaintiffs /filed a motion requesting that the court enter a /final judgment against defendants to allow an appeal.  On 11 June 2020, the defendants /filed an opposition to plaintiffs' motion, and plaintiffs /filed a reply brief on 18 June 2020. On 29/uni00A0June 2021, the court denied plaintiffs' motion.\n\nOn 28 July 2021, the court stayed the O'Sullivan I action pending a decision in the appeal in a related case, Freeman vs. HSBC Holdings, PLC, No. 19-3970 (2d. Cir.). (The O'Sullivan II and Tavera cases have been previously stayed pending that appeal.)\n\n## \u008a Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ('ICE')\n\nOn January 15, 2019 a class action ('Putnam Bank') was /filed before a federal court in New-York (US District Court Southern District of New-York) against the Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ('ICE') and a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Securities-USA. This action has been /filed by plaintiffs who allege that they have invested in /financial instruments indexed to the USD ICE LIBOR. They accuse the banks of having collusively set the index USD ICE LIBOR at arti/ficially low levels since February 2014 and made thus illegal pro/fits.\n\nOn January 31, 2019 a similar action ('Livonia') has been /filed before the US District Court Southern District of New-York, against a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Securities-USA. On February 1, 2019, these two class actions were consolidated for pre-trial purposes.\n\nOn March 4, 2019, a third class action ('Hawa\u00ef Sheet Metal Workers retirement funds') was /filed against the same banks in the same courtand consolidated with the two previous actions on April 26, 2019.\n\nOn July 1 st , 2019, the plaintiffs /filed a 'Consolidated Class Action Complaint'. On August 30, 2019, the Defendants /filed a motion to dismiss against this consolidated complaint. On March 26, 2020, a judgment granted the Defendants Motion to Dismiss. On April/uni00A024, 2020, the plaintiffs /filed a notice of appeal.\n\nOn November 30, 2020, during brie/fing of the appeal, Plaintiffs' lawyers informed Defendants that all of the named Plaintiffs wished to withdraw from the case and, on December 1, 2020, Plaintiffs' counsel /filed the motion to stay the appeal, which Defendants opposed. The court denied the motion on December/uni00A07, 2020 and Plaintiffs /filed their reply brief on December 15, 2020.\n\nOn December 28, 2020, DYJ Holdings Inc. /filed a motion for leave to intervene to replace the currents named plaintiffs. On January/uni00A07, 2021, Defendants /filed a brief in opposition to DYJ Holdings' motion and also /filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.\n\nOn April 6, 2021, the court granted DYJ Holdings Inc.'s motion for leave to intervene and denied Defendants' motion to dismiss the appeal.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, Defendants submitted a supplemental brief addressing merits issues unique to DJY Holdings.\n\nOral argument was held on November 29, 2021.\n\n## \u008a Binding agreements\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB) does not depend on any industrial, commercial or /financial patent, license or contract.\n\nN",

It is staggered on a straight-line basis over the vesting period to re/flect continued employment, and a liability is recorded in employee expenses, the amount of which is subject to periodic revaluation through pro/fit or loss until the settlement date, depending on the change in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price and the vesting conditions (continued employment and performance conditions).\n\n## 7.7  Remuneration of senior managers\n\nSenior managers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB include all members of the Executive Committee of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nThe composition of the Executive Committee is detailed in the Corporate Governance chapter of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe compensation paid and bene/fits granted to the members of the Executive Committee in 2021 were as follows:\n\n- y short-term bene/fits: \u20ac16.6 million for /fixed and variable compensation (o/w \u20ac1.6 million paid in share-indexed instruments), including social security expenses and bene/fits in kind;\n- y post-employment bene/fits at 31 December 2021: \u20ac7.6 million for end-of-career bene/fit commitments and the supplementary pension plan set up for the Group's Senior Executive Of/ficers;\n- y other long-term bene/fits: the amount granted for long-service awards was not material;\n- y other share-based payment: not applicable.",

They are liable to change in the future due to changes in market conditions or other factors.\n\nThe calculations are best estimates. They are based on a number of assumptions. Market participants are assumed to act in their best economic interests.\n\nAs these models contain uncertainties, the fair values used may not be realised when the /financial instruments in question are actually sold or if they are immediately settled.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy for /financial assets and liabilities is broken down according to the observability of the inputs used for their valuation in line with the principles de/fined by IFRS 13.\n\nFair value hierarchy Level 1 applies to the fair value of /financial assets and liabilities listed on active markets.\n\nFair value hierarchy Level 2 applies to the fair value of /financial assets and liabilities with observable inputs. This includes market data relating to interest rate risk or credit risk where they can be\n\nN\n\nmeasured from observable Credit Default Swap (CDS) spread quotes. Repurchase agreements listed on an active market, based on the underlying and the maturity of the transaction, may also be included in level 2 of the hierarchy, as are /financial assets and liabilities with a demand component whose fair value is equal to the unadjusted amortised cost.\n\nLevel 3 of the hierarchy indicates the fair value of /financial assets and liabilities for which there is no observable data or for which some inputs can be remeasured with internal models using historical data. These are mainly parameters related to credit risk or prepayment risk.\n\nIn some cases, market values may be close to the carrying amounts. This applies primarily to:\n\n- y /floating-rate assets or liabilities whose fair value is not signi/ficantly affected by changes in interest rates, as their rates are frequently adjusted to market rates;\n- y short-term assets or liabilities whose redemption value is considered to be close to market value;\n- y instruments traded on a regulated market (e.g. regulated savings) whose prices are set by the public authorities;\n- y demand assets or liabilities;\n- y transactions for which there are no reliable observable data.",

        "page_content": "NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 10: RECLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## 11.2    Information about financial instruments measured at fair value\n\nMarket transactions are measured by management information systems and checked by a team that reports to the Risk Division and is independent from market operators.\n\nValuations are made using:\n\n- y prices or inputs obtained from independent sources and/or validated by the Market Risk Department using all the sources available, such as pricing service vendors, market consensus data and brokers;\n- y models validated by the Market Risk Department's quantitative teams.\n\nThe valuation produced for each instrument is a mid-market valuation, which does not take into account the direction of the trade, the bank's aggregate exposure, market liquidity or counterparty quality. Adjustments are then made to the market valuations to incorporate these factors, and the potential uncertainties inherent in the models or inputs used.\n\nThe main types of valuation adjustments are as follows:\n\nMark-to-market adjustments: these adjustments aim to adjust for the potential variance between the mid-market valuation of an instrument arrived at using internal valuation models and the associated inputs and the valuation determined from external sources or market consensus data. These adjustments may be positive or negative;\n\nBid/ask adjustments: these adjustments aim to incorporate the bid/ask spread in the valuation of a given instrument to re/flect the price at which the position could be reversed. These adjustments are always negative;\n\nAdjustments for uncertainty: these adjustments account for a risk premium as considered by any market participant. These adjustments are always negative:\n\n- y adjustments for input uncertainty aim to incorporate any uncertainties that may exist in relation to one or more of the inputs used in the valuation of an instrument;\n- y adjustments for model uncertainty aim to incorporate any uncertainties that may exist in relation to one or more of the inputs used in the valuation of an instrument.\n\nFurthermore, and in accordance with IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement', Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (CACIB) includes, in the calculation of the fair value of its OTC derivatives, various adjustments relating to:\n\n- y default or credit quality risk (Credit Valuation Adjustment/Debit Valuation Adjustment)\n- y future /financing costs and gains (Funding Valuation Adjustment)\n- y liquidity risk associated with collateral (Liquidity Valuation Adjustment).\n\n## CVA ADJUSTMENT\n\nThe Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) is a mark-to-market adjustment  that  aims  to  price  the  market  value  of  our counterparties' default risk (risk that amounts due to us will not be repaid if counterparties default or their creditworthiness deteriorates) into the value of OTC derivatives. This adjustment is calculated for each counterparty based on the trading portfolio's positive future exposure pro/files (taking into account any netting or collateral agreements, where applicable) weighted by the probability of default and the losses incurred in the event of default.\n\nThe methodology used maximises the use of inputs/market price (the probability of default is preferably directly deduced from listed CDS, listed CDS proxies, or other credit instruments if they\n\nare deemed to be suf/ficiently liquid). This adjustment is always negative and reduces the fair value of the OTC derivative assets held in the portfolio.\n\n## DVA ADJUSTMENT\n\nThe Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) is a mark-to-market adjustment that aims to price the market value of our own default risk (potential losses to which CACIB may expose its counterparties if it defaults or its creditworthiness deteriorates) into the value of fully collateralised OTC derivatives. This adjustment is calculated for each type of collateral contract based on the trading portfolio's negative future exposure pro/files weighted by the probability of default (of CASA) and the losses incurred in the event of default.\n\nThe methodology used maximises the use of inputs/market price (use of CASA CDS to determine the probability of default). This adjustment is always positive and reduces the fair value of the OTC derivative liabilities held in the portfolio.\n\n## FVA ADJUSTMENT\n\nThe Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) is a mark-to-market adjustment that aims to price the additional future funding costs and bene/fits based on the cost of Asset & Liability Management (ALM) funding into the fair value of OTC derivatives that are not collateralised, or not fully collateralised. This adjustment is calculated for each counterparty based on the trading portfolio's positive future exposure pro/files (taking into account any netting or collateral agreements, where applicable) weighted by ALM funding spreads.\n\nFor 'cleared' derivatives, an FVA adjustment known as an IMVA (Initial Margin Value Adjustment) is calculated to take into account the future funding costs and bene/fits for the initial margins to be posted with the main derivative clearing houses until the portfolio matures.\n\n## LVA ADJUSTMENT\n\nThe LVA (Liquidity Valuation Adjustment) is a positive or negative valuation adjustment aimed at pricing in both the potential absence of collateral payment for counterparties with a CSA (Credit Support Annex), and the non-standard remuneration from CSAs.\n\nThe LVA therefore factors in the gain or loss resulting from the additional liquidity costs. It is calculated for OTC derivatives with a CSA.\n\nN",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 6 - Consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2021\n\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 10: RECLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1\n\nLevel 1 is the classi/fication applied to derivatives traded on an active organised market (options, futures, etc.), regardless of the underlying (interest rate, exchange rate, precious metals or main equity indices), and equities and bonds listed on an active market.\n\nA market is regarded as being active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from exchanges, brokers, dealers, pricing services or regulatory agencies, and these prices represent actual transactions regularly occurring in the market at arm's length.\n\nCorporate, government and agency bonds that are measured based on prices obtained from independent sources that are considered to be executable and are regularly updated are classi/fied as Level 1. This applies to the bulk of the sovereign, agency and corporate bonds held. Issuers whose bonds are not listed are classi/fied as Level 3.\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2\n\nThe main /financial instruments classi/fied as Level 2 are:\n\nLiabilities designated at fair value\n\nDebts issued and designated at fair value are classi/fied as Level/uni00A02 if their embedded derivative is considered to fall under Level 2;\n\nOver-the-counter derivatives\n\nThe main OTC derivatives classi/fied as Level 2 are those measured using inputs considered to be observable and a valuation technique that does not generate signi/ficant exposure to model risk.\n\nThe following are therefore classi/fied as Level 2:\n\n- y Linear derivative products such as interest-rate swaps, currency swaps and forward FX. These are measured using simple models widely used by the market, based on inputs that are directly observable (foreign exchange rates and interest rates) or can be deduced from the market prices of observable products (foreign exchange swaps);\n- y non-linear vanilla instruments such as caps, /floors, swaptions, currency options, equity options and credit default swaps, including digital options. These are measured using simple models widely used by the market, based on inputs that are directly observable (foreign exchange rates, interest rates and share prices) or can be deduced from observable market prices (volatilities);\n- y simple exotic single-underlying instruments such as cancellable swaps or baskets of major currencies;\n\nThese are measured using models that are sometimes slightly more complex but are still widely used by the market. The signi/ficant inputs are observable. Prices are observable on the market, particularly through quotes from brokers and/or market consensus data, which can be used to corroborate internal valuations;\n\n- y Securities, equity options, and future equity options listed on a market deemed to be inactive and for which independent valuation data is available.\n\n## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 3\n\nFinancial instruments classi/fied as Level 3 are those that do not meet the conditions for classi/fication as Level 1 or 2. They are therefore mainly /financial instruments with a high model risk or products whose valuation requires the use of signi/ficant nonobservable inputs.\n\nA reserve is recognised on the initial recognition date for the initial margin for all new transactions classi/fied as Level 3. The margin is added back to pro/fit or loss, either spread out over the period during which the inputs are considered to be non-observable or in its entirety on the date when the inputs become observable.\n\nThe following are therefore classi/fied as Level 3:\n\n## Securities\n\nLevel-3 securities mainly consist of:\n\n- y Unlisted shares or bonds for which no independent valuation is available;\n- y ABSs and CLOs for which there are indicative independent valuations but these are not necessarily executable;\n- y ABSs, CLOs and super senior and mezzanine CDO tranches, for which the active nature of the market has not been demonstrated.\n\nLiabilities designated at fair value\n\nDebts issued and designated at fair value are classi/fied as Level 3 if their embedded derivative is considered to fall under Level 3.\n\nOver-the-counter derivatives\n\nUnobservable products are /financial instruments that are complex, signi/ficantly exposed to model risk or require the use of inputs considered to be non-observable.\n\nBased on these principles, observability mapping is carried out for the three Levels, indicating the classi/fication for each product, currency and maturity.\n\nThe following are most commonly classi/fied as Level 3:\n\n- y Linear interest rate or currency products with very long maturities for major currencies, or shorter maturities for emerging currencies; this may include repos depending on the maturity of the transactions involved and their underlying assets;\n- y non-linear interest rate or currency products with very long maturities for major currencies, or shorter maturities for emerging currencies;\n- y the following complex derivatives:\n- - some equity derivatives: options on shallow markets or very long-dated options or products whose valuation depends on non-observable correlations between various underlying shares;\n- - some exotic interest rate products whose underlying is the difference two interest rates (structured products based on interest-rate differences or products whose correlations are not observable);\n- - some products whose underlying is the forward volatility of an index. These products are deemed to be non-observable because of their signi/ficant model risk and thin liquidity, which prevent regular and accurate estimates of inputs;\n- - securitisation swaps generating exposure to the prepayment rate. The prepayment rate is determined based on historical data for similar portfolios;\n- - long-term interest rate/foreign exchange hybrid products of the power reverse dual currency type, or products whose underlying is a basket of foreign currencies. The inputs for the correlation between the interest rates and currencies and between the two interest rates are determined using an internal methodology based on historical data. Results are cross-checked against market consensus data to ensure that the overall method is consistent;\n- - multiple-underlying products generating exposure to correlations between several risk classes (interest-rate, credit, FX, in/flation and equity);\n- - the parts of CDOs exposed to baskets of corporate credit. These are now immaterial.\n\nN",

The vehicles /finance these purchases by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities, the repayment of which is associated with the performance of the assets comprising the vehicles.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB invests in and provides short-term credit facilities to the securitisation vehicles it has sponsored on behalf of clients.\n\n## \u008a Structured Finance\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB operates through entities dedicated to the acquisition of assets. These entities may take the form of asset /finance companies or leasing companies. In structured entities, /financing is secured by the asset. The Group's involvement is often limited to /financing or loan commitments.\n\n## \u008a Sponsored entities\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB sponsors a structured entity in the following cases:\n\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is involved in the creation of the entity and this involvement, against remuneration, is deemed to be substantial to ensuring the successful completion of operations;\n- y A structuring arrangement took place at the request of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and it is the main user;\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB sold its own assets to the structured entity;\n- y Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is the portfolio manager;\n- y The name of a subsidiary or parent company of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is associated with the name of the structured entity or the /financial instruments issued by the entity.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB sponsored its non-consolidated structured entities in which it held no interests at 31 December 2021.\n\n## INFORMATION ON RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERESTS HELD\n\n## \u008a Financial support for structured entities\n\nIn 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB did not provide /financial support to non-consolidated structured entities.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB does not intend to provide /financial support to a non-consolidated structured entity.",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## INDEPENDENCE\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes) for the period from 1/uni00A0January 2021 to the date of our report and speci/fically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## 4.3 JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the /financial statements for this period have been prepared and audited under special circumstances. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the health emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their /financing, and have led to greater uncertainties regarding their future prospects. Some of these measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on companies' internal organization and on the performance of audits.\n\nIt is in this complex, evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justi/fication of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the consolidated /financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated /financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on speci/fic items of the consolidated /financial statements.",

These concern in particular the cases relating to Euribor/Libor and SSA Bonds with the authorities of various countries (USA, UK) and the European Union.\n\nA number of tax investigations are also ongoing in France and in certain other countries where the Group operates.\n\nDeciding whether to recognize a provision and the amount of that provision requires the use of judgement, given that it is dif/ficult to assess the outcome of disputes or the uncertainties related to certain tax treatments.\n\nGiven the degree of judgement required, the measurement of provisions for regulatory and tax disputes constitutes a signi/ficant risk of material misstatement in the consolidated /financial statements, and we therefore deemed such measurement to be a key audit matter.\n\nThe various ongoing legal or arbitration proceedings, investigations and requests for information (Euribor/ Libor, SSA Bonds and other indices), as well as tax proceedings, are presented in Notes 6.15 and 6.10, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## \u008a Our response\n\nWe gained an understanding of the procedure implemented by management for measuring the risks resulting from these disputes and tax uncertainties and, where applicable, the associated provisions, notably through quarterly exchanges with management and, in particular, the Legal, Compliance and Tax departments of your Group and its main subsidiaries.\n\nOur work consisted primarily in:\n\n- y examining the assumptions used to determine provisions based on available information (documentation prepared by the Legal Department or legal counsel of your Group and its entities, correspondence from regulators and minutes of Legal Risks Committee meetings);\n- y gaining an understanding of the analyses or /findings of your Group's legal counsels and their responses to our requests for con/firmation;\n- y as regards tax risks in particular, examining, with guidance from our specialists, your Group's responses submitted to the relevant authorities, as well as the risk estimates carried out by the Group;\n- y assessing, accordingly, the level of provisioning at 31 December 2021.\n\nLastly, we examined the related disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated /financial statements.\n\nN",

We also familiarized ourselves with the main /findings of your Group's specialized committees in charge of monitoring underperforming and nonperforming loans.\n\nRegarding value adjustments for expected losses in Buckets 1 and 2, we:\n\n- y asked specialists to assess the methods and measurements for the various ECL inputs and calculation models;\n- y assessed the analyses carried out by management on sectors with a deteriorated outlook and having been seriously impacted by the crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n- y examined the methodology used by Risk Management to identify signi/ficant increases in credit risk (SICR);\n- y tested the controls that we deemed to be of key importance in relation to the transfer of the data used to calculate ECL or the reconciliations between the bases used to calculate ECL and the accounting data;\n- y carried out independent value adjustment calculations for expected losses, compared the calculated amount with the recognized amount and examined the adjustments made by management where applicable.\n\nRegarding individually calculated value adjustments in Bucket/uni00A03, we:\n\n- y examined  the  estimates  used  for  impaired  significant counterparties;\n- y based on a sample of impaired or non-impaired credit /files, examined the factors underlying the main assumptions used to assess the expected recovery /flows, in particular with regard to valuing collateral.\n\nLastly, we examined the disclosures in relation to credit risk hedging provided in the notes to the consolidated /financial statements.",

Moreover, the issue of debt instruments, some of which are hybrid, to your Group's international and domestic customers contributes to the management of your Group's medium- and long-term re/financing.\n\n- y Derivative /financial instruments held for trading purposes are measured at fair value through pro/fit or loss on the balance sheet.\n- y Hybrid issues are recognized in /financial liabilities according to the 'fair value through pro/fit or loss' option.\n\nFinancial instruments whose measurement requires the use of signi/ficant unobservable market inputs are classi/fied in level 3. We deemed the measurement of certain of these instruments to be a key audit matter when they require signi/ficant judgement on the part of management, in particular as regards:\n\n- y the mapping of the observability of valuation inputs;\n- y the use of internal and non-standard valuation models;\n- y the valuation of inputs unsubstantiated by observable market data;\n- y the estimate of valuation adjustments designed to re/flect uncertainties related to the models, the inputs used and counterparty and liquidity risks.\n\nDerivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet under financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. As at 31/uni00A0December 2021, derivative instruments categorized as level 3 amounted to \u20ac3.5/uni00A0billion in assets and \u20ac1.3 billion in liabilities.\n\nHybrid issues are recognized in financial liabilities according to the 'fair value through profit or loss' option. As at 31/uni00A0December 2021, they represented \u20ac7.6 billion in liabilities.\n\nSee Notes 3.2, 6.2 and 11.2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## \u008a Our response\n\nWe gained an understanding of the processes and controls put in place by your Group to identify, measure and recognize derivative /financial instruments and hybrid issues classi/fied in level 3.\n\nWe examined the key controls, particularly those performed by the Risk Management department, such as the review of the observability mapping, the independent veri/fication of measurement inputs and the internal approval of valuation models. We also examined the system governing the recognition of valuation adjustments and the accounting categorisation of /financial products.\n\nWith the support of our specialists in the valuation of /financial instruments, we carried out independent valuations, analysed those performed by your Group and examined the assumptions, inputs, methodologies and models used. In particular, we examined the documentation concerning changes over the year in the observability mapping.\n\nWe also assessed the main valuation adjustments recognized, as well as the justi/fication provided by management for the main differences in measurement vis \u00e0 vis counterparties observed in the margin calls process and gains or losses in the event of the unwinding of /financial instruments.\n\nN",

These tests are based on a comparison between the carrying amount of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) and its recoverable amount, de/fined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is determined by discounting the estimated future cash /flows of the CGU, as set out in the /financial forecasts validated by the governance bodies and extended until 2025.\n\nThe rate of capital allocation is determined by taking into account any speci/fic requirements set by the regulator (in particular for Pillar 2).\n\nBy their very nature, these impairment tests require the exercise of judgement to make decisions concerning the key assumptions to use, in particular for determining economic scenarios in a context marked by the end of the crisis linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, /financial forecasts and discount rates.\n\nGiven the trend in the difference between the value in use and the carrying amount, and the sensitivity of impairment tests to the assumptions used by management, we paid particular attention to the tests performed on the Corporate and Investment Banking CGU and the Wealth Management CGU.\n\nThe impairment tests performed at 31/uni00A0December 2021 did not lead to the recognition of any impairment losses on goodwill. Sensitivity tests are set out in Note/uni00A06.14 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## \u008a Our response\n\nWe gained an understanding of the procedures implemented by your Group to identify objective indications of impairment and to assess the need to recognize impairment losses against goodwill.\n\nWe included valuation specialists in the audit team to examine the assumptions used to determine the discount rates and the perpetual growth rates used, as well as the models used for calculating discounted cash /flows.\n\nWe tested the calculations and the main assumptions (rate of capital allocation, discount rate, perpetual growth rate, etc.) compared with external sources.\n\nWe examined the /financial forecasts prepared by management and used in the model to:\n\n- y verify their consistency with those presented to your Board of Directors and ensure that any restatements made were justi/fied;\n- y assess the main underlying assumptions, including in relation to the extension of forecasts beyond the period presented to your Group's Board of Directors, in view of /financial forecasts made versus actual performance in prior periods;\n- y conduct sensitivity tests on some of the assumptions (level of capital allocated, discount rate, cost of risk, cost/income ratio).\n\nWe also examined the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated /financial statements on the results of these impairment tests and the level of sensitivity to the various measurement inputs.",

Regarding consolidated /financial statements, our work includes\n\n## APPOINTMENT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank by the general meeting of shareholders held on 30 April 2004 for PricewaterhouseCoopers and on 20/uni00A0May/uni00A01997 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres.\n\nverifying that the tagging thereof complies with the format de/fined in the above-mentioned regulation.\n\nOn the basis of our work, we conclude that the preparation of the consolidated /financial statements intended to be included in the annual /financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated /financial statements that will ultimately be included by your Company in the annual /financial report /filed with the AMF (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s /financiers) agree with those on which we have performed our work.\n\nAs at 31/uni00A0December 2021, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in its eighteenth year and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres in its twenty/fifth year of total uninterrupted engagement.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated /financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated /financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a\n\ngoing concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going\n\nconcern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the /financial\n\nreporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and /financial reporting procedures. The consolidated /financial statements were approved by the\n\nBoard of Directors.\n\n## STATUTORY AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## \u008a Objectives and Audit Approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated /financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these consolidated /financial statements.\n\nAs speci/fied in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- y Identi/fies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- y Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n\nN",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated /financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- y Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated /financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- y Obtains suf/ficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the /financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated /financial statements.

It is the present value of the difference between contractual cash /flows and expected cash /flows (including principal and interest).\n\nThe ECL approach aims to recognise expected credit losses as soon as possible.\n\n## \u008a Governance and measurement of ECL\n\nThe governance of the provisioning measurement system is based on the organisation set up under the Basel framework. The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group Risks Department is responsible for de/fining the methodological framework and for the supervision of the mechanism for provisioning exposures.\n\nThe Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group relies primarily on the internal rating system and the current Basel processes to generate the risk parameters needed to calculate expected credit losses. The assessment of changes in credit risk is based on a model that anticipates losses, and extrapolation on the basis of reasonable scenarios. All available, relevant, reasonable and justi/fiable information, including forward looking information, is used.\n\nThe calculation formula incorporates probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default parameters.\n\nThese calculations are largely based on internal models used for prudential monitoring, where they exist, with adjustments to calculate the ECL.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 7 - Parent-company financial statements at 31 December 2021\n\nNOTES TO THE PARENT-COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe measurement of ECL under French accounting standards is similar to the IFRS approach.\n\nThe accounting approach also involves recalculating certain Basel parameters, in particular to neutralise internal collection costs or /floors imposed by the regulatory authorities for regulatory loss given default (LGD) calculations.\n\nThe methods for calculating expected credit losses are to be assessed according to the types of products: loans and receivables due from clients and off-balance sheet instruments.\n\nThe 12-month expected credit loss is a portion of lifetime expected credit losses, representing the lifetime cash /flow shortfall occurring from a default within 12 months of the reporting date (or a shorter period if the exposure's expected life is shorter than 12/uni00A0months), weighted by the probability of default within 12 months.\n\nThe expected credit loss is discounted using the effective interest rate determined on initial recognition of the /financial instrument.\n\nThe  provisioning  parameters  are  measured  and  updated according to methodologies de/fined by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and are used to establish an initial level of reference, or shared base, for provisioning.\n\nBacktesting of models and parameters used is carried out at least on a yearly basis.\n\nForward-looking macro-economic data are taken into account in a methodological framework applicable at two levels:\n\n- y At the level of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, in determining a shared framework for taking into account forward looking data in the projection of PD and LGD parameters over the transaction amortisation period;\n- y At the level of each entity with regard to its own portfolios. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB applies additional forward looking parameters on portfolios of loans and receivables due from clients and performing and non-performing /financing commitments when local economic and/or structural factors expose it to additional losses not covered by the scenarios de/fined at the Group level.\n\n## \u008a Significant deterioration of the credit risk\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB assesses the deterioration of the credit risk of each exposure since inception at each closing date. This assessment of changes in credit risk enables entities to classify their transactions into risk buckets (performing exposures / nonperforming exposures / impaired exposures).\n\nTo determine a signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group applies a process with two levels of analysis:\n\n- y a /first level using relative and absolute rules and criteria, applied to Group entities;\n- y a second level speci/fic to each entity related to the assessment, based on an expert opinion of additional forward looking parameters when local economic and/or structural factors expose it to additional losses not covered by the scenarios de/fined at the Group level, of the risk borne by each entity on its portfolios which could lead to an adjustment of the Group's criteria for downgrading performing exposures to non-performing exposures (by transferring the portfolio or sub-portfolio to lifetime ECL).\n\nSigni/ficant deterioration is monitored for every /financial instrument without exception. No contagion is required for a /financial instrument from the same counterparty to be transferred from performing to non-performing. Monitoring of the signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk must cover the primary debtor, without taking into account guarantees, even for transactions guaranteed by the shareholder.\n\nFor  exposures  comprised  of  small  loans  with  similar characteristics, the review by counterparty may be replaced by a statistical estimate of expected losses.\n\nTo measure the signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition, it is necessary to retrieve the internal rating and the PD (probability of default) applied on initial recognition.\n\nThe date of initial recognition refers to the trading date, when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the loan. For /financing and guarantee commitments, the date of initial recognition is the date on which the irrevocable commitment is made.\n\nFor exposures not covered by an internal rating model, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group uses amounts past due for more than 30 days as the ultimate threshold representing a signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk leading to classi/fication as a non-performing exposure.\n\nFor exposures measured using an internal rating system (particularly those monitored using advanced methods), the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group considers that all of the information included in the rating system enables a more relevant assessment than just the criteria of arrears of over 30 days.\n\nIf the signi/ficant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition is no longer observed, the provision can be reclassi/fied to 12-month expected credit losses (reclassi/fied as a performing loan).\n\nWhen certain factors or indicators of a signi/ficant deterioration are not identi/fiable at the level of an exposure considered separately, an assessment is made of signi/ficant deterioration for portfolios, groups of portfolios or portions of portfolios of /financial instruments.\n\nThe establishment of portfolios for an assessment of collective impairment can be based on common characteristics such as:\n\n- y The type of exposure;\n- y The credit risk rating;\n- y The type of guarantee;\n- y The date of initial recognition;\n- y The term to maturity;\n- y The sector of activity;\n- y The geographic location of the borrower;\n- y The value of the asset allocated as a guarantee in relation to the /financial assets, if this has an effect on the probability of default (for example, in the case of loans guaranteed only by real security in certain countries, or the loan-to-value ratio);\n- y The distribution channel, the purpose of the loan, etc.\n\nThe grouping of assets for the purpose of assessing changes in credit risk on collective basis may change over time as new information becomes available.\n\nAllocations to and reversals of provisions for credit risk on performing and non-performing exposures are booked as cost of risk.\n\n## NON-PERFORMING LOANS AND RECEIVABLES\n\nLoans and receivables of all kinds, even those which are guaranteed, are classi/fied as non-performing if they carry an identi/fied credit risk arising from one of the following events:\n\n- y signi/ficant arrears, generally when a payment is more than ninety days past due, unless speci/fic circumstances point to the fact that the delay is due to reasons beyond the debtor's control;\n- y the entity believes that the debtor is unlikely to settle its credit obligations in full unless it avails itself of certain measures such as the enforcement of collateral.\n\nA loan is deemed to be non-performing when one or more events have occurred which have a negative effect on future estimated cash /flows. The following events constitute observable data indicative of a non-performing loan:\n\n- y signi/ficant /financial dif/ficulties for the issuer or borrower;\n- y a breach of an agreement, such as a default or late payment;\n- y the granting by the lender(s) to the borrower, for economic or contractual reasons related to the borrower's /financial dif/ficul-",

These impairment losses represent the difference between the carrying amount of the receivable and estimated future cash /flows discounted at the initial effective interest rate, taking into account the borrower's /financial condition, its business prospects and any guarantees, after deduction of the cost of enforcing such guarantees.\n\nProbable losses in respect of off-balance sheet commitments are covered by provisions recognised in liabilities.\n\n## \u008a Accounting treatment of impairment losses\n\nAllocations to and reversals of impairment for the risk of noncollection of non-performing loans is recognised in cost of risk. In accordance with ANC/uni00A0Regulation 2014-07, the Group has chosen to recognise the increase in the book value arising from the reversal of the impairment related to the passage of time as net interest income.\n\n## WRITE-OFFS\n\nThe assessment of the write-off period is based on expert judgement, and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB determines it with its Risk Division, based on its knowledge of its activity.\n\nLoans and receivables which have become irrecoverable are recorded as losses, and the corresponding impairments are reversed.\n\n## COUNTRY RISKS\n\nCountry risks (or risks on international commitments) represent the total amount of non-impaired on and off-balance sheet commitments carried by an institution, either directly or via hive-off vehicles, involving private or public debtors residing in the countries identi/fied by the French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority (ACPR), or where settlement thereof depends on the position of public or private debtors residing in those countries.\n\nWhen these receivables are not classi/fied as non-performing, they continue to be carried under their original classi/fication.\n\n## RESTRUCTURED LOANS\n\nLoans restructured due to /financial dif/ficulties are those for which the entity has changed the initial /financial terms (interest rate, maturity, etc.) for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's /financial dif/ficulties, in a manner that would not have been considered under other circumstances.\n\nThe de/finition of receivables restructured due to /financial dif/ficulties therefore involves two cumulative criteria:\n\n- y contractual modi/fications or re/financing of receivables (where concessions are granted);\n- y a client in /financial dif/ficulty (a debtor experiencing, or about to experience, dif/ficulties in meeting their /financial commitments).\n\nThis notion of restructuring must be assessed at the level of the contract and not at the client level (no contagion).\n\nThey can be non-performing or performing at the restructuring date.\n\nRestructured loans do not include loans whose characteristics have been renegotiated on a commercial basis with counterparties not showing any insolvency problems.\n\nThe reduction of future cash /flows granted to a counterparty, or the postponing of these /flows as part of a restructuring, results in the recognition of a discount. It is equal to the difference between:\n\n- y The nominal value of the loan; and\n- y The sum of theoretical future cash /flows from the restructured loan, discounted at the original effective interest rate (de/fined at the date of the /financing commitment).\n\nThe discount recognised when a loan is restructured is recorded under cost of risk.\n\nLoans restructured due to the debtor's /financial position are rated in line with the Basel rules and are impaired according to the estimated credit risk.\n\nAs soon as the restructuring operation has been carried out, the exposure maintains this status of 'restructured' for a period of at least two years if the exposure was performing at the time of the restructuring, or three years if the exposure was in default at the time of the restructuring. These periods are extended if certain events occur (new incidents, for example).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The classi/fication of these securities as trading securities depends on the effective turnover of the securities and on a signi/ficant trading volume taking into account market opportunities.\n\nThese securities must be tradable on an active market and resulting market prices must represent real transactions regularly undertaken in the market on an arm's length basis.\n\nTrading securities also include:\n\n- y Securities bought or sold as part of specialised management of the trading portfolio, including forward /financial instruments, securities or other /financial instruments that are managed together and which show indications of a recent short term pro/fit-taking pro/file;\n- y Securities on which there is a commitment to sell as part of an arbitrage transaction on an organised or similar market.\n- y Borrowed securities (including, where applicable, borrowed securities subsequently loaned and reclassi/fied as 'trading securities lent') in connection with lending/borrowing transactions classi/fied as trading securities and offset against the liabilities representing the borrowed securities recorded on the liabilities side of the balance sheet.\n\nExcept as provided in ANC Regulation 2014-07, trading securities may not be reclassi/fied into another accounting category. They continue to be presented and measured as trading securities until they are removed from the balance sheet after being sold, fully redeemed or written off.\n\nTrading securities are recognised on the date they are purchased for the amount of their purchase price, excluding transaction expenses and including accrued interest.\n\nLiabilities relating to securities sold short are recognised on the liabilities side of the seller's balance sheet for the amount of the selling price excluding incidental purchase costs.\n\nAt each closing date, securities are measured at the most recent market price. The overall amount of differences resulting from price changes is taken to pro/fit and loss and recorded in 'Net gain/(loss) on trading book'.\n\n## SHORT TERM INVESTMENT SECURITIES\n\nThis category consists of securities that do not fall into any other category.\n\nThe securities are recorded at their purchase price, excluding fees.\n\n## \u008a Bonds and other fixed income securities\n\nThese securities are recognised at acquisition cost including accrued interests at acquisition date. The difference between the purchase price and the redemption value is spread over the remaining life of the security on an actuarial basis.\n\nIncome is recorded in the income statement under: 'Interest and similar income on bonds and other /fixed income securities'.\n\n## \u008a Equities and other equity variable income securities\n\nEquities are recognised in the balance sheet at their purchase price excluding acquisition fees. The associated dividends are recorded as income under 'Income from variable-income securities'.\n\nRevenues from Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) are recorded in the same item at the time of collection.\n\nAt each closing date, short term investment securities are measured at the lowest between acquisition cost and market value. If the current value of an item or a group of similar securities (calculated from market prices at the reporting date, for example) is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded for the unrealised loss with no offsetting against any gains recognised on other categories of securities. Gains from hedging within the meaning of ANC Regulation 2014-07, in the form of purchases or sales of forward /financial instruments, are factored in for the purposes of calculating impairment losses. Potential gains are not recorded.\n\nImpairment intended to take into account counterparty risk and recognised under cost of risk is recognised on /fixed income securities as follows:\n\n- y In the case of listed securities, impairment is based on market value, which intrinsically re/flects credit risk. However, if Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has speci/fic information on the issuer's /financial position that is not re/flected in the market value, a speci/fic impairment loss is recorded;\n- y In the case of unlisted securities, impairment is recorded in the same way as on loans and receivables due from clients based on identi/fied probable losses (see Note 1.1 Loans and /financing commitments - Impairment resulting from identi/fied credit risk).\n\nSales of securities are deemed to take place on a /first-in, /first-out basis.\n\nImpairment charges and disposal gains or losses on short term investment securities are recorded under 'Net gain/(loss) from investment portfolios and similar'. Income from equities and other variable income securities is recorded on the income statement under 'Income from variable income securities'.\n\n## LONG TERM INVESTMENT SECURITIES\n\nLong term investment securities are /fixed income securities with a /fixed maturity date that have been acquired or transferred to this category with the clear intention of holding them until maturity.\n\nThis category only includes securities for which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has the necessary /financial ability to continue holding them until",

Long term investment securities are recognised at their purchase price, excluding acquisition costs and including accrued interest. The difference between the purchase price and the redemption\n\nprice is spread over the remaining life of the security.\n\nImpairment is not recognised for long term investment securities if their market value falls below cost. However, if the impairment is associated with a risk speci/fic to the issuer of the security, an impairment is recorded under \u00abCost of risk.\u00bb\n\nIn the case of the sale or reclassi/fication to another category of long term investment securities representing a material amount, the reporting entity is no longer authorised to classify securities previously bought or to be bought as long term investment securities during the current /financial year and the two subsequent /financial years, in accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-07.\n\n## MEDIUM TERM PORTFOLIO SECURITIES\n\nIn accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-07, these securities are 'investments made on a regular basis, with the sole aim of securing a capital gain in the medium term, with no intention of investing in the issuer's business on a long term basis or taking an active part in its management'.\n\nSecurities can only be included in this category if the activity is carried out to a signi/ficant extent and on an ongoing basis within a structured framework and gives the reporting entity a recurring return mainly in the form of capital gains on disposals.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB meets these conditions and some of its securities can be classi/fied in this category.\n\nMedium term portfolio securities are recorded at purchase price, excluding transaction expenses.\n\nThey are recognised at the end of the reporting period at the lower of historical cost or value in use, which is determined on the basis of the issuer's general outlook and the estimated remaining time horizon for holding the securities.\n\nFor listed companies, value in use is generally the average quoted price over a suf/ficiently long period of time, depending on the estimated time horizon for holding the securities, to mitigate the impact of substantial /fluctuations in stock prices.\n\nImpairment losses are booked for any unrealised losses calculated for each line of securities, and are not offset against any unrealised gains. Unrealised losses are recorded under 'Net gains or losses on short term investment portfolios' along with impairment losses and reversals on these securities.\n\nUnrealised gains are not recognised.\n\n## INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATES, EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND OTHER LONG TERM EQUITY INVESTMENTS\n\n- y Investments in subsidiaries and af/filiates are investments in companies that are under exclusive control and that are or are liable to be fully consolidated into a given group.\n- y Equity investments are investments (other than investments in subsidiaries and af/filiates), of which the long term ownership is judged bene/ficial to the reporting entity, in particular because it allows it to exercise in/fluence or control over the issuer.\n- y Other long term equity investments are composed of securities held with the intention of promoting long term business\n\nrelations by creating a special relationship with the issuer, but with no in/fluence on the issuer's management due to the small percentage of voting rights held.\n\nThe securities are recorded at their purchase price, excluding fees.\n\nAt the reporting date, the value of these securities is measured individually, based on value in use, and they are recorded in the balance sheet at the lowest of their historical cost or value in use.\n\nValue in use represents the price the reporting entity would be prepared to pay to acquire these securities if it had to buy them having regard to its reasons for holding them.\n\nValue in use may be estimated on the basis of various factors such as the issuer's pro/fitability and prospective pro/fitability, its equity, the economic environment, the average share price in the preceding months or the mathematical value of the security.\n\nWhen value in use is lower than historical cost, impairment losses are booked for these unrealised losses and are not offset against any unrealised gains.\n\nImpairment losses and reversals and disposal gains or losses on these securities are recorded under 'Net gains (losses) on /fixed assets'.\n\n## MARKET PRICE\n\nThe market price at which the various categories of securities are measured is determined as follows:\n\n- y Securities traded on an active market are measured at the latest price;\n- y If the market on which the security is traded is not or no longer considered active or if the security is unlisted, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB determines the likely value at which the security concerned would be traded using valuation techniques. Firstly, these techniques take into account recent transactions carried out on an arm's length basis. If required, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses valuation techniques commonly used by market participants to price these securities, when it has been demonstrated that these techniques provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions.\n\n## RECORDING DATES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB records securities classi/fied as long term investment securities on the settlement/delivery date. Other securities, regardless of type or classi/fication, are recognised on the trading date.\n\n## SECURITIES SOLD/BOUGHT UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements are kept on the balance sheet. The amount received, representing the liability to the buyer, is recorded as a liability. Securities bought under repurchase agreements are not recorded on the balance sheet, but the amount paid, representing the amount receivable from the seller, is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet.\n\nThe corresponding income and expenses are taken to pro/fit and loss on a pro rata basis.\n\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements are subject to the accounting principles corresponding to the category of portfolio from which they originate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At each closing date, the receivable is measured using the rules applicable to loaned securities, including the recognition of accrued interest on short term and long term investment securities. In the accounts of the borrower, the security is recorded as an asset under trading securities at the market price prevailing on the date the security was borrowed. A liability to the lender is recorded on the balance sheet under 'Liabilities relating to securities lending transactions'. At each closing date, the liability and the securities are measured at the most recent market price and recorded for their net amount on the balance sheet, in accordance with ANC Regulation No. 2020-10, amending ANC Regulation No. 2014-07 on the netting of securities borrowing transactions.\n\n## RECLASSIFICATION OF SECURITIES\n\nIn accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-07, the following securities may be reclassi/fied:\n\n- y From the trading portfolio to the long term investment portfolio or the short term investment portfolio in the case of exceptional market conditions or, for /fixed income securities that are no longer tradable in an active market and if the entity has the intention and ability to hold the securities for the foreseeable future or until maturity\n- y From the short term investment portfolio to the long term investment portfolio in exceptional market conditions or for /fixed income securities that are no longer tradable in an active market.\n\nIn 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB did not make this type of reclassi/fication pursuant to regulation ANC 2014-07.\n\n## 1.3  Fixed assets\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB applies ANC Regulation 2014-03 relating to the amortisation and impairment of assets.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB applies component accounting for all of its property, plant and equipment. In accordance with this method, the depreciable base takes into account the potential remaining value of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe acquisition cost of /fixed assets includes the purchase price plus any incidental expenses, namely expenses directly or indirectly incurred in connection with bringing the asset into service or 'into inventory'.\n\nLand is recorded at acquisition cost.\n\nBuildings and equipment are recorded at acquisition cost, less depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses accumulated over the period of use.\n\nPurchased  software  is  measured  at  purchase  price  less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and any impairment losses since acquisition.\n\nProprietary software is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses booked since completion.\n\nIntangible assets other than software, patents and licences are not amortised. They may be subject to impairment.\n\nThe technical merger losses are recognised in the balance sheet according to the asset classes to which they are allocated, under 'Other property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and /financial assets, etc.' The loss is amortised, impaired and written off in the same way as the underlying asset.\n\nFixed assets are impaired over their estimated useful lives.\n\nThe following components and depreciation periods have been adopted by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB following the application of component accounting for /fixed assets. These depreciation periods are adjusted according to the type of asset and its location:\n\n| Component              | Depreciation period                         |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Land                   | Not depreciable                             |\n| Structural works       | 30 to 80 years                              |\n| Non-structural works   | 8 to 40 years                               |\n| Plant and equipment    | 5 to 25 years                               |\n| Fixtures and /fittings | 5 to 15 years                               |\n| Computer equipment     | 4 to 7 years (accelerated or straight-line) |\n| Special equipment      | 4 to 5 years (accelerated or straight-line) |\n\nBased on available information on the value of its /fixed assets, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has concluded that impairment testing would not lead to any change in the existing depreciable amount.\n\n## 1.4   Amounts due to clients and credit institutions\n\nAmounts due to credit institutions, to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole entities and to clients are presented in the /financial statements according to their remaining maturity or their nature:\n\n- y demand and term deposits for credit institutions,\n- y current accounts, term accounts and advances for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole internal transactions,\n- y special savings accounts and other amounts due to clients (notably including /financial clients).\n\nRepurchase agreements (represented by certi/ficates or securities) are included under these various headings, according to counterparty type.\n\nAccrued interest on these deposits is taken to pro/fit or loss.\n\n## 1.5 Debt securities\n\nDebt securities are presented according to their form: interestbearing  notes,  interbank  market  instruments,  negotiable debt securities, bonds and other debt securities, excluding subordinated securities, which are classi/fied in liabilities under 'Subordinated debt'.\n\nAccrued interest not yet due is taken to pro/fit or loss.\n\nIssuance or redemption premiums on bonds are amortised over the lifetime of each bond. The corresponding expense is recorded under 'Interest and similar expenses on bonds and other /fixed income securities'.\n\nRedemption premiums and issuance premiums for debt securities are amortised according to the actuarial amortisation method.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also amortises borrowing expenses in its parent company's /financial statements.\n\n## 1.6  Provisions\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB applies ANC Regulation 2014-03 for the recognition and measurement of provisions.\n\nProvisions include provisions relating to /financing commitments, retirement and early retirement liabilities, litigation and various risks.\n\nThe provisions also include country risks.

Unrealised gains and losses are not recorded.\n\n## MARKET TRANSACTIONS\n\nMarket transactions include:\n\n- y Isolated open positions (category 'a' of Article 2522-1 of ANC Regulation 2014-07);\n- y The specialised management of a trading portfolio (category 'd' Article 2522 of ANC Regulation 2014-07);\n- y Instruments traded on an organised or similar market, over the counter or included in a trading portfolio - within the meaning of regulation ANC 2014-07.\n\nThey are marked to market on the closing date.\n\nIf there is an active market, the instrument is stated at the quoted price on that market. In the absence of an active market, fair value is determined using internal valuation techniques and models.\n\nFor instruments:\n\n- y In isolated open positions traded on organised or similar markets, all gains and losses (realised or unrealised) are recognised;\n- y In isolated open positions traded on over-the-counter markets, the expenses and incomes are recognised in pro/fit and loss on a pro rata basis. Furthermore, only potential unrealised losses are recognised through a provision. Realised gains and losses are recognised in pro/fit (loss) at the time of settlement;\n- y Forming part of a transaction portfolio, all gains and losses (realised or unrealised) are recognised.\n\n## INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS (SWAPS, FRAS, CAPS, FLOORS, COLLARS, SWAPTIONS)\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses interest rate and currency swaps mainly for the following purposes:\n\n- 1. T o hedge interest rate risk affecting one item or a set of similar items;\n- 2.  To hedge and manage the Group's overall interest rate risk, except for transactions described in [1] and [3];\n- 3.  To carry out specialist management of a trading portfolio consisting of interest rate or currency swaps, other forward interest rate instruments, debt instruments or similar /financial transactions.\n\nIncome and expenses related to transactions mentioned in the above section are recognised in the income statement as follows:\n\n- 1. I n the same manner as income and expenses on the hedged item or set of items\n- 2.  On a pro rata basis, with unrealised gains and losses not recognised\n- 3.  At market value, adjusted through an MTM adjustment to take into account counterparty risks and future administrative expenses related to these contracts.\n\nMarket value is determined by discounting future cash /flows using the zero coupon method.\n\nInstruments cannot be reclassi/fied between categories, except for transfers from category [2] to category [1] or [3] in the event of an interrupted hedging relationship. Transfers are recognised at the net book value of the instrument, which is then subject to the rules of the portfolio to which it is transferred.\n\nUp-front and termination fees regarding interest rate or foreign exchange contracts are spread over the remaining maturity of the transaction or hedged item, except in the case of markedto-market contracts, for which they are taken directly to the income statement.\n\n## COUNTERPARTY RISK ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nIn accordance with ANC Regulation 2014-07, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB includes the assessment of counterparty risk on derivative assets in the market value of derivatives. For this reason, only derivatives recognised as isolated open positions and in trading portfolios (respectively, derivatives classi/fied in categories a and d of Article 2522-1 of the aforementioned regulation) are subject to a calculation of counterparty risk on derivative assets (CVA Credit Valuation Adjustment).\n\nThe CVA makes it possible to calculate counterparty losses expected by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nThe CVA is calculated on the basis of an estimate of expected losses based on the probability of default and loss given default. The methodology used maximises the use of observable market inputs.\n\nIt is based on:\n\n- y Primarily market data such as registered and listed CDS (or Single Name CDS) or index-based CDS;\n- y in the absence of registered CDS on the counterparty, an approximation based on a basket of Single Name CDS of counterparties with the same rating operating in the same sector and located in the same area.\n\nIn certain circumstances, historical default data may also be used.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This adjustment is measured based on positive or negative future exposure of transactions for which a cost of /financing is applied.\n\n## OTHER INTEREST RATE OR EQUITY TRANSACTIONS\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses various instruments such as interest rate futures and equity derivatives for trading or speci/fic hedging purposes.\n\nContracts concluded for trading purposes are measured at market value, and the corresponding gains or losses are taken to the income statement.\n\nGains or losses, realised or unrealised, resulting from the markto-market measurement of speci/fic hedging contracts are spread over the maturity life of the hedged instrument.\n\n## CREDIT DERIVATIVES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB uses credit derivatives mainly for trading, in the form of Credit Default Swaps (CDS). CDS concluded for trading purposes are measured at market value, and the corresponding gains or losses are taken to the income statement.\n\n## 1.8  Foreign currency transactions\n\nAt each closing date, receivables and liabilities, as well as forward foreign exchange contracts recorded as off-balance-sheet commitments denominated in foreign currencies, are translated at the exchange rate in force on the reporting date.\n\nIncome received and expenses paid are recognised at exchange rates on the day of the transaction. Accrued income and expenses not yet due are translated at the closing rates.\n\nAssets in foreign currencies held long term, comprising allocations to branches, /fixed assets, investment securities, subsidiaries' securities and equity investments in foreign currency /financed in euros are translated at the exchange rates on the date of acquisition (historical). A provision may be recognised if there is a permanent deterioration in the exchange rate affecting Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's foreign equity interests.\n\nAt each reporting date, forward foreign exchange transactions are measured at the relevant forward exchange rate. Recognised gains or losses are taken to the income statement under 'Gains or losses on trading book - Gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions and similar /financial instruments'.\n\nPursuant to the implementation of ANC Regulation 2014-07, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has instituted multi-currency accounting to enable it to monitor its currency position and to measure its exposure to foreign exchange risk.\n\nThe overall amount of the operational foreign exchange position of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB Paris stood at \u20ac836 million on 31 December 2021 compared with \u20ac538 million on 31 December 2020.\n\n## SPOT AND FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS\n\nAt each closing date, spot foreign exchange contracts are measured at the spot exchange rate of the currency concerned. Forward foreign exchange transactions categorised as trading transactions are recognised at market value using the forward rate applicable to the remaining period of the contract. Recorded\n\nnet gains or losses are recognised in the income statement under 'Net gain/(loss) from trading portfolios - foreign exchange and similar /financial instruments'. Net gains and losses on forward foreign exchange transactions that are categorised as spot exchange transactions in connection with loans and borrowings are recognised on a pro rata basis over the term of the contracts.\n\n## CURRENCY FUTURES AND OPTIONS\n\nCurrency futures and options are used for trading purposes as well as to hedge speci/fic transactions. Contracts concluded for trading purposes are measured at market value, and the corresponding gains or losses are taken to the income statement. Realised or unrealised gains or losses resulting from the markto-market valuation of speci/fic hedging contracts are recognised in the same manner as the hedged transaction.\n\n## 1.9 Consolidation of foreign branches\n\nBranches  keep  separate  accounts  that  comply  with  the\n\naccounting rules in force in the countries in which they are based. At each reporting date, foreign branches' balance sheets and income statements are adjusted according to French accounting rules, converted into euros and integrated with the accounts of their head of/fice after eliminating intra-group transactions.\n\nThe rules for conversion into euros are as follows:\n\n- - Balance sheet items are translated at the closing rate,\n- - Income and expenses paid and received are recorded at the exchange rate on the transaction date, whereas accrued income and expenses are translated at the average rate of the period. Gains or losses resulting from this translation are recorded in the balance sheet under 'Accruals, prepayments and sundry assets'\n\nor 'Accruals, deferred income and sundry liabilities'.\n\n## 1.10  O/ff-balance sheet commitments\n\nOff-balance sheet items mainly re/flect the unused portion of given and received /financing commitments and guarantee commitments.\n\nAn expense is recognised as provisions for given commitments if there is a probability that calling in the commitment will result in a loss for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nReported off-balance sheet items do not mention commitments on forward /financial instruments or foreign exchange transactions. Similarly, they do not include received commitments concerning treasury bonds, similar securities and other securities pledged as collateral.\n\n## 1.11   Employee profit-sharing and incentive plans\n\nEmployee pro/fit-sharing is recognised in the income statement in the /financial year in which the employees' rights are earned. Pro/fit-sharing and incentive plans are covered by a companywide agreement.\n\nPro/fit-sharing and incentives are included in 'Employee expenses'.",

For de/fined bene/fit plans that subject bene/fits to conditions of seniority, for a maximum capped amount, and the employee's continued employment by the entity upon reaching retirement age, the recommendation allows the distribution of bene/fits to be determined on a straight-line basis based on:\n\n- y either the date on which the employee began employment\n- y or the date from which each year of employment is included in the calculation for the vesting of bene/fits\n\nIn accordance with this regulation, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB sets aside provisions to cover its retirement and similar bene/fit obligations falling within the category of de/fined-bene/fit plans.\n\nThese obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial, /financial and demographic assumptions, and in accordance with the projected unit credit method. This charge is calculated based on the discounted future bene/fit.\n\nAs  of  fiscal  year  2021,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  CIB  applies  the determination of the distribution of bene/fits on a straight-line basis from the date on which each year of employment is included in the calculation for the vesting of bene/fits (i.e. convergence with the IFRS IC decision of April 2021 on IAS 19). The impact on the level of actuarial liabilities was \u20ac37,335k.\n\nThe impact of the /first-time application is recognised as an offsetting entry in Retained Earnings (see Note 15 on Changes in equity): it amounted to \u20ac37,335k, with an offsetting entry of \u20ac184,566k in terms of provisions for pension obligations (see Note 13 Provisions). There is no impact on surplus plan assets.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB elected to immediately recognise the actuarial gains and losses in pro/fit or loss, and accordingly the amount of the provision is equal to:\n\n- y the present value of the de/fined bene/fit obligation at the reporting date, calculated using the actuarial method recommended by the regulation,\n- y minus the fair value of plan assets, as applicable. These may be represented by an eligible insurance policy. In the event that the obligation is fully covered by such a policy, the fair value of the policy is deemed to be the value of the corresponding obligation, i.e. the amount of the corresponding actuarial liability.\n\n## RETIREMENT PLANS - DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS\n\nThere are various mandatory pension plans to which employers contribute. The funds are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies have no legal or implied obligation to pay additional contributions if the funds do not have suf/ficient assets to provide all the bene/fits corresponding to the services rendered by staff during the current and previous years.\n\nAs a result, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has no liability in this respect\n\nother than the contributions payable for the past /financial year. The amount of contributions under the terms of these pension schemes is shown under 'Employee expenses'.\n\n## 1.13   Stock options and subscription to shares o/ffered to employees as part of the Company Savings Scheme\n\n## SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SHARES AS PART OF THE COMPANY SAVINGS SCHEME\n\nSubscriptions to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. shares offered to employees under the Company Savings Scheme, with a maximum discount of 30%, do not include a vesting period but may not be sold or transferred for /five years. These subscriptions to shares are recognised in accordance with provisions relative to capital increases.\n\n## 1.14   Extraordinary income and expenses\n\nThese comprise income and expenses that are extraordinary in nature and relate to transactions that do not form part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's ordinary activities.\n\n## 1.15  Income tax charge\n\nGenerally, only tax that is payable is recognised in the parent company /financial statements.\n\nThe tax expense shown in the income statement corresponds to income tax payable for the /financial year. It includes social security contributions on pro/fits of 3.3%, as well as provisions for taxes for the year.\n\nWholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is part of the tax consolidation group constituted by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and is the head of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB sub-group constituted with the subsidiaries that are members of the tax consolidation group.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has signed a tax consolidation agreement with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Under the terms of the agreement, the de/ficits generated by all subsidiaries of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB sub-Group will be compensated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\n\nWhen tax credits on income from securities portfolios and amounts receivable are effectively used to pay income tax due for the year, they are recognised under the same heading as the income with which they are associated. The corresponding tax charge is kept under the heading 'Income tax charge' in the income statement.\n\nGiven that the legislative intent when introducing the tax credit for competitiveness and employment ( Cr\u00e9dit d'Imp\u00f4t pour la Comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 et l'Emploi - CICE) was to reduce employee expenses, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has chosen to recognise the CICE (Article 244 quater C of the French General Tax Code) as a reduction in employee expenses rather than a tax reduction.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is challenging the proposed adjustments. A provision was recognised to cover the estimated risk.\n\n## 13.2  Inquiries and requests for information from regulators\n\n## OFFICE OF FOREIGN ASSETS CONTROL (OFAC)\n\nIn October 2015, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB) reached agreements with the US and New York authorities that had been conducting investigations regarding US dollar transactions with countries subject to US economic sanctions. The events covered by this agreement took place between 2003 and 2008.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., which cooperated with the US and New York authorities in connection with their investigations, have agreed to pay a total penalty amount of $787.3 million (i.e. \u20ac692.7 million). The payment of this penalty has been allocated to the pre-existing reserve that had already been taken and, therefore, has not affected the accounts for the second half of 2015.\n\nThe agreements with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Fed) and the New-York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) are with CASA and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. The agreement with the Of/fice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury is with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also entered into separate deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) with the United States Attorney's Of/fice for the District of Columbia (USAO) and the District Attorney of the County of New York (DANY), the terms of which are three years. On October 19, 2018 the two deferred prosecution agreements with USAO and DANY ended at the end of the three year period, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB having complied with all its obligations under the DPAs.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole continues to strengthen its internal procedures and its compliance programs regarding laws on international sanctions and will continue to cooperate fully with the US and New York authorities with its home regulators, the European Central Bank and the French Regulatory and Resolution Supervisory Authority (ACPR), and with the other regulators across its worldwide network.\n\nPursuant to the agreements with NYDFS and the US Federal Reserve, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's compliance program is subject to regular reviews to evaluate its effectiveness, including a review by an independent consultant appointed by NYDFS for a term of one year and annual reviews by an independent consultant approved by the Federal Reserve.\n\n## EURIBOR/LIBOR AND OTHER INDEXES\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, in their capacity as contributors to a number of interbank rates, have received requests for information from a number of authorities as part of investigations into: (i) the calculation of the Libor (London Interbank Offered Rates) in a number of currencies, the Euribor (Euro Interbank Offered Rate) and certain other market indices; and (ii) transactions connected with these rates and indices. These demands covered several periods from 2005 to 2012.\n\nAs part of its cooperation with the authorities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB carried out investigations in order to gather the information requested by the various authorities and in particular the American authorities - the DOJ (Department of Justice) and CFTC (Commodity Future Trading Commission) - with which they are in discussions. It is currently not possible to know the outcome of these discussions, nor the date when they will be concluded.\n\nFurthermore, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is currently under investigation opened by the Attorney General of the State of Florida on both the Libor and the Euribor.\n\nFollowing its investigation and an unsuccessful settlement procedure, on 21 May 2014, the European Commission sent a statement of objection to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB pertaining to agreements or concerted practices for the purpose and/or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition in derivatives related to the Euribor.\n\nIn a decision dated 7 December 2016, the European Commission jointly /fined Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB \u20ac114,654,000 for participating in a cartel in euro interest rate derivatives.

        "page_content": "challenging this decision and have asked the General Court of the European Union to overturn it.\n\nThe Swiss competition authority, COMCO, has conducted an investigation into the market for interest rate derivatives, including the Euribor, with regard to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and several Swiss and international banks. This investigation was closed following a settlement procedure under which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A agreed to pay a penalty of CHF 4.465.701 and proceedings costs amounting to CHF 187.012 without any admission of guilt. Moreover, in June 2016 the South Korean competition authority (KFTC) decided to close the investigation launched in September 2015 into Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and the Libor index on various currencies, Euribor and Tibor indices. The investigation into certain foreign exchange derivatives (ABS-NDF) has been closed by the KFTC according to a decision noti/fied to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB on 20 December 2018.\n\nConcerning the two class actions in the United States of America in which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB have been named since 2012 and 2013 along with other /financial institutions, both as defendants in one ('Sullivan' for the Euribor) and only Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. as defendant for the other ('Lieberman' for Libor), the 'Lieberman' class action is at the preliminary stage that consists in the examination of its admissibility; proceedings are still suspended before the US District Court of New York State. Concerning the'Sullivan' class action, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB introduced a motion to dismiss the applicants' claim. The US District Court of New York State upheld the motion to dismiss regarding Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in /first instance. On 14 June 2019, the plaintiffs appealed this decision.\n\nSince 1 July 2016, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, together with other banks, are also party to a new class action suit in the United States ('Frontpoint') relating to the SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate) and SOR (Singapore Swap Offer Rate) indices. After having granted a /first motion to dismiss /filed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, the New York Federal District Court, ruling on a new request by the plaintiffs, excluded Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. from the Frontpoint case on the grounds that it had not contributed to the relevant indexes. The Court considered, however, taking into account recent developments in case law, that its jurisdiction could apply to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, as well as to all the banks that are members of the SIBOR index panel. The allegations contained in the complaint regarding the SIBOR/USD index and the SOR index were also rejected by the court, therefore the index SIBOR/Singapore dollar alone is still taken into account. On 26 December, the plaintiffs /filed a new complaint aimed at reintroducing into the scope of the Frontpoint case the alleged manipulations of the SIBOR and SOR indexes that affected the transactions in US dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, alongside the other defendants, objected to this new complaint at the hearing held on 2 May 2019 before the New York Federal District Court. On July 26, 2019, the Federal Court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. The plaintiffs /filed a notice of appeal on August 26, 2019.\n\nOn March 17, 2021, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal of the 2 nd Circuit reversed the dismissal and returned the case to the District Court. The defendants, including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, requested the Second Circuit Court to rehear the case 'en banc' (all the active judges of the Court). This motion was denied by the Second Circuit Court on May 6, 2021. Another motion was /filed on May 12, 2021 by the defendants seeking a stay of this decision remanding the case to the District Court, which was rejected on May 24, 2021. On October 1, 2021, the defendants /filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the US Supreme Court, which decided on January 10, 2022 not to hear the case. A new\n\npetition, currently under review, has been /filed by the defendants before the District Court in an attempt to stop this action. These class actions are civil actions in which the plaintiffs claim that they are victims of the methods used to set the Euribor, Libor, SIBOR and SOR rates, and seek repayment of the sums they allege were unlawfully received, as well as damages and reimbursement of costs and fees paid.\n\n## BONDS SSA\n\nSeveral regulators requested information to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB for investigations relating to activities of different banks involved in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA (Supranational, Sub-Sovereign and Agencies) denominated in American dollars. Through the cooperation with these regulators, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB proceeded to internal inquiries to gather the required information available. On 20 December 2018, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections to a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB within its inquiry on a possible infringement of rules of European Competition law in the secondary trading of Bonds SSA denominated in American dollars. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB became aware of these objections and issued a response on 29 March 2019, followed by an oral hearing on 10-11 July 2019.\n\nIn a decision dated 28 April 2021, the European Commission jointly /fined Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB \u20ac3,993,000 for participating in a cartel in the secondary trading market of Bonds SSA denominated in American dollars. On 7 July 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB appealed this decision to the General Court of the European Union.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was included with other banks in a putative consolidated class action before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. That action was dismissed on 29 August 2018 on the basis that the plaintiffs failed to allege an injury suf/ficient to give them standing. However the plaintiffs were given an opportunity to attempt to remedy that defect. The plaintiffs /filed an amended complaint on 7 November 2018. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB as well as the other defendants /filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint. An order issued on 30 September 2019 dismissed the class action against CACIB for lack of personal jurisdiction and, in a subsequent ruling, the Court held that the plaintiffs had in any event failed to state a claim for violation of US antitrust law. In June 2020, the plaintiffs took an appeal from both of the Court's orders. On 19 July 2021, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals af/firmed the district court's holding that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim for violation of US antitrust law. Plaintiffs' deadline to seek further review of the district court's decision from the US Supreme Court passed on 2 December 2021 without plaintiffs taking any further action, and the action therefore is concluded.\n\nOn 7 February 2019, a second class action was /filed against CACIB and the other defendants named in the class action already pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In July 2020, the plaintiffs voluntarily discontinued the action but the claim could be revived. On 11 July 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB were noti/fied with other banks of a class action /filed in Canada, before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Another class action has been /filed before the Federal Court of Canada. The action before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice was dismissed on 19 February 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "NOTES TO THE PARENT-COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## O'SULLIVAN AND TAVERA\n\nOn November 9, 2017, a group of individuals, (or their families or estates), who claimed to have been injured or killed in attacks in Iraq /filed a complaint ('O'Sullivan I') against several banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., and its subsidiary Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate Investment Bank (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB), in US Federal District Court in New York.\n\nOn December 29, 2018, the same group of individuals, together with 57 new plaintiffs, /filed a separate action ('O'Sullivan II') against the same defendants.\n\nOn December 21, 2018, a different group of individuals /filed a complaint ('Tavera') against the same defendants.\n\nAll three complaints allege that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, and other defendants conspired with Iran and its agents to violate US sanctions and engage in transactions with Iranian entities in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism Act and the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act. Speci/fically, the complaints allege that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, and other defendants processed US dollar transactions on behalf of Iran and Iranian entities in violation of sanctions administered by the US Treasury Department's Of/fice of Foreign Assets Control, which allegedly enabled Iran to fund terrorist organizations that, as is alleged, attacked plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are seeking an unspeci/fied amount of compensatory damages.\n\nOn 2 March 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and other defendants /filed a motion to dismiss the O' Sullivan I Complaint. On 28/uni00A0March 2019, the Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss. On 22/uni00A0April 2019, the plaintiffs /filed a motion to amend their complaint. Defendants submitted an opposition to that motion on 20 May 2019 and plaintiffs /filed a reply on 10 June 2019. On 25 February 2020 the plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint was denied and their original complaint dismissed with prejudice.\n\nOn 28 May 2020, plaintiffs /filed a motion requesting that the court enter a /final judgment against defendants to allow an appeal. On 11 June 2020, the defendants /filed an opposition to plaintiffs' motion, and plaintiffs /filed a reply brief on 18 June 2020. On 29/uni00A0June 2021, the court denied plaintiffs' motion.\n\nOn 28 July 2021, the court stayed the O'Sullivan I action pending a decision in the appeal in a related case, Freeman vs. HSBC Holdings, PLC, No. 19-3970 (2d. Cir.). (The O'Sullivan II and Tavera cases have been previously stayed pending that appeal.)\n\n## INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE, INC. ('ICE')\n\nOn January 15, 2019 a class action ('Putnam Bank') was /filed before a federal court in New-York (US District Court Southern District of New-York) against the Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. ('ICE') and a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Securities-USA. This action has been /filed by plaintiffs who allege that they have invested in /financial instruments indexed to the USD ICE LIBOR. They accuse the banks of having collusively set the index USD ICE LIBOR at arti/ficially low levels since February 2014 and made thus illegal pro/fits.\n\nOn January 31, 2019 a similar action ('Livonia') has been /filed before the US District Court Southern District of New-York, against a number of banks including Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Securities-USA. On February/uni00A01, 2019, these two class actions were consolidated for pre-trial purposes.\n\nOn March 4, 2019, a third class action ('Hawa\u00ef Sheet Metal Workers retirement funds') was /filed against the same banks in the same courtand consolidated with the two previous actions on April 26, 2019.\n\nOn July 1 st , 2019, the plaintiffs /filed a 'Consolidated Class Action Complaint'. On August 30, 2019, the Defendants /filed a motion to dismiss against this consolidated complaint. On March 26, 2020, a judgment granted the Defendants Motion to Dismiss. On April/uni00A024, 2020, the plaintiffs /filed a notice of appeal.\n\nOn November 30, 2020, during brie/fing of the appeal, Plaintiffs' lawyers informed Defendants that all of the named Plaintiffs wished to withdraw from the case and, on December 1, 2020, Plaintiffs' counsel /filed the motion to stay the appeal, which Defendants opposed. The court denied the motion on December/uni00A07, 2020 and Plaintiffs /filed their reply brief on December 15, 2020.\n\nOn December 28, 2020, DYJ Holdings Inc. /filed a motion for leave to intervene to replace the currents named plaintiffs. On January/uni00A07, 2021, Defendants /filed a brief in opposition to DYJ Holdings' motion and also /filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.\n\nOn April 6, 2021, the court granted DYJ Holdings Inc.'s motion for leave to intervene and denied Defendants' motion to dismiss the appeal.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, Defendants submitted a supplemental brief addressing merits issues unique to DJY Holdings.\n\nOral argument was held on November 29, 2021.",

OPINION\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your General  Meeting  of  Shareholders,  we  have  audited  the accompanying /financial statements of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the /financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the /financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## 3.2. BASIS FOR OPINION\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes ) for the period from 1 January 2021 to the date of our report, and speci/fically we did not provide any prohibited nonaudit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## 3.3. OBSERVATION\n\nWe draw your attention to section 2.13 of Note 1 'Accounting principles and methods and Note 13 'Provisions' to the /financial statements relating to the impacts of the change in accounting method  concerning  the  modified  calculation  of  pension commitments and similar bene/fits, resulting from the updating of ANC recommendation no. 2013-02. Our opinion is not modi/fied in respect of these matters.\n\n## 3.4.  JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the COVID19 pandemic, the /financial statements for this period have been prepared and audited under special circumstances. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the health emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their /financing, and have led to greater uncertainties regarding their future prospects. Some of these measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on companies' internal organization and on the performance of audits.\n\nIt is in this complex, evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L./uni00A08239 and R./uni00A08237 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justi/fication of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the /financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the /financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on speci/fic items of the /financial statements.",

These concern in particular the cases relating to Euribor/Libor and SSA Bonds with the authorities of various countries (USA, UK) and the European Union.\n\nA number of tax investigations are also ongoing in France and certain countries where Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank operates.\n\nDeciding whether to recognize a provision and the amount of that provision requires the use of judgement, given that it is dif/ficult to assess the outcome of disputes or the uncertainties related to certain tax treatments.\n\nGiven the degree of judgement required, the measurement of provisions for regulatory and tax disputes constitutes a signi/ficant risk of material misstatement in the /financial statements, and we therefore deemed such measurement to be a key audit matter.\n\nThe various ongoing legal proceedings, investigations and requests for information (Euribor/Libor, SSA Bonds and other indices), as well as tax proceedings, are presented in Note 13 to the financial statements.\n\n## \u008a Our response\n\nWe gained an understanding of the procedure implemented by management for measuring the risks resulting from these disputes and tax uncertainties and, where applicable, the associated provisions, notably through quarterly exchanges with management and, in particular, the Legal, Compliance and Tax departments of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank.\n\nOur work consisted primarily in:\n\n- y examining the assumptions used to determine provisions based on available information (documentation prepared by the Legal department or legal counsel of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, correspondence from regulators and minutes of Legal Risks Committee meetings);\n- y gaining an understanding of the analyses or /findings of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank's legal counsels and their responses to our requests for con/firmation;\n- y as regards tax risks in particular, examining, with guidance from our specialists, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank's responses submitted to the relevant authorities, as well as the risk estimates carried out by the Bank;\n- y assessing, accordingly, the level of provisioning at 31 December 2021.\n\nLastly, we examined the related disclosures provided in the notes to the /financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank also recognizes provisions in liabilities to cover credit risks that are not individually allocated, such as country risk provisions or sectoral provisions generally calculated based on IFRS 9 models for estimating expected credit losses (ECL).\n\nGiven the signi/ficant judgement required in determining such value adjustments, we deemed the estimate of provisions for and impairment of performing and underperforming loans in the energy and transport sectors (collectively impaired) and non-performing loans (individually impaired) to be a key audit matter due to:\n\n- y an uncertain economic environment resulting in particular from the COVID-19 crisis;\n- - the complexity of identifying exposures where there is a risk of non-recovery; and\n- y the degree of judgement needed to estimate recovery /flows.\n\nThe financing granted is recorded under loans due from credit institutions and customer transactions. Impairment is recognised as a deduction from assets (\u20ac2,078 million) or as a liability (\u20ac445/uni00A0 million) and additions/reversals are recorded under cost of risk.\n\nProbable losses in respect of off-balance sheet commitments are covered by provisions recognised in liabilities (\u20ac390/uni00A0million).\n\nSee Notes 3, 8, 13 and 26 to the financial statements.\n\n## \u008a Our response\n\nWe  examined  the  procedures  implemented  by  the  Risk Management department to categorize outstanding loans and measure the amount of recorded value adjustments in order to assess whether the estimates used were based on methods correctly documented and described in the notes to the /financial statements.\n\nWe assessed, in particular, how the crisis linked to COVID-19 and the macro-economic projections used to calculate value adjustments were taken into account.\n\nWe tested the key controls implemented by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate  and  Investment  Bank  for  the  annual  portfolio reviews, the updating of credit ratings, the identi/fication of sectors weakened by the COVID-19 crisis, underperforming or nonperforming loans and the measurement of value adjustments. We also familiarized ourselves with the main /findings of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank specialized committees in charge of monitoring underperforming and non-performing loans.\n\nRegarding collectively measured value adjustments, we:\n\n- y asked experts to assess the methods and measurements for the various ECL inputs and calculation models;\n- y assessed the analyses carried out by management on sectors with a deteriorated outlook and having been seriously economically impacted by the COVID-19 crisis;\n- y examined the methodology used to identify signi/ficant increases in credit risk;\n- y tested the controls that we deemed to be of key importance in relation to the transfer of the data used to calculate ECL or the reconciliations between the bases used to calculate ECL and the accounting data;\n- y carried out independent ECL calculations, compared the calculated amount with the recognized amount and examined the adjustments made by management where applicable.\n\nRegarding individually calculated value adjustments, we:\n\n- y examined  the  estimates  used  for  impaired  significant counterparties;\n- y based on a sample of impaired or nonimpaired credit /files, examined the factors underlying the main assumptions used to assess the expected recovery /flows, in particular with regard to valuing collateral.\n\nLastly, we examined the disclosures in relation to credit risk hedging provided in the notes to the /financial statements.",

In particular, transactions entered into for trading purposes are measured at market value and the corresponding gains and losses are taken to income.\n\nThese /financial instruments are considered to be complex when their measurement requires the use of signi/ficant unobservable market inputs.\n\nWe deemed the measurement of these complex derivative /financial instruments to be a key audit matter, as it requires judgement from management, particularly as regards:\n\n- y the use of internal and non-standard valuation models;\n- y the valuation of inputs unsubstantiated by observable market data;\n- y the estimate of valuation adjustments designed to re/flect uncertainties related to the models, the inputs used and counterparty and liquidity risks.\n\nGains or losses on financial instrument transactions accounted for in trading portfolios amounted to \u20ac1,775 million at 31 December 2021.\n\nSee Notes 19 and 23 to the financial statements.\n\n## \u008a Our response\n\nWe gained an understanding of the processes and controls put in place by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank to identify, measure and recognize complex derivative /financial instruments.\n\nWe examined the controls that we deemed of key importance, particularly those performed by the Risk Management department, such as the independent veri/fication of measurement inputs and the internal approval of measurement models. We also examined the system governing the recognition of valuation adjustments and the accounting categorization of /financial products.\n\nWith the support of our experts in the valuation of /financial instruments, we carried out independent valuations, analyzed those performed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and examined the assumptions, inputs, methodologies and models used.\n\nWe also assessed the main valuation adjustments recognized, as well as the justi/fication provided by management for the main differences observed in the margin calls and losses or gains in the event of the unwinding of /financial instruments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

STATUTORY AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Objectives and Audit Approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the /financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the /financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these /financial statements.\n\nAs speci/fied in Article L./uni00A0 823101 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- y Identi/fies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the /financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be suf/ficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- y Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- y Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the /financial statements.\n- y Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/ficant doubt on the\n\nCompany's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the /financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n\n- y Evaluates the overall presentation of the /financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report signi/ficant de/ficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the accounting and /financial reporting procedures that we have identi/fied.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in the audit of the /financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, con/firming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L./uni00A082210 to L./uni00A082214 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors ( Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes ). Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, le 22 March 2022\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nAgn\u00e8s Hussherr-Harel\n\nLaurent Tavernier\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nMatthieu Pr\u00e9choux\n\nOlivier Durand\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consequently, all duties and taxes which, for whatever reason, may become payable solely in respect of certain shares further to their redemption, whether during the life of the Company or upon its liquidation, shall be spread over all the shares making up the capital at the time of such redemption, in a manner such that all the present or future shares shall confer upon their owners, taking account where applicable of their nominal and non-redeemed amount and of the rights of shares of other classes, the same actual advantages and right to receive the same net amount.\n\nOn each occasion that it may be necessary to hold more than one share in order to exercise any right, the ownership of a single share or of shares in a number less than that required shall confer no right with respect to the Company, it being the responsibility of the shareholders to arrange personally for the grouping and, where applicable, for the purchase or sale of the necessary number of shares.",

STATUTORY AUDITORS' SPECIAL REPORT ON RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS\n\nGeneral Meeting for the approval of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank - 12 place des Etats-Unis - 92547 Montrouge Cedex, France To the Shareholders,\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank ('Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB'), we hereby report to you on related party agreements.\n\nIt is our responsibility to report to shareholders, based on the information provided to us, on the main terms and conditions of the agreements that have been disclosed to us or that we may have identi/fied as part of our engagement, as well as the reasons given as to why they are bene/ficial for the Company, without commenting on their relevance or substance or identifying any undisclosed agreements. Under the provisions of Article/uni00A0R.225-31 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), it is the responsibility of the shareholders to determine whether the agreements are appropriate and should be approved.\n\nWhere applicable, it is also our responsibility to provide shareholders with the information required by Article R.225-31 of the French Commercial Code in relation to the implementation during the year of agreements already approved by the General Meeting.\n\nWe performed the procedures that we deemed necessary in accordance with professional standards applicable in France to such engagements. These procedures consisted in verifying that the information given to us is consistent with the underlying documents.\n\n## 3.1. AGREEMENTS TO BE SUBMITTED FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE GENERAL MEETING\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 225-40 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we have been noti/fied of the following related party agreements entered into during the past /financial year and which received prior authorization from your Board of Directors.\n\n- \u008a Agreement for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB to assume CA Indosuez's corporate income tax liability on the foreign exchange gains or losses relating to the CHF-denominated investments received in connection with the merger of CA Indosuez Wealth (Group) into CA Indosuez on 1 July 2021\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., shareholder; corporate of/ficers in common: Fran\u00e7oise Gri, Catherine Pourre and Philippe Brassac.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nThe tax consolidation agreement entered into on 30 June 2020 between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. (CASA), Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (CACIB) and CA Indosuez Wealth France (CAIWF) stipulates that CAIWF will bear a corporate income tax charge equal to that which it would have borne in the absence of tax consolidation and that it will pay its corporate income tax directly to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nOn 1 July 2021, as part of the merger of CA Indosuez Wealth (Group) into CA Indosuez Wealth France (now CA Indosuez), CA Indosuez (CAI) received all of the assets and liabilities of CAIWG, including as assets, the CHF-denominated securities of CAI Suisse (CAIS) and Azqore, and as liabilities, a CHF-denominated loan.\n\nUnlike CAIWG, CAI is a credit institution and, pursuant to the provisions of Article 38-4, paragraph 2 of the French tax code (Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts), must include in its taxable income the\n\nforeign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency securities and loans as well as the income or expenses on hedging derivatives.\n\nThis will eventually lead to baseline tax neutrality, but, in the year of the merger, CAI must include in its taxable income a signi/ficant amount in respect of the /first foreign exchange gains or losses on the CAIS and Azqore shares (the 'Initial Tax Spread').\n\nAs the head of the tax consolidation subgroup, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole/uni00A0CIB bene/fited, in its relations with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., from the 'Tax gain' resulting from the tax losses generated by CAIWG and, therefore, it seems justi/fied to take on the cost of the corporate income tax on the Initial Tax Spread, up to the amount of the tax savings generated in the past in respect of:\n\n- y foreign exchange gains or losses on the CHF loan;\n- y and net /financial expenses on hedging derivatives;\n- y as it would be unfair for CAI to bear this corporate income tax cost.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nThe agreement aims to provide a framework for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB to assume the Initial Tax Spread, instead of CAI, pursuant to the following terms and conditions:\n\n- y the amount of CAI's tax exemption for 2021, corresponding to the Initial Tax Spread, capped at the Tax Gain related to the CHF hedges, i.e., a maximum of \u20ac49,798,767\n- y in the event that the taxable income declared by CAI for 2021 is less than the amount of the Initial Tax Spread and that the amount of CAI's contribution to the Group's tax payment before the exemption organised by the agreement ('2021 Gross Contribution') is less than the amount of the Initial Tax Spread, the parties agree that the amount in excess over the 2021 Gross Contribution will be subtracted from the amount that CAI contributes to the Group's tax payment for the following /financial years, until the difference is zeroed out.",

While the strict application of tax consolidation rules (which provide that the absorbed company CAIWG's losses are forfeited) would not in principle lead to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB paying CA Indosuez's corporate income tax following the revaluation of its CHF-denominated shares, it would seem legitimate to provide for such payment for the bene/fit of CA Indosuez (which takes over CAIWG's rights and obligations) and within the limit of the tax savings previously generated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB insofar as Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB previously bene/fited from these tax savings in past years thanks to the losses generated by CAIWG.\n\n## \u008a Guarantee granted to the corporate o/fficers\n\n## CORPORATE OFFICERS CONCERNED:\n\nMembers of the Board of Directors\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nTo enable the Company to assume the costs resulting from proceedings against all corporate of/ficers, including directors, the Board of Directors, at its meeting of 20 December 2012, was asked to authorise the conclusion of a guarantee in favour of directors, including the Chairman.\n\nSTATUTORY AUDITORS' SPECIAL REPORT ON RELATED PARTY AGREEMENTS\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nThe purpose of this guarantee is to cover any risk of liability in legal or administrative proceedings initiated against corporate of/ficers, notably in the United States, during the period set under the statute of limitations applicable to the claims in question, plus three months. It was submitted to the shareholders for approval at the Ordinary General Meeting of 30 April 2013 based on the Statutory Auditors' report on related party agreements, in accordance with Article/uni00A0L.225-42 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), the Board having recused itself insofar as all Directors were concerned.\n\nIn view of the positions held by the Directors within the Company, the Board was asked, at its meeting of 29 October 2015, to authorise the amendment of the guarantee in favour of the Directors in order to give it the same degree of clarity as that authorised by the Board of Directors at its meeting of 30 July 2015 in favour of the members of Executive Management.\n\nHaving noted that all Directors were concerned and that they could therefore not take part in the vote, the Board of Directors submitted this agreement to the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting of 9 May 2016 on the basis of the Statutory Auditors' special report, in accordance with Article/uni00A0L.225-42 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\nAll of the Directors bene/fit from this guarantee.\n\n## REASONS JUSTIFYING WHY THE COMPANY BENEFITS FROM THIS AGREEMENT\n\nDuring 2021, the Board of Directors authorised the application of this guarantee to Laure Belluzzo, co-opted by the Board of Directors on 2 November 2021, to Guy Guilaum\u00e9 and Claude Vivenot, appointed as Directors by the General Meeting on 3/uni00A0May 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

AGREEMENTS ALREADY APPROVED BY THE GENERAL MEETING\n\nIn accordance with Article R. 225-30 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we have been noti/fied that the implementation of the following agreements, which were approved by the Annual General Meeting in prior years, continued during the past /financial year.\n\n## With Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S./uni00A0A., shareholder holding more than 10% of voting rights\n\n- \u008a Subscription  for  preferred  shares  or  supersubordinated notes ( titres super subordonn\u00e9es 'TSS')\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nWithin the context of the strengthening of the shareholders' equity made necessary by the transfer to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (formerly Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez) of the Corporate and Investment Banking activities of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on 4 March 2004, authorised one or more issues of supersubordinated notes or preferred shares.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nIn this context, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S./uni00A0A. subscribed to two series of USD-denominated super-subordinated notes issued in 2004 for a total of USD/uni00A01,730/uni00A0million.\n\nDuring 2014, one of the issues for USD/uni00A01,260/uni00A0million was redeemed in advance on 28 February 2014.\n\nFor the only issue of USD/uni00A0 470/uni00A0 million, still outstanding and partially reimbursed at the beginning of 2019 for an amount of USD/uni00A0 270/uni00A0 million (the lifetime notional amount for 2021 was USD/uni00A0200/uni00A0million), the total coupon due for 2021, excluding latepayment interest, was USD/uni00A03,850,000.\n\n## \u008a Agreement relating to the payment of the Euribor fine\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nPhilippe Brassac, CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, Fran\u00e7ois Thibault (until the end of his term of of/fice at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on 13 May 2020), Director of both Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, as well as, in the same capacity, Fran\u00e7ois Veverka and Jean-Louis Roveyaz until the end of their terms of of/fice as members of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB on 4 May 2017.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nOn 7 December 2016, the European Commission sentenced Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., considered to be jointly and severally liable, to a /fine of \u20ac114,654,000 after an investigation carried out by the Commission concluding that a cartel existed among seven banking institutions in relation to interest-rate derivatives in euros by agreeing on the determination of the Euribor benchmark interest rate.\n\nAs soon as the Commission's judgement was delivered, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole announced that it would appeal the decision before the General Court of the European Union. An appeal was /filed on 17/uni00A0February 2017.\n\nAs the appeal did not stay the judgement, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole had to pay the full amount of the /fine by 5 March 2017.\n\nWithin this context, it was provided that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the Company should enter into an agreement determining the\n\nconditions relating to the provisional payment of the /fine, and that the conditions of the breakdown between them of the /final amount of the /fine that may have to be paid would be decided after all European judicial remedies had been exhausted.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nAt its meeting on 10 February 2017, the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB authorised the draft agreement between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB under which:\n\n- y in the period prior to the obtaining of a decision by a court of last instance having the force of res judicata, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. shall provisionally bear and pay the amount of \u20ac114,654,000 in respect of the penalty;\n- y the conditions of the breakdown of the /final amount of the potential penalty shall be determined by mutual agreement between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB at a later date, following a decision by a court of last instance having the force of res judicata.\n\nThe agreement was authorised in identical terms by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on 20 January 2017.\n\nIn accordance with the delegation granted by their respective Boards, this agreement was signed on 27 February 2017 by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's CEO and the CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. The penalty was paid within the statutory time limit, i.e., before 5 March 2017.\n\n## \u008a Business transfer agreement relating to the transfer of the banking services division activities from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB\n\nThis agreement was the subject of an amendment authorised by the Board of Directors on 10 December 2020, which follows this agreement.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nPhilippe Brassac, CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, Fran\u00e7oise Gri, Catherine Pourre and Fran\u00e7ois Thibault (until the end of his term of of/fice at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on 13 May 2020), Directors of both Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, as well as, in the same capacity, Jean-Pierre Paviet until the end of his term of of/fice on 4 May 2018.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nIn line with the 'Strategic Ambition/uni00A02020' Medium-Term Plan, which aims to refocus Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on its core activities, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB agreed to transfer Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s Banking Services Division ('BSD') to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's Operations & Country COOs Division ('OPC'). The transaction took the form of a business transfer agreement\n\nincluding:\n\n- y a settlement and correspondent banking activity consisting for the Banking Services Department in account management and the provision of services related to this account management (particularly electronic transfers, cheque clearing, etc.) for internal and external customers of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- y an account management activity for the Regional Banks and some of the other Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group credit institutions; and level/uni00A01 /filter alert processing.",

Since that date, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB has operated the acquired business with the transferred human and material resources.\n\nHowever, for operational reasons and, in particular, IT system migrations, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was not able to open accounts for BSD customers on the transfer date. Consequently, accounts opened by customers will continue to be administered by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. during a transition period and will be opened by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB during and at the end of the transition period according to a schedule based on progress made in the work to be done by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, which is expected to be completed no later than 31 December 2022 (this period was extended in view of the amendment authorised by the Board of Directors on 10 December 2020). During this transition period, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. will pass back to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB the revenue from the operations of the transferred business  received by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. from BSD customers. At the same time, all expenses, costs and liabilities incurred by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S./uni00A0A. in respect of the transferred business will be paid by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nThe business transfer was granted and accepted in return for the payment of /fifty-seven thousand euros (\u20ac57,000).\n\nAs the business transfer agreement is not a routine business transaction for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. or Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and thus cannot be considered as an 'ordinary transaction entered into on an arm's length basis', it falls within the scope of a related party agreement governed by the provisions of Article/uni00A0L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ).\n\n- \u008a Amendment to the business transfer agreement relating to the transfer of the banking services division's activities from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., shareholder; corporate of/ficers in common: Fran\u00e7oise Gri, Catherine Pourre, Philippe Brassac and Fran\u00e7ois Thibault (until the end of his term of of/fice at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S./uni00A0A. on 13 May 2020).\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF THE INITIAL PROJECT\n\nOn 1 January 2018, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. transferred certain activities managed by its Banking Services Division ('BSD') to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, by means of a business transfer agreement entered into on 20 December 2017.\n\nThe management of certain accounts opened by the Regional Banks with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S./uni00A0A. in its capacity as central body, in accordance with the applicable regulations, was nevertheless excluded from the scope of the transfer and maintained at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S./uni00A0A.\n\nFor operational reasons, in particular the migration of IT systems, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB was not able, as of 1 January 2018, to open accounts for the BSD customers. Consequently, it was agreed that Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. would maintain its contractual relations with the BSD customers and would continue to manage the accounts opened by the latter, during a transition period starting on 1 January 2018.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. decided to negotiate and establish the terms and conditions of changes to the initial project through an amendment to the business transfer agreement. Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB proposed to marginally adjust the scope of the transfer so as to exclude the following transferred activities, maintained at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. since 1/uni00A0January 2018:\n\n- y CRCA and AMUNDI 'mandatory reserve' accounts;\n- y BforBank 'Investment' and 'Re/financing' accounts;\n- y Two embargoed accounts and one account held by a deceased individual.\n\nAt the same time, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB also planned to extend the time limit of the transition period.\n\n## TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nThe business transfer agreement is cancelled in part, with retroactive effect from 1 January 2018, in order to expressly exclude the activities maintained from the scope of the transfer, as well as all the rights and obligations attached thereto such as existed at the date of transfer, and to include them in the excluded activities with retroactive effect from the date of transfer.\n\nThe partial cancellation of the business transfer agreement does not give rise to the retrocession by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB of a share of the transfer price relating to the maintained activities, the latter having been valued at zero when the transfer price was established.\n\nThe time limit for the transition period is extended until a date to be mutually agreed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB when the IT systems migration will be completed and the other operational constraints will have been lifted, and no later than 31 December 2022 (or possibly mid-2023). In addition, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB may mutually agree to change the time limit at any time during the transition period.\n\nThe conclusion of the amendment to the business transfer agreement is not a routine business transaction for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. or Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB. Consequently, the amendment to the business transfer agreement cannot be characterised as an 'ordinary transaction entered into on an arm's length basis' either for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. or for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, and both companies must comply with the related party agreements procedure.\n\n- \u008a Billing and collection mandate as part of the transfer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s IT services management activities (MSI) to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nPhilippe Brassac, CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, Fran\u00e7oise Gri, Catherine Pourre and Fran\u00e7ois Thibault (until the end of his term of of/fice at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A on 13 May 2020), Directors of both Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, as well as, in the same capacity, Jean-Pierre Paviet until the end of his term of of/fice on 4 May 2018.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nAt its meeting on 12 December 2017, the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S./uni00A0A. approved the transfer of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s IT services management activities ('ITSM') to Global IT ('GIT'), which performs the same functions for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.",

In this respect, this mandate was authorised by the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB at its meeting on 12/uni00A0December 2017.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nDuring a six- to twelve-month transition period starting from the ITSM transfer date, certain Credit Agricole Group entities may bene/fit from ITSM services, on the basis of signed quotes. Billing and collection services will be carried out by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. under a billing and collection mandate, which includes, in particular, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s warranty given to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB concerning the collection, from the entities bene/fiting from these services, of the amounts billed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. in the name and on behalf of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB.\n\nAt the end of this transition period, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB may decide, if appropriate, to perform the services for these Group entities, through another Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entity, depending on the result of the services performed during the transition period, regulatory changes and any other reorganisation of activities carried out within the Credit Agricole Group.\n\n## \u008a Tax consolidation agreement between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., shareholder; corporate of/ficers in common: Fran\u00e7oise Gri, Catherine Pourre and Philippe Brassac.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nIn 1996, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. signed a tax consolidation agreement with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, which was renewed on 22 December 2015 for the period 2015-2019, its purpose being to govern relations between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on the one hand, and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and its consolidated subsidiaries on the other.\n\nUnder this agreement, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB is deemed to constitute, along with its consolidated subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries, a subgroup forming a tax subgroup, and thus calculates its corporate income tax on the basis of the overall results for its consolidated subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries in its subgroup.\n\nIn addition, when the result of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB's subgroup is a loss, it receives the savings in corporate income tax generated by the group for the amount of the loss of this subgroup effectively allocated by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nAs the previous tax consolidation agreement expired in 2020, a new agreement was signed for the period 2020-2024.\n\nThis tax consolidation agreement falls within the scope of the related party agreements referred to in Article/uni00A0L.225-38 of the French Commercial Code and must in principle be subject to prior authorisation by the Board of Directors. As the renewal of the tax consolidation agreement was signed on 9 December 2020 before prior approval by the Board of Directors, it is therefore subject to ex-post approval by the Board of Directors on 9 February 2021.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nThis renewal concluded in 2020 between Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. covers the period 2020-2024.\n\nFirst, the amount of the de/finitive compensation for 2020 is zero (the amount of the provisional compensation for 2020 was estimated at \u20ac40.7/uni00A0million in our letter of 16 March), and, second, the amount of the provisional compensation for 2021 is also zero.\n\n## With Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais\n\n## \u008a Agreement for the indemnification of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais by the Company\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nThe Corporate and Investment Banking business of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais was transferred to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB (formerly Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez) on 30 April 2004 with retroactive effect from 1 January 2004, except for outstanding short-, medium- or long-term commercial loans for which Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB preferred to defer the effective date until 31 December 2004 at the latest, mainly due to the time needed to complete their transfer.\n\nTo comply with the principle of retroactive effect from 1 January 2004, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB undertook to indemnify Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais for the counterparty risks relating to those loans from 1 January 2004.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nThe amount of the guarantee was \u20ac1.87/uni00A0million at 31 December 2021. The amount of compensation due in respect of 2021 was \u20ac4,431.04, excluding taxes.\n\nWith Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., shareholder holding more than 10% of voting rights, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Technologies et Services , Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Solutions , CA Consumer Finance, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group Solutions, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Payment Services, Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Nationale du/uni00A0Cr\u00e9dit Agricole\n\n## \u008a Shareholders'  Agreement  on  the  rules  of governance of CA-GIP\n\nThis agreement was the subject of an amendment authorised by the Board of Directors on 3 August 2020, which follows this agreement.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nPhilippe Brassac, CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, Jacques Boyer (until the end of his term of of/fice as member of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB on 3 May 2021), Olivier Gavalda, Luc Jeanneau and Fran\u00e7ois Thibault (until the end of his term of of/fice at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A on 13 May 2020), Nicole Gourmelon (until the end of her term of of/fice as member of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB on 7 May 2019), Fran\u00e7oise Gri and Catherine Pourre, executive of/ficers and/or directors of the companies concerned.",

        "page_content": "## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nPursuant to the above-mentioned agreement, some of the parties agreed to set up a new company, CA-GIP, to lead the project concerning the merging of some of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's IT infrastructure and production activities. This company was formed in order to host, as from 1 January 2019, SILCA and the IT production activities of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Technologies et Services , Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB in France and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Solutions . Its role is to host the IT production activities of other Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities. Together, the shareholder parties hold 100% of the share capital and voting rights of the company.\n\nWithin this context, the parties wished, through the Shareholders' Agreement:\n\n- y to supplement the rules of governance of CA-GIP provided for in the articles of incorporation;\n- y to organise their relationship as shareholders;\n- y to determine the conditions that they intend to comply with in the event of the transfer of all or part of their stake in the Company's capital.\n\nThe Shareholders' Agreement relating to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole-Group Infrastructure Platform notably lays down the following rules of governance speci/fic to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole-Group Infrastructure Platform: a Board of Directors composed 50/50 of Regional Banks and their subsidiaries or IT production entities and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, with a Chairman of the company who is also Chairman of the Board of Directors, appointed upon the proposal made by the Regional Banks and a Chief Executive Of/ficer appointed upon the proposal made by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group.\n\nNoting, in addition to the presence of executive of/ficers and directors in common, that the rules of governance described above do not re/flect the intended division of capital between the Regional Banks and their subsidiaries (36%) and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group (64%), it was considered that this Shareholders' Agreement constituted a related party agreement within the meaning of the provisions of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ). The Shareholders' Agreement was signed on 8 June 2018.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nThe Shareholders' Agreement speci/fies the rules of governance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole-Group Infrastructure Platform, as concerns both the executive and the supervisory functions of the management body, as well as those of the subsidiary to be formed in accordance with the agreement. In particular, it organises the rules relating to the /financing of the company and the transfer of securities, as well as any conditions of the exit of a shareholder and the conditions under which the company's services will be provided.\n\n- \u008a Amendment to the Shareholders' Agreement on the rules of governance of CA-GIP\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., shareholder; corporate of/ficers in common: Jacques Boyer (until the expiry of his term of of/fice as director on the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB on 3 May 2021), Philippe Brassac, Paul Carite, Olivier Gavalda, Luc Jeanneau, Odet Triquet, Fran\u00e7oise Gri, Catherine Pourre, and Laurence Renoult (until the expiry of her term of of/fice as director on the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB on 30 October 2021).\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nFor the record, the formation of CA-GIP concerned the merger of some of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's IT infrastructure and production\n\nactivities. Within this context, several agreements were signed, some of which were related party agreements.\n\nThe parties (CATS, CASA, CAAS, CACF, CACIB, CAGS, CAPS, LCL and FNCA) notably entered into a Shareholders' Agreement on 8 June 2018 concerning the rules of governance of CA-GIP and supplementing the articles of association of the latter, organising the parties' relationships as shareholders, and determining the conditions with which the parties intend to comply in the event of the transfer of all or part of their stake in the Company's share capital.\n\nIn accordance with Articles/uni00A0 L.225-38 et seq. of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), and due to the different signatories having directors in common, this Shareholders' Agreement is considered to be a related party agreement. Consequently, any subsequent change or amendment to this Shareholders' Agreement must be submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.\n\n## CONDITIONS\n\nBy this amendment, the parties intend to modify the clauses and conditions of the Shareholders' Agreement initially entered into to facilitate the functioning of its governance bodies:\n\n- y Facilitating the functioning of the Board of Directors of CA-GIP;\n- y Ensuring /flexibility in the appointment of the Chairs of specialist committees (in particular, the Audit and Finance Committee): Article 2.4.9.1(c);\n- - Composition of the Audit and Finance Committee/Article 2.4.9.1(d);\n- - Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee.\n\nWith Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S./uni00A0A., shareholder holding more than 10% of voting rights, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Assurances Solutions , Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, CA Consumer Finance, Credit Agricole Group Solutions, Credit AgricoleGroup Infrastructure Platform and SILCA.\n\n- \u008a SILCA guarantee agreement on the representations and warranties granted by the shareholders of SILCA for the benefit of CA-GIP, as well as the respective rights and obligations of the parties in the event of breach or inaccuracy of one or more of said representations\n\n## EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS CONCERNED\n\nPhilippe Brassac, CEO of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB, Jacques Boyer (until the end of his term of of/fice as member of the Board of Directors of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole CIB on 3 May 2021), Olivier Gavalda, Fran\u00e7ois Thibault (until the end of his term of of/fice at Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. on 13 May 2020), Nicole Gourmelon (until the end of her term of of/fice as member of the Board of Directors of the Company on 7 May 2019), Fran\u00e7oise Gri and Catherine Pourre, executive of/ficers and/or directors in common of the companies concerned.\n\n## NATURE AND PURPOSE\n\nAt its meeting on 4 May 2018 during which it authorised the signing of the agreement, the Company's Board of Directors was informed that the signatories would undertake that the agreements for the contribution or divestment of business activities would provide for clauses guaranteeing assets and liabilities relating to management prior to the completion date and that, in the case of SILCA, a special mechanism must be studied insofar as this entity would be the subject of a merger before the expiry of the liability warranties.",

        "page_content": "## 1.1. RISKS\n\n## Credit Risk\n\n- \u00b7 Corporate & financial institutions risk: Risk arising in the event of default by a counterparty or counterparties considered to be a single group of related clients in the major client scope, excluding the risk of sector and individual concentration and issuer risk.\n- \u00b7 Sector and individual concentration risk: Risk arising from exposure to counterparties considered to be a single group of related clients, to counterparties operating in the same economic sector or in the same geographical region, or from the granting of loans relating to the same activity, or from the application of credit risk mitigation techniques, including collateral issued by the same issuer.\n- \u00b7 Country and sovereign risk: Credit risk associated with exposures to countries and sovereigns, including the risk of concentrated exposures in credit and investment portfolios.\n- - Country risk is the risk that the deterioration in the environment or the economic, /financial, political or social situation of a country may affect the Bank's activities and the quality of our counterparties in that country;\n- - Sovereign risk measures the losses incurred by CACIB under its commitments to sovereign counterparties in the event of their default or due to them being unable to meet their contractual obligations.\n- \u00b7 Counterparty risk on market transactions: Risk arising in the event of the default or the deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty or counterparties considered to be a  single  group  of  related  clients  under  /financial  contracts (within the meaning of Article L 211.1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code) entered into with those counterparties. \u00a1  Securitisation  risk:  Credit  risk  arising  from  securitisation transactions in which CACIB acts as an investor, originator or sponsor, including reputational risks such as those arising in conjunction with complex structures or products\n\n## Financial risks\n\n- \u00b7 Global interest rate risk: Risk of future loss on the net interest margin following interest rate stress. This risk re/flects the potential impact of interest rate movements on the interest rate margin, net banking income and equity capital.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk: Liquidity Risk covers:\n- - liquidity price risk: the risk of additional /financial costs caused by a change in re/financing spreads.\n- - liquidity availability risk: risk of the funds required in order to meet commitments not being available.\n- \u00b7 Risk of change in the value of the securities portfolio or Issuer risk: Risk of a fall in the value of securities held in the banking book (excluding equity investments) and recognised at fair value, where those securities were acquired to generate a return and/or to manage liquidity reserves.\n- \u00b7 Market risk: Risk of loss of value of /financial instruments arising from changes to market parameters, the volatility of these parameters and the correlations between these parameters.  These  parameters  include  exchange  rates,  interest rates, the prices of securities (shares, bonds) and commodities, derivative products and all other assets, such as property assets.\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange risk (banking book): Risk arising from structural foreign exchange positions (equity investments), as operational foreign exchange risk is systematically hedged.\n\n- \u00b7 Transformation  risk: This  risk  exists  when  assets  are /financed using resources with differing maturities. As a result of their traditional business of transforming resources with short maturities into longer term uses, banks are naturally affected by transformation risk, which itself entails liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Transformation is when assets have a longer maturity than liabilities and anti-transformation is when assets are /financed by resources with a longer maturity.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance risk: Risk of judicial, administrative or disciplinary sanctions, signi/ficant /financial losses or reputational damage, arising from non-compliance with laws, regulations or professional or ethical rules on banking and /financial activities, or instructions from the executive body, in particular pursuant to the guidelines of the supervisory body. This sub-category of risk also includes the risk of internal and external fraud and the risk of misconduct.\n- \u00b7 Legal risk : Risk of a dispute with a counterparty resulting from any inaccuracy, de/ficiency or insuf/ficiency that may be attributable to the supervised entity in relation to its transactions. It therefore covers: legislative risk, i.e., breaches of the laws or regulations that govern the exercise of the Bank's activities in any jurisdiction in which it operates and that determine the legality and validity of its actions and their enforceability by third parties; contractual risk, i.e., the risk that, as a result of inaccuracy, de/ficiency or insuf/ficiency, contractual documentation is not suitable for the transactions carried out, with the result that it does not fully and clearly re/flect intentions.\n- \u00b7 Other operational risks (includeing accounting risk): In addition to the sub-category of risks referred to above: the risk of losses resulting from inadequate or defective processes, staff and internal systems or external events; operational risks include risks associated with unlikely but high-impact events, as well as security risks to information systems and physical risks\n\n## Other Risks\n\n- \u00b7 Business risks : Risk covering two speci/fic risks:\n- - strategic risk: the risk linked to losses or falls in revenue or pro/fits due to decisions over strategic choices and/or our competitive positioning;\n- - systemic risk: global risk related to the macroeconomic, political and regulatory environment (in particular, the prudential and tax environment).\n- \u00b7 Climate risk: Risk covering:\n- - physical  risks  resulting  from  damage  directly  caused  by meteorological and climatic events (acute risks, as for instance natural disasters, and chronic risks, associated with longer-term changes in climate patterns).\n- - energy transition risks resulting from the effects of the implementation of a low-carbon business model (regulatory and legal, technological, market and reputational risks).",
