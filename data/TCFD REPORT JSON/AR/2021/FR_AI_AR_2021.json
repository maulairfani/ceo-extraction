How would you describe Air Liquide's performance?\n\nIn short, I would say that it was a very good year, given\n\nthe complex environment in which we were operating. Indeed, we stepped up to the plate on all fronts. Throughout the world, Air Liquide teams demonstrated an incredible ability to both react and adapt to many challenges, whether in response to the covid-19 crisis, the significant acceleration in inflation or the energy transition challenge. The Group's resilience was thoroughly tested in 2021 and our success is due to our 66,400 employees who give their all to our customers and patients on a daily basis. I would like to give them my heartfelt thanks and once again express my great pride in them.\n\n## Could you tell us more regarding the Group's financial performance?\n\nIn 2021, Air Liquide delivered another year of profitable growth. The Group posted an 8.2% (1) increase in sales to reach 23.3 billion euros in revenue, and a 13.3% (2) increase in recurring net profit. Growth was achieved across all activities, with Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies benefiting from projects relating to the energy transition. In the Gas & Services activity, which represents 95% of Group revenue, all business lines and geographical areas are up significantly, particularly in Asia (+6%), Europe (+7%) and the Americas (+8%).\n\nOur operating margin is increasing thanks to an inflation-adapted pricing policy, high efficiency gains reaching 430 million euros and strong business portfolio management. Amid a landscape of high energy prices, the Group was able to counter rising costs thanks to our strong business model. Finally, 2021 saw a high volume of investments that reached 3.6 billion euros. The Group's financial performance in 2021 was truly exceptional.\n\n## In March 2021, Air Liquide announced ambitious sustainable development objectives. What has that changed for the Group?\n\nThese objectives represent an in-depth evolution of our business model. Our performance must not only take into account the interests of our employees, customers and shareholders, but also those of society as a whole.",

        "page_content": "## \u00ab We are focusing on global performance.\n\nGrowth only makes sense if it has a positive impact on the environment and wider society. \u00bb\n\nWith these objectives, we have set out a very clear road map in terms of sustainable development, and the Group is now focused on global performance, which combines financial and non-financial indicators. I firmly believe that economic growth should be accompanied by a positive impact on the environment and all of society.\n\n## Decarbonization is a key focus of your commitments. What are the key drivers in this field?\n\nIn practical terms, we have targeted two major areas of action to fight global warming. The first is to decarbonize industry. We are a leading player in this pursuit thanks to our wide range of technologies based on hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and biomethane. We implement these solutions for our customers, allowing them to significantly reduce their CO2 emissions. We are also working to decarbonize our own operations through numerous initiatives, from the purchase of renewable energy - as we've done in the Netherlands and in Belgium - to the construction of more energy-efficient production plants that emit less CO2. Our goal is to reduce our CO2 emissions by 33% by 2035 and to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Our second area of action is linked to the first, and is of course hydrogen, a major lever of the energy transition.\n\n## In terms of hydrogen, what are your major accomplishments?\n\nThere are so many, and we are extremely proud of them. These days, many companies are interested in hydrogen and its adoption is rapidly gaining momentum in the industrial and heavy transport sectors. We have already signed several partnerships with major global industrial brands in these domains, a sign of how our technologies have reached maturity. In the past four years, we have multiplied our annual expenditure on hydrogen technologies by 20, and the number of our employees working in this field has increased tenfold. And this is just the beginning; the outlook is extremely promising. By 2035, we will invest approximately 8 billion euros in the low-carbon hydrogen value chain, with the goal of tripling sales from 2 billion to 6 billion euros in the same time frame.\n\n## On a more personal note, 2022 is a milestone year for you, with the announcement of a new governance organization and the launch of a new strategic plan.\n\nIndeed, on June 1, 2022, Fran\u00e7ois Jackow will succeed me as Chief Executive Officer. I will remain Chairman of the Board of Directors, a role that I am familiar with, having already held it for around 15 years. We have planned this transition carefully with the entire Board of Directors, and I have complete confidence in Fran\u00e7ois, his leadership qualities, his experience and his unrivaled knowledge of the Group. I am confident that he will continue, in tandem with the Executive Committee team, the transformations that are already underway and will take them even further, notably through our new strategic plan. Announced on March 22, 2022, this plan marks an important step for the Group as we embark on a path of global performance that combines both financial and nonfinancial indicators.\n\n## What is your vision for the Group's future?\n\nWe are at a very singular moment in the history of the world, marked by geopolitical, economic and environmental upheavals. The last two years have profoundly transformed our societies, and we have all lived it firsthand. More recently, the war in Ukraine and the terrible humanitarian and economic consequences that stem from it have changed the geopolitical situation and shaken up the world order. Despite these challenges, I think that the world must continue to move forward, and that we must always believe in the future and build it with conviction. From the Group's point of view, our resilience and our capacity to adapt are true assets. For over 120 years, Air Liquide has ceaselessly cultivated its key strength: the ability to perceive and even anticipate the profound changes impacting society, and to offer the necessary expertise.\n\nWe are also at a real turning point in the Group's history. Despite the current uncertain environment, I remain confident in Air Liquide's ability to face the challenges ahead. The opportunities for Air Liquide remain numerous. Our international presence, inventor DNA, technological expertise and the diversity of our business, supported by the strength of our model, will enable the continuation of our growth trajectory. We are having a truly decisive impact on the markets that are essential for the future: hydrogen, of course, which is part of a rapidly changing energy world, but also healthcare, electronics and high technology. Few companies have such a wide range. We are pleased to be able to act in so many markets.",

In the following  decade  Air  Liquide  linked  its  production  units  to  one another and supplied several customers with pipeline network. The production increase allowed to meet demand from large industries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIRGAS ACQUISITION BY AIR LIQUIDE\n\nThis acquisition enabled the Group to be integrated on the whole value chain  of  the  American  market,  combining  Air  Liquide's  production capacities with Airgas' distribution channels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF NEW HYDROGEN MARKETS\n\nAir Liquide invested in new hydrogen markets at large scale: production using electrolysis, hydrogen liquefaction for mobility, and a first project where coal is partially replaced with hydrogen to produce low carbon steel.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY GOALS\n\nThe Group strengthened all of its sustainable development goals by detailing  them  around  three  axes.  First,  to  ACT  for  a  low-carbon society, in line with the Paris Agreement, by setting a target of carbon neutrality by 2050, with two major intermediate steps: the start of the reduction of its CO 2 emissions in absolute value around 2025 then a 33% decrease in its  CO 2 emissions  from  scopes  1  and  2  by  2035 compared to 2020. Second, CARE for patients by improving the quality of  life  of  patients  with  chronic  diseases  in  mature  economies  and facilitating access to medical oxygen for rural communities in low- and middle-income countries. And third, promoting TRUST as the base to engage with employees and to build a best-in-class governance.\n\n## CONSTANT EVOLUTION FOR MORE THAN 100 YEARS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## LISTING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE\n\nThe critical role played by shareholders became evident in the first years of the Company's development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NEW MARKETS\n\nThe  Group  began  to  supply  ultra-high  purity  gases  to  the Semiconductor industry in 1985. In the middle of the 90', Air Liquide extended its offering to hydrogen and steam. Meanwhile, in addition to oxygen supply to hospitals, Air Liquide became a specialist in the Healthcare sector and launched its Home Healthcare business and set up a dedicated network of specialized teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ENERGY TRANSITION AND CLIMATE OBJECTIVES\n\nOn  November  30,  2018,  Air  Liquide  announced  its  Climate Objectives,  in  particular  a  30%  reduction  in  its  carbon  intensity between 2015 and 2025, with a global approach that includes its assets, its customers, and ecosystems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MOBILIZATION OF THE GROUP AGAINST COVID-19\n\nThe  Healthcare  teams  were  highly  mobilized  to  cope  with  the increasing  demand  for  medical  oxygen  and  ensure  equipment supply such as respirators for hospitals.\n\nIn  a  context  of  global  health  and  economic  crisis,  the  Group  has once again proven its resilience and the contribution of its activities to society.",

This  was  one  of  the  reasons  why Air Liquide set its sites internationally early on, building numerous production units abroad. Development was rapid in Europe (1906), Japan (1907), Canada (1911) and the United States (1916).\n\n## 1913\n\n## LISTING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE\n\nThe  critical  role  played  by  Shareholders  became  evident  in  the first  years  of  the  Company's  development.  Listed  on  the  Paris Stock Exchange in 1913, the share celebrated its hundredth-year of listing in 2013. Air Liquide has endeavored to forge a strong and privileged relationship with its Shareholders based on exceptional stock market performance, with an average annual increase in its share price over the 100 years to 2013 of +11.9%.\n\n## 1952-1960\n\n## THE CRYOGENIC REVOLUTION\n\nStoring gas in liquid form in cryogenic tanks allows vast quantities to be transported by road or rail within a radius of approximately 200-250 km from the production site.\n\n## PIPELINE NETWORK STRATEGY\n\nBy  delivering  gas  to  several  customers  through  pipelines, Air Liquide adopted a network strategy for the first time, linking its gas  production  units  to  one  another.  The  Group  increased  its production capacity to meet soaring demand from large industries: firstly, for oxygen in the steel industry, and secondly, for nitrogen in chemicals.  This  marked  the  start-up  of  the  Large  Industries business.\n\n## 1960-1980\n\n## SPACE INDUSTRY\n\nConvinced of the industrial potential of cryogenics, Jean Delorme, Chairman  &  CEO  of  Air  Liquide,  decided  to  create  a  research center dedicated to these technologies. This center was founded in  1962  near  Grenoble  in  France.  The  first  applications  were rapidly integrated in the space industry and ever since Air Liquide has been a key partner of the space adventure.\n\n## A TRADITION OF INVENTIONS\n\nThe  Claude  Delorme  Research  Center,  located  on  the  Saclay plateau and now called the Innovation Campus Paris, was created in 1970. The research center's work is focused on enhancing gas production technologies and their applications. It is evidence of the Group's desire to better understand the industrial processes of its customers and develop new gas applications to better satisfy their requirements. Today, the Group also has Innovation Campuses in Europe, North America and Asia.\n\n## 1980-2000\n\n## A NEW MARKET: ELECTRONICS\n\nIn  Japan,  the  Group  began  in  1985  to  supply  ultra-high  purity gases to the semiconductor industry: this involves carrier gases, mainly  nitrogen,  used  to  transport  the  specialty  gases  and  keep the chip production tools inert, and specialty gases that are used directly in the manufacturing  of  semiconductors.  In  1987, Air  Liquide  inaugurated  the  Tsukuba  Research  Center  in  Japan, which is dedicated to the electronics industry.\n\n## MAJOR ACQUISITION\n\nThe  Group  acquired  Big  Three  in  the  United  States  in  1986,  a Large Industries  business  with  significant  pipeline  network  along the Gulf Coast.\n\n## EXTENDED OFFERING: HYDROGEN AND STEAM\n\nIn  addition  to  oxygen  and  nitrogen,  Air  Liquide  extended  its offering to hydrogen and steam in the 90's. To ensure the success of this new offering, the Group used its business model, which is behind the success of its air gas business, and deployed from the beginning a basin strategy based on a pipeline network, providing customers with flexibility, distribution reliability and service quality at the best price.\n\n## HEALTHCARE\n\nOriginally  an  oxygen  supplier  to  hospitals, Air  Liquide  became  a specialist in the healthcare sector. The Group launched its Home Healthcare business and set up a dedicated network of specialist teams. Medical gases were progressively classified as drugs and manufacturers  were  required  to  file  market  authorizations.  The Group  also  launched  research  programs  in  therapeutic  gases, used for resuscitation and pain relief.",

        "page_content": "## 2000\n\n## INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION\n\nThe  Group  invested  massively  in  China  in  the  early  2000s;  the country has been a major growth market for industrial gases and Air Liquide entered into numerous air gas contracts.\n\nThe  Group  acquired  part  of  Messer  Griesheim  activities  in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n## 2007-2009\n\n## ORGANIZATION BY BUSINESS LINE\n\nThe Air Liquide growth drivers for the coming decades are based on changing lifestyles: industrial growth of developing economies, increasing energy needs and environmental challenges, healthcare and high technology. To capture this growth, the Group created  a  new  organizational  structure  based  on  four  World Business  Lines.  They  combine  the  technical  and  operational expertise  which  are  specific  to  each  of  the  businesses  of  the Group  -  Large  Industries,  Industrial  Merchant,  Healthcare  and Electronics - and centralize the specific market expertise.\n\nConscious of the strategic dimension of Engineering & Construction capabilities, the Group acquired Lurgi in 2007. This company provides Air Liquide with major proprietary technologies, notably  hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units, adding to the Group's historical competencies in cryogenics.\n\n## RESILIENCE IN AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS\n\nAffected by a global economic crisis of unprecedented magnitude, the  Group  focused  its  efforts  on  the  management  of  its  cash, costs,  and  investments  (capital  expenditures).  Having  tested  the solidity  of  its  long-term  contracts,  Air  Liquide  demonstrated  the relevance of its business model. In a context of global recession, the Group showed itself to be an exception, posting a stable net profit while preserving the strength of its balance sheet.\n\n## 2013-2015\n\n## INITIATIVES IN THE INNOVATION FIELD - HYDROGEN ENERGY\n\nInnovation is central to Air Liquide's strategy. In 2013, Air Liquide launched  two  initiatives  to  promote  open  innovation:  i-Lab (innovation Lab) and ALIAD, the Group's capital venture entity to take  minority  investments  in  innovative  technology  start-ups.  In 2014,  the  Group  decided  on  new  investments  such  as  the modernization  of  the  Research  Center  near  Versailles,  on  the Saclay plateau, the creation of a center for the development and industrialization of gas cylinders for industry and healthcare, and the  launch  of  a  technical  center  of  excellence  for  cryogenic production technologies.\n\nIn addition, on a worldwide scale, Air Liquide actively contributes to the development of the hydrogen energy activity by supporting automotive manufacturers launching Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles on the market. Air Liquide contributes to the construction of hydrogen charging  stations  (United  States,  Japan,  France,  Germany, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Korea).\n\n## History of the Air Liquide Group\n\n## 2016\n\n## AIRGAS ACQUISITION BY AIR LIQUIDE\n\nOn  May  23,  2016,  Air  Liquide  completed  the  acquisition  of  the American company Airgas. This acquisition was complementary to the  Group's  businesses  in  the  United  States  and  enabled Air  Liquide  to  be  present  across  all  market  segments  both upstream  of  and  downstream  to  the  US  market;  this  integration has created significant value.\n\nIn addition to the 300 million US dollars of synergies targeted by the  Group  through  this  acquisition,  Air  Liquide  believes  that  the Airgas model, in terms of products, digitization of businesses, and business model, may be applied outside the United States.\n\nWith  this  acquisition,  Air  Liquide  strengthens  its  position  in  the United  States,  the  largest  industrial  gas  market  worldwide.  This market  also  enjoys  the  strongest  growth  among  advanced economies.\n\n## THE LAUNCH OF THE NEW COMPANY PROGRAM 2016-2020: NEOS\n\nThe Group acquired a new dimension following the acquisition of Airgas  and  thus  entered  a  new  phase  of  its  development.  On July  6,  2016,  Air  Liquide  published  its  new  mid-term  Company program, NEOS, for the 2016-2020 period.\n\nAir  Liquide's  strategy  for  profitable  growth  over  the  long-term  is that of a customer-centric  transformation.  It  is  based  on operational excellence and the quality of its investments, on open innovation and the network organization already implemented by the Group worldwide. Air Liquide's ambition is to be a leader in its industry, deliver long-term performance and contribute to sustainability.\n\n## CREATION OF THE GLOBAL MARKETS & TECHNOLOGIES BUSINESS\n\nTo  step  up  the  development  of  offerings  in  new  markets,  the Group  created  the  Global  Markets  &  Technologies  business, responsible  for  developing  new  activities  in  the  field  of  energy transition and deep tech, by leveraging technologies.\n\n## 2017\n\n## REFOCUSING ON GAS & SERVICES BUSINESSES\n\nFollowing  the  disposal  of  its Aqua  Lung  (diving)  and Air  Liquide Welding  (welding)  subsidiaries,  Air  Liquide  focused  on  its  Gas &  Services  businesses  and  the  implementation  of  its  NEOS Company  program.  After  these  disposals,  the  share  of  Gas & Services revenue in Group sales increased from 90% in 2015 to 96% in 2018.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## History of the Air Liquide Group\n\n## 2018\n\n## ENERGY TRANSITION AND CLIMATE OBJECTIVES\n\nFor  many  years  now,  Air  Liquide  has  been  committed  to sustainable  growth  aimed,  in  particular,  at  limiting  its  CO2 emissions  and  those  of  its  customers.  On  November  30,  2018, Air Liquide announced its Climate Objectives, in particular a 30% reduction  in  its  carbon  intensity  between  2015  and  2025,  with  a global  approach  that  includes  its  assets,  its  customers,  and ecosystems. These objectives are the most ambitious in the sector and are in line with the NEOS company program.\n\nIn  this  respect,  the  Global  Markets  &  Technologies  activity  is stepping up sales to energy transition-related markets, driven by the biomethane sector with the start-up of several production units in Europe and the United States, and by hydrogen energy with the commissioning  of  new  hydrogen  charging  stations  for  mobility. Moreover,  the  Hydrogen  Council,  which  was  founded  in  2017, brings  together  more  than  100  global  leaders  in  the  energy, transport and industry sectors to promote hydrogen with a view to achieving  climate  change-related  objectives,  and  has  held  a meeting in China for the first time.\n\n## 2019\n\n## FINALIZATION OF THE INTEGRATION OF AIRGAS AND STRENGTHENING OF THE GROUP'S EFFICIENCY PROGRAM\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  2019,  Air  Liquide  reached  its  target  of 300  million  US  dollars  in  synergies,  thanks  to  the  integration  of Airgas,  more  than  a  year  before  initially  planned.  With  the integration complete, Airgas joined the Group's efficiency program and  contributes  to  increasing  the  annual  target  for  efficiencies. This target was initially set at 300 million euros and was revised up,  to  more  than  400  million  euros,  as  of  2019.  Moreover,  a program aimed at promoting the sharing of the Airgas model has allowed close to 100 Group managers to immerse themselves in Airgas operations, to step up the sharing of its best practices with other Group regions.\n\n## INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF NEW HYDROGEN MARKETS\n\nAir  Liquide  announced the construction in Canada of the largest Proton  Exchange  Membrane  (PEM)  electrolyzer  in  the  world, aimed at producing hydrogen using hydro-power for industry and mobility usages.\n\nAir  Liquide  joined  forces  with  its  steel  customers  as  part  of  a pioneering  project  to  develop  low-carbon  steel  production  where hydrogen  will  be  injected  on  a  large  scale  to  partially  replace pulverized coal in the blast furnace, thus reducing emissions in the production process.\n\nOn the West Coast of the United States, Air Liquide took a stake in FirstElement  Fuel,  a  leading  hydrogen  station  operator  in California. Air Liquide will invest in the production and liquefaction of low-carbon hydrogen through the partial use of biomethane.\n\n## 2020\n\n## MOBILIZATION OF THE GROUP AGAINST COVID-19\n\nThe  Healthcare  teams  were  highly  mobilized  to  cope  with  the increasing demand for medical oxygen, supply equipment such as respirators  for  hospitals,  ensure  stabilized  patients  can  return home and guarantee  chronic  patients  are  continually  monitored. Faced with the pressing need for respirators to treat the patients most affected by covid-19, Air  Liquide  successfully  led  a  French industrial  partnership  in  order  to  produce  10,000  units  in  record time  in  response  to  a  request  by  the  French  government. Moreover, Home Healthcare teams are mobilized to treat patients at their home in order to relieve pressure on hospitals.\n\nIn a context of global health and economic crisis, the Group has once again proven its resilience. This  crisis  has  also  highlighted the contribution of the Group's activities to society as well as the commitment of its employees.\n\n## 2021\n\n## ACT FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE\n\nThe Group strengthened all of its sustainable development goals by detailing them around three axes. First, to ACT for a low-carbon society,  in  line  with  the  Paris  Agreement,  by  setting  a  target  of carbon neutrality by 2050, with two major intermediate steps: the start  of  the  reduction  of  its  CO2  emissions  in  absolute  value around  2025  and  a  33%  decrease  in  its  CO2  emissions  from Scopes 1 and 2 by 2035 compared to 2020.\n\nDuring  2021,  Air  Liquide  acted  for  climate,  by  initiating  projects and partnerships for the decarbonization of industrial and mobility activities,  and  by  announcing  its  participation  in  the  largest  fund dedicated  to  clean  hydrogen  infrastructure.  The  Group  also acquired  Sasol  air  separation  units  in  South  Africa  and  a TotalEnergies steam methane reformer in France while committing to a very significant decrease of their CO2 emissions.\n\nSecond,  CARE  for  patients  by  improving  the  quality  of  life  of patients with chronic diseases  in  mature  economies  and facilitating  access  to  medical  oxygen  in  low  and  middle  income countries. Already in place in Senegal, the initiative allows access to  medical  oxygen  to  rural  communities  and  deployment  has started in South Africa.\n\nThe  fight  against  the  covid-19  pandemic  continues  throughout 2021, with large deliveries of medical oxygen to hospitals including importations  of  additional  volumes  to  low-  or  middle-income countries. The Home Healthcare business is also involved through the management of patients with oxygen therapy.\n\nAnd third, TRUST as the base to engage with employees and to build the best-in-class governance.",

Description of activities\n\nThe  Group  classifies  its  activities  as  follows:  Gas  &  Services, Engineering & Construction, Global Markets & Technologies, and all  serve  one  unique  business,  that  of  industrial  gases. The  four business lines comprising the Gas & Services activities are closely tied  by  a  strong  industrial  mindset  where  proximity  is  key.  The diagram  on  page  21  illustrates  the  sharing  of  production  or distribution assets between the different business lines for a given geographic  region.  This  efficient  industrial  network  and  its proximity with its customers allow Air Liquide to:\n\n- \u25a0 improve reliability;\n- \u25a0 optimize energy consumption, costs and logistics flow;\n- \u25a0 anticipate customers' needs;\n- \u25a0 understand changes in the markets;\n- \u25a0 and offer innovative solutions.\n\nThe synergies enjoyed by all  of  the  Group's  businesses  are  not limited  to  the  industrial  aspect,  but  also  include  scientific  and technological  expertise,  the  innovation  approach,  as  well  as Human  Resources  and  financial  management.  The  strong integration  of  the  various  World  Business  Lines  thus  allows  the Group  to  create  synergies,  become  stronger  and  to  grow  while creating long-term value.\n\n## 2021 GROUP REVENUE BY ACTIVITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.1.  GAS & SERVICES\n\nThe Gas & Services business includes four World Business Lines to  better  support  changes  and  meet  the  needs  of  the  various markets:  Large  Industries,  Industrial  Merchant,  Healthcare,  and Electronics.\n\nGas  supply  relies  on  local  production  in  order  to  limit  transport costs.  Therefore,  Air  Liquide  gas  production  units  are  located throughout the world and can supply many types of customers and industries  with  the  relevant  volumes  and  services  required. Air  Liquide's  structure  is  made  up  of  a  base,  in  Paris,  and  four hubs: Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East and Africa. These hubs draw on the Group's expertise and presence in these geographic regions.\n\n- \u25a0 Large Industries supplies industrial gases by operating major production units. It serves customers in the metals, chemicals, refining and energy sectors where high gas volumes call for a dedicated  plant  or  the  development  of  a  pipeline  network. Large Industries also supplies the Group's other business lines with  gases  which  are  then  packaged  and  delivered  to  their respective customers.\n\n- \u25a0 Industrial Merchant supplies a wide range of different gases, application  equipment  and  associated  services.  It  serves industries and professionals that require smaller quantities than Large Industries customers. Gas can be distributed in bulk, in liquid  form,  or  in  cylinders,  in  gaseous  form,  for  smaller quantities.  Finally,  small  production  units  can  be  installed locally for customers with larger gas needs, or in remote areas.\n- \u25a0 Healthcare supplies medical gases, equipment and services to hospitals  and  also  directly  to  patients  in  their  homes.  It  also produces  and  distributes  healthcare  specialty  ingredients  for the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, vaccine and nutrition markets.\n- \u25a0 Electronics supplies  gases,  materials  (complex  molecules) used in manufacturing processes, and services mainly used for the production of semiconductors, but also for flat screens and photovoltaic panels.",

They  represent  48%  of  Gas  &  Services revenue.  Industrial  Merchant  is  impacted  by  local  industrial production momentum and consumer demand, whereas Electronics  is  linked  to  the  semiconductor  sector.  The  solutions offered by the business lines to sustainable development, of today or the future, especially in the energy transition domain, reinforce the Group strength and growth.\n\nIn Large Industries, the supply of gas is contracted for a duration of 15 years, or more for specific projects, and includes take-or-pay clauses which guarantee a minimum level of revenue.\n\nUnderlying  trends  for  the  Healthcare  business  (longer  life expectancy,  more  sedentary  lifestyles,  urbanization)  ensure growth in demand which is decorrelated from economic cycles.\n\nIndustrial  Merchant  benefits  from  the  broad  diversity  of  its markets,  customers,  and  regions  which  is  the  result  of  strategic targeting and which reinforces the resilience of the business line.\n\nThe development of the semiconductor industry with its numerous digital  applications  is  the  main  source  of  sales  growth  in Electronics, an industry presenting a strong momentum.\n\nThe  Group's  capacity  to  innovate  enables  it  to  continuously improve its current offerings by integrating new technologies and new ways of working to boost operational excellence. Air Liquide therefore draws on its internal and external innovation ecosystems to  develop differentiating solutions for its customers and patients and open up new markets. Innovation contributes to the Group's sustainable growth.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Gas  &  Services  businesses,  Global  Markets & Technologies help place Air Liquide in a pioneering position in new  markets  and  new  business  models  relating  to  energy transition and deep tech, thus accelerating the learning curve on new  social  and  environmental  challenges,  and  opening  up  key opportunities for future growth.\n\nFinally, the Engineering & Construction business line is responsible  for  the  design  and  construction  of  plants  and equipment  to  meet  the  various  needs  of  the  Group's  business lines and third-party customers. Through its Engineering &  Construction  business  line,  the  Group  cultivates,  shares  and passes on its expertise from one generation to the next, ensuring both the continuity of its know-how  and  its  continuous improvement  thanks  to  the  permanent  integration  of  the  latest technological advances and their adaptation to new markets.\n\nMoreover,  through  its  various  World  Business  Lines,  the  Group serves more than 3.8 million customers and patients in a variety of industries and across a wide range of regions, which provides high resistance  to  economic  cycles.  These  characteristics,  which  are inherent  to  the  industrial  and  healthcare  gas  business,  reinforce the strength of the business model.",

Business overview\n\nThe  Large  Industries  business  line  supplies  gas  and  energy solutions  to  customers  in  the  metals,  chemicals,  refining  and energy  industries,  which  are  essential  for  their  own  core businesses, to improve process efficiency and to make their plants more environmentally friendly. The Large Industries business line provides oxygen, nitrogen, argon, hydrogen and carbon monoxide through  its  plants  and  its  pipeline  network.  The  Group  also operates cogeneration plants to supply customers with steam and electricity.\n\nThe world leader in this sector, Air Liquide benefits from dedicated in-house  development  and  engineering  teams,  differentiating proprietary  technologies  and  rigorous  processes  for  selecting investments  and  carrying  out  projects.  The  largest  Large Industries  customers  are  looked  after  by  key  account  managers who have in-depth knowledge of customers' businesses, as well as of their projects, industrial processes and global structure. This allows  Large  Industries  to  maintain  close  contact  with  its customers,  thus  improving  the  Group's  responsiveness  and competitiveness in terms of meeting their needs.\n\n## 2021 LARGE INDUSTRIES REVENUE BY PRODUCT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  31% of Gas & Services revenue.\n\n## b. Business model\n\nThe supply of gas is generally contracted for 15 years. For certain projects,  this  can  be  extended  to  20  years  and  beyond.  The signing  of  new  contracts  for  new  industrial  customers'  sites  is  a strong  predictor  of  future  growth.  Within  these  contracts,  the Group guarantees long-term service continuity and a high level of reliability  with  respect  to  the  gas  supply  via  a  high-performing industrial  solution.  In  return,  long-term  gas  supply  contracts include guaranteed  minimum  volumes  through  take-or-pay clauses,  as  well  as  the  indexation  to  variable  costs  (mainly  for electricity and natural gas) and to inflation.\n\nThe  use  of  industrial  gases  is  critical  for  the  various  industrial processes of Large Industries' customers. As any discontinuity in supply translates into an interruption of the customer's production operations,  supply  reliability  and  safety  are  crucial.  However, although vital, gas supply generally represents a very small part of total production cost for the customer.\n\nThe  Large  Industries  are  at  the  heart  of  the  energy  transition, which creates major growth opportunities with the supply of lowcarbon gases as well as new modes of process and solutions for the customers' CO2 emissions reduction.\n\n## c. Large Industries industrial processes\n\nThe raw materials necessary for the production of industrial gases vary  according  to  the  type  of  gas  and  the  location  of  the production  unit.  The  production  of  oxygen  and  nitrogen  requires air and a large quantity of electricity. Cogeneration units consume natural gas and water. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units mainly consume natural gas and little electricity. In 2021, the Group  also  inaugurated  the  world's  largest  electrolysis  facility  in Canada that uses water and renewable hydroelectricity to produce low-carbon  hydrogen.  The  energy  and  capital  intensity  of  these industrial processes is generally high.\n\n## Air gases production (ASU: Air Separation Unit)\n\nAn ASU compresses, liquefies and distills air in order to separate it into  its  different  components:  78%  nitrogen,  21%  oxygen, 1%  argon  and  noble  gases  (neon,  krypton  and  xenon).  Only certain large ASUs  can  produce  noble  gases.  Electricity consumption  is  significant.  A  simplified  diagram  of  an  ASU operation is presented on page 24.\n\n## Hydrogen and carbon monoxide production through steam reforming (SMR: Steam Methane Reformer)\n\nBy steam reforming natural gas, an SMR produces hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The most significant raw material is natural gas; electricity and water consumption is modest. A simplified diagram of a hydrogen unit's operation is presented on page 23. Air Liquide has  developed  a  portfolio  of  CO2  capture  solutions  adapted  to SMR, allowing to largely reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Hydrogen production through electrolysis\n\nHydrogen  production  through  electrolysis  is  based  on  the dissociation of water molecules (H2O) using electricity, to extract hydrogen and oxygen molecules. This process produces hydrogen without using or emitting carbon-based molecules. It can be used to produce low-carbon hydrogen for industry and mobility, as well as for energy storage. A simplified diagram of hydrogen production through electrolysis is presented on page 23.\n\n## Cogeneration\n\nCogeneration consists of simultaneously and efficiently producing electricity  and  steam  generally  by  consuming  natural  gas  and water. The electricity is used by an Air Liquide plant or sold on the local  network.  The  steam  is  required  for  certain  industrial processes.",

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS\n\nThe  chemicals  industry uses  mainly  oxygen,  hydrogen  and carbon  monoxide  in  its  manufacturing  processes,  as  well  as nitrogen to inert its installations.\n\nThe refining industry requires hydrogen to desulfurize fuels and crack heavy hydrocarbons. The demand for hydrogen is growing steadily  due  to  more  stringent  legislation  aimed  at  reducing emissions and the use of increasingly heavier hydrocarbons in fuel production.\n\nIn  the  metals  industry, Air  Liquide  supplies  large  volumes  of oxygen to steel producers notably, the use of which improves their energy performance and reduces significantly their CO2 emissions.  The  majority  of  new  projects  are  currently  located  in developing  economies.  As  part  of  Air  Liquide's  aim  to  offer solutions  to  its  customers  that  will  help  them  reduce  their emissions, the Group is also taking part in a pilot project, with one of its steelmaking customers, which consists of injecting hydrogen at large scale to partially replace pulverized coal in blast furnaces, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the steel production process.\n\nNumerous  industries  linked  to  energy  or  chemicals  use  large quantities  of  oxygen  to  transform  coal,  natural  gas  or  liquid hydrocarbons into syngas for the production of chemical products, synfuel or electricity.\n\nTo meet customer requirements, the supply of large quantities of gas  is  critical.  Air  Liquide  supplies  its  customers  directly  by pipelines  from  a  dedicated  plant  or  different  plants  linked  by  a network. Air  Liquide  has  built  its  pipeline  networks  progressively over  the  last  40  years.  With  a  total  length  of  more  than 9,700  kilometers  (6,000  miles),  these  networks  stretch,  for example,  across  Northern  Europe,  from  Rotterdam  through  to Dunkirk, and along the Gulf Coast in the United States from Lake Charles (Louisiana) to Corpus Christi (Texas) as well as along the Mississippi river in Louisiana. Many other mid-size local networks have  also  been  built  in  other  significant  and  fast-developing industrial basins in Germany, Italy, Singapore and, more recently, China.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\nThe Large  Industries business  line  depends  on  long-term contracts (15 to 20 years) which include take-or-pay clauses, offer considerable visibility of future revenue and protection in the event of a significant fall in customer volume consumption (below the minimum take-or-pay level). Sales prices in Large Industries contracts are indexed, in particular, to energy and to inflation costs. The long investment cycle and high capital intensity  require  a  solid  balance  sheet.  The  signing  of  new contracts is a strong predictor of future growth.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  developing  a  pipeline  network  strategy  in  the industrial  basins  in  order  to  provide  customers  with  greater supply  reliability  while  optimizing  operating  costs.  This strategy allows to mutualize production assets and generate savings, notably on energy, on the overall Air Liquide network as well as for its customers.\n\nBy  developing  its  capacity  to  deliver  low-carbon  industrial gases to its clients and other Group's businesses, by allowing industrial processes decarbonization, and by offering carbon capture  as  a  service,  the  Large  Industries  is  a  key  for  the energy transition and the Group's decarbonization strategy.",

        "page_content": "## Industrial Merchant\n\n## 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW, BUSINESS MODEL AND SUPPLY MODES\n\n## a. Business overview\n\nThe  Industrial  Merchant  business  line  is,  by  its  nature,  a  highly local business, which provides more than two millions customers with  industrial  gases,  equipment,  hardgoods  and  associated services.\n\nIndustrial  Merchant  provides  gas  using  the  supply  mode  best adapted to customers' needs: either via a small on-site production unit  for  customers  with  major  volume  requirements,  or  in  liquid form  distributed  by  trucks  for  medium-scale  quantities,  or  in cylinders  for  smaller  volumes  and  use  on  construction  sites. Around  95%  of  Industrial  Merchant's  customer  base  is  small customers  who  favor  simplicity,  flexibility  and  quality  of  service: they mainly order cylinder gas and hardgoods.\n\nThe Industrial  Merchant serves a wide variety of markets and is constantly inventing new applications for its molecules which not only  contribute  to  improve  customer  operational  efficiencies  but also address energy transition objectives as well as the challenges of  new  markets.  The  Industrial  Merchant  business  manages  a significant amount of data from the large number of assets used in operations  along  with  the  diversity  of  markets  and  customers. Digital transformation and  data  analysis  therefore  play  a predominant  role  in  improving  operational  efficiency,  price management,  and  the  quality  of  the  services  provided  to  the customers.\n\n## 2021 INDUSTRIAL MERCHANT REVENUE BY END-MARKET\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  43% of Gas & Services revenue.\n\n## b. Business model\n\nA large share of Industrial Merchant sales is covered by contracts with terms of up to five years for cylinders and liquid gas supply and  up  to  15  years  for  small  on-site  gas  generators.  These contracts  generally  include  gas  supply,  the  reliable  and  safe delivery of products and the provision by the Group of equipment at  customers'  sites,  the  provision  of  a  service,  as  well  as  the indexation of the sales price to different variables such as inflation and  energy  prices.  The  provision  of  cylinders  or  tanks  at customers' sites is covered by a fixed monthly fee. The wide range of markets, customers and regions in which the Group is present reinforces the resilience of this business line.\n\n## Business model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Industrial  Merchant  (IM)  business  line  is  integrated  in  the industrial  basins  and  firmly grounded  in  local  economic  life. This  local  base  is  strengthened  by  economic  constraints  which limit the radius of gas distribution to some 250 kilometers around a production site. One of the strengths of Industrial Merchant is to be  able  to  identify  high  potential  areas  and  establish  a  site  by developing synergies with Large Industries' network of plants or by investing in dedicated units. While permeating the local economy, the Industrial Merchant business line has expanded its operations internationally  in  more  than  62  countries,  thus  strengthening  the business  line's  resilience.  This  regional  diversity  is  based  on  a strategy  of  targeted  investments  and  the  regular  optimization  of portfolios.\n\nA permanent focus on geographic density within the industrial basins  is  a  key  success  factor  thanks  to  the  synergies  that  this generates,  in  particular  in  terms  of  logistics.  In  addition  to  the business  development  of  a  basin,  the  acquisition  of  local distributors and their portfolio of customers also helps improve this density, in particular in markets that are still fairly fragmented such as in the United States and China.\n\n## c. Supply methods\n\nOn  page  27,  the  diagram  shows  the different  supply  modes used in  Industrial  Merchant. Strong operational  discipline is applied  across  the  value  chain  (supply,  packaging,  distribution) and is an essential part of Air Liquide's integrated model. Coupled with  new  digital  tools  including  the  IBO  ('Integrated  Bulk Operations'),  this  allows  the  Group  to  optimize  the  use  of  its resources in real time (plants, trucks, energy, etc.) to improve the competitiveness  of  its  products  and  services  for  customers  and reduce  its  CO2  emissions.  Air  Liquide's  quest  for  continuous improvement helps ensure the safety of its employees, customers and  service  providers  and  optimize  their  costs,  while  offering  a seamless customer experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS\n\n## a. A customer-centric culture\n\nCustomers  and  markets  served  by  Industrial  Merchant are presented  in  the  drawing  on  page  27.  Industrial  Merchant customers vary greatly in terms of size, business and needs, but their  common  ground  is  their  desire  for  products  and  services which facilitate daily activities.\n\nThe Group's ambition to provide a seamless customer experience requires listening to customers' needs, providing a diversified and customized offering and an excellent quality of service. To further customer engagement, Air Liquide is working on the rationalization and  simplification  of  its  processes  to  continuously  improve  the level of its service, focusing on the reliability of its equipment and deliveries and thus the overall efficiency of its supply chain.\n\nOptionality in terms of both product and service offering as well as transactional channel is also a differentiating characteristic of the Industrial  Merchant  business  line.  The  integration  of  Airgas  has boosted  this  customer-centric  culture  within  the  Group,  both  in terms  of  the  excellence  of  operational  service  and  the  multichannel sales approach. Airgas' business model and know-how in telesales,  e-commerce and its ability to integrate all channels, is currently being transferred to certain Group subsidiaries.\n\n## A MULTI-CHANNEL SALES APPROACH\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DATA AND DIGITAL WORKING FOR THE CUSTOMER AND IMPROVING GROUP PERFORMANCE\n\nThe Industrial Merchant Business Line manages a significant amount of data from the large number of assets used in operations and the diversity of markets and customers. Digital transformation and data analysis therefore play a predominant role in improving operational efficiency,  the  quality  of  the  services  provided  to  the  customers  and  new  offerings. Thanks  to  this  data  analysis,  the Industrial Merchant teams are able to drive the performance of operations in real time and optimize price management in a fair and dynamical  way  depending  on  market  and  costs.  The  digitalization  of  assets  on  customer  sites  also  enables  the  uploading  of utilization data, which is then analyzed to create new services, offerings or business models.\n\n## b. A strategic positioning on markets with optimized product portfolios\n\nThanks to their proximity to customers and the Group's presence in a large number of markets, the Industrial Merchant teams foster a large and in-depth knowledge of the latter and of their industrial processes. Moreover, Air Liquide collects a large amount of data from these markets and the economy in general. This allows the Group  to  identify  major  trends,  assess  growth  prospects  and anticipate  future  opportunities.  By  closely  analyzing  this  market data and their value chains, the Group has developed a selective\n\napproach  and  dynamic  market  management to  focus  its resources on areas of higher potential growth. The diversity of the markets,  customers  and  geographical  regions  resulting  from strategic targeting strengthens the resilience of the business line.\n\nThe  level  of  profitability  of  the  Industrial  Merchant  business  line varies according to product and supply mode. By optimizing this product mix , the business increases its profitability, captures new volumes and diversifies its customer base.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.  ENGINEERING & CONSTRUCTION\n\nTo  provide  customers  with  the  gases  required  for  their  industrial production,  Air  Liquide  engineers  have  developed  innovative proprietary  technologies. The  Group  designs  and  constructs  gas production  units,  from  the  feasibility  study  stage  through  to  the delivery of the complete installation, for its own use or for sale to customers  who  prefer  to  insource  their  gas  requirements. Air  Liquide  complies  with  the  increasingly  strict  safety,  reliability and  competitiveness  requirements  of  Air  Separation  Units  and hydrogen units.\n\nSince the acquisition of Lurgi in 2007, the Group has expanded its range  of  technological  expertise.  Engineering  &  Construction development for industrial gas, energy conversion, gas purification and CO2 capture technologies enable customers to optimize the use  of  natural  resources.  Engineering  &  Construction  teams  are helping  customers  to  reduce  their  greenhouse  gas  emissions, focusing on technologies and skills to support energy transition.\n\nIn  particular,  Engineering  &  Construction  teams  are  already offering the customers, particularly in hard to abate sectors, a full range of carbon capture proprietary technologies that enable them to decarbonize their operations.\n\nTo  cover  all  of  the  primary  industrial  markets  and  manage  its production  costs,  the  Engineering  &  Construction  business  has extensive  geographical  coverage  with  engineering  centers  and manufacturing  workshops  located  mainly  in  North  America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\n## Business model\n\nThe Group favors the development of its gas sales business over equipment sales. Nonetheless, Engineering & Construction has a strategic value for the Group, both internally and externally.\n\nInternally,  the  Group  benefits  from  the  relevant  engineering resources during the investment phase of the projects of its Gas & Services businesses. It provides a high level of expertise, crucial to  the  design  of  efficient  units  which  specifically  respond  to  the needs  of  the  Group's  Gas  &  Services  customers.  It  provides support  for  the  Group  during  site  takeovers,  by  ensuring  the appropriate assessment of the quality of assets purchased.\n\nThe Engineering & Construction business also serves third-party customers. Air Liquide designs and builds customized units which customers  will  own  and  operate.  Also,  this  third-party  customer business allows the Group to constantly assess the competitiveness of its own technologies and commercial offering. In  particular,  Air  Liquide  is  able  to  forge  close  relations  with customers who produce their own gas and better understand their industrial  processes  and  investment  projects.  In  certain  cases, negotiations  initially  steered  toward  the  sale  of  equipment  were finalized  by  the  signing  of  a  long-term  industrial  gas  supply contract. As part of this third-party customer business, the strategy consists of favoring research and equipment supply contracts and of  not  tolerating  construction  risks.  Accordingly,  Engineering &  Construction's  contribution  to  consolidated  revenue  (sales  to third-party customers) can vary significantly from year to year.\n\nIn 2021, published consolidated third-party sales for Engineering & Construction totaled 387 million euros.\n\n## KEY POINTS\n\nThe Engineering  &  Construction business  provides  the  Group  with  a  genuine  competitive  edge,  enabling  it  to  offer  turnkey solutions  to  its  customers  and  to  engage  for  its  own  purposes  in  a  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  industrial  processes, reduction in the cost of its industrial assets and of the environmental footprint.\n\nConsolidated Engineering & Construction sales only reflect sales to third parties and do not include internal sales for the needs of the Group or the Gas & Services businesses. In order to cover all the major industrial markets and control its production costs, it has an  extensive  geographical  presence  with  engineering  centers  and  manufacturing  workshops  established  in  particular  in  North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.\n\n## 2.3.

        "page_content": "1\n\n## Business model\n\n## 4. Competition\n\nAt  a  global  level,  the  industrial  gases  industry  comprises  three main  players:  Air  Liquide  and  Linde  Plc  (Ireland),  co-market leaders  with  sales  in  excess  of  20  billion  euros  each,  and  Air Products  (United  States)  with  revenue  which  is  more  than  two times  lower.  Linde  Plc  is  the  new  entity  following  the  merger  of equals  between  two  global  players,  Linde  AG  (Germany)  and Praxair  (United  States),  which  was  completed  in  October  2018. There are also a number of global and regional players, such as Taiyo  Nippon  Sanso  (Japan),  Messer  (Germany),  AirPower  former Yingde and Baosteel Gases (China), Air Water (Japan) and Hangzhou  Oxygen  Plant  Group  \"Hangyang\"  (China).  Finally, numerous smaller-sized players are also present in local markets.\n\nIn  Large  Industries,  the  customer  can  choose  between  selfproduction  and  over-the-fence  gas  supply.  Self-production  is currently  estimated  to  account  for  90%  of  hydrogen  production and 60% of oxygen production globally, although with significant geographical disparities. Companies self-producing gas represent an  important  market  share  for  the  Group  to  address.  In  this respect, the potential to convert self-production into over-the-fence supply  represents  a  major  growth  opportunity  for  the  Large Industries  business.  The  level  of  self-production  varies  strongly depending  upon  the  geographic  region,  type  of  industry  or  local culture.  In  advanced  economies,  the  supply  of  oxygen  is  largely over-the-fence, while the supply of hydrogen for refining remains primarily in-house. In developing economies, while relatively new, over-the-fence supply is accelerating significantly. Air Liquide and Linde,  the  world  leaders  in  Large  Industries,  are  in  competition with the other major global players and local players.\n\nIndustrial  Merchant  is  a  local  business:  transport  costs  limit  the operating area to within 200 to 250 km of a production unit, except for  high  value-added  gases  such  as  argon  and  helium.  This market, which is highly diversified due to the size and activity of its customers, thus includes numerous small and medium-sized local competitors,  either  by  producing  and  distributing  gas,  or  solely distributing gas.\n\nIn Healthcare, most gas industry players also supply hospitals with medical  oxygen,  but  few  are  present  in  the  treatment  of  chronic diseases at home. In Home Healthcare, Air Liquide is number one in Europe, whereas Linde Plc has a larger presence in the United States. This market remains fragmented in almost all regions with a multitude of small companies and associations. This fragmentation provides bolt-on acquisition opportunities.\n\nIn  Electronics,  a  business  in  which Air  Liquide  is  the  leader,  five companies play a major role: Air Liquide, Linde Plc, Merck KGaA (Germany),  Air  Products  and  Taiyo  Nippon  Sanso.  In  the Advanced  Materials  market,  Air  Liquide  is  a  leader  and  is considered  as  one  of  the  'first  movers'  focusing  on  growing  its incumbent position and developing innovative new molecules. The other  'first  movers'  in  this  specific  Electronics  market  are  Merck and Entegris.\n\nIn  Engineering  &  Construction,  Air  Liquide  also  competes  with industrial  gas  players.  In  'cold'  technologies  used  for  air  gas separation, the main competitors are Linde Plc, Hangzhou Oxygen Plant  \"Hangyang\"  (China),  AirPower  and  Air  Products.  Chinese competitors  are  gaining  ground  due  to  strong  demand  in  their country. In 'hot' technologies used for producing hydrogen and the chemical  conversion  of  syngas,  the  largest  competitors  are Technip  Energies  (France),  Tecnimont  (Italy),  Haldor  Topsoe (Denmark) and Linde Plc.\n\nGlobal  Markets  &  Technologies  is  growing  worldwide,  in  growth markets such as those relating to the energy transition and deep tech.  The  competitive  landscape  varies  greatly  from  market  to market,  with  companies  of  various  sizes:  from  multinationals  to start-ups.\n\nAir Liquide is well positioned to capture new growth opportunities relating  to  the  energy  transition,  notably  low  carbon  hydrogen, thanks  to  its  strategic  positioning,  operational  experience  and expertise  in  key  technologies  such  as  electrolysis,  CO2  capture and hydrogen liquefaction.",

Air  Liquide  strives  to  be  a leader  in  its  industry  and  of  healthcare,  deliver  long-term performance and contribute to a more sustainable world.\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE'S PERFORMANCE OVER 30 YEARS\n\n- \u25a0 Revenue: +5.4% on average per year.\n- \u25a0 Cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital: +5.9% on average per year.\n- \u25a0 Earnings per share (a) : +6.7% on average per year.\n- \u25a0 Dividend per share (a) (b) : +8.3% on average per year.\n- \u25a0 Safety - Reduction in the accident frequency rate: -4.6% on average per year.\n- \u25a0 Number of employees: +3.1% on average per year.\n- (a) Adjusted for the two-for-one share split in 2007, for free share attributions and for a factor of 0.974 reflecting the value of the preferential subscription rights of the capital increase completed in October 2016.\n- (b) Subject to the approval of the General Meeting on May 4, 2022.\n\n## CONTRIBUTE TO SUSTAINABILITY\n\nOn March 23, 2021, Air Liquide organized a 'Sustainability Day' during which it was the first major industrial gas player to commit to  reach  carbon  neutrality  by  2050.  The  Group  presented  to financial  markets  its  strategy  and  its  environmental,  social  and societal medium and long term goals, detailed in page 37.\n\nFinancial performance and sustainable development are inseparable  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's  growth  strategy.  This commitment  is  key  for  both  motivating  the  Group's  teams  and nurturing  the  long-term  trust  of  stakeholders  as  well  as  for  the Company's long-term performance and sustainability.\n\n## BEING A LEADER IN ITS INDUSTRY AND IN HEALTHCARE\n\nThe Group aims to outperform  its  market  growth  by  excelling  in customer experience. To do so, safety and reliability of its products are  a  priority.  Being  a  leader  also  means  adopting  a  pioneering role and constantly innovating, in particular in the three main fields of  energy  transition  and  the  climate,  changes  in  healthcare,  and digital.  This  innovation  contributes  to  operational  excellence  and drives  the  development  of  new  technologies,  new  expertise  and helps open new markets, in particular that of hydrogen energy.\n\n## DELIVER LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE\n\nFor  more  than  30  years,  Air  Liquide  has  posted  strong performances which has driven its long-term growth outlook. This performance is due to the nature of the industrial gases market, which enjoys steady growth, our investments, and the strength of Air  Liquide's  business  model.  It  is  also  based  on  cornerstones including operational excellence, the capacity to innovate, and the permanent optimization of its business portfolio.\n\nThe Group's businesses are rolled out in a way that contributes to major environmental and societal challenges, providing industrial, transportation  and  healthcare  solutions.  The  solutions  to  these challenges (especially these of climate and air quality) are growth drivers for Air Liquide. The risks associated with these areas are also taken into account in the Group's risk prevention program as well as to meet the various regulations in the Vigilance Plan and the Non-Financial Performance Declaration.\n\nThe Group is a responsible industry player that combines financial and extra-financial performance. Air Liquide contributes through its business and its commitments to achieve some of the Sustainable Development  Goals  (SDGs)  introduced  by  the  UN.  These  are detailed in the Extra-financial Performance Declaration (page 355).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group is deeply convinced that hydrogen will play a major role in the  energy  transition.  Hydrogen  offers  a  tremendous  growth potential as a competitive low-carbon solution for many applications  in  the  industry  and  mobility  sectors.  The  Group intends to be a key enabler of the hydrogen society thanks to its assets,  technology,  expertise  and  strategic  positioning  built  up over  about  fifty  years.  This  is  why  the  Group  announced  an acceleration on the development of hydrogen with the objective to invest 8 billion euros by 2035 in order to at least triple its hydrogen revenues  from  2  billion  to  more  than  6  billion  euros  during  the same period.\n\nIn  these  new  hydrogen  markets,  the  Group  masters  the  whole value chain for industry and mobility which includes the supply of low-carbon energies and renewables, the production of hydrogen, packaging by compression and liquefaction, delivery by truck and pipelines along with storage and distribution to the end customers.\n\nTo this end, the Group is investing in new technologies to produce and  distribute  low-carbon  hydrogen  at  large  scale  competitively, reliably  and  safely,  such  as  electrolysis,  capture  of  CO2  and hydrogen liquefaction.\n\nSince  2014,  Air  Liquide's  cumulative  investments  for  the development of these new markets almost reached 700 million euros with more than 60 assets deployed including a large-scale 20 MW electrolysis unit in Canada, a CO2 capture unit based  on  Cryocap TM technology  in  France,  a  30-ton  per  day liquefier  for  mobility  in  the  US,  as  well  as  hydrogen  refueling stations.\n\n## 2. Company program and mid-term objectives\n\nThe  Company  program  provided  a  framework  to  build  a  Group which  is  sustainably  more  efficient,  more  connected  to  its stakeholders and more innovative. This program had two series of objectives: financial as well as societal and environmental.\n\nDue to the public health crisis and the unprecedented economic environment  in  2020  which  has  had  a  major  impact  on  sales growth  as  well  as  on  costs  and  investment  management,  the Group believes that including 2020 results in the assessment of its medium-term performance is not relevant.\n\nAs a result, the achievement of the financial objectives set out in the NEOS program initially planned to cover the 2016-2020 period was  terminated  early  at  the  end  of  2019,  except  for  the  ROCE target which had been set for a longer period of time and has been postponed  to  2023/2024  because  of  the  pandemic  and  the acceleration  of  the  opportunities  related  to  the  energy  transition. Over 2016-2019, all of the objectives were achieved.\n\nA  new  five-year  Company  program  will  be  announced  on March 22, 2022 during the Capital Markets Day and will cover the 2021-2025 period.\n\n## 2.1.   ACHIEVEMENT OF FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES\n\nAir Liquide achieved its financial objectives set out in the NEOS program at the end of 2019, with the exception of ROCE which has been set for a longer period of time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Including Airgas scope effect in 2017 corresponding to a +2% CAGR.\n- (b) Over the 2017-2020 period.\n\nThe compound average annual growth rate (CAGR) of revenue over the 2016-2019 period was +6.5% and +7.8% excluding the currency impact, of which +2% was related to the Airgas acquisition. This was in line with the target of +6% to +8% between 2016 and 2020 including the Airgas impact.\n\n* CAGR: Compound Annual Growth Rate",

        "page_content": "The initial target of 300 million US dollars in cumulated synergies relating  to  the  Airgas  acquisition  was  reached  during  the  first quarter of 2019, one year before the initial date. Furthermore, in 2019,  the  Group  raised  its  initial  target  of  300  million  euros  in efficiencies  to  400  million  euros.  More  than  1.1  billion  euros  in cumulated  efficiencies  were  therefore  achieved  over  2017-2019, largely exceeding the initial target.\n\nAir Liquide maintained its 'A' rating for the entire period. The net debt-to-equity ratio, which was initially above 150% following the Airgas acquisition, stood at 64.0% at the end of 2019. This sharp reduction in debt was recognized by the Standard & Poors rating agency which then published a positive outlook on the Group. This agency has also upgraded the Group's credit notation to 'A/A-1' in 2021.\n\n## Strategy and objectives\n\nMoreover,  the  Group  also  maintained  its  level  of  investments between  10%  and  12%  of  sales  during  the  period,  in  line  with guidance. The Group had set a ROCE target of more than 10% for 2021-2022, but the covid-19 pandemic had an impact on net profit growth. Furthermore, in preparation for future growth, Air Liquide has decided to step up its investments despite the public health crisis,  in  particular  those  related  to  the  energy  transition.  The Group therefore maintains its ROCE target of more than 10% and has rescheduled its achievement to 2023-2024.\n\nA  new  five-year  company  program  will  be  announced  on March 22, 2022 and will cover the 2021-2025 period.\n\n## 2.2.   SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES\n\nAs  a  responsible  company,  Air  Liquide  has  long  endeavored  to protect  the  environment.  In  2018,  the  Group  took  a  step  further with a commitment to reduce carbon intensity of its activities. The Group has reinforced its commitment for sustainable development with  ambitious  goals  on  March  23,  2021.  This  ambition  is structured around 3 axes:\n\n- \u25a0 Abatement of CO2 emissions for a low-carbon society;\n- \u25a0 Care for patients;\n- \u25a0 Trust  as  the  base  to  engage  with  employees,  and  to  build  a best-in-class governance.\n\nThese axes are detailed hereafter.\n\n## 2.2.1.  Abatement\n\nIn  full  support  of  the  2015  Paris  agreement,  the  Group  has targeted carbon  neutrality by  2050  with  key  intermediary milestones in 2025 and 2035: starting to reduce its absolute CO2 emissions  around  2025,  then  reaching  a  -33%  decrease  of  its Scope  1  and  Scope  2  emissions  by  2035  compared  to  2020. Within this context, the Group also maintains its existing objective to reduce by -30% its carbon intensity by 2025 compared to 2015.\n\n## CLIMATE OBJECTIVES\n\n- \u25a0 Carbon neutrality by 2050;\n- \u25a0 Decrease CO2 emissions by -33% (a) in absolute value by 2035;\n- \u25a0 Reduce carbon intensity  by  -30% (b) by  2025,  based  on 2015 emission levels.\n- (a) In  tonnes  of  CO2-equivalent  for  Scopes  1  and  2,  in  a  \"market-based\" methodology (see definition of Scopes in paragraph 2.1.1 of Extra-financial Performance  Declaration,  page  329,  and  methodology  for  calculation  of scopes in paragraph 2.3.4 of the Annual Reporting section of chapter 5, pages  386  and  387),  restated  to  include,  from  2020  onwards,  the emissions for the entire year of assets acquired after 2020.\n- (b) In kg CO2-equivalent/euro of Operating income  recurring before depreciation  and  amortization  and  excluding  IFRS  16  at  2015  exchange rates for Scopes 1 and 2 of greenhouse gas emissions in a \"market-based\" methodology (see definition of Scopes in paragraph 2.1.1 of Extra-financial Performance  Declaration,  page  329,  and  methodology  for  calculation  of scopes in paragraph 2.3.4 of the Annual Reporting section of chapter 5, pages  386  and  387  as  well  as  reconciliation  in  paragraph  Performance indicators of chapter 1, page 58).\n\n## 2.2.2.  Care\n\nIn mature economies, the Group wants to go one step further, and reinforce its societal contribution by improving the quality of life of patients with chronic conditions such as respiratory diseases and diabetes.\n\nThis goal will translate into promoting customized care pathways for patients, leveraging digital tools and the importance of human relations in the follow-up of the medical treatment.\n\nThe  Group  will  further  intensify  its  societal  contribution  by facilitating  access  to  medical  oxygen  in  low  and  middle  income countries,  by  equipping  primary  care  facilities  with  oxygen,  and bringing its expertise in partnerships to support local communities, expanding  partnerships  with  stakeholders  (NGO,  international agencies...).\n\n## 2.2.3.  Trust\n\nTrust is the base to engage with employees, and to build a best-inclass governance.\n\nWith safety as a prerequisite for action, the Group will engage with its  employees  to  provide  a  common  basis  of  care  coverage  for 100% of its employees by 2025.\n\nAir Liquide actively promotes inclusion and diversity with a target to  reach  35%  of  women  among  Managers  &  Professionals  by 2025  and  will  continue  to  create  a  safe,  inclusive  and  engaging workplace.\n\nRegarding corporate governance, the Group, with a diverse and independent  Board  of  Directors,  will  continue  to  implement  best practices  in  terms  of  ethics,  responsible  dialogue  and  close relations with all shareholders.\n\n## SOCIAL AND SOCIETAL OBJECTIVES\n\n- \u25a0 35% of women among the Managers & Professionals by 2025;\n- \u25a0 100% of employees with a common basis care coverage by 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

ORGANIZATION\n\nVarious  internal  structures  contribute  to  the  definition  and implementation  of  the  Group's  strategy.  Their  roles  are presented in Chapter 2 'Risk factors and control environment', page 75.\n\nSIR  meetings  (Strategic  Investment  Review)  and  SR  meetings (Strategic Review) are chaired by the Chairman and CEO or by the Senior Vice President in charge of the Strategy depending of subjects  in  order  to  periodically  review  the  Group's  strategy, major investments and policies. The Executive Committee meets on a regular basis to review the strategy and its implementation.\n\nMoreover, monthly meetings of the Group Performance Steering Committee  are  held  to  establish  investment  budgets  and  the action  plans  to  undertake  or  amend  in  order  to  achieve  the annual or multi-annual objectives.\n\nFinally,  investments  are  validated  through  the  Resources  and Investment  Committees  (RIC),  the  operation  of  which  is described on page 42 of this Chapter.\n\nTaking  environmental  and  societal  challenges  into  account  are also  an  integral  part  of  the  Group's  strategy.  The  Sustainable Development  Department,  which  reports  to  an  Executive  Vice President, member of the Executive Committee, thus contributes to  the  development  of  the  strategy  and  defines  the  specific measures  to  be  included  in  the  Company  program.  Moreover, this  Executive  Vice  President  takes  part  with  a  sustainable development focus in the SIR and some RIC.\n\n## 3.2.   INVESTMENT PROCESS\n\nThe Group's steady long-term growth is largely due to its ability to invest  in  new  projects  each  year.  Investment  projects  in  the industrial  gas  business  are  spread  throughout  the  world,  highly capital intensive  and  supported  by  long-term  contracts,  in particular for Large Industries and Electronics. Air Liquide has thus tailored  its  financing  to  the  nature  of  its  projects,  based  on  the diversification  of  financing  sources,  the  prudent  management  of the  balance  sheet  and  innovative  financing  methods.  This financing  policy  is  fundamental  for  the  Group's  continued development.\n\nThe Group's investments reflect its growth strategy. They can be classified into two categories:\n\n- \u25a0 industrial  investments,  which  bolster  organic  growth  and guarantee the efficiency, replacement, maintenance and safety of installations;\n- \u25a0 financial  investments,  which  strengthen  existing  positions,  or accelerate penetration into a new region or business segment through the bolt-on acquisition of companies or assets already in operation, as well as new technologies.\n\nThe  nature  of  industrial  investments  differs  from  one  World Business  Line  to  the  next:  from  gas  production  units  for  Large Industries  and  Electronics,  to  filling  centers,  logistics  equipment, storage  facilities,  medical  devices  and  management  systems  for Industrial  Merchant,  Electronics  and  Healthcare.  The  nature  of investments is also highly varied within Global Markets & Technologies. Capital intensity varies greatly from one business to another.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CLIMATE AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS\n\nFor all its projects, for all geographies, even those without a current price for CO2, Air Liquide includes a carbon price in its  investment  decision  process.  A  sensitivity  study  to  this aspect is performed with various values including a reference price of 50 euros per tonne, the local current price and a high value of at least 100 euros per tonne, chosen in function of the geography and context. The study allows to assess the economic cost of greenhouse gas emissions and consequences on the project, even in the case of a strong carbon price increase on the long term. The analysis ensures the robustness and sustainability of the customer project, the CO2  cost  being  contractually  invoiced  to  the  client.  This analysis also makes it possible to validate the relevance and viability of the investment solution planned by Air Liquide and to  propose  low-carbon  technological  solutions,  whenever possible. Moreover,, the projects are evaluated and selected considering  their  contribution  to  the  Group  CO2  emissions evolution.\n\n## 3.2.1.  Capital intensity\n\nCapital  intensity  is  the  ratio  of  capital  required  to  generate  one euro  of  supplementary  revenue,  when  projects  or  businesses reach maturity. This  capital  is  either  invested  in  industrial  assets (production  units,  storage  facilities,  logistics  equipment,  etc.),  or used  as  working  capital  to  finance  the  development  of  the activities.\n\nCapital intensity varies significantly from one business to another:\n\n- \u25a0 Large Industries:\n- -air  gases production has a capital intensity of around 3. It varies with the trend in electricity prices,\n- -hydrogen  and  cogeneration  have  a  capital  intensity  of between 1.5 and 2, due to the high proportion of natural gas in  the  cost  of  sales.  This  capital  intensity  therefore  varies with the changes in natural gas and electricity prices;\n- \u25a0 Industrial Merchant capital intensity to launch the business in a new market is between 1.5 and 2;\n- \u25a0 Electronics has an average capital intensity of around 2.5;\n- \u25a0 in  Healthcare,  capital  intensity,  excluding  acquisitions,  is around 1 depending on the product mix.\n\nThe  Group's  capital  intensity therefore continues  to  vary depending  on  the  business  mix,  project  type  and  prices  of  raw materials. It is much higher for renewal and efficiency investments.\n\nWhatever the capital intensity, any project must enable the Group to achieve its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) objective over the  long  term.  Therefore,  for  the  same  level  of  return  on investment,  the  operating  margin  (OIR  to  revenue  ratio)  of  a project will depend on the capital intensity of the activity in which the project is carried out.",

        "page_content": "## 3.2.2.  The theoretical lifespan of gas production unit contracts\n\nLong-term  development  is  one  of  the  key  characteristics  of  the Industrial Gas business. It is particularly evident in the investment cycle, where there is approximately a five-year span between the study  of  a  new  construction  project  for  a  Large  Industries customer  and  the  first  corresponding  industrial  gas  sales.\n\n## Strategy and objectives\n\nInvestment  cycles  in  other  business  lines  are  generally  shorter. Monitoring the lifespan of these projects is essential to anticipating the  Group's  future  growth.  The  chart  below  provides  details  of each  stage  of  this  process  based  on  the  example  of  a  Large Industries contract.\n\n## INVESTMENT CYCLE OF A LARGE INDUSTRIES CONTRACT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nApplying a theoretical capital intensity of 2, an investment of 100 million euros in a new project should generate 50 million euros of sales per annum, when fully ramped-up.\n\n- \u25a0 Opportunities and Negotiation phase: the project is included in the portfolio of investment opportunities and enters into the development  process.  Projects  exceeding  5  million  euros  of investment for Large Industries and exceeding 3 million euros for  other  business  lines  are  monitored  within  the  portfolio  of potential  opportunities  and  split  between  those  for  which  a decision is expected within 12 months and those for which the investment decision will take more than one year. Projects are then discussed and negotiated with the customer. Projects can be removed from the portfolio for several reasons:\n- 1. the contract is signed, it is removed from the portfolio and therefore becomes an investment decision;\n- 2. the project is abandoned by the customer;\n- 3. the customer decides against an over-the-fence gas supply or the project is awarded to a competitor;\n- 4. the project is delayed beyond 12 months: it is removed from the 12-month portfolio but remains in the long-term portfolio.\n- \u25a0 Signature  phase: the  two  parties  reach  an  agreement.  The signing  of  a  long-term  contract  represents  an  investment decision  validated  by  the  internal  governance  bodies.  The project is removed from the portfolio of investment opportunities and is registered in current investments.\n- \u25a0 Construction  phase: the  construction  of  the  unit  generally takes  around  24  months  and  sometimes  up  to  36  months depending  on  the  size  of  the  project.  This  is  the  capital expenditure period. The project remains in current investments.\n- \u25a0 Revenue phase:\n- 1. commissioning: this corresponds to the start-up of the unit. Sales reflect the needs of the customer with a guaranteed minimum  volume  at  the  take-or-pay  level,  guaranteeing minimum profitability from the beginning of the contract;\n\n- 2. ramp-up: this is the unit's ramp-up phase. Over the course of  the  contract  term,  volumes  increase  above  the  take-orpay  level  to  the  nominal  amount  defined  in  the  contract. Nominal capital intensity is achieved only at the end of this phase.\n\n## 3.2.3.

It  is  also  responsible  for  good internal governance practices.\n\nThe local subsidiary proposes the project and, once the contract has been signed, carries the investment on its balance sheet. It is then  responsible  for  operations,  customer  relations  and  the project's financial profitability.\n\nEngineering  &  Construction  provides  the  technologies  and guarantees that they are competitive, both overall and specifically for  each project thanks to a good industrial architecture solution. Engineering & Construction is responsible for the technical aspect and works with local Capital Implementation teams (CI within the hubs) which are responsible for executing the project. The local CI team  is  supported  by  a  dedicated  CIG  (Capital  Implementation Group)  composed of  experts.  In  the  cases  of  the  most  complex projects,  the  project  execution  authority  is  piloted  by  the  Group Transformational Investments team (GTI).\n\nPotential  projects  are  identified  well  in  advance,  based  on  good market  knowledge  and  a  strong  local  presence.  The  first  stage includes selecting the opportunities in which the Group would like to invest both commercial and technical resources, in line with its\n\nglobal  strategy. This  selection  process  is  followed  by  a  series  of validation stages.\n\nDuring  the  development  stage,  the  project  is  submitted  for  the approval  of  the  geographic  region  on  which  it  depends.  At  the Group  level,  three  major  bodies  validate  the  relevance  of  the project: the RIC (Resources & Investment Committee - see below page  42)  which  is  responsible  for  assessing  and  validating investment  requests,  the  ERC  (Engineering  Risk  Committee) which is responsible for assessing technical and execution risk, as well as the E-ENRISK (Energy and Emissions Risks Committee) in charge of taking into account aspects related to energy and the environment.\n\nOnce the project has been decided on by Air Liquide and signed with  the  customer,  it  is  executed  by  a  team  composed  of representatives  of  the  investing  subsidiary  and  of  Engineering & Construction, under the supervision of the geographic hub.\n\nDuring  the  start-up  of  a  unit,  project  management  is  the responsibility of the local operational teams, under strict standards to  ensure  the  site's  security  and  integrity.  The  operational management of the unit is carried out by the local subsidiary, and the  Group  and  hub's  Operations  Control  monitors  its  financial performance.\n\n## ROLE OF THE RESOURCES & INVESTMENT COMMITTEE (RIC)\n\nThe purpose of these Committees is to assess and approve requests for investments that have been submitted, as well as medium and long-term contractual commitments and Human Resources requirements that may arise therefrom.\n\nThey meet regularly (usually once a month) for each hub (Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Africa, Middle-East & India) and each World Business Unit (Healthcare, Engineering & Construction, Innovation & Development Division (IDD), Headquarters).\n\nEach Committee meeting is chaired by a member of the Executive Committee in charge of the hub or of the World Business Unit involved and brings together managers of the region and business line concerned by the investment, as well as representatives of the Group Finance Department (who have a veto right), Engineering & Construction, and the Capital Implementation Group (CIG).\n\nThe Committee's decisions are reviewed by Executive Management.\n\nThe decision is based on a rigorous assessment of individual projects as well as each project's expected profitability. The following criteria are systematically reviewed:\n\n- \u25a0 the  location  of  the  project:  the  analysis  will  take  into  account  whether  the  project  is  based  in  an  industrial  basin  with  high potential, whether it is connected to an existing pipeline network, or whether it is in an isolated location;\n- \u25a0 the competitiveness of the customer's site: based on size, production processes and particularly their environmental footprint, cost of raw materials and access to markets;\n- \u25a0 customer risk;\n- \u25a0 the green house gases emissions as well as their economic impact and opportunities for reducing emissions;\n- \u25a0 the adequacy of the project with the Group's environmental objectives;\n- \u25a0 the other sustainable development criteria, such as water consumption, biodiversity and relations with local communities;\n- \u25a0 the physical risks related to climate change;\n- \u25a0 exposure to the risk of corruption;\n- \u25a0 contract clauses;\n- \u25a0 end products and the stability of future demand for these products;\n- \u25a0 quality and risk related to the technical solution;\n- \u25a0 country risk: evaluated on a case-by-case basis and can lead to changes in the financing policy and its supplementary insurance cover.\n\nFollowing approval by the RIC and signing with the customer, the project is transferred to the current investment category.",

FINANCING\n\nThe  financing  policy  is  regularly  reviewed  to  provide  the  best possible  support  to  the  Group's  development  and  take  into account changes in financial market conditions, while respecting a credit profile in line with Standard & Poor's and Moody's long-term minimum 'A' category rating. This  credit  profile  depends  on  key ratios  such  as  net  debt  to  equity  and  cash  flow  from  operating activities after change in working capital requirements to net debt.\n\nThe Air Liquide Group applies the following principles of prudence:\n\n- \u25a0 diversifying financing sources and spreading of debt maturities in order to minimize refinancing risk;\n- \u25a0 backing  commercial  paper  issues  with  confirmed  credit facilities;\n- \u25a0 hedging interest rate risk to ensure visibility of financing costs, in line with long-term investment decisions;\n- \u25a0 funding  investments  in  the  currency  of  the  operating  cash flows, to ensure a natural currency hedging;\n- \u25a0 a permanent centralization of funding and excess cash through Air Liquide Finance, a wholly-owned entity of Air Liquide.\n\n## 3.3.1.  Diversifying and securing financing sources\n\nAir  Liquide  diversifies  its  financing  sources  by  accessing  various debt markets: commercial paper, bonds and banks.\n\nAir  Liquide  uses  the  short-term  commercial  paper  market,  in France, through two French Commercial Paper programs of up to an outstanding maximum of 3 billion euros each, and in the United States through a US Commercial Paper program (USCP) of up to an outstanding maximum of 2 billion US dollars.\n\nFor its long-term financing, Air Liquide has a Euro Medium Term Note  (EMTN)  program  to  issue  long-term  bonds  of  up  to  an outstanding  maximum  amount  of  12  billion  euros.  This  program allows,  in  particular,  for  bonds  to  be  issued  in  the  principal currencies  (euro,  US  dollar,  Japanese  yen)  as  well  as  in  other currencies  (Chinese  renminbi,  Swiss  franc,  pound  sterling  and Russian ruble). Air Liquide can also issue private placements.\n\nIn line with its ESG (Environmental Social Governance) objectives, Air Liquide has established a Sustainable Financing Framework to cover  the  following  instruments  to  finance  sustainable  projects intended to have a clear benefit to the environment and society. This  Framework is  aligned  with  the  Green  Loan  Principles  2020 and the Social Loan Principles 2021 overseen by the Loan Market Association  (LMA)  and  with  the  Green  Bond  Principles  2018 (GBP),  the  Social  Bond  Principles  2020  (SBP)  and  the Sustainability  Bond  Guidelines  2018  (SBG)  overseen  by  the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA).\n\nThe Group also raises funds through bank debt (loans and credit facilities).\n\nTo avoid liquidity risk relating to the renewal of funding at maturity, and  in  accordance  with  the  Group's  internal  policy,  the  Group limits its short-term debt maturities to an amount which is covered from  its  core  banks  by  committed  credit  facilities,  syndicated  or bilateral.\n\nInvestments  are  generally  funded  in  the  currency  in  which  the cash flows are generated, creating a natural currency hedge.\n\n## Strategy and objectives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Centralization of cash and funding, excess cash and hedging\n\nTo benefit from economies of scale and facilitate capital markets financing  (bonds  and  commercial  paper),  the  Group  uses  a dedicated subsidiary, Air Liquide Finance.  This  subsidiary centralizes the vast majority of the Group's financing transactions. It  hedges  currency,  interest  rate  and  energy  risk  for  the  Group's subsidiaries in those countries where it is permitted by law.\n\nIn  the  countries  where  local  regulations  allows  it,  Air  Liquide Finance  also  centralizes  cash  flow  balances  through  direct  or indirect  daily  cash  pooling  of  these  outstanding  balances  or through intra-group loans and borrowings. When daily international  cash  concentration  is  not  possible,  there  exist, nonetheless, local cash poolings which allow periodic intercompany loans to Air Liquide Finance.\n\nDue to the currency matching within Air Liquide Finance, resulting from  the  currency  hedging  of  intra-group  loans  and  borrowings, these  internal  financing  transactions  do  not  generate  a  foreign exchange risk for the Group.\n\nAir  Liquide  Finance,  which  centralizes  the  Group's  financial hedging transactions, complies with EMIR requirements (European Market Infra-structure Regulation) relating to its status as  a  non-financial  counterparty  (NFC-).  Following  the  new definitions  brought  by  EMIR  REFIT  and  according  to  its  status 'NFC-', Air  Liquide  Finance  transfered  in  2021  the  responsibility for reporting derivatives to the majority of its counterparties.\n\nFurthermore, in certain specific cases (e.g. regulatory constraints, high country risk, joint ventures, etc.), the Group may limit its risk though adapted management, by setting up specific financing in the local banking market, and by using credit risk insurance.\n\n## 3.3.3.  Staggering debt maturity\n\nTo  minimize  the  refinancing  risk  related  to  debt  maturity schedules, the Group spreads maturities over several years.\n\nDebt  maturity  schedules  are  regularly  reviewed  by  Finance Department during Finance Committee.\n\nRefinancing risk is also reduced by the regularity of the cash flow generated from Group activities.\n\n## 3.3.4.  Use of bank guarantees\n\nGroup  subsidiaries  require  from  time  to  time  bank  guarantees, mostly  in  favor  of  Healthcare,  Engineering  &  Construction  and Global  Markets  &  Technologies,  either  during  the  tender  period (bid bond), or after contract award, during contract execution until the end of the warranty period (advance payment bond, retention bond, performance bond, and warranty bond).\n\nThe most common bank guarantees are advance payment bonds and performance bonds and are extended to customers to secure contractual performance.\n\nIn  the  Group's  ordinary  course  of  business,  certain  subsidiaries are  required  to  provide  financial  payment  guarantees  to  secure rental or insurance obligations.\n\nThe  projects,  for  which  these  guarantees  are  granted,  are regularly reviewed by management and are subject to approval by the Board of Directors for guarantees which exceed 100  million  euros.  When  guarantee  payment  calls  become probable, the necessary provisions are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

INNOVATION\n\nThe  Innovation  and  Development  Division  (IDD)  drives  the innovation  strategy  and  its  execution  for  the  Group's  Hubs  and Operations, with the strong support of the World Business Lines. It contributes to the operational excellence and future growth of the Group  by  creating  new  profitable  and  sustainable  offers  in  both traditional  and  new  businesses.  It  is  responsible  for  imaging, developing and incubating new solutions until they are brought to market,  particularly  when  it  comes  to  offers  with  a  high technological content (including Digital and IT).\n\n## Strategy and objectives\n\nThe  Innovation  and  Development  Division  relies  both  on  its Innovation Campuses and its Campus Technologies, which gather the experts of its internal ecosystem, and on its partnerships with external innovation ecosystems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  investment  decisions  and  resources  relating  to  innovation depend  on  the Group's  governance  bodies  (Resources  and Investment Committee - RIC, Risk Committee), the  operation of  which  is  described  on  page  42  of  the  present  Universal Registration Document.\n\nResearch  &  Development projects are subject to joint governance  by  the  R&D  Program  directors  and  the  World Business  Lines  in  order  to  ensure  the  projects  are  aligned  with business  strategies  and  to  anticipate  the  industrialization  and rollout  phases. The implementation of R&D projects for a cluster (group of countries), in line with the World Business Lines strategy also  helps  improve  customer  centricity  and  reduces  the  time  to market of innovations.\n\nACADEMICS, TECHNOLOGY INSTITUTES, CUSTOMERS, START-UPS\n\nFurthermore, Technology  Roadmaps  (TRM) dedicated in particular to the Hydrogen energy, Global Markets & Technologies and  Engineering  &  Construction  have  been  defined  and  are coordinated  by  the  Innovation  and  Development  Division's  Chief Technology  Officer  working  hand  in  hand  with  R&D  and  the Business  Lines.  Structured  around  the  project  maturity  scale, these  roadmaps  constitute  the  steering  tool  of  the  Group's technology innovation strategy. The First-of-its-Kind Committee (FOIK), created specifically to assess the risks relating to pilot or demonstration projects carried out for the first time by the Group, meets  every  month.  The  Digital  Committee  validates  digital projects  when  they  are  in  the  development  phase  before deployment  (Minimum  Viable  Products  -  MVP)  along  with  the associated expenses.\n\nThe innovation strategy is also regularly reviewed by the Group's Executive Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This strong sales growth in 2021 follows the year 2020 that saw the Group demonstrate resilience in an especially tough sanitary environment. Sales in 2021 were up +6% (1) compared with 2019. Notably  driven  by  projects  related  to  the  energy  transition, consolidated  revenue  from  Engineering  &  Construction  was  up +55.4%. Global Markets & Technologies posted growth of +17.8%, which was buoyed by the momentum of the biogas market.\n\nEnergy  prices  saw  an  exceptionally  strong  increase  during  the 2 nd half of the year, especially in Europe, resulting in a significant energy  impact,  at  +8.4%  for  2021  and  even  +16.5%  in  the 4 th quarter. Currency and significant scope impacts were negative, at  -1.6%  and  -1.1%  respectively.  All  in  all,  the  Group  reported growth of +13.9% in published revenue.\n\n## Gaz & Services\n\nGas & Services revenue in 2021 totaled 22,267 million euros , a strong increase of +7.3% . Large Industries sales rose +5.5% and were  driven  by  strong  demand  in  the  Steel  and  Chemicals markets,  as  well  as  a  recovery  in  Refining  over  the  year. Electronics revenue rose +7.0% in a thriving market, with Carrier Gases sales posting double-digit growth thanks to the start-up of new  production  units.  Healthcare  growth  remained  strong  at +7.2% despite a high basis of comparison in 2020, with teams still focused on fighting against covid-19. The recovery in the Industrial Merchant  business  continued  in  2021,  with  sales  rising  +8.4%, driven by a pricing impact of +3.6% for the year, which picked up to reach +7.0% in the 4 th quarter.\n\nGas & Services sales were up +13.3% as published in 2021: the energy impact (+8.8%) hit record levels, especially toward the end of  the  year.  This  was  partially  offset  by  unfavorable  currency (-1.6%)  and  significant  scope  (-1.2%)  impacts.  The  significant scope impact primarily results from the acquisition of 16 Sasol air separation units in  late  June  2021,  the  divestment  of  Sch\u00fclke  in 2020 in Healthcare and the reduction or sale of the Group's stakes in several non-strategic distributors in 2020 in Japan.\n\n## Performance",

As  a  reminder,  Large Industries  energy  costs  are  contractually  passed  through  to customers. Other  operating  expenses  and  income was  up +4.2% and  notably  included  an  increase  in  transport  costs  and maintenance expenses due to the exceptional winter storm along the Gulf Coast at the beginning of the year and Hurricane Ida in September. Depreciation and amortization reached 2,173 million euros , representing a moderate increase of +1.6% and of +2.7% excluding the currency impact: the impact from the start-up of new units and the integration of the 16 ASUs acquired from  Sasol  in  June  2021  was  partially  offset  by  divestments, including that of Sch\u00fclke in 2020, and the end of the depreciation and amortization of certain assets.\n\nGroup Operating Income Recurring (OIR) reached 4,160 million euros ,  marking  a  sharp  increase  of  +9.8%  and  of +12.7% on a comparable basis ,  which was much higher than the comparable sales growth of +8.2%. The operating margin (OIR to revenue) stood at 17.8% as published, an improvement of  +70  basis  points  excluding  the  energy  impact . On  a reported basis, the margin declined by -70 basis points compared to  2020,  due  to  the  strong  energy  costs  increase,  which  are contractually  passed  through  to  Large  Industries  customers, therefore  having  a  dilutive  impact  on  the  published  margin.  This performance  reflected  the  Group's  capability  to  quickly  translate steep and rapid increase of energy costs during the 2 nd half of the year  into  prices.  This  also  marked  the  third  consecutive  year  of significant improvement in operating margin excluding the energy impact,  following  the  performances  seen  in  2019  (+70  basis points) and 2020 (+80 basis points).\n\nEfficiencies (2) for the year totaled 430 million euros , exceeding the annual target of 400 million euros. These efficiencies represent a  saving  of  3.0%  of  the  cost  base. Industrial  efficiencies accounted for close to 50% of total efficiencies and were mainly the  result  of  investment  in  efficiency  projects,  notably energy efficiencies in  Large  Industries.  The  implementation  of digital tools aimed  at  the  Group's transformation continued,  with  the\n\n(2)\n\nacceleration of the roll-out of remote operation centers for Large Industries  production  units  (Smart  Innovative  Operations,  SIO), new  optimization  tools  for  delivery  routes  in  Industrial  Merchant (Integrated  Bulk  Operations,  IBO),  and  the  introduction  of  a remote patient monitoring platform in Healthcare.\n\nPortfolio  and  pricing  management  also  contributed  to  margin improvement.\n\n## Gas & Services\n\n## GAS & SERVICES 2021 OPERATING INCOME RECURRING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGas & Services operating income recurring totaled 4,362 million euros ,  representing  an  increase  of  +8.6%  compared  with  2020, and  an  improvement  of +11.3%  on  a  comparable  basis .  The operating margin stood at 19.6%, up +80 basis points excluding the  energy  impact .  The  operating  margin,  as  published,  was down compared with 2020 (20.4%) due to the significant increase in energy costs, which are contractually passed through to Large Industries customers and therefore have a dilutive impact on the published margin.\n\nIndustrial Merchant prices were up +3.6% over the year due to pricing  campaigns  launched  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  and which  were  stepped  up  during  the  2 nd half  of  the  year  in  an unprecedented  context  of  steep  and  rapid  increase  of  energy prices,  in  particular  in  Europe.  Prices  were  stable  in  Healthcare (down  in  Europe  and  up  in  the  Americas)  and  were  down  in Electronics due to price discounts on certain Advanced Materials granted to customers signing medium-term contracts, in anticipation of a strong increase in volumes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin stood at 20.9% , marking a very high increase of +130 basis points compared with 2020. The Industrial Merchant was the most contributing activity due to the volumes increase related to the pick-up in the activity and the efficiencies generated  coupled  with  a  strong  cost  control. Improved volumes and business mix in Healthcare coupled with efficiencies in Large Industries also participated in the improvement in the operating margin.\n\nOperating  income  recurring  for Europe reached 1,444  million euros ,  an  increase  of +2.8% .  Excluding  the  energy  impact,  the operating  margin  was 20.5% , down  just -10  basis  points compared with 2020. The operating margin of industrial activities improved  slightly,  driven  by  Large  Industries,  especially  the efficiencies, and to a lesser extent by the increased volumes and efficiencies  in  Industrial  Merchant.  The  Healthcare  operating margin was down due to a marked decrease in regulatory prices despite  the  significant  efficiencies  generated  and  improved business  mix  following  the  strong  activity  increase  in  Home Healthcare.\n\nOperating income recurring for Asia-Pacific totaled 1,066 million euros ,  an  increase  of +8.2% .  The  operating  margin  was 22.6% excluding the energy impact, up +60 basis points compared with 2020.  Electronics,  which  notably  enjoyed  a  strong  increase  in Advanced Materials and Carrier Gases volumes with several startups  during  the  year,  and  Large  Industries  which  generated significant efficiencies, were the two largest contributors. Industrial Merchant  and  Healthcare  also  participated  in  the  improved operating margin, albeit to a lesser extent, through efficiencies and an increase in Industrial Merchant volumes.\n\nOperating  income  recurring  for  the Middle  East  and  Africa amounted to 158 million euros , a significant increase of +66.0% . This was driven mainly by the acquisition of the 16 Sasol units at the end of June, which fully contributed during the 2 nd half of the year.  Excluding  the  energy  impact,  the  operating  margin  was 22.4% ,  representing a major improvement of +550 basis points . The integration of the 16 Sasol units accounted for almost half of this improvement, the customer keeping at its direct expenses the energy costs in a first phase, which had an accretive effect on the margin. The operating margin also benefited from higher volumes in  Large  Industries,  in  particular  in  the  Yanbu  basin  in  Saudi Arabia,  as  well  as  in  Industrial  Merchant  where  the  efficiencies generated were also significant.\n\n## Engineering & Construction\n\nOperating income recurring for Engineering & Construction was 42 million euros in  2021. The operating margin stood at 11.0% , representing a marked improvement compared with 5.1% in 2020 due to a clear upturn in business and project progress.\n\n(3)\n\n## Global Markets & Technologies\n\nOperating income recurring for Global Markets & Technologies amounted to 97 million euros with an operating margin of 14.2% for 2021, representing a +70 basis point increase compared with 2020.\n\n## Corporate Costs and Research & Development\n\nCorporate  and  Research  &  Development  expenses ,  stood  at 341  million  euros .  They  were  up  +7.4%  compared  with  2020, mainly due to the development of innovation and costs related to the capital increase reserved for employees.\n\n## NET PROFIT\n\nOther  operating  income  and  expenses showed  a  balance  of -151  million  euros compared  with  -140  million  euros  in  2020. These included costs relating to the realignment plans implemented  in  various  countries  and  business  lines,  and expenses  relating  to  acquisitions  and  divestments  carried  out during the year.\n\nThe financial  result amounted  to -408  million  euros and included the cost of net debt , which stood at -280 million euros , representing  a  decrease  of  -20.6%  compared  with  2020.  This decrease was primarily due to the exceptional cost generated in 2020 by the early redemption of bonds ('senior notes') issued by Airgas before its acquisition by Air Liquide. The average cost of net debt was 2.8% ,  stable compared with 2020. Other financial income  and  expenses amounted  to -128  million  euros compared  with  -87  million  euros  in  2020.  This  difference  is explained in particular by a provision taken on interests on arrears, the  impact  of  hyperinflation  in  Argentina  and  the  effect  of  the revaluation of financial instruments.\n\nIncome  tax  expense was 915 million euros in 2021, corresponding to an effective tax rate of 25.4% . This is compared with an exceptionally low rate (21.1%) in 2020 due to the reduced tax rate on the capital gain from the sale of Sch\u00fclke.\n\nThe share of profit of associates amounted to 5 million euros . The share of minority interests in  net profit totaled 120 million euros , up  +28.9%  due  to  the  strong  increase  in  profit  at subsidiaries  with  minority  shareholders  that  was  driven  by business picking up.\n\nNet profit (Group share) stood at 2,572 million euros in  2021, up  +5.6%  as  published  and  a  significant  increase  of +8.9% excluding  the  currency  impact.  Recurring  net  profit  (Group share) (3) also amounted to 2,572 million euros . This represented a  marked  increase  of  +9.9%,  and +13.3%  excluding  the currency  impact ,  compared  with  recurring  net  profit  (Group share) for 2020.",

This  corresponds  to  a  high  level  of  22.7%  of  sales  and 24.5% excluding  the  energy  impact ,  improving  by +40  basis  points compared  with  2020 . The  improvement  in  the  OIR  before depreciation and amortization to sales ratio excluding the energy impact was also +40 basis points.\n\nWorking Capital Requirement (WCR) decreased significantly, by 377  million  euros compared  with  December  31,  2020.  This improvement  was  mainly  driven  by  an  increase  in  prepayments from third-party customers in Engineering & Construction related to  the  strong  upturn  in  business,  as  well  as  an  increase  in  nonrecourse factoring programs for an amount of almost 300 million euros excluding currency effect to manage the impact of the sharp increase in energy prices on the value of trade receivables. The strong  focus  on  debt  recovery  continues  amid  a  tough  sanitary environment. The WCR excluding taxes to sales ratio therefore improved to 0.9% from 2.3% in 2020.\n\nNet  cash  flow  from  operating  activities  after  changes  in working capital requirement amounted to 5,571 million euros , a  marked increase of +7.0% compared with 2020 and of +8.6% excluding the currency impact .\n\n## CAPITAL EXPENDITURE\n\n|   (in millions of euros) | Industrial  Investments   |   Financial  Investments  (a) | Total capital  expenditures  (a)   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                     2017 | 2,183                     |                           144 | 2,327                              |\n|                     2018 | 2,249                     |                           131 | 2,380                              |\n|                     2019 | 2,636                     |                           568 | 3,205                              |\n|                     2020 | 2,630                     |                           145 | 2,775                              |\n|                     2021 | 2,917                     |                           696 | 3,613                              |\n\nGross capital expenditure was very high in 2021 at 3,613 million euros , including transactions with minority shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This represented 1 2.5% of sales and 13.5% excluding the energy impact , reflecting strong project development. For Gas & Services, this expenditure totaled 2,641 million euros with the corresponding geographical breakdown presented in the table below.\n\nGas & Services\n\n|   (in millions of euros) |   Europe |   Americas |   Asia Pacific |   Middle East  and Africa | Total   |\n|--------------------------|----------|------------|----------------|---------------------------|---------|\n|                     2020 |      873 |        914 |            577 |                        53 | 2,416   |\n|                     2021 |      913 |        909 |            755 |                        64 | 2,641   |\n\nFinancial investments amounted to 660 million euros in 2021 , representing a marked increase compared with 129 million euros in  2020.  These  included  the  acquisition  of  Sasol's  units  for approximately  480  million  euros. A  total  of  21  acquisitions  were completed in 2021.\n\nProceeds from the sale of assets ,  which  reached 220 million euros in 2021, underline the Group's efforts to maintain an active portfolio  management  strategy.  These  included  in  particular  the divestment of activities in Greece, these of propane in the United States and of compressed air in France.\n\nNet capital expenditure (1) totaled 3,388 million euros .\n\n## NET DEBT\n\nNet debt at  December 31, 2021, reached 10,448 million euro s. Despite  the  very  high  level  of  investment  and  an  unfavorable currency  impact,  net  debt  was  down  by  161  million  euros compared with December 31, 2020, mainly due to the increased Group  cash  flow  from  operating  activities  and  the  decrease  in working  capital  requirement.  The net  debt-to-equity  ratio reached 47.5% .\n\n## ROCE\n\nThe return on capital employed after tax (ROCE) was 9.3% in 2021. Recurring  ROCE (2) was  identical (9.3%) ,  representing  a marked improvement compared with 8.6% in 2020 and in line with the ROCE target of more than 10% in 2023 or 2024.\n\n## 4.

They  notably  included  the acquisition of 16 Air Separation Units from Sasol in South Africa for approximately 480 million euros.\n\nIndustrial  investment  decisions totaled  close  to 3.0  billion euros and were stable compared with 2020. They were strong in Large Industries and notably included energy transition projects: in Asia,  they  included  a  carbon  monoxide  production  unit  with integrated CO2 recycling, and in Europe, a large-size electrolyzer in the Ruhr basin. Investment decisions continued at a high level within the Electronics business line, with Carrier Gases projects in Asia  and  the  United  States.  Industrial  decisions  contributing  to efficiencies accounted for 8% of the total.\n\nFinancial  investment  decisions reached 662  million  euros in 2021  and  included  the  acquisition  of  the  units  from  Sasol  for approximately  480  million  euros.  They  also  comprise  several Healthcare  acquisitions  in  Europe,  as  well  as  in  the  Industrial Merchant business line in North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nThe investment  backlog remained  stable  at  the  high  level  of 3.2 billion euros , appropriately distributed across  various business  sectors  and  geographies.  The  Chemicals  market represents  the  largest  share,  followed  by  Semiconductors,  while the  share  that  energy  transition  projects  represent  remains substantial. These investments should lead to a future contribution to annual sales of approximately 1.1 billion euros per year when fully ramped up.",

Betamed specialises in the care of patients with severe pathologies , either at home or in its specialised clinic in Chorz\u00f3w in Silesia. This acquisition enables the Group to strengthen its presence in Poland and to expand its range of services to support patients suffering from complex forms of chronic diseases .\n\n## Start-ups\n\nThere  were 21  major  start-ups during  2021.  This  notably included large-scale ASUs in Russia and the United States for the Large  Industries Steel  and  Chemicals  markets,  and  several Carrier  Gases  production  units  for Electronics in  Asia  and  the United States.\n\nThe additional contribution to sales of unit start-ups and rampups  totaled 345  million  euros in  2021,  including  a  70  million euros contribution by the Sasol units in South Africa in the second half-year. Electronics is the main contributor in Asia-Pacific, while in Europe and Americas it is Large Industries.\n\nThe additional contribution to 2022 sales of  unit  start-ups and ramp-ups is expected to be between 410 million and 435 million euros ,  which  is  higher  than  the  corresponding  amount  in  2021. This  includes  approximately  135  million  euros  from  the  16  units acquired  from  Sasol  at  the  end  of  June  2021  and  half  of  this amount will be recognized as part of the significant scope impact.\n\n## Investment opportunities\n\nThe 12-month portfolio of investment opportunities increased to 3.3  billion  euros at  the  end  of  2021,  with  new  entries  in  the second half-year, notably related to Electronics in Asia and Large Industries,  offsetting  investment  decisions  and  the  removal  from the portfolio of several projects that were either postponed beyond 12 months or awarded to the competition.\n\nThe  projects  related  to energy  transition represent  more  than 4 0%  of  the  investment  opportunities.  Europe , where  the majority  of  energy  transition  projects  are  based,  represented approximately 40% of the portfolio. It was followed by Asia , which was  driven  by  large Electronics projects.  Next  came  the Americas , with opportunities for major  projects  in Large Industries and Electronics .  Lastly,  the  Middle-East  and  Africa accounted for less than 10% of the portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FINANCING\n\n- \u25a0 On  May  19,  2021,  Air  Liquide  successfully  launched  its first  green  bond  issue ,  by  raising 500  million  euros  (10  years maturity) which will be dedicated to financing and refinancing the development of several sustainable projects , in particular in hydrogen, biogas and oxygen. This operation is in line with the 'Sustainable Financing Framework' published on May 17 and validated by a third-party . This new bond issue will notably contribute to the financing of the ambitious sustainable projects the Group announced on March 23, 2021. At the same time, Air Liquide undertakes to publish, annually until the funds raised are fully allocated, a \"Sustainable Financing Reporting\", which will include an allocation report and an impact report, both validated by an audit firm and made public on the Group's website.\n\nIn September 2021, the Group also issued a public bond for an amount of 500 million euros , under its EMTN program, maturing in 12 years .\n\nAt the end of 2021, outstanding bonds issued under the EMTN program amounted to 7.5 billion euros (nominal amount).\n\n## 2021 FINANCING\n\n## 'A' Category financial rating confirmed\n\nAir  Liquide  is  rated  by  two  main  rating  agencies,  Standard  & Poor's  and  Moody's.  The  long-term  rating  from Standard  & Poor's  is  'A',  improving compared  to  'A-'  in  2020,  and  from Moody's  is  'A3' .  These  are  in  line  with  the  Group's  strategy. Moreover, the short-term ratings are 'A1' for Standard & Poor's, upgraded compared  to  'A2'  in  2020,  and  'P2'  for  Moody's. Standard & Poor's announced its long term and short terms rating upgrades  on  July  28,  2021  and  gave  a  stable  outlook.  Moody's confirmed  its  ratings  on  May  4,  2021  and  upgraded  its  outlook from stable to positive.\n\n## Diversifying and securing financial sources\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  Group  financing  through  capital markets accounted for 89% of the Group's total debt , for a total amount of outstanding bonds of 11.1 billion euros including all types of bonds, and 0.2 billion euros of commercial paper.\n\nThe total amount of credit facilities was stable at 3.6 billion euros . The  syndicated  credit  facility  covers  an  unchanged  amount  of 2.5  billion  euros and  matures  in  December  2025.  Since  2019, this  facility  includes  an  indexation  mechanism  between  the financial costs and three of the Group's CSR targets in the areas of carbon intensity, gender diversity, and safety.\n\nThe  amount  of  total  debt  maturing  in  the  next  12  months  is 2.2 billion euros, stable compared with December 31, 2020.\n\n## 2021 Bond issuance\n\nIn May 2021, under the EMTN program, the Group issued a public green  bond for  an  amount  of 500  million  euros ,  maturing  in 10 years .\n\n## Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, net debt increased in US dollar due to the currency impact (appreciation  of  the  US  dollar  against  the  euro)  and  in  South African rand. In addition, net debt decreased in euro and the share of the euro in total net debt decreased consequently in favor of the US dollar and the South African rand.\n\n## Centralization of cash and funding\n\nAir Liquide Finance pools the cash balances of Group entities.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Air Liquide Finance had granted to Group subsidiaries,  directly  or  indirectly,  the  equivalent  of  13.0  billion euros  in  loans  and  received  3.4  billion  euros  in  excess  cash  as deposits  from  them.  These  transactions  were  denominated  in 26  currencies  (primarily  the  euro,  US  dollar,  Japanese  yen, Chinese renminbi, Singapore dollar, British pound). Approximately 400 subsidiaries are included in the Group cash pooling, directly or indirectly (including subsidiaries where cash pooling is carried out locally before being centralized at Air Liquide Finance).\n\n## 5.

Due to the generation of net cash flow in 2021, bond issues reached maturity without the need for refinancing and the new bonds were issued with long maturity, at 10 and 12 years.\n\nThe  following  chart  shows  the  Group's  debt  maturity  schedule. The single largest annual maturity represents approximately 11% of total debt.\n\n## DEBT MATURITY SCHEDULE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Bonds and private placements\n- Bank debt and finance leases\n- Commercial paper\n- \u25a0 Recurring net profit Group share;\n- \u25a0 Recurring net profit excluding currency effect;\n- \u25a0 Net Profit Excluding IFRS16;\n- \u25a0 Net Profit Recurring Excluding IFRS16;\n- \u25a0 Efficiencies;\n- \u25a0 Return on Capital Employed (ROCE);\n- \u25a0 Recurring ROCE.",

The  currency effect is  calculated  based  on  the  aggregates  for  the  period converted at the exchange rate for the previous period.\n\nIn addition, the Group passes on variations in the cost of energy (electricity and natural gas) to its customers via indexed invoicing integrated  into  their  medium  and  long-term  contracts.  This indexing can lead to significant variations in sales (mainly in the Large  Industries  Business  Line)  from  one  period  to  another depending on fluctuations in prices on the energy market.\n\nAn energy impact is calculated based on the sales of each of the main  subsidiaries  in  Large  Industries.  Their  consolidation  allows the determination of the energy impact for the Group as a whole. The foreign exchange rate used is the average annual exchange rate  for  the  year  N-1. Thus,  at  the  subsidiary  level,  the  following formula provides the energy impact, calculated for natural gas and electricity respectively:\n\nThis  indexation  effect  of  electricity  and  natural  gas  does  not impact the operating income recurring.\n\nThe significant scope effect corresponds to the impact on sales of all acquisitions or disposals of a significant size for the Group. These changes in scope of consolidation are determined:\n\n- \u25a0 for  acquisitions  during  the  period,  by  deducting  from  the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition;\n- \u25a0 for acquisitions during the previous period, by deducting from the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition between January 1 of the current period and the anniversary date of the acquisition;\n- \u25a0 for  disposals  during  the  period,  by  deducting  from  the aggregates  for  the  previous  period  the  contribution  of  the disposed entity as of the anniversary date of the disposal;\n- \u25a0 for disposals during the previous period, by deducting from the aggregates  for  the  previous  period  the  contribution  of  the disposed entity.\n\nEnergy impact = Share of sales  indexed  to  energy  year  (N-1)  x (Average energy price in year (N) - Average energy price in year (N-1))\n\n## CALCULATION OF PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (YEAR)\n\n## Comparable sales change and comparable operating income recurring change\n\nComparable  changes  for  sales  and  operating  income  recurring exclude  the  currency,  energy  and  significant  scope  impacts described above .\n\nFor 2021, the calculations are the following:\n\n| (in millions of euros)     | FY 2021   | FY  2021/2020  Published  Growth   | Currency  impact   | Natural  gas  impact   | Electricity  impact   | Significant  scope  impact   | FY 2021/2020  Comparable  Growth   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Revenue                    |           |                                    |                    |                        |                       |                              |                                    |\n| Group                      | 23,335    | +13.9%                             | (321)              | 1,255                  | 467                   | (206)                        | +8.2%                              |\n| Impacts in %               |           |                                    | -1.6%              | +6.1%                  | +2.3%                 | -1.1%                        |                                    |\n| Gas & Services             | 22,267    | +13.3%                             | (317)              | 1,255                  | 467                   | (206)                        | +7.3%                              |\n| Impacts in %               |           |                                    | -1.6%              | +6.4%                  | +2.4%                 | -1.2%                        |                                    |\n| Operating Income Recurring |           |                                    |                    |                        |                       |                              |                                    |\n| Group                      | 4,160     | +9.8%                              | (75)               | -                      | -                     | (27)                         | +12.7%                             |\n| Impacts in %               |           |                                    | -2.0%              | -                      | -                     | -0.9%                        |                                    |\n| Gas & Services             | 4,362     | +8.6%                              | (74)               | -                      | -                     | (27)                         | +11.3%                             |\n| Impacts in %               |           |                                    | -1.9%              | -                      | -                     | -0.8%                        |                                    |\n\n## Operating margin and operating margin excluding energy\n\nThe operating margin is the ratio of the operating income recurring divided  by  revenue.  The  operating  margin  excluding  energy corresponds to the operating income recurring, not affected by the indexation effect of electricity and natural gas, divided by revenue excluding  the  energy  impact.  The  ratio  of  operating  income recurring divided by the revenue (whether restated or not from the\n\nenergy impact) is calculated with rounding to one decimal place. The  variation  between  2  periods  is  calculated  as  the  difference between  these  rounded  ratios,  which  can  result  in  positive  or negative differences compared to a more precise calculation, due to rounding.\n\n|                            |                | FY 2021   | Natural gas  impact   | Electricity  impact   | FY 2021,  excluding  energy impact   |\n|----------------------------|----------------|-----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Revenue                    | Group          | 23,335    | 1,243                 | 463                   | 21,629                               |\n|                            | Gas & Services | 22,267    | 1,243                 | 463                   | 20,561                               |\n| Operating Income Recurring | Group          | 4,160     | -                     | -                     | 4,160                                |\n|                            | Gas & Services | 4,362     | -                     | -                     | 4,362                                |\n| Operating Margin           | Group          | 17.8%     |                       |                       | 19.2%                                |\n|                            | Gas & Services | 19.6%     |                       |                       | 21.2%                                |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Environment and society\n\nThe extra-financial indicators monitored by the Group are detailed in the Integrated Report included below (Chapter 1).\n\nThe Extra-financial Performance Declaration is presented in Chapter 5 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 6.1.   CLIMATE\n\nAir Liquide acknowledges the importance and urgency of climate issues. The Group's ambition is to participate in achieving the Paris Agreement, which sets a global framework designed to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to a level well below 2\u00b0C.\n\n## CLIMATE INITIATIVES\n\nAir Liquide believes the major climate related challenges of our society can be overcome.\n\nThis is why Air Liquide has become an active member of the TCFD (Task Force for Climaterelated  Financial  Disclosures),  a  working  group  which  brings  together  institutional  investors, audit firms and listed companies whose aim is to formulate recommendations on information to be provided, on a voluntary basis, relating to the financial risks associated with changes to the climate. Air Liquide has also declared its support for the TCFD.\n\nThe Sustainability Accounting Oversight Board (SASB) is a non-profit organization created in 2011, producing sustainable development reporting standards by industry sector.\n\nThe  SASB  takes  the  following  elements  into  account  when  establishing  its  standards: environment; social capital; human capital; innovation and economic model; and leadership and governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCross-reference tables are available in Chapter 5 pages 356 to 358 of the present Universal Registration Document which show the relationships between the recommendations from TCFD and SASB and the Air Liquide various initiatives and actions taken by Air Liquide.\n\nTo  reach  this  ambition,  in  March  2021, Air  Liquide  committed  to reach  carbon  neutrality  by  2050,  with  two  intermediary  steps: starting to reduce its absolute CO2 emissions around 2025, then reaching a -33% decrease of its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by  2035  compared  to  2020 (1) . Moreover,  the  Group  also maintained  its  existing  objective  to  reduce  by  -30%  its  carbon intensity by 2025 compared to 2015 (2) .\n\nA  new  organization  for  the  management  of  greenhouse  gas emissions  was  defined  and  implemented  this  year.  This  newly formed  organization,  along  with  the  decisions  taken  and  the actions performed by the Group secure the objective of emissions inflection  in  absolute  value  around  2025  and  the  decrease  by -30% of carbon intensity.\n\nIn 2021, Air Liquide improved the way indirect emissions related to electricity and steam purchases are accounted for, moving from a 'location-based' approach based on the average emission factors of  the  national  network,  to  a  much  more  precise  and  specific approach,  directly  linked  to  the  supply  contracts  in  place,  called 'market-based'.  With  this  approach,  the  Group  adopts  the  GHG Protocol's  recommended  method  of  accounting  for  Scope  2 emissions.  The  Group's  electricity  procurement  initiatives,  in particular  the  voluntary  procurement  of  renewable  electricity,  are now directly reflected in the reported Scope 2 emissions figures.",

However, given the ambitious decarbonization plan of the Group, including for the Sasol project, this does not compromise the -30% intensity reduction objective to reach an intensity of 5.1 (\"market-based\" methodology) by 2025 vs. 2015 baseline.\n\nDue to several factors (takeover of Sasol's air separation units in South Africa in mid-2021 and a change in the method for calculating indirect emissions related to purchases of electricity and steam), the objectives set under the 2018 strategy are no longer appropriate for meeting the new goal to reduce CO2 emissions in absolute terms while still meeting the targeted -30% reduction in carbon intensity by 2025 compared to 2015. Therefore, those objectives are no longer presented as in previous years. However, the drivers identified for decarbonizing the Group's assets are still relevant and are presented in the infographies from page 62 to page 64.

The Group has taken action in the here  and  now ,  while  at  the  same  time  preparing  the  future.  The  investment  momentum  has  been  sustained,  with  the signature  of numerous agreements in particular related to the energy transition .\n\nThe Group has delivered another year of profitable growth: Sales reached 23.3 billion euros, up +8.2% on a comparable basis, the operating margin increased by 70 basis points excluding  the  energy  impact,  and recurring net profit (1) rose  13.3% at  constant exchange rates.\n\nAll activities improved markedly :  Gas & Services, which represents 95% of Group revenue, Engineering & Construction, as well as Global Markets & Technologies. All Gas & Services business lines and regions grew to high levels, with Asia growing by +6%, Europe by +7% and the Americas by +8%.\n\nThe Group further improved its operating margin thanks to an inflation-adapted pricing policy, significant efficiencies of 430 million euros and a dynamic management of its business portfolio . Faced with a sharp and sustained rise in energy prices, the Group has demonstrated both the strength of its business model - which allows it to automatically pass on these variations to its Large Industries customers - and its ability to rapidly adapt its pricing for Industrial Merchant customers.\n\nAir Liquide's balance sheet has been further strengthened. Recurring ROCE reached 9.3% , approaching the 2023-2024 target of more than 10%. Cash flow from operations remained high at 24.5% of sales, excluding the energy impact, and helped reduce debt while also  financing  our  capital  expenditures  and  the  dividend.  Investment  decisions  reached  3.6  billion euros  for  the  year,  and opportunities remained high at 3.3 billion euros , of which more than 40% are related to the energy transition . The dividend , which will  be  submitted to the shareholders' vote in May, is proposed at 2.90 euros per  share, which represents an increase of +5.5% that reflects our confidence in the future. Moreover, a free shares attribution will take place in June 2022 .\n\nWith a business model that combines financial and extra-financial performance , Air Liquide is particularly well positioned in the markets of the future . In response, notably to the major challenges of climate change and the energy transition, the Group offers a wide range of solutions based on hydrogen and technologies to decarbonize industry. Contributing to a sustainable future is at the heart of our activity and of our strategy .\n\nIn  2022,  assuming no significant economic disruption, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net profit (2) growth at constant exchange rates.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  most  serious  risks  are identified  in  order  to  be  addressed  as  a  matter  of  priority through  the  drafting  of  prevention,  mitigation  or  remedial measures ('Vigilance Plan' section of this chapter, page 96);\n- \u25a0 the  EFPD,  which  is  included  in  Chapter  5  of  the  Universal Registration Document (page 320), presents the Group's main gross extra-financial risks and the related mitigation policies. Some  of  these  risks,  which  meet  the  requirements  of Prospectus Regulation III, are included in the 'Risk factors and management measures' section of this chapter.\n- \u25a0 risk  factors  which  are specific  to  the  issuer  and  material, after taking in account the related management measures (net risks, Prospectus Regulation, Chapter III), are presented in the 'Risk  factors  and  management  measures'  section  of  this chapter of the Universal Registration Document (page 76);\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n\nThe Group identifies the risk factors to which it is exposed using a formal  risk  management  approach.  This  presentation  of  risk factors  and  related  management  measures  is  based  on  the reference framework of the internal control and risk management system, developed under the supervision of the French financial markets authority (AMF). It was prepared with contributions from several departments (particularly Finance, Sustainable Development, Group Control and Compliance, Legal, Safety and Industrial Systems, etc.).\n\nThe  risks  presented  below,  at  the  date  of  this  Universal Registration  Document,  are  the  risks  that  the  Group  considers may  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on  its  business,  results, outlook, or reputation, should they occur. The list of these risks is, however, not exhaustive and other risks, unknown at the date of this  document,  could  occur  and  have  a  negative  effect  on  the Group's business.\n\nAs part of its risk management approach, the Group is committed to regularly assessing the risks and to reducing the likelihood that they  will  occur  or  their  potential  impact  by  implementing  internal control  and  risk  management  procedures,  as  well  as  formalized and  specific  action  plans.  These  procedures,  as  well  as  the Group's  codes  and  policies,  are  included  in  a  global  reference manual,  called  the  BlueBook,  which  is  the  cornerstone  of  the Group's internal control system and risk management.\n\nRisk factors are presented below as net risks (taking into account management  measures  already  implemented)  and  divided  into categories  according  to  their  nature.  In  each  category,  the  most significant risk factors are presented first (in bold).\n\nAlthough  the  risk  categories  have  not  been  listed  in  order  of importance,  the  two  most  significant  specific  risks  for  the Air  Liquide  Group  are  both  related  to  its  business.  These  are industrial risks and industrial investment-related risks.\n\n## IMPACTS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nSince early 2020, the health crisis related to the global spread of covid-19, has increased some of these risk factors. As a result, the Group  has  applied  adapted  management  measures  in  each country and each business.\n\nIn  2021,  the  pandemic  continued  to  develop  in  waves  while vaccination  campaigns  allowed  for  some  measure  of  economic recovery  which  remains  globally  uneven  and  uncertain.  In  this context, the Group has maintained the crisis management system put in place at the start of 2020 with adaptations (particularly with operational  business  continuity  plans  and  remote  working).  This system,  which  is  both  global  (restriction  or  ban  on  trips  and gatherings,  digital  protection,  rules  relating  to  remote  working, etc.) and  local  (contact  with  authorities,  local  lockdowns), contributes to the Group's effective response to the pandemic.\n\nIn addition, the timing and speed of the lifting of state aid remain factors  of  uncertainty  which  make  it  difficult  to  assess  the  final impact  on  the  economies  of  the  Group's  main  markets  and therefore  on  its  financial  situation.  It  should  be  noted  that  the Air  Liquide  Group did not receive any aid from the French State during this health crisis.",

The specific  protocols  to  apply  the  health  measures  required by  governments  at  the  sites  were  maintained,  as  were  the external psychological support systems.\n- \u25a0 Industrial  risks: the  procedures  aimed  at  preserving  the safety  of  employees  and  installations  within  an  organization modified by health measures have also been maintained and adapted.\n- \u25a0 Digital  risks: the  Group  has  relentlessly  pursued  actions  to raise  awareness  among  teams  about  fraud  and  the  theft  of personal and confidential data, as well as initiatives to prevent, detect and deal with significant incidents.\n- \u25a0 Customer risks and industrial investment-related risks: the pandemic, and its impact on the global economy and on supply chains  in  particular,  has  increased  the  risk  of  a  slowdown  or temporary or permanent interruption of the business of certain customers  which  could  lead  to  payment  defaults  and/or  late payments  in  the  short  term  and  to  a  permanent  decline  in revenue in the longer term. This risk may be reinforced with the gradual  lifting  of  state  aid.  The  same  applies  to  industrial investment projects, the execution of which could be delayed for  reasons  related  to  the  customer  or  the  supply  chain.  The diversity  of  the  Group's  sites,  as  well  as  the  industries  and sectors  in  which  it  works,  notably  those  where  demand  has increased  significantly  (healthcare,  pharmaceuticals)  or  which have demonstrated their resilience (food and electronics), help reduce, but not neutralize, its exposure to this risk.\n- \u25a0 Regulatory  and  legal  risks: all  of  the  Group's  subsidiaries continued  to  closely  monitor  local  regulatory,  health  and legislative  developments  and  incorporated  them  into  their processes.\n\nAs in 2020, the impact of the pandemic is not of a nature to call into  question  the  scope  and  classification  of  the  Group-specific risk factors as presented in this Universal Registration Document.\n\n| Risk categories                          | Risk factors  Industrial risks  Industrial investment-related risks  Sourcing-related risks   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Business-related risks                   | Risks relating to the design and construction of production units                             |\n|                                          | Innovation-related risks                                                                      |\n|                                          | Human Resources management related risks                                                      |\n|                                          | Customer risks                                                                                |\n|                                          | Counterparty and liquidity risks                                                              |\n| Financial risks                          | Foreign exchange risks                                                                        |\n|                                          | Interest rate risks                                                                           |\n|                                          | Tax risks                                                                                     |\n| Digital risks                            | Digital risks                                                                                 |\n|                                          | Climate risks (greenhouse gas emissions)                                                      |\n| Environmental and societal risks         | Climate risks (physical impact on Operations)                                                 |\n|                                          | Societal risks (discrimination-related)                                                       |\n| Geopolitical, regulatory and legal risks | Geopolitical risks                                                                            |\n| Geopolitical, regulatory and legal risks | Regulatory and legal risks                                                                    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Business-related risks\n\nThe  industrial  gas  business  is  characterized  by  a  significant  technology  content  (both  in  the  design  phase  and  the  construction  of production units), local production units, high capital intensity, and substantial energy requirements.\n\nVarious  risks  are  associated  with  these  characteristics.  They  are  mitigated  by  various  factors  which  include  primarily  the  diversity  of industries  and  customers  served  by  the  Group,  the  multiple  gas  applications  that  it  offers  them,  as  well  as  the  large  number  of geographical locations in which it operates. In addition, a significant share of business is subject to contracts, a strict investment project authorization and management process, and a tailored energy policy.\n\n## 1.1.   INDUSTRIAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nIndustrial risks are linked to the various industrial products, processes and distribution methods implemented by the Group. They are distributed over a large number of local production sites.\n\nOver and above the usual risks inherent in all industrial activities, Air Liquide's businesses entail more specific risks relating to:\n\n- \u25a0 products:  the  intrinsic  properties  of  industrial  gases  manufactured,  transformed  or  packaged  by  the  Group  classifies  them  in  the dangerous materials category; the use of these industrial gases requires specific means of control and protection in order to prevent risks such as:\n- -anoxia, associated with inert gases,\n- -over-oxygenation or fires, associated with oxygen and oxygen mixtures;\n- \u25a0 processes and their operation:\n- -Cryogenics  is  used  to  separate  gases  by  distillation,  store  them  and  transport  them.  This  very  low  temperature  technique  is connected with a risk of cryogenic burns from liquefied gases,\n- -Likewise, high temperature techniques, which are used in particular in the production of hydrogen, are particularly exposed to risks of burns, fire or explosions,\n- -In addition, pressure is central to the Group's processes. Pressurized equipment must be designed with safety devices which limit the risk of accidents caused by an uncontrolled increase of pressure;\n- \u25a0 logistics and transportation: each year, delivery vehicles, sales staff and technicians travel hundreds of millions of kilometers. Noncompliance  with  the  traffic  regulations  or  the  lack  of  regular  maintenance  of  vehicles  would  expose  drivers  and  third  parties  to increased risks of accidents. In addition, industrial sites use a lot of motorized lifting equipment, which present specific risks (collision, falling cylinders, etc.). Training and certification are thus required to operate them;\n- \u25a0 engineering and construction: industrial risks are factored in and must commence at the design phase of future installations. During the  construction  phase,  the  lack  of  a  strict  accident  prevention  framework  would  affect  the  coordination  among  the  various stakeholders and expose teams to risks of accidents;\n- \u25a0 delivery  reliability:  the  Group  is  exposed  to  the  risk  of  faults  in  the  systems  supplying  gas  to  customers,  which  could  lead  to  a disruption to supply, in terms of quality or volumes;\n- \u25a0 any failure to comply with specific standards and regulations, in particular in Healthcare, with the risk of non-compliance of products and services provided to customers and patients.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nSafety is a fundamental value for the Group and the 'zero accidents, on every site, in every region, in every unit' ambition remains a key priority.\n\nThe Group is therefore committed to efficiently and under all circumstances reducing the exposure of its employees, subcontractors, suppliers, customers and patients to professional and industrial risks.\n\nThe safety results for the past 30 plus years illustrate the long-term effectiveness of the Group's actions in this area.\n\nTo manage these risks, the Group has an Industrial Management System (IMS), which operates based on:\n\n- \u25a0 the accountability of the departments of the various Group entities for the effective implementation of this system;\n- \u25a0 the issue of key management and organizational procedures that aim to ensure:\n- -compliance with standards and regulations,\n- -design management,\n- -industrial risk management,\n- -hygiene, health and environmental management,\n- -management of road safety,\n- -management of skills (training, certification if necessary and more),\n- -the management of production and maintenance,\n- -the management of industrial purchasing,\n- -change management,\n- -the analysis and treatment of incidents and accidents,\n- -the dissemination of shared technical standards within Group entities.\n\nThe IMS document base is updated and supplemented on an ongoing basis.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors and management measures\n\nThe Safety and Industrial Systems Department and the Industrial Departments of the World Business Lines supervise and control the implementation of the IMS, by notably relying on:\n\n- \u25a0 on-going awareness-raising actions for teams by providing specifically related training;\n- \u25a0 the presentation of various dashboards designed to monitor performance in terms of the safety and reliability of operations;\n- \u25a0 process audits to verify the implementation conditions and compliance of operations with IMS requirements;\n- \u25a0 thorough safety reviews prior to the start-up of any new facility to prevent any accidents due to a construction defect;\n- \u25a0 technical audits to ensure the compliance of operations with Group rules.\n\nThe evolution of safety performances of operations and of their level of compliance with IMS requirements are regularly monitored by the Executive Committee.\n\n## 1.2.   INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group may be exposed to certain risks specific to its industrial investments. Each investment project may be affected, particularly in its profitability, by different factors linked primarily to project location, customer quality, good project management by the customer, and particularly the respect of implementation schedules, the competitiveness of the site, the environmental footprint or societal impact of the project, as well as to design, cost estimates, quality, and meeting construction deadlines and budgets for gas production units, including for suppliers.\n\nMoreover, in new emerging markets such as those related to energy transition, the Group may be exposed, in addition to the abovementioned risks, to risks related to the degree of maturity of some of these market segments or in certain regions.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe  BlueBook's  Operations  control  policy  sets  out  the  principles  of  the  strict  control  of  the  Group's  industrial  investments  and  its commitments, the implementation of which is set out in the investment decisions procedure. The latter includes in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 a detailed review and approval process of investment requests based on very strict assessment criteria as well as of any associated medium- and long-term contractual commitments, within the Resources and Investment Committees (described on page 42);\n- \u25a0 control of investment decisions through the specific follow-up of authorizations granted as well as contributions expected and seen during the initial years. In addition, the subsidiaries are obliged to report (above certain thresholds) all budget overruns and implement corrective action plans aimed at ensuring the profitability of the investments concerned; for the largest ones, they are supported by teams  of  experts  ('Group  Capital  Implementation'  teams)  in  order  to  secure  good  preparation  and  execution  in  particular  for  the largest projects;\n- \u25a0 more in-depth analysis of the profitability of certain major investments (comparative analysis prior and subsequent to completion).\n\n## 1.3.   SOURCING-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nElectricity and natural gas are the main raw materials used by production units. Their availability is thus essential to the Group. Where the local market permits, Group subsidiaries secure the energy sourcing through medium- to long-term supply commitments and competitive bidding scenarios with local suppliers with the objective of achieving the most reliable and competitive energy costs, with a low -carbon footprint, available on the market.\n\nRisks to which the Group are exposed when sourcing raw materials relate to:\n\n- \u25a0 energy supply (access and reliability, in particular counterparty risk, etc.);\n- \u25a0 volumes (non-compliance with obligations and commitments on volumes, etc.);\n- \u25a0 prices (volatility, competitiveness, etc.);\n- \u25a0 compliance with current regulations (market transparency rules, Sapin 2 Law, etc.);\n- \u25a0 changes in local regulations on energy and its deregulation;\n- \u25a0 their carbon footprint.\n\nFinancial risk relating to raw materials is described in note 26.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 283.\n\nMoreover, and in addition to energy, the Group may be temporarily exposed to supply shortages for certain molecules which are only produced at a limited number of sites, in particular with worldwide reach, such as helium and rare gases.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nDue to the geographic spread of Group activities, its supply contracts are diversified.\n\nThe management of exposure to specific energy sourcing risks is described in the Group's Energy management policy and is based on two principles:\n\n- \u25a0 energy purchasing must exclusively cover internal production needs ('own-use');\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk factors and management measures\n\n- \u25a0 entities pass on energy cost fluctuations to their customers via indexed invoicing integrated into their medium- and long-term gas supply contracts. The Group works to maintain this principle in the context of the supply of low-carbon industrial gases produced from renewable energy (for which new risks must be taken into account: long-term commitment, fixed price, intermittency, management of environmental certificates, etc.).\n\nThe 'E-Enrisk' Group Energy & Emissions Risk Management Committee reviews the energy sourcing strategies of the entities, examines the most significant commitments submitted to it and ensures proper implementation of the Climate Objectives through the review of strategies to decarbonize production assets (both for investment decisions and for existing assets).\n\nEach month, this E-Enrisk Committee brings together the Vice President in charge of the Large Industries World Business Line, the Energy Director, the Group Finance and Treasury Director as well as the Director in charge of Accounting policies and procedures, and the Sustainable Development Director. Meeting minutes are sent to all Executive Committee members.\n\nMoreover, risks relating to the sourcing of certain molecules produced at a limited number of sites with worldwide reach are managed by a strategy of diversifying sources, storing molecules and securing procurement through long-term contracts.\n\n## 1.4.   RISKS RELATING TO THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF PRODUCTION UNITS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir Liquide's engineering team designs and builds production units worldwide which are primarily intended for Group investments, but also for third-party customers.\n\nAs these projects generally extend over several years, they are exposed, at their various stages, to risks relating to design, purchasing, transport or construction and more generally the overall quality, schedule and costs. Risks relating to these projects are often greater during the construction phase, in particular for turnkey projects:\n\n- \u25a0 the quality and delivery times for critical equipment, on the one hand, and on-site construction costs and deadlines on the other may give rise to project start-up setbacks and impact project profitability;\n- \u25a0 unexpected technical difficulties may also arise, in particular when a new innovative process is implemented;\n- \u25a0 certain projects are located in regions of the world that may be a source of specific political or economic risks.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nEngineering and project management teams have implemented a risk management system for the development and execution of all its projects (of varying size and complexity and which use different types of technology), which is described in the document specific to this activity, the 'Playbook'.\n\nThis system relies on a Risk Committee for Engineering and an Execution Review Board for project management and aims to guarantee effective risk assessment for the duration of each project's life as well as the implementation of adequate risk management measures:\n\n- \u25a0 during  the  development  stage:  by  identifying  potential  threats  (but  also  opportunities)  that  may  have  an  impact  on  the  project's objectives during the forthcoming execution stage, thus allowing adequate decisions to be made;\n- \u25a0 during  the  execution  stage:  by  continuing  to  regularly  assess  and  mitigate  already-identified  risks  which  could  change,  occur  or disappear, but also by identifying and dealing with any new threats which could have an impact on the contractual commitments, technical integrity or performance of the project right through until its completion.\n\n## 1.5.   INNOVATION-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group operates in a fast-moving environment, with the emergence of new products, new players, new business models and new technologies,  thus  creating  a  strong  need  for  technological  developments  in  its  main  markets,  such  as  hydrogen  energy,  artificial intelligence or even the Healthcare offering. These changes may impact the Group's activities or its position in a market. The Group's growth possibilities therefore depend on its ability to respond to this change over time.\n\nIn terms of digital technologies, the Group is facing remarkable transformation challenges with possible impacts on its business model, its organization and, ultimately, its competitiveness. The risk to which the Group is exposed is notably related to the rapid increase in the nature  and  the  volume,  as  well  as  the  availability  of  data,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  this  is  a  result  of  connected  customers  and patients, big data, blockchain or artificial intelligence.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group has introduced a dedicated structure to roll out its innovation strategy which focuses on two objectives: contributing to its operational excellence and creating new offers in both its traditional business lines and growing markets. The Innovation & Development Division  (IDD)  therefore  steers  the  innovation  strategy  on  behalf  of  the  Group's  hubs  and  operations,  and  contributes  to  the  Group's sustainable growth.\n\nDrawing on continuous reflection regarding the markets of the future, the IDD is responsible for imagining, developing and incubating new solutions through to their launch on the market, in particular when related to offers with major technological content (including digital and IT), all while maximizing their impact and facilitating replication across all of the Group's businesses and geographies. To do so, it relies in particular on the strong exploration capacity of the Group's R&D and its i-Lab (innovation lab or innovation laboratory), which acts as a catalyst to detect and study emerging and systemic trends.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors and management measures\n\nThe Group continuously  adapts  its  innovation  approach  and  invests  each  year  in  research  and  development  and  digital  services.  In recent years, it has strengthened its open innovation approach, in particular with the signing of long-term joint development agreements with key partners, regarding:\n\n- \u25a0 the energy transition and the environment (a significant portion of the innovation spend is indeed allocated to the elaboration of new processes which consume less energy and allowing to limit CO2 emissions);\n- \u25a0 healthcare;\n- \u25a0 digital;\n- \u25a0 deep tech.\n\nFive Innovation campuses and one Technologies Campus, located across the globe, aim to create a connected network which is open to its innovation partners - universities and technology institutes, suppliers, customers and start-ups; the Group thus relies on an ecosystem made up of more than 300 external partners.\n\nThe Group has put in place a robust innovation governance process, from idea to market. In particular, it reviews initiatives whose results are not at the expected level (see page 45).\n\nThe Group is introducing digital solutions into its internal operations and as part of its offerings, to improve efficiency and in particular help steer  its  industrial  activities  with  greater  speed  and  agility.  The  roll  out  of  Smart  &  Innovative  Operations  centers  which  facilitate  the remote management of production at its sites, by drawing on predictive analysis and digital technologies, is an illustration of the Group's technological and digital transformation. Moreover, the roll out of the Integrated Bulk Operations program, aimed at digitizing the liquid gas supply chain, provides Industrial Merchant customers around the world with access to a service which guarantees greater reliability and safety.\n\n## 1.6.   HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe  long-term  performance  of  the  Air  Liquide  Group  is  driven,  in  particular,  by  the  quality  of  its  employees,  their  skills  and  their commitment.\n\nIn its businesses, the Group is therefore exposed to the risk of not being able to:\n\n- \u25a0 attract and maintain the required skills at the right time and in the right place, in particular in emerging countries where the Group is expanding its activities, or in regions where the employment market is strained;\n- \u25a0 develop these skills, in particular with the digitization of certain businesses.\n\nThese risks would result, in particular, in shortcomings in:\n\n- \u25a0 the level or quality of training;\n- \u25a0 the management of careers and opportunities; and\n- \u25a0 the recognition of performances and contributions, in particular in certain areas of expertise.\n\nIn  addition  to  risks  relating  to  skills  management,  psycho-social  risks  may  also  affect  the  health  and  level  of  commitment  of Group employees, in particular in the recent context where remote working has been rapidly implemented during periods of lockdown.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe  Group  is  committed  to  identifying,  attracting  and  developing  the  necessary  scientific,  technical  and  digital  skills  required  for  its growth, the efficient working of its operations and innovation. The Human Resources policy defines the main rules, together with the roles and responsibilities of the different parties in their implementation, with respect to, among others:\n\n- \u25a0 acquisition and sustainability of the necessary skills. Training is provided under the Air Liquide University brand with, in particular, reinforced e-learning courses attended by an increasing number of users (more than 62,000 in 2021) in a wide range of domains (ethics, industrial safety, competition law, digital security, management, etc.). They are the subject of a structured program and are managed by a specific learning management system (LMS);\n- \u25a0 supporting employees in their individual development throughout their career, particularly enabled by a centralized career and skills management  tool  (TMS:  Talent  Management  System)  and  the  communication  of  career  advancement  opportunities  (TAS:  Talent Acquisition System);\n- \u25a0 changes in working methods within the Group. The organization of work must therefore not only meet the demands and expectations of today's employees and of Air Liquide, but also those of tomorrow, while being based on the Group's fundamentals. The result of a co-creation bringing together more than 700 employees, the Group thus deployed in 2020 its new Be Act Engage model, which allows its employees to develop in a safe, ethical and engaging environment to deliver sustainable performance;\n- \u25a0 measuring  and  recognizing  performance  and  contributions  for  all  employees.  In  addition  to  employee  remuneration  and  loyalty policies (regular capital increases reserved for employees), specific provisions aimed at promoting and sustaining certain skills, such as inventor and entrepreneur recognition programs, the technical expertise development scheme ('Technical Community Leaders') in a wide range of fields such as industrial operations, industrial safety and, more recently, digital and IT since 2019.\n\nMore generally, the Group ensures the building of a performance-focused, attractive and collaborative professional environment while also safeguarding the health and well-being of Group employees in their workplace. The measurement and monitoring of the commitment of employees is carried out using an employee feedback tool called 'MyVoice'. Operations and support functions use the results from My Voice to define and implement tailored action plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employees' adjustment to this new way of working was facilitated by the existence of a digital and collaborative environment that had already been rolled out within the Group several years ago, as well as the development of virtual training courses covering remote working and team management.\n\n## 1.7.   CUSTOMER RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe primary customer risk is the risk of bankruptcy or closure of a customer's production site.\n\nMore generally, the business of some of the Group's customers may be interrupted following natural or man-made disasters, including those resulting from changes in weather conditions, pandemics, climate change, or following major political events.\n\nThe amount of operating  receivables  as  well  as  provisions  for  doubtful  receivables  are  shown  in  note  18  'Trade  receivables'  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 262.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe diversity of the Group's geographic presence across 75 countries, as well as the industries and sectors in which it works, helps distribute customer risk. The Group's entities serve a very large number of customers (more than two million worldwide) in a broad range of  industries:  chemicals,  steel,  metals,  refining,  food,  pharmaceuticals,  automotive,  healthcare,  electronics,  photovoltaics,  research laboratories, etc.\n\nThe Group's largest customer represents less than 2% of revenue, the Group's top 10 customers represent around 12% of revenue and the top 50 customers represent around 28% of revenue.\n\nA  significant  part  of  the  Industrial  Gas  business  is  covered  by  customer  contracts,  with  commitment  periods  specific  to  the  relevant business line:\n\n- \u25a0 the Large Industries business and a third of the Electronics business mainly rely on 15- to 20-year take-or-pay secured contracts, ensuring a guaranteed minimum revenue and offering strong future cash flow predictability;\n- \u25a0 the contracts  in  the  Industrial  Merchant  business,  generally  with  a  duration  of  one  to  five-years,  also  include  services  relating  to storage and cylinders over the lifetime of the supply contract;\n- \u25a0 in the Healthcare business, positions vary between health systems, with certain countries awarding one to five-year contracts on a regional and pathology basis following invitations to tender.\n\nFinally, the impact on the Group of the risks of customer business interruption following major climatic or political events is limited by the wide diversity of countries in which it operates. This impact can be offset by the necessary recourse to gases or equipment manufactured by  the  Group  in  critical  situations.  Gases  are  needed  to  secure  industrial  or  chemical  facilities  (inert  gases),  maintain  local  industrial activity  (essential  to  industrial  processes)  or  even  sustain  life  (medical  gases  and  equipment). The  Group's  businesses  are  therefore often protected or prioritized depending on the situation.\n\n## 2. Financial risks\n\nThe Group's financial policy sets out the management principles for the financial risks to which its business is exposed. In this context, the  Group  has  defined  and  regularly  reviews  the  terms  of  the  financial  procedures  which  forbid  speculative  transactions  notably  on financial instruments.\n\nFinancial decision-making governance is the responsibility of the two Finance Committees (Strategic Finance Committee and Operational Finance Committee), with the former considering issues relating to the financing strategy and the latter dealing with the practical methods of its implementation.\n\n## 2.1.   COUNTERPARTY AND LIQUIDITY RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nCounterparty risk primarily relates to trade receivables, outstanding amounts on short-term investments and derivative instruments for hedging, and to credit facilities contracted with each bank.\n\nTrade receivables risks relate to receivables on the balance sheet that may remain unpaid in the long term, in particular in the event of the financial hardship of a customer.\n\nInvestment risk is mainly related to short-term deposits in the event that one of the Group's key banks default and, to a lesser extent, an impairment loss due to use of monetary funds for a portion of the portfolio.\n\nHedging derivative risk relates to the positive market value of transactions which would be lost in the event of the default of one or more counterparties, and the need to substitute new hedges under potentially less favorable conditions.\n\nFinally, the main risk related to credit facilities is that the facility is unavailable in the case of a drawdown.\n\nNote 26.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes counterparty and liquidity risk for the year ended December 31, 2021 on pages 281 to 282.\n\nNotes  18.1  and  18.2  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  provide  a  breakdown  of  trade  and  other  operating  receivables  and allowances for doubtful receivables on page 262.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors and management measures\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nWith industrial projects and acquisition transactions, customer counterparty risk is one of the key elements assessed by the Resources and Investments Committees.\n\nFor  long-term  contracts,  an  assessment  of  a  potential  customer's  credit  profile  is  carried  out  before  any  contact  is  made.  This assessment is then taken into account in the payment terms proposed to customers.\n\nFor the Group's major customers, counterparty risk is monitored on a monthly basis using ratings provided by financial rating agencies, or via  an  internal  rating  when  there  is  no  specific  published  rating  available.  The  actual  structure  of  contracts,  in  particular  for  Large Industries and Electronics, reduces risks in that these medium- to long-term contracts include safeguarding clauses for the Group.\n\nIn certain cases (mainly Europe and the United States), the risk of losses on trade receivables is transferred to the banks through nonrecourse factoring programs.\n\nMoreover, to reduce risks relating to the default of a financial counterparty, the Group has adopted a conservative approach to its shortterm investments and only works with leading banks and financial institutions rated at least A or A2 by Standard & Poor's or Moody's, over the long term, except in exceptional and justified circumstances.\n\nInvestments  must  therefore  be  made  with  key  banks,  (i.e.,  leading  banks  selected  according  to  their  financing  resources,  their geographical and product coverage, as well as their financial stability) with maturities of less than three months, be highly liquid and have low volatility. The ratings of key banks and risk indicators available on the markets are monitored on a daily basis using real-time financial information services.\n\nCash pooling with the help of international cash pooling (a daily leveling system towards Air Liquide Finance) and the policy of annual extraction of subsidiaries' dividends also helps limit the amount of local cash in each country.\n\nTo  minimize  the  risk  relating  to  the  market  value  of  hedging  derivatives  used  to  manage  currency  and  interest  rate  risk  and  that  of fluctuations in raw material prices, the Group works with its key banks on one hand, while also ensuring it diversifies its transactions. These  transactions  are  executed  under  framework  agreements  (French  Banking  Federation  (FBF)  and  International  Swaps  and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements). The Group has decided not to use a collateralization mechanism due to the low average duration of these derivatives and the cash fluctuations that may result from margin call mechanisms.\n\nFinally,  in  terms  of  financing,  to  ensure  its  development  and  independence,  the  Group  ensures  that  it  has  sufficient  and  permanent sources of liquidity, meaning adequate financing resources available at any time and at the lowest cost from a large range of key banks and financial markets.\n\n## 2.2.   FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group, due to its international presence, is naturally exposed to foreign currency fluctuations with, on one hand, a transaction risk and, on the other hand, a risk relating to the translation of its Financial Statements into euros (the Group's reporting currency).\n\nForeign exchange transaction risk relates, on one hand, to the foreign currency commercial cash flows of operating entities and, on the other hand, cash flows arising from royalties, technical support and dividends.\n\nTranslation risk relates to the publication of the Group's Financial Statements in euros from the entities' Financial Statements in local currencies, without an impact on the profitability of the Group's businesses.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Airgas in the United States, the exposure of the Group's revenue and assets to the US dollar has increased, as has the Group's US dollar-denominated debt, with a risk linked to the translation of the Financial Statements:\n\n- \u25a0 large fluctuations in the value of the euro against the US dollar have a more significant impact on the Group's published results than before the acquisition;\n- \u25a0 these foreign exchange variations have an impact on the figures presented in the Group's balance sheet, particularly concerning the debt.\n\nNote  25.5  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  presents  net  debt  by  currency  on  page  278  and  note  26.1  to  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements  on  pages  279  to  283  describes  the  foreign  exchange  risk  management  process,  as  well  as  the  derivative instruments used and sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nSince industrial and medical gases are not transported over long distances, most products are manufactured in the country where they are sold. The Group considers that its activities and its profitability have a low level of exposure to currency fluctuations.\n\nThe  Group  has  nevertheless  defined  methods  for  hedging  its  main  foreign  exchange  risks,  whether  this  is  borne  by  the  holding companies or the operating entities, in terms of authorized hedging instruments, the decision process and the execution of transactions.\n\nThese measures are supplemented by management rules adapted to local circumstances, which are aimed at ensuring compliance and security of transactions and optimizing management.\n\nThe application of this financial policy is controlled by the Finance Department. The majority of transactions are executed directly on a centralized basis with the subsidiaries and over-the-counter markets, which is completed by consolidated Reports provided by various Group entities on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on the type of risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

An  independent  auditor  was commissioned in 2021 to assess the Group's level of compliance with the Swift Customer Security Program. The assessment showed that the ecosystem and internal security procedures are in line with Swift requirements.\n\nFurthermore, the Group provides a natural hedge and reduces its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by raising debt in the currency of the cash flows generated to repay the debt. Thus, financing is raised either in local currency or, when sales contracts are indexed in euros or US dollars, in foreign currency (EUR or USD).\n\n## 2.3.   INTEREST RATE RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe interest rate risk is mainly linked to the fluctuation of future cash flows on debt when the rate is variable.\n\nIn  case  of  a  significant  increase  in  interest  rates  upon  future  renewals  of  bonds,  the  Group  may  find  itself  obliged  to  devote  a  more significant portion of cash flows from its operational activities to service its debt.\n\nNote  25.3  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  on  page  276  presents  the  fixed-rate  portion  of  debt  and  note  26.1  to  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  on  pages  279  to  283  describes  the  sensitivity  of  the  Group's  financial  expenses  to  interest  rate fluctuations and the interest rate repricing schedule for fixed-rate debt and interest rate risk hedging instruments.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group's strategy is to maintain, over a medium- to long-term period, a majority of total debt at fixed rates, notably by using firm or option hedges.\n\nCentralized interest rate hedging methods have also been defined for each major currency in which debt is held (in particular EUR, USD, JPY, and CNY, which represent around 85% of total net debt) including:\n\n- \u25a0 the selection of authorized tools, in particular swaps and interest rate options;\n- \u25a0 hedging decision processes;\n- \u25a0 methods of executing transactions.\n\nFor debt in other currencies, rules have been defined in order to ensure that the transactions initiated to hedge interest rate risk are consistent with Group objectives.\n\nMoreover, pre-hedging transactions for future highly probable issues are regularly implemented to protect the Group against an increase in interest rates.\n\nWith  few  exceptions,  all  interest  rate  transactions  are  centrally  processed  by  Air  Liquide  Finance,  and  regularly  valued  using  both internally designed tools and an independent specialized firm.\n\n## 2.4.   TAX RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group is exposed to tax risk in certain countries, due to changes in applicable regulations, which may have an impact on its activities or its results. This risk may arise from:\n\n- \u25a0 unfavorable changes in local or international regulations;\n- \u25a0 challenges in the application of current regulations or standards;\n- \u25a0 errors when completing tax returns;\n- \u25a0 regular audits by tax authorities which could lead to disagreements over the interpretation of facts.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nAs far as tax is concerned, the Group focuses on complying with laws and regulations. Modifications of laws and regulations are followed and monitored by its Tax Department and its local Finance Departments.\n\nThe Group's tax Charter supports its ambition to remain a leader in its sector by acting in a responsible manner, consistent with the Group's  long-term  growth  strategy.  Air  Liquide  has  defined  the  following  principles  which  govern  its  tax  policy,  in  line  with  article L. 22-10-36 of the French Commercial Code:\n\n- \u25a0 Group entities must respect the laws and regulations in force, as well as the international standards that affect it such as those of the OECD, in particular on transfer prices;\n- \u25a0 Group entities ensure that tax returns and payments are completed in compliance with local regulations. They complete the required tax returns according to the jurisdictions in which the Group operates;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  is  committed  to  acting  with  integrity  in  all  tax-related  matters.  It  aims  to  operate  in  a  transparent  manner  and  build constructive, long-term relationships with the tax authorities;\n- \u25a0 the Group deals with tax-related matters by banning tax havens and does not make use of shell corporations without economic or commercial substance;\n- \u25a0 the Group protects value for its shareholders by taking measures to minimize double taxation phenomena. Furthermore, it acts to minimize fiscal risk.\n\nIts tax strategy is in line with the Group's strategy and complies with the Code of Conduct.",

By  signing  this  partnership  in  March  2019,  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  and  its  subsidiaries  have entered a long-term trust-based, transparent relationship with the French tax authorities. This commitment continues without interruption.\n\n## 3. Digital risks\n\n## 3.1.   DIGITAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group's activities, expertise and, more generally, its relations with all the stakeholders (suppliers, customers, banks, communities of experts,  etc.)  depend  on  increasingly  dematerialized  and  digitized  operations.  These  operations  rely  on  interdependent  information systems and communication networks both in functional, technical, as well as human level terms.\n\nThe Group's pursuit of this digital transformation increases its exposure to risks relating to data integrity, availability and confidentiality as well  as  the  availability  of  IT  systems  and  applications.  For  data  confidentiality,  the  increase  in  expectations  and  requirements  for protection also adds the risk of regulatory non-compliance.\n\nThese risks, which impact all economic and political players, are increasing in intensity due to the severity and frequency of digital attacks and to their changing nature (historically, cyber risks constituted industrial espionage or data hacking and have come to involve the risks of cyber criminality, malware and ransomware, where the user often plays a decisive role). These attacks, which spread at high velocity, have the potential to affect all of the Group's regions and businesses, with significant impacts on its industrial processes (disturbance of production or distribution activities), its capacity for communication, notably internal, and its image (digital identity theft, dissemination of false information, etc.).\n\nThe rise in remote working also contributes to the Group's greater dependency on information systems and therefore to the increased consequences of a potential cyber attack.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Digital  Security  Policy  describes  the  digital  security  issues,  sets  the  basic  rules  governing  the  handling  of  associated  risks,  and outlines the roles and responsibilities in this area. It is accompanied by:\n\n- \u25a0 codes outlining principles to be respected by users and IT administrators;\n- \u25a0 procedures describing, in particular, how to secure data and applications, detect and deal with incidents.\n\nThe Digital Security Department, attached to the General Control and Compliance Department, defines the main areas of focus in a multiyear operational program, and specifies the short-term action plans, in the light of a risk analysis that is updated annually. It coordinates them  in  collaboration  with  the  Digital  &  IT  teams,  among  others,  and  deploys  them  by  relying  on  dedicated  resources  in  the  hubs, clusters, World Business Units and World Business Lines. The main lines of work revolve around:\n\n- \u25a0 risk prevention and awareness raising for employees regarding issues such as fraud and the theft of personal and confidential data, with teaching tools such as e-learning courses on information protection (notably personal or sensitive data) or the use of IT tools and phishing campaigns (with a focus on employees who have been repeatedly tricked). Risk prevention measures in the event of remote working have been strengthened, in particular in the management of remote access to IT systems;\n- \u25a0 protection of critical applications, the most sensitive information, industrial assets, as well as taking digital security into account from the project design phase, as an intrinsic dimension of any digital solution;\n- \u25a0 monitoring  of  digital  threats,  information  leaks  and  major  cyber  incidents  that  could  affect  the  Group's  activities:  this  involves penetration testing (which is increasingly automated) and the implementation of a system to monitor information regarding Air Liquide which may have been leaked online;\n- \u25a0 implementing regulatory compliance for the organization using specific projects or programs such as respecting the General Data Protection Regulation; for the latter, a framework agreement was drafted governing sharing of personal data within the Group, and a mechanism for the handling and processing of complaints was introduced;\n- \u25a0 strengthening the Group's resilience: increased importance of the department in charge of incident detection/reaction, crisis simulation exercises (at the Base and hub levels), definition and implementation of a business continuity plan in the event of an interruption of IT systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Climate risks (greenhouse gas emissions)\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAlmost 85% of Air Liquide's large production units are Air Separation Units which do not use any combustion processes and consume almost exclusively electrical energy. Electricity used by the Group to power these units generate CO2 emissions at electricity suppliers; such emissions are classified as indirect emissions (Scope 2).\n\nThe Group's other two main energy consuming activities are hydrogen production and cogeneration. These account for nearly 15% of large production units and use combustion processes emitting CO2 such emissions are classified as direct emissions (Scope 1).\n\nAir Liquide's business model is based on the outsourcing of the industrial gas needs of its customers who often emit greenhouse gases themselves, in particular in the metals, chemicals and refining industries. This outsourcing is justified by Air Liquide's expertise which grants them optimized energy consumption of production tools and low-carbon energy procurement. However, it leads to the transfer of a portion the customer's greenhouse gas emissions to the Group.\n\nIn  this  respect,  the  climate  risk  (greenhouse  gas  emissions)  is  closely  linked  to  the  access  to  renewable  electricity  sources  and implementation by public authorities of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies such as, for example, the introduction of a carbon price or more stringent product regulations, that may impact:\n\n- \u25a0 either  the  Group's  plants  (direct  impact  on  the  operational  scope),  resulting  in  increased  production  costs  and  the  need  for  new investments;\n- \u25a0 or those of its suppliers, resulting in price increases;\n- \u25a0 and customers (indirect impact on the value chain), impacting for instance their market, processes and industrial gases needs.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  present  in  regions  across  the  globe  that  have  implemented,  or  are  in  the  process  of  implementing,  greenhouse  gas emissions trading schemes. In the event that the share of emissions covered by free allowances decreases, the Group may be required to introduce compensatory measures.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nAir Liquide carries out a complete inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions, which are reported according to the different categories recommended by recognized standards such as the Green House Gas (GHG) Protocol.\n\nIn 2021, Air Liquide improved the way indirect emissions related to electricity and steam purchases are accounted for, moving from a 'location-based' approach based on the average emission factors of the national network, to a much more precise and specific approach, directly  linked  to  the  supply  contracts  in  place,  called  'market-based'.  With  this  approach,  the  Group  adopts  the  GHG  Protocol's recommended method of accounting for Scope 2 emissions. The Group's electricity procurement initiatives, in particular the voluntary procurement of renewable electricity, are now directly reflected in the reported Scope 2 emissions figures.\n\nThe Group has committed to target carbon neutrality by 2050 with key intermediary milestones in 2025 and 2035, to:\n\n- \u25a0 start reducing its CO2 emissions in absolute value around 2025;\n- \u25a0 reach a -33% decrease of its CO2 emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by 2035 compared to 2020 (1) .\n\nThis trajectory is  centrally  managed via a carbon budget allocated to the regions, in line with intermediary objectives. The emissions trajectory is presented to the Executive Committee during performance reviews. Consolidated emissions, for the Group and by region, for each fiscal year, are published in the Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe  climatic  risk  is  integrated  into  the  investment  process,  considering  on  the  one  hand  a  valuation  of  CO2  in  order  to  analyze  the economic impacts of a CO2 price, and on the other hand via a specific review process for projects that have a significant impact on the Group's  carbon  footprint.  This  approach  allows  to  guide  decision-making  and  to  better  assess  the  project's  resilience  to  a  carbon constraint, as well as its impact on the objectives of Group CO2 emissions reduction.\n\nAir Liquide's actions to limit environmental impacts include:\n\n- \u25a0 for  its  own  production  activities,  by  strengthening  the  effectiveness  of  its  assets,  setting  up  renewable  electricity  contracts, implementing CO2 capture solutions, adapting its production technologies;\n- \u25a0 for  the  environmental  footprint  of  its  customers  by  drawing  on  its  technologies,  expertise  and  investment  capacity  to  co-develop solutions to limit their carbon impact;\n- \u25a0 for its ecosystems by offering solutions to build a low-carbon society (development of hydrogen and biomethane).",

Climate risks (physical impact on Operations)\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir  Liquide  operates  in  certain  regions  of  the  world  exposed  to  changes  (in  amplitude  or  frequency)  in  exceptional  meteorological phenomena due to climate change. These phenomena can slow down or interrupt the Group's operations or make them more expensive. Its suppliers and customers are also confronted with this same issue.\n\nThese can be broken down into:\n\n- \u25a0 acute risks triggered by events such as natural disasters, the frequency and severity of which are increasing: storms, hurricanes, flooding, etc. These risks may relate to Air Liquide sites located near the coast for example, or in regions affected by hurricanes (the Gulf Coast, South Asia, etc.);\n- \u25a0 chronic risks related to more long-term changes in climate models and rising temperatures: rising sea levels, chronic heat waves in certain regions, changes in rainfall patterns and an increase in their variability, the disappearance of certain resources, etc.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nPhysical risks (water availability, frequency of extreme events, etc.) are appraised during the review of investment requests, in the same way as financial criteria, to ensure that the associated risk management measures are adapted, for example in the design of equipment.\n\nIn addition, Group operations which are regularly exposed to the acute risks described above have risk management systems in place aimed at adopting suitable preventive operational measures, and at managing these crises by, first and foremost, protecting individuals and the production facilities in close cooperation with customers. These systems are regularly updated and improved.\n\nChronic risks are taken into account, in particular in the design of production units, in the same way and to the same extent as their energy efficiency and carbon footprint.\n\n## 4.2.   SOCIETAL RISKS (DISCRIMINATION-RELATED RISKS)\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir Liquide operates businesses in a large number of countries with different cultures. It is therefore naturally exposed to discrimination risks relating in particular to gender mix (gender disparity, particularly in technical and expert professions), diversity (skin color, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, etc\u2026), age or disability.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group's Principles of Action and the Code of Conduct reaffirm the Group's values and, more specifically, a culture based on diversity, openness, transparency, respect for others and the rejection of all forms of discrimination. These values are also included in the Human Resources policy and must be promoted by all Group employees, with the support of Human Resources, through awareness-raising, training tools and the monitoring of progress indicators.\n\nMoreover, for several years, Air Liquide has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, for which one of the principles aims to contribute to the elimination of all forms of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nTo this end, actions are regularly taken to promote gender mix (for example to increase the number of women among managers and professionals to 35% by 2025), nationality mix (Air Liquide's senior executives are now of 35 different nationalities), and inclusion (review of the policy relating to employees with disabilities). Actions taken by the Group are detailed on pages 325 to 327.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In an increasingly complex context due to a continuously rising number of standards, they must monitor changes to the legal and regulatory framework notably in terms of the specificities of the businesses that they conduct.\n\nThe Healthcare business line, in particular, is subject to specific regulations for the products that it sells (medical devices, drugs), the research activities that it carries out, and for the processing of patients' personal healthcare data.\n\nThe Group must face, in all regions in which it operates, the risks of non-compliance with:\n\n- \u25a0 competition law;\n- \u25a0 provisions aimed at combating corruption;\n- \u25a0 regulations restricting the export of certain products or the transfer of personal data;\n- \u25a0 the duty of vigilance.\n\nGroup entities are also exposed to the risk of non-compliance with contractual obligations (of their own or those of their contractual counterparties).\n\nLiabilities and contingent liabilities related to disputes are described in notes 23 and 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 267 and 287.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nChanges to legal and regulatory requirements are monitored with particular vigilance and are accompanied by the implementation of procedures  aimed  at  improving  teams'  knowledge  of  these  changes  and  related  risks  and  providing  them  with  tools  to  ensure compliance with obligations in the following fields, through:\n\n- \u25a0 Group Codes on how to behave in order to comply with competition laws (including Europe, the United States and Asia-Oceania), accompanied by surprise audits and training that includes e-learning;\n- \u25a0 a corruption prevention program in which Executive Management and management are closely involved; this program relies in particular on the mapping of corruption risks, the updated Code of Conduct, a full set of training and awareness-raising actions for those exposed to corruption-related risks, a third-party assessment mechanism, a whistleblowing system and accounting controls. This program is regularly updated to take into account new regulatory and legal requirements under the coordination of the Group's Ethics Officer, who relies on a network of ethics correspondents and the support of the Operational Departments in the hubs and businesses; it is regularly audited;\n- \u25a0 a guidance document for export control and international sanctions, as well as a tool to identify and verify third parties;\n- \u25a0 various  contract  guides  (for  Large  Industries,  Industrial  Merchant,  Electronics,  Engineering  &  Construction  and  Financing)  and Codes of Good Practices (for Healthcare);\n- \u25a0 the establishment of a specific mission to deal with the legal challenges of the law on the duty of vigilance.\n\nTo the Group's knowledge, there are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings which would be current or looming, which may have or have had, in the past 12 months, significant impacts on the Group's financial situation or profitability.",

Intellectual property-related risks\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe  external  and  global  environment  surrounding  intellectual  property  points  to  a  growth  in  patent  activity  as  well  as,  in  certain jurisdictions, greater attention to the protection of trade secrets. The Group's business is not dependent on technologies patented by third  parties;  it  relies  mainly  on  technologies,  processes  and  designs  developed  internally  by  its  innovation  teams,  Engineering  & Construction, the World Business Lines and in the field. The resulting inventions are reviewed and systematically protected by patents, drawings and models, brands, or by other means. Innovation is increasingly achieved in partnership with third parties; in particular the Group develops innovative businesses through partnerships, buying shares in innovative entities, or acquisitions.\n\nThis  could  lead  to  risks  of  infringement  of  the  intellectual  property  rights  of  third  parties  (patents,  utility  models,  copyright,  design, etc.)  -  counterfeiting  -  in  particular  when  several  market  players  are  working  on  similar  technologies  (especially  in  markets  or technologies that are 'new' in general or 'new' for the Group). Risks may also arise from the processing of confidential third-party information as part of partnerships or during the development of digital solutions.\n\n## Related management measures\n\nGovernance relating to intellectual property and related risk management principles are set out in the Group Policy and procedures aimed at:\n\n- \u25a0 ensuring Air Liquide's compliance with valid patents and other intellectual property rights held by third parties in its different areas of business, in particular through freedom to operate analysis;\n- \u25a0 protecting Group intellectual property assets, by protecting its inventions, designs and brands through their identification (on an official filing basis) and managing Group obligations in terms of the recognition of their inventors;\n- \u25a0 in the case of partnerships or other third-party relations, supporting stakeholders within the Group to manage risk relating to the protection of third-party rights;\n- \u25a0 raising awareness among Group employees of the risks relating to the intellectual property of third parties.\n\nTo this end, the Group relies on an Intellectual Property Department, comprising professionals located at the Group's head office and in the main geographic regions.\n\nTo the Group's knowledge, there are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings which would be current or looming, which may have or have had, in the past 12 months, significant impacts on the Group's financial situation or profitability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Organization\n\nThe  Group  is  organized  and  based  on  a  consistent  Group strategy.  It  is  supported  by  a  method  of  management  which centers on mid-term objectives that are categorized by business, as  well  as  a  steering  process  for  activities  based  on  annual budgetary  objectives,  which  are  further  categorized  down  to  the individual plan level. As part of the NEOS Company program, the Group has developed into a network organization  that  promotes communication and shortens decision-making circuits.\n\nThe organization breaks down into:\n\n- \u25a0 hubs  which  ensure  the  presence  and  representation  of  the Group in the main global regions. With the Base (L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  Head  Office),  they  are  responsible  for defining  the  Group's  operational  strategy  and  its  global performance.  They  accommodate  the  representatives  of  the Corporate functions and World Business Lines who ensure that the Group strategy is properly implemented locally;\n- \u25a0 entities,  grouped  in  clusters  (groups  of  countries)  for  better pooling  of  resources,  which  provide  operational  management of  their  activities  and  implement  the  Group  strategy  in  those countries where the Group has a presence;\n- \u25a0 the World Business Lines, which:\n- -with  the  hubs  and  Strategy  Department,  prepare  the medium-term  strategic  goals  for  the  businesses  they represent,\n- -have responsibility for strategic marketing, the transformation  of  their  respective  businesses,  industrial policy  and  the  suitability  of  skills  in  their  specific  areas  of business;\n- \u25a0 the World Business Units specific to certain businesses (Global Markets & Technologies, Engineering & Construction);\n- \u25a0 the  Innovation  &  Development  Division  (IDD),  which  brings together all the research and innovation resources, technology development,  Digital  &  IT  (the  Digital  Factory,  ALIZENT, network  infrastructure  and  more)  and  the  Global  Markets & Technologies (GM&T) WBU mentioned above.\n\nThis  organization  also  includes  the  Corporate  functions,  which notably comprise the three key control departments that report to Executive Management:\n\n- \u25a0 the Finance Department, which is responsible for:\n- -the reliability of accounting and financial information,\n- -the Group's financial and tax risk management,\n- -the drafting of Group  objectives  and  monitoring  of performance by operations control, based on financial data prepared by the accounting teams, analysis conducted by the financial teams of the various entities as well as certain operational data;\n- \u25a0 the Group Control and Compliance Department which:\n- -provides  expertise  and  assistance  to  entities  in  their  risk management  approach  (see  below)  and  builds  a  Group synthesis,\n\n- -helps Group entities ensure compliance with and promotion of  both  the  Group's  ethical  values,  particularly  through training and awareness-raising measures and the treatment of fraud and deviations (all these measures, organizations, and  tools  are  presented  in  detail  in  the  Extra-financial Performance Declaration), as well as compliance with duty of vigilance measures  and  with international trade regulations,\n- -verifies the effective application of internal control and risk management  procedures  through  audits carried out according  to  a  defined  program  presented  to  the  Group's Audit  and  Accounts  Committee.  This  program,  developed and based on the risk analysis, is regularly monitored by the Audit and  Accounts  Committee  in  liaison  with  the Environment and Society Committee (for environmental and societal issues). Audit Reports are systematically supplemented  by  corrective  action  plans,  which  are supervised  by  a  member  of  the  Executive  Committee. These  Reports,  as  well  as  subsequent  follow-up  Reports, are  the  subject  of  various  communications  and  periodic discussions with the Statutory Auditors,\n- -provides  guidance  to  Group  entities,  through  the  Digital Security  Department,  which  reports  directly  to  the  Group Control  and  Compliance  Department,  on  the  identification and protection of their data, systems, and digital applications  (definition  of  rules,  roll-out  expertise  and advice, control of proper implementation);\n- \u25a0 the  Legal  Department,  which  identifies  legal  risks,  issues internal guidelines and Codes, and then oversees their proper implementation.  It  monitors  the  main  disputes  and  manages insurance.\n\nMoreover, the Group has a formal whistleblowing system at all its entities, whereby employees can anonymously alert an independent external service provider of any deviations from the Group Code of Conduct or applicable legislation. Employees can file  this  alert  in  their  own  language  by  telephone  or  through  the provider's  dedicated  website.  This  system  was  extended  at  the end  of  2021  to  all  internal  and  external  stakeholders  after consulting the employee representative bodies in France.\n\nAll  alerts  filed  are  processed  in  a  confidential  manner  under  the supervision of the Ethics Officer, in line with the principle that any employee  who  reports  something  in  good  faith  will  not  be sanctioned or have any retaliatory measures taken against them. This  principle  is  guaranteed  by  the  Group  and  reiterated  in  the Code of Conduct.\n\nThis  system  is  an  alternative  solution  to  the  usual  process  for reporting incidents within the entities: through managers and the Human Resources teams. It helps to accelerate the processing of reports  received,  and  thus  to  minimize  their  potential  impact  on individuals and the organization. Details of the indicators relating to  reports  received  and  alerts  are  provided  in  Chapter  5  on page 352.",

Risk management\n\nTo ensure the continued development of its activities, the Group must  actively  pursue  an  approach  to  prevent  and  manage  the risks  (especially  industrial  and  financial  risks)  to  which  it  is exposed.\n\nIn terms  of  the  Group's  business  activities,  industrial  risk management  must  essentially  focus  on  prioritizing  safety  and security while maintaining a permanent focus on the reliability of facilities.\n\nFinancial risk management requires strict control over investments,  combined  with  prudent  and  rigorous  practices regarding the accounting and financial aspects of the activities.\n\nThe Group's formal risk management approach aims to ensure:\n\n- \u25a0 the regular identification of the different forms of risk (industrial, financial  and  other)  encountered  by  the  Group  during  the pursuit of business activities, which are assessed according to both potential damage and probability of occurrence;\n- \u25a0 the assessment of the level of maturity of the management of each risk based on a common scale with respect to the quality of policies, organizational structures, processes and controls in place;\n- \u25a0 the progress of the main corrective action plans undertaken to mitigate  these  risks,  by  focusing  monitoring  activities  on  a limited number of priorities.\n\nThis  three-phase  risk  management  process  (mapping,  maturity level  assessment,  mitigation  plans)  covers  more  than  90%  of consolidated Group revenue.\n\n## 3. Internal control\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Principles  of Action  (https://www.airliquide.com/ sustainable-development/ethics/groups-principles-action), which reaffirm the Group's values with particular reference to stakeholders (shareholders, suppliers and customers, employees, etc.),  the  Group's  policies,  Codes,  and  procedures  are  grouped together  in  a  global  reference  manual,  the  BlueBook,  which  is available  to  employees  on  the  Intranet.  They  constitute  a  set  of internal control and risk management documents, which must be implemented by each entity included in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe  BlueBook  is  the  cornerstone  of  the  Group's  internal  control system, which aims to ensure that:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group's activities and the conduct of its employees:\n- -comply  with  laws  and  regulations,  internal  standards  and applicable best practices,\n- -comply  with  the  objectives  defined  by  the  Company, especially  in  terms  of  risk  prevention  and  management policies,\n- -contribute to safeguarding the Group's assets;\n\n- \u25a0 to certain financial executives, in order to ensure the security of transactions and financial flows.\n\nThe  managers  of  the  various  Group  subsidiaries  exercise  their duties  under  the  control  of  the  Boards  of  Directors  and  in accordance with laws and regulations applicable in the countries where they operate.\n\nThe Risk Management Department within the Group Control and Compliance Department leads this approach using:\n\n- \u25a0 resources  dedicated  by  the  hubs,  World  Business  Units  and World  Business  Lines  to  manage  the  approach  in  their respective  scopes  of  responsibility  (under  the  supervision  of the  Boards  of  Directors  of  the  entities  concerned)  and  to provide a summary thereof;\n- \u25a0 the work of members of the Risk Committee that it coordinates (described on page 93).\n\nThe  Audit and  Accounts Committee  reviews Group  risk management based on presentations covering:\n\n- \u25a0 the progress of the approach (on an annual basis);\n- \u25a0 each  major  risk  management  system  based  on  a  multi-year program structured according to the challenges;\n- \u25a0 internal audit summaries of these risk management systems.\n\nEnvironmental and societal risks are reviewed by the Environment and  Society  Committee  (three  meetings  per  year),  which  also meets once a year in a joint session with the Audit Committee.\n\nFinally, an  annual  summary  of  risk  management  actions undertaken by the Group is presented to the Board of Directors; each  year  it  validates  the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee's provisional  program which is presented to it beforehand, as well as a list of subjects of strategic interest or with particular relevance that will be presented in a more specific manner.\n\n- \u25a0 all  financial  and  accounting  information  communicated  either internally or externally gives a true and fair view of the situation and  activity  of  the  Group  and  complies  with  prevailing accounting standards.\n\nGenerally, the Group's internal control system should help better master its activities, the efficiency of its operations and the efficient use of its resources. It also aims to prevent errors and frauds.\n\nAs with other 'assurance systems', it cannot provide an absolute guarantee that the Group's objectives will be met.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  pursued  the  actions  undertaken  in  previous years,  with  all  material  Group  entities  and  shared  service platforms (representing over 90% of consolidated Group revenue), reviewing  the  appropriateness  of  their  internal  control  system  in relation  to  the  Reference Framework for internal control and risk management  systems.  These  entities  also  implemented  actions aimed  at  improving  their  control  system  in  terms  of  annual guidelines  defined  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  by  the  hubs  and World  Business  Units,  the  Group  Control  and  Compliance Department and the Finance Department. The latter two together organize  these  improvement  measures  and  report  on  their progress to the Group's Executive Management then to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are regularly brought to the attention of Executive Management, the Ethics and Compliance Committee and the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## RECENT MEASURES AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE SYSTEM\n\nIn 2021, the Group continued its measures to improve the quality of  its  internal  control  and  risk  management  system,  with  in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 in terms of industrial safety:\n- -created  in  2020,  the  Industrial  and  Safety  Committee, chaired  by  a  member  of  the  Executive  Committee,  meets every two months to better learn from incidents across the Group. This Committee helps strengthen the Group's safety performance  and  the  management  of  certain  industrial risks. Industrial departments from all activities participate in this Committee;\n- \u25a0 in terms of governance:\n- -the  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  monitored  the progress  of  programs  covering  prevention  of  corruption, competition law, export control, protection of personal data\n- (GDPR)  and  the  Vigilance  Plan.  The  Committee  notably reviewed the update of the Code of Conduct and the topics related  to  social  taxonomy  (classification  of  activities  from the perspective of human and social rights, with reference to international standards),\n- -in  terms  of  the  duty  of  vigilance,  the  launch  in  2020  of  a strategy  aimed  at  improving  the  Group's  measures  in  this field, in terms of both the regulatory framework and also the expectations of third parties;\n- \u25a0 in terms of internal control : under the supervision of the Group Internal  Control  Department,  several  awareness-raising  and training  initiatives  on  internal  control  issues  have  been  held, drawing on the network of Group internal controllers;\n- \u25a0 in  terms  of  digital  security  and  the  management  of  major crises:  the  continuation  of  the  project  aimed  at  defining  and then  rolling  out  cyber  business  continuity  plans  across  the Group;\n- \u25a0 in terms of human resources management: with the increasing digitalization  of  activities,  the  Air  Liquide  University  offered again  two  virtual  training  campuses  covering  six  themes: Management  &  Leadership,  Sales  &  Marketing,  Operational Excellence,  Innovation,  Climate  &  Energy  Transition  and  HR professionals;\n- \u25a0 in response to the health crisis and the accompanying changes to organizational structures, the continuation of the global 'next normal' project  to  support  this  shift  in  working  methods.  This tool allows managers to take ownership of this new framework including  remote  team  management,  a  structured  remote working  policy,  the  design  of  workspaces,  and  an  in-depth review of our interaction with our customers and patients.\n\n## 4. Financial and accounting information\n\nIn  order  to  guarantee  the  quality  and  reliability  of  financial  and accounting information produced, the Group primarily relies on a set of accounting principles and standards, as well as a consistent accounting and management reporting system and feeds both the Group  statutory  consolidation  process  and  the  management analysis that is under the responsibility of independent departments, which report to the Finance Department.\n\nThe Group accounting manual, which includes the Group financial policy, defines the accounting rules and principles as well as the consolidation methods  applicable and states the formats applicable for reporting financial and accounting information. This manual is regularly updated by the Finance Department with the amendments to IFRS or their interpretations.\n\nManagement  and Accounting  Reports  are  each  prepared  under the responsibility of independent but interactive departments that follow identical methods and principles:\n\n- \u25a0 this independence allows for the enhancement of information and analysis through the use of complementary indicators and data, particularly those which are specific to each business;\n- \u25a0 the  fact  that  these  bodies  are  interactive  provides  for  better control  of  the  reliability  of  information  through  the  systematic and regular reconciliation of data.\n\nThe reports primarily include:\n\n- \u25a0 monthly management reporting, known as the 'Monthly Flash Report',  that  provides  information  on  revenue  and  the  main financial indicators: income  statement,  cash  flow  from operating  activities,  net  debt  and  the  amount  of  investments authorized and committed;\n- \u25a0 quarterly  reporting,  known  as  the  'Management  Control Report',  which  provides  details  of  the  primary  items  of  the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement;\n- \u25a0 a  quarterly  'variance'  analysis  report  to  assess  the  various components of the change in operating income recurring.\n\nThese three documents are compiled by each management entity according to a predefined yearly timetable.\n\nThey are systematically  accompanied by comments on activities drawn  up  under  the  supervision  of  the  entity's  Chief  Executive Officer, and are consolidated at Group level with a breakdown for each hub and business:\n\n- \u25a0 quarterly reporting for accounting consolidation is compiled by each  reporting  entity  which,  in  addition,  must  provide  (on  a semi-annual basis) information on off-balance sheet commitments that include in particular:\n- -energy purchasing,\n- -financial guarantees and deposits,\n- -all other contractual commitments.",

This department  prepares  the  consolidated  data  and  works  in conjunction with the Operations Control Department, whose duty it is to analyze and comment on the results, identify and explain any differences  with  respect  to  forecasts,  and  update  said  forecasts. Meetings are organized each month with the heads of hubs and clusters (groups of countries) to clarify these analyses.\n\nAs part of the scope of the monthly Group Performance Steering Committee,  a  rolling  forecast  for  the  rest  of  the  current  year  is systematically presented by the Finance Department, in order to identify,  when  applicable,  any  differences  with  respect  to  yearly targets and take the necessary steps.\n\nIt  also  relies  on  audits  carried  out  by  the  Group  Control  and Compliance Department, with which it has regular contact.\n\nThe quality and reliability of financial and accounting information is also  based  on  high-performance  transactional  systems  (such  as Enterprise Resource Planning - ERP), coupled with modern and secure  Group  consolidation  and  Business  Intelligence  tools.

Property damage and business interruption\n\nGroup property and business interruption are covered by property and  casualty  insurance  policies  underwritten  in  each  country  in which  the  Group  operates.  Almost  all  of  these  policies  are integrated into an international program.\n\nThese policies, which are generally of the 'All Risks' form, cover fire,  lightning,  water  damage,  explosions,  vandalism,  impact, machinery breakdown, theft and, depending on the country and in limited amounts, natural disasters.\n\n## 2. Civil liability\n\nIn  terms  of  civil  liability,  the  Group  has  global  coverage  which covers all of its businesses under an umbrella policy, underwritten in  France,  which  covers  both  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries beyond any local coverage provided for the subsidiaries.\n\nThis policy covers the liability of Group companies for any damage they might cause to a third party in the course of doing business (operational risk) or arising from their products (product risk).\n\n## 3. Captive reinsurance\n\nA portion of property damage and business interruption risk is kept by  the  Group  via  a  captive  reinsurance  company,  which  also participates  among  other  things  in  the  coverage  of  the  Group's civil liabilities as well as in the coverage of goods transported.\n\nBusiness interruption following a claim for damage is covered by insurance  for  most  production  sites  under  these  same  policies. The coverage period for business interruption is 6 to 24 months. Deductible  amounts  are  correlated  to  the  activity  of  the  sites. Insurers conduct regular visits at the main industrial sites for risk prevention purposes.\n\nThe  coverage  amount  underwritten  exceeds  500  million  euros. Coverage is built on several overlapping insurance lines. and each line  has  been  underwritten  for  a  given  amount  with  several insurers sharing the risk. Beyond the first line, the upper lines pick up the excess risk from the lower lines.\n\nEach foreign  subsidiary  has  its  own  policy  covering  damages  to third  parties  incurred  through  its  businesses  or  products.  The amount insured for each subsidiary in its policy depends notably on the amount of its revenue and on its activities.\n\nThis captive reinsurance company covers, for the 2021 fiscal year, claims of up to a maximum of 44 million euros with sub-limits per claim adapted to the nature of the claim. Beyond these amounts, risks are transferred to third-party insurers. Their management is entrusted  to  a  captive  manager  approved  by  the  competent authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  plan  must  include 'reasonable  vigilance  measures  to  identify  the  risks  and  prevent severe  impacts  on  Human  Rights  and  fundamental  freedoms, health and safety of persons and on the environment' which may result  from  the  activities  of  the  Group  and  its  subsidiaries,  and those of suppliers or subcontractors with whom Air Liquide has an established  commercial  relationship.  This  obligation  is  based  on five measures:\n\n- \u25a0 risk mapping (identification, analysis, prioritization);\n- \u25a0 procedures  to  regularly  assess  the  situation  of  subsidiaries, suppliers and subcontractors;\n- \u25a0 appropriate actions to mitigate risks or prevent severe impacts;\n- \u25a0 an alert mechanism that collects reporting of potential or actual risks;\n- \u25a0 a  monitoring  scheme  to  follow  up  on  the  measures implemented and assess their effectiveness.\n\nAir Liquide complies with the requirements of the Law on the duty of  vigilance  by  publishing  a  Vigilance  Plan,  whose  content  is shown below, that presents the various measures implemented for each stake: Human Rights and fundamental freedoms (paragraph 2), the health and safety of individuals (paragraph 3), and the environment (paragraph 4). As specific measures apply to the  management  of  suppliers  and  subcontractors,  the  risks, procedures and measures implemented in this regard are set out in  paragraph  5.  Two  measures,  risk  mapping  (paragraph  1)  and the  setup  of  an  alert  mechanism  and  collection  of  reports (paragraph  6),  apply  transversally  to  all  three  stakes  and  are presented  independently  to  facilitate  their  reading.  The  effective implementation  report  for  the  year  2021  is  integrated  into  the Vigilance  Plan,  in  particular  through  operational  illustrations  and monitoring indicators.\n\nAir  Liquide  strives  to  be  a  leader  in  its  industry  and  of healthcare,  deliver  long-term  performance  and  contribute  to sustainability. The  Group's  customer-centric  transformation strategy aims at profitable, steady and responsible growth over the long term. It relies on operational excellence, selective investments, open  innovation  and  a  network  organization implemented by Air Liquide worldwide in 75 countries. Through the commitment  and  the  inventiveness  of  its  66,400  employees  in responding to challenges in energy and environmental transition, in healthcare and in digitization, the Group focuses on increasing value creation for all its stakeholders.\n\nThis  Vigilance  Plan  applies  to  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  and  all  Group subsidiaries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STEERING AND GOVERNANCE OF THE DUTY OF VIGILANCE\n\nAs an extension to the Group's commitment to subjects relating to the duty of vigilance, Executive Management decided to create in 2020  within  the  Group  Control  and  Compliance  Department  a function  dedicated  to  strengthening  the  coordination  of  these matters.  Today,  two  people  oversee  the  implementation  of Air  Liquide's  vigilance  approach.  Their  responsibilities  notably include  coordinating  the  structure  and  content  of  the  Vigilance Plan to better meet the expectations of the Group's stakeholders and  to  issue  recommendations  to  the  various  departments involved. Progress is regularly monitored by Executive Management.\n\nThe  Procurement,  Group  Control  and  Compliance  (including  in particular Ethics, Risk Management, Digital Security and the duty of vigilance), Sustainable Development, Legal, Human Resources, and  Safety  and  Industrial  System  Departments  participate  in monitoring the actions and the drafting of this Vigilance Plan.\n\nThe  departments  responsible  for  duty  of  vigilance  stakes  (e.g. Human  Resources,  Safety  and  Industrial  System,  Procurement) have  their  own  internal  steering  bodies,  including  operational representatives.  These  bodies  meet  regularly  to  monitor  the actions implemented and performance through indicators.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee, which widened its scope in  June  2020  and  now  includes  the  duty  of  vigilance,  monitors progress regarding the Vigilance Plan. It brings together the Group Control  and  Compliance,  Sustainable  Development,  Legal  and Human  Resources  Departments  as  well  as  a  representative  of operational functions who is a member of the Group's Executive Committee and meets at least twice a year and more often when required.  In  2021,  the  Committee  continued  its  review  of  the progress of the mission related to the duty of vigilance.\n\nThe Environment and Society Committee is one of the Board of Directors' special committees dedicated to societal and environmental responsibility issues. This Committee was created in 2017; it includes three members and meets at least three times a  year.  In  2021,  it  continued  to  supervise  the  roll  out  of  the Vigilance Plan in two sessions.",

This  commitment  is  reiterated  in  the  general statement of the Principles of Action, which were adopted in 2006 and  revised in 2016.  These  Principles  are  shared  with all  employees  and  are  available  on  the  Group's  website  (https:// www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ethics/groupsprinciples-action).  Air  Liquide  is  committed  to  its  customers  and patients, shareholders, employees, local communities, its suppliers and  partners.  The  Group  is  also  committed  to environmental protection and sustainable development.\n\nAs a complement to these Principles of Action, the Group has also adopted a Code of Conduct, whose update in 2021 will be rolled out in the Group's subsidiaries in 2022. This Code of Conduct is available  on  the  Air  Liquide  website  (https://www.airliquide.com/ sustainable-development/ethics). The Code's main areas of focus are covered in the following three chapters:\n\n- \u25a0 'Acting with Care' which deals with the themes of protection of people and assets;\n- \u25a0 'Acting  with  Integrity  and  Transparency'  which  illustrates  in particular  the  expected  behavior  in  terms  of  prevention  of corruption, respect for fair competition rules and transparency of information communicated to the public;\n- \u25a0 'Acting Responsibly' which describes the commitments of the Group  and  its  employees  to  protect  the  environment  and Human Rights as well as their contribution to the community.\n\nThis Code provides employees with a framework for reflection and tools  to  adopt  the  expected  behaviors.  The  alert  mechanism  is also  presented  in  an  educational  manner  and  recalls  all  the protections granted to whistleblowers (paragraph 6).\n\n## INITIATIVES IN FAVOR OF THE DUTY OF VIGILANCE\n\nIn  line  with  its  growth  trajectory,  and  with  performance  and sustainability at the core of its strategy, Air Liquide announced on March 23, 2021 strengthened sustainability objectives to ACT for a sustainable  future.  The  Group's  commitment  is  to  make  a meaningful difference, with a plan based on three dimensions:\n\n- \u25a0 Abatement of CO2 emissions for a low-carbon society;\n- \u25a0 Care for patients;\n- \u25a0 Trust  as  the  base  to  engage  with  employees,  and  to  build  a best-in-class governance.\n\nSome  of  these  commitments  contribute  to  the  prevention  and mitigation of the risks identified in the mapping (paragraph 1) and are  more  fully  described  in  this  Vigilance  Plan  (in  particular  in paragraphs 2.3 and 4.3).\n\nAir Liquide adheres to several initiatives contributing to the duty of Nations Global Compact (UN Global Compact, https://\n\nvigilance  stakes.  The  Group  has  been  a  signatory  of  the  United www.unglobalcompact.org/participation/report/cop/create-andsubmit/active/458878) since 2014, and has committed to sustainably  adopt  the  ten  principles  relating  to  Human  Rights, international  labor  standards,  the  environment  and  the  fight against corruption in the Group's strategy and operations. Within the Global Compact France network, the Group participates in the Human Rights Workgroup which allows its members, of all sizes and from all  sectors,  to  share  experiences  and  expertise  on  the\n\nmanagement of Human Rights risks.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  also  a  signatory  of  the  Responsible  Care \u00ae Global Charter,  an  initiative  of  the  International  Council  of  Chemical Associations (ICCA, https://icca-chem.org/wp-content/ uploads/2020/09/Signatories-of-RC-Global-Charter.pdf) which aims  to  improve  global  performance  in  the  chemical  industry  in terms of health, safety and the protection of the environment.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  joined  the  association  'Businesses  for human  rights'  ('Entreprises  pour  les  droits  de  l'homme',  https:// www.e-dh.org/) in May 2021. This multisectoral association brings together  24  international  companies  and  provides  a  forum  for reflection  and  exchange  of  good  practices  to  better  understand and  integrate  Human  Rights  and  duty  of  vigilance  issues  within Air Liquide.\n\nThe  Group  also  takes  part  in  several  initiatives,  such  as associations  or  working  groups,  relating  to  a  specific  stake contributing to the duty of vigilance. For instance, Air Liquide is a member of the French Observatory for Sustainable Procurement (ObsAR, https://www.obsar.asso.fr/) and of the 'Enterprises for the Environment'  association  ('Entreprises  pour  l'Environnement, EpE',  http://www.epe-asso.org/),  for  which  it  chairs  the  Climate Change Commission.\n\nLastly, through its activities, its engagement and its environmental and social  actions, Air  Liquide  contributes  to  certain  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that the United Nations has set up to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and guarantee prosperity for all by 2030. To illustrate the Group's contribution, the appropriate actions  to  mitigate  risks  or  prevent  severe  impacts,  described  in paragraphs 2.3, 3.3 and 4.3, are associated with the corresponding SDGs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY AND SUMMARY FOR THE YEAR 2021\n\nSince 2018, Air Liquide has assessed the duty of vigilance risks. Risk identification process is carried out regularly and takes both local characteristics and emerging issues into account. The risks as  well  as  the  level  of  maturity  of  their  management  are  first assessed  by  the  clusters  (groups  of  countries)  according  to  the double criterion of potential damage and probability of occurrence. A summary of this assessment is reviewed at the Group level with the  help  of  experts,  in  particular  for  safety,  security,  climate  and water management-related subjects and is then presented to the Group Risk Committee.\n\nIn  2021,  the  result  of  the  mapping  of  duty  of  vigilance  risks includes changes reflecting:\n\n- \u25a0 a better classification of the risks associated to each stake;\n- \u25a0 the  integration  of  risks,  which  appeared  to  be  salient  in Air Liquide's activities, such as risks related to care coverage or the protection of personal data.\n\nThe summary of this mapping includes the following risks:\n\n| Duty of vigilance stakes              | Associated risks                                                                             |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Human Rights and fundamental freedoms | Labor relations Discrimination Well-being at work Care coverage Protection of personal data  |\n|                                       | Worker safety (to protect them from work-related accidents)                                  |\n|                                       | Process safety                                                                               |\n| Health and safety of individuals      | Road safety                                                                                  |\n| Health and safety of individuals      | Product safety                                                                               |\n| Health and safety of individuals      | Security of individuals (to protect them against external threats including  malicious acts) |\n| Environment                           | Climate (greenhouse gas emissions, physical impact)                                          |\n| Environment                           | Water management (withdrawal and consumption, quality)                                       |\n\nDetails of risks by stake are presented in paragraphs 2.1, 3.1, and 4.1.\n\n## 1.2.   EVOLUTION OF THE METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH TO RISK MAPPING\n\nThe risk mapping methodology underwent changes starting in the second half of 2021 in order to refine the identification of salient risks concerning the duty of vigilance. This approach is based on principles advocated by international standards such as the United Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights  and the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development (OECD)  Due  Diligence  Guidance  for  Responsible  Business Conduct.\n\nThe  first  step  consists  of  identifying  a  universe  of  risks  that Air Liquide's activities could cause to people and the environment. Risk scenarios were determined for each duty of vigilance stake, in  particular  on  the  basis  of  internationally  recognized  Human Rights. In terms of Human Rights and fundamental freedoms and health and safety of persons, the different categories of individuals who may be affected are taken into account in this identification: Air Liquide employees and external staff present on its sites, local communities, customers and their employees, patients, end users, shareholders and other third parties. The departments responsible for duty of vigilance stakes contributed to the definition of this risk universe.\n\nThe second step consists of analyzing and prioritizing the risks in order to determine the most salient ones, that is to say the most severe potential negative impacts that Air Liquide's activities could cause  to  people  and  to  the  environment.  This  assessment  is carried  out  taking  into  account  two  dimensions:  Air  Liquide's activities  and  the  countries  in  which  the  Group  operates.  The salience of the risks is assessed on the basis of two criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 the  severity,  by  determining  which  impacts  would  be  most significant in terms of gravity, scope and irremediability;\n- \u25a0 the  probability,  by  assessing  the  likelihood  of  the  risk materializing.\n\nThis  assessment  is  supplemented  by  monitoring  to  identify countries and issues of interest to external stakeholders.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  a  test  of  this  approach  began  with  the Electronics  business  line.  The  first  results  will  be  used  to determine  the  relevance  of  the  methodology  and  to  revise  it  if necessary before deploying it to other activities.",

        "page_content": "Vigilance Plan\n\n## 2. Human Rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nAir Liquide respects and promotes Human Rights in its operations around  the  world.  The  Group  strongly  believes  that  all  persons should  be  treated  with  respect  and  dignity  and  that  companies should play a role in protecting these fundamental Human Rights. Air Liquide shares the principles laid down in the International Bill of  Human  Rights,  the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO) Declaration  on  Fundamental  Principles  and  Rights  at  Work,  the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) as well as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These promote an ethical and responsible approach by  companies  in  their  activities  and  professional  relations,  in particular  in  terms  of  Human  Rights,  by  encouraging  the implementation of due diligence procedures.\n\n## 2.1.   RISK MAPPING\n\n## 2.1.1.  Risks related to labor relations\n\nAir  Liquide  contributes  to  economic  and  social  growth  in  the 75  countries  where  it  operates  through  its  technical,  industrial, medical  and  economic  activities.  The  Group  therefore  identifies the  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  in  particular  in  terms  of working conditions and freedom of association.\n\n## 2.1.2.  Risks related to discrimination\n\nAir Liquide operates businesses with high technological content in a  large  number  of  countries  with  different  cultures.  Challenges relating  to  discrimination  mainly  with  regard  to  gender  equality (gender disparity, in particular in technical or expert occupations), disability,  origin,  religion  or  age  could  affect  employees  of  the Group or of its partners.\n\n## 2.1.3.  Risks related to well-being at work\n\nThe  work  environment  is  characterized  by  the  accelerated evolution  of  society  and  the  economy,  with  digitization,  rapid technological development and new business models. An intense workload can create psychosocial risks  such  as  stress,  work-life imbalance  and  thus  affect  the  well-being,  health  and  level  of engagement of Group employees.\n\n## 2.1.4.  Risks related to care coverage\n\nWhile all Air Liquide employees have care coverage in accordance with  local  regulations,  disparities  between  countries  could  create inequitable situations within the Group. In addition, local standards may,  in  some  cases,  not  be  sufficient  to  offer  adequate  and  fair social protection to employees.\n\n## 2.1.5.  Risks related to the protection of personal data\n\nPersonal  data  can  be  used  dishonestly  in  order  to  infringe  the privacy,  rights  and  property  of  individuals,  or  for  the  purposes  of discrimination. The people most likely to be exposed to these risks in  the  context  of Air  Liquide's  activities  are  the  1.8  million  home healthcare  patients  treated  by  Air  Liquide,  the  more  than 500,000 individual shareholders and the 66,400 Group employees.\n\n## 2.2.   REGULAR ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES\n\n## 2.2.1.  Risks related to labor relations\n\nOne of  the  pillars  of  the  Human  Resources  strategy  is  to  boost engagement  and  employability  of  the  employees  to  enhance performance.  To  achieve  this,  relations  with  social  partners  are crucial. They allow for the creation of a positive work environment. In light of local regulations, situation and needs, each Group entity defines,  in  agreement  with  the  employee  representative  bodies, where  they  exist,  the work  organization that  will  promote engagement and performance. Each year, the share of employees who have access to a dialogue structure with the management is reported by the entities. Formal dialogue structures (e.g. employee representative  bodies),  equivalent  informal  structures,  or  other forms  of  direct  dialogue  with  the  management  of  the  entity  are taken into account in this assessment.\n\n## 2.2.2.  Risks related to discrimination\n\nOne of  the  pillars  of  the  Human  Resources  strategy  consists  in building  an  inclusive  and  collaborative  organization  capable  of addressing the challenges of a continuously changing world.\n\nTo  assess  and  manage  discrimination-related  risks,  Air  Liquide rolled  out  in  the  past  a  policy  based  on  four  cornerstones:  age, gender,  disability  and  nationality.  To  cover  the  various  forms  of diversity  and  promote  a  more  inclusive  culture,  Air  Liquide  is changing  its  policy,  striving  to  fight  against any  form  of discrimination .\n\nDiversity  is  a  priority  of Air  Liquide's  Human  Resources  strategy and policy and the Group considers it as a source of dynamism, creativity  and  performance.  It  is  a  fundamental  element  of  the organization, in terms of both professions and employees, and it drives  Air  Liquide's  long-term  performance.  Established  at  the Group level, this policy is then applied locally in the subsidiaries.\n\nObjectives at the Group level include enhancing diversity among managerial  staff  to  better  value  the  various  cultures  on  which Air Liquide is built and to improve gender equality. In this respect, quantified  gender  equality  targets  have  been  set  for  the  Group. The  local  entities  carried  out  an  assessment  of  the  current situation to define an objective at the cluster (group of countries) level and thus contribute to the overall objective.\n\nAt  the  entity  level,  the  objective  is  to  have  teams  composed of employees who are representative of the country in which they work. Therefore, each entity is responsible for implementing action plans  specific  to  the  country  and  its  legal  framework  regarding various  forms  of  diversity  (race,  origin,  disability,  religion,  sexual orientation etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risks related to well-being at work\n\nAir  Liquide  has  launched a program called MyVoice to measure and  monitor  employees'  engagement .  This  program  aims  to assess and improve the experience and well-being of employees within  the  Group.  It  is  based  on  a  simple  concept:  listen, understand  and  act.  Since  the  launch  of  the  initiative  in  Asia Pacific  in  2019,  feedback  is  collected  annually  from  employees throughout  the  Group  to  obtain  a  better  understanding  of  their needs and expectations and to identify and introduce appropriate measures and, as a result, significantly increase their engagement.\n\nA  short  survey  covering  some  twenty  topics  is  sent  to  each employee with room to leave comments if desired. The questions cover areas such as safety, work-life balance, career development, inclusion, autonomy, professional development and trust  in  management.  Answers  are  completely  anonymous  and confidential  to  ensure  that  employees  are  free  to  express  their thoughts.  Results  are  collected  in  real  time,  aggregated  and analyzed in a central platform for the entire Group. All managers have access to their team's results, provided that the thresholds for ensuring respondents' confidentiality are met.\n\nSince  its  launch,  this  program  has  confirmed  Air  Liquide's strengths which contribute to employee engagement and identified opportunities, particularly in the context of the public health crisis (work-life  balance,  collaboration)  in  order  to  provide  appropriate responses as soon as possible.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, THE HOUSING CONDITIONS\n\n## OF EMPLOYEES WERE ASSESSED\n\nTo  assess  the  housing  conditions  of  employees  working  on the  Engineering  &  Construction  (E&C)  site  in  Ras  alKhaimah, a visit to the housing was carried out in 2021 by the E&C  Human  Resources  Department.  For  instance,  the verifications  focused  in  particular  on  space  management, sleeping arrangements, sanitary facilities and common living areas. The results of this assessment show that the housing conditions  meet  the  standards  defined  by  the  International Labour Organization (ILO) in this area.\n\n## 2.2.4.  Risks related to care coverage\n\nThese  risks  are  linked  to Air  Liquide's  presence  in  75  countries with a variety of social protection systems .\n\nA  team  within  the  Human  Resources  Department  was  set  up  in 2020  to  organize  a  survey  among  its  correspondents  in  all  the entities.  The  resulting  form  containing  about  10  questions  was designed to better understand the level of care coverage existing in the entities.\n\nIn 2021, an in-depth assessment was performed in addition to the survey to:\n\n- \u25a0 map the existing social benefits;\n- \u25a0 identify the contrasting situations between countries;\n- \u25a0 assess the deviations from market standards and thus define a common basis of care coverage to best meet the concerns of employees.\n\nFollowing  this  assessment,  Air  Liquide's  commitment  focused primarily on life insurance, health coverage and new measures in favor  of  maternity  leave.  This  commitment  is  described  below  in paragraph 2.3.4.\n\n## 2.2.5.  Risks related to the protection of  personal data\n\nThe level  of  risk  of infringement of the privacy of  individuals varies  according  to  the  nature,  sensitivity  and  scope  of  personal data entrusted to and necessary to Air Liquide in the course of its activities.\n\nOperating entities describe the personal data they own or use and the appropriate protection measures. The analysis of this risk and the  corresponding  security  measures  are  validated  during  the creation of or implementation of major changes to the processing of  personal  data  (in  particular  when  revising  the  operational processes or IT tools supporting them).\n\nThe points evaluated during the analysis include:\n\n- \u25a0 the  nature  of  the  personal  data  (for  example  patient  health data,  asset  and  financial  data  of  shareholders,  family  or financial data of employees);\n- \u25a0 the purposes of the processing of personal data;\n- \u25a0 the functions that process personal data within Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 third  parties  to  whom  personal  data  may  be  entrusted  or transferred outside the Group;\n- \u25a0 the  possible  transfer  of  personal  data  outside  the  European Union.\n\nThis information as well as the protective measures are grouped together in the record of personal data processing activities.\n\n## 2.3.   APPROPRIATE ACTION TO MITIGATE RISKS OR PREVENT SEVERE IMPACTS\n\n## 2.3.1.  Risks related to labor relations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide is committed to meaningful labor relations in all of its subsidiaries. This may take different forms according to local regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  Europe,  the  European  Works  Council  has  29  employee representatives  from  12  countries.  It  was  renewed  in  2021  for  a term  of  four  years.  In  2021,  two  plenary  meetings  chaired  by  a member  of  the  Executive  Committee,  one  exceptional  plenary meeting to elect the new Council's Board members as well as four other  meetings  of  the  Council's  Board  members  were  held.  The main  themes  addressed  during  the  information  and  consultation meetings  are:  safety,  including  an  update  on  the  public  health crisis,  news  on  the  Group's  activities,  especially  in  Europe, financial  results,  energy  impacts,  digital  roadmap  in  the  industry, the  well-being  and  psychological  health  of  employees,  the processes and the organization of the Procurement function in the different  countries  where  Air  Liquide  operates.  For  security reasons, some meetings were held remotely or in hybrid mode.\n\nThe  reflections  on  psychosocial  risks  carried  out  during  the European Works Council meetings have resulted in the production of the 'Care & Perform' Charter described in the paragraph 2.3.3 below.\n\nIn France, the Group has sought to improve labor relations, using a  debate  and  project  development  approach  as  part  of  a collaborative initiative. Two social seminars were held before the public  health  crisis  to  promote  working  together  (employee representatives/trade unions and management/HR) towards a new ambition.",

        "page_content": "## Vigilance Plan\n\nIn addition, 2020 and 2021 were largely devoted to managing the public health crisis together with employee representatives. These two  years  were  characterized  by  ongoing  and  strengthened dialogue with bodies such as the Social and Economic Committee, the  France  Group  committee,  the  European  Works  Council  and the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IN THE UNITED STATES, AIRGAS IS COMMITTED TO AN OPEN AND CONTINUOUS DIALOGUE WITH LABOR UNIONS\n\nAround  50  collective  agreements  have  been  negotiated covering  subjects  including  union  security,  management rights,  overtime,  health  and  wellbeing,  working  hours,  public holidays, paid vacations, pay raises, discipline and dismissal.\n\n## 2.3.2. Risks related to discrimination\n\nThe  Group's  roadmap  for  promoting  diversity  is  based  on  three pillars:\n\n- \u25a0 deploying  the  diversity  objectives  in  all  entities  and  ensuring the implementation of the related action plans;\n- \u25a0 improving  all  of  the  Group's  Human  Resources  processes  to reduce any bias and avoid all forms of discrimination;\n- \u25a0 promoting an inclusive culture to leverage the diversity of the teams.\n\nWithin  the  central  Human  Resources  organization,  a  team  leads diversity projects. Each hub and business line implements its own roadmap and actions to promote diversity with consideration to its own  situation.  In  this  context,  they  analyze  processes  and practices,  identify  potential  biases  and  implement  corrective measures  ('nudges')  to  limit  these  biases.  Thus,  during  the regular  reviews  of  talents  with  high  potential,  the  diversity  of profiles  is  taken  into  account,  with  the  aim  of  continuing  to increase diversity in the Group's key positions. This also serves as a way to promote the many cultures that make up the Group, and to strengthen gender equality.\n\nFinally,  promoting  an  inclusive  culture  also  contributes  to  a sustainable  approach  to  diversity.  Numerous  initiatives  are deployed  within  the  Group  to  this  end:  events,  learning opportunities,  mentoring,  networks  and  communities  for  different interest groups such as women's careers. One recent example is the  creation  in  2021  of  an  Inclusion  Movement  which  is  a development  opportunity  for  committed  employees.  For  seven months, 220 of these 'Inclusion & Diversity enthusiasts' designed and  carried  out  experiments  across  the  Group  using  innovative methods to promote inclusion in the work environment. These new approaches  are  disseminated  throughout  the  organization  in  a spirit of continuous improvement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE INAUGURATES A DIVERSITY MONTH\n\nCalled  'Diversity  Awareness  Month',  the  month  of  October 2021  was  an  opportunity  to  bring  together  more  than 1,300  Group  employees  as  part  of  10  sessions  dealing  in particular with the subjects of disability, the place of women in the community of technical experts, and the different forms of discrimination. Moreover, employees involved in the Inclusion Movement  were  able  to  share  what  they  learned  from  the 33 experiments carried out in previous months in their entities to introduce new inclusive practices into their daily lives.\n\n## Gender equality\n\nAs part of the sustainability objectives announced in March 2021, Air Liquide's ambition is to build upon TRUST as a base to engage with employees. The Group reaffirmed its commitment to promote inclusion and diversity, in particular through the following objective:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreach a 35% share of women among 'Managers and  Professionals'  by  2025.  This  objective  is  in line  with  the  results  obtained  over  the  past ten years which have enabled the share of female 'Managers and Professionals' within the Group to increase from 26% to 31%.\n\nAs  a  complement  to  its  sustainability  objectives,  Air  Liquide  is pursuing  another  ambitious  gender  diversity  objective  aimed  at reaching  25%  of  women  in  Executive  positions  by  2025,  versus 24% currently.\n\n## Equal pay\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn France, the law of September 5, 2018, known as the Loi avenir professionnel relating to the freedom to choose  one's  professional  future,  requires companies  with  more  than  50  employees  to implement  an  annual  mechanism  for  assessing gender  pay  gaps,  the  result  of  which  is  a  public social  score  for  the  Company  (out  of  100  points). The Professional Equality Index and the five related indicators  must  also  be  made  available  to  the Social and Economic Committee and be transmitted to the Labor administration.\n\nIn 2021, the Group's 31 companies with at least 50 employees in France  were  evaluated.  The  weighted  average  Professional Equality Index stands at 86.5/100, maintaining the trend compared to  2019 and 2020. The company L'Air Liquide S.A. published its fourth annual Index, reaching 97/100.\n\nOutside  of  France,  the  Group  initiated  a  common  process  to assess the gender pay gap by creating an internal index inspired by  the  French  one  and  adapted  to  Air  Liquide's  international presence. It was tested for the first time in 2019 for entities with more than 400 employees. The 2020 index, covering 61% of the Group's employees and calculated in 2021, was 82/100.\n\nThis index is calculated on the basis of four criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 differences  in  remuneration,  calculated  for  job  position categories;\n- \u25a0 differences in salary raise percentages;\n- \u25a0 salary raises during maternity leave;\n- \u25a0 gender diversity among the 10 highest remunerations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Subsidiaries  are  progressively  identifying  job  positions  according to these standards to allow for a better comparison at Group level and thus increase staff coverage.\n\n## Inclusion of disability - one of our priorities\n\nTo promote the inclusion of disability, Air Liquide intervenes at two levels:\n\n- \u25a0 with its employees, in particular via the HandivAirsity initiative;\n- \u25a0 with its suppliers, by developing relationships with companies which make their employment policies and practices inclusive of persons with disabilities (i.e. disability-inclusive companies).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLaunched  in  2017  at  the  European  level,  the HandivAirsity aims  to  encourage  diversity  by integrating  employees  with  disabilities  within  the teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Our  differences  make  our  performance'.  This  slogan  carries  a strong conviction. The inclusion of disability is fully in line with the policy to promote diversity within Air Liquide.\n\nThis  desire  is  not  new,  it  has  been  embodied  since  2007  in successive agreements in France which have advanced the policy of welcoming,  maintaining  and  promoting  the  professional development of people with disabilities. Air Liquide is committed to seeking  solutions  for  disabled  people  to  remain  in  employment. The  following  adjustments  are  planned  to  compensate  for disabilities in the workplace:\n\n- \u25a0 ergonomic  studies  and  adaptation  of  the  workstation  with regard to the capacities of the person;\n- \u25a0 specific equipment and tools;\n- \u25a0 adaptation  of  access  to  work  premises  and  specific  training services;\n- \u25a0 transportation and relocation assistance.\n\nAir Liquide raises awareness among the teams about the inclusion of  disability  in  order  to  facilitate  the  reception  and  professional integration  of  workers  with  disabilities  in  the  Group.  The  French subsidiaries have awareness-raising plans in order to strengthen the  level  of  information  for  all  actors  and  fight  against  any prejudices  that  may  persist.  They  participate  in  particular  in DuoDay,  a  day  where  they  welcome  a  person  with  a  disability paired with a volunteer professional.\n\nWithin  a  scope  covering  around  5,500  employees  based  in France,  a  fifth  Disability  agreement  for  a  period  of  three  years (2020-2022)  was  signed  at  the  end  of  2019.  The  aim  of  this agreement is to continue with measures already implemented in favor of people with disabilities and thus further improve the direct employment  rate  to  reach  4.2%  in  2022  vs  3.3%  in  2018.  The 2020 rate, calculated in 2021, is 4.35%.\n\nMore broadly  in  Europe,  other  concrete  actions  are  also  carried out to better respond to ideas in the operations and accelerate the recruitment  dynamic:  ambassador  campaign,  managers  working group, European 'Time to Act' hackathon in November 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE FRANCE INDUSTRIE PROMOTES THE INCLUSION OF DISABILITY\n\nAir  Liquide  France  Industrie  participates  in  Linkday,  a  forum dedicated to people with disabilities which takes place in the Grenoble  region.  It  also  participates  in  EDEW  (European Disability  Employment  Week)  by  hosting  awareness-raising caf\u00e9s,  sensory  workshops,  initiations  to  parasports  and conferences  on  its  sites.  This  entity  provides  a  toll-free number to help employees with disabilities in their procedures to gain recognition and adapt their vehicle appropriately.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeasures  have  also  been  taken  to  contribute  to the so-called 'indirect' employment of people with disabilities,  through  the purchase of goods and services  from  disability-inclusive  companies . This  sector  includes  organizations  for  the  social and  professional  integration  of  disabled  persons (ESAT),  self-employed  workers  with  disabilities (TIH) as well as adapted enterprises (EA).\n\n## IN FRANCE, AIR LIQUIDE COLLABORATES WITH AfB TO GIVE A SECOND LIFE TO ITS EQUIPMENT\n\nThe  Grenoble  Technologies  Campus  has  joined  forces  with AfB, the first adapted enterprise in the IT sector in Europe, for the  collection  of  IT  equipment.  The  equipment  is  then reconditioned,  upgraded and re-marketed by AfB. Thanks to its 160 employees, including 110 workers with disabilities, AfB offers a local social solution which also allows to improve the environmental  footprint  of Air  Liquide's  activities.  253  pieces of equipment were thus reused or recycled in 2021.\n\nIn  France,  in  2021, Air  Liquide  declared  2.4  million  euros  spent with  disability-inclusive  companies.  Since  2018,  Air  Liquide  has organized  four  annual  editions  of  the  'STPA  Business  Meeting' bringing  together  Air  Liquide  key  players  and  disability-inclusive companies to promote solidarity procurement. In 2021, the 'STPA Business Meeting,' co-hosted with the Handeco association, was held in digital format via presentations and speed-meetings in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. 180 Air Liquide employees and 10 disability-inclusive suppliers took part.\n\nIn  addition,  and  for  the  first  time  this  year,  a  European  Inclusive Procurement Forum brought together nearly 200 Group participants. During this Forum, examples of actions implemented in  Germany,  Spain  and  Switzerland  were  shared  to  increase awareness of and relations with disability-inclusive companies.\n\nAir Liquide was also present at the 'HandiHA' digital trade fair for the third consecutive year. This event provides the opportunity for meetings between contractors and disability-inclusive companies. This  year,  the  Group  Procurement  Director  took  part  in  a roundtable.",

Work  clothes,  which  are  now purchased,  are  cleaned  by  local  businesses  in  the  disability sector. After being launched in France at 40 sites, this project is now being rolled out in Spain, Italy, Poland, Portugal as well as  in  northern  countries.  Because  the  clothes  are  now purchased, they can be selected according to the impact of their life cycle, including the recycling of damaged clothes.\n\nThe  definition  and  understanding  of  the  different  forms  o discrimination vary depending on the national or local context. Th fight against discrimination must therefore be handled in a manne fitting  with  these  disparities.  This  is  why  actions  are  also  take locally to adapt the procedures implemented by the entities to figh other forms of discrimination. f e r n t\n\n## IN FRANCE, AIR LIQUIDE PROMOTES YOUTH EMPLOYMENT\n\nIn 2021, i-Lab, Air Liquide's foresight laboratory, conducted a social impact study in the industrial basin of the Lower Seine Valley  where  several  of  the  Group's  sites  are  located.  This study revealed that young people under 30 may be at risk of discrimination in accessing the labor market in this geographic area.  To  mitigate  these  risks,  Air  Liquide  contributes  to  the professional  integration  of  high  school  dropouts,  at  the Production  School  in  Le  Havre  area.  The  employees  share their  knowledge  and  experience  with  the  students  of  the boiler-making professional certificate  (CAP)  training  program and take them on tours of the industrial sites. During and at the end of the program, Air Liquide helps to integrate students with its service providers who require these types of skills.\n\nIn the United States, in order to develop a more inclusive culture, communities in networks called 'Business Resource Groups' (BRG) are created to promote diversity, in particular with regards to women,  veterans,  African-Americans,  LGBTQ+, Hispanic and Asian Americans.\n\nThe  Human  Resources  Department  of  Air  Liquide  US,  with  the help  of  the  BRGs,  has  created  a  'Diversity  &  Inclusion  Learning On Demand Toolkit' offering resources to employees to improve their knowledge  about  Diversity  &  Inclusion.  This  initiative supports  efforts  to  improve  behaviors  and  work  methods  that promote  a  culture  of  inclusion.  This  toolkit  contains  topics,  in  a variety  of  formats,  classified  by  level  of  knowledge  and  target audience, for example:\n\n- \u25a0 Inclusion and Belonging;\n- \u25a0 Allyship and Equality;\n- \u25a0 Gender Identity;\n- \u25a0 Courageous Conversations;\n- \u25a0 Walk in my shoes.\n\nFighting other forms of discrimination\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IN THE UNITED STATES, AIR LIQUIDE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE INCLUSION OF LGBTQ+ PEOPLE\n\nIn 2021, Air Liquide US received for the second consecutive year the 'Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality' distinction awarded by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, which rewards  companies  that  implement  policies  and  procedures that promote equality of LGBTQ+ people at work.\n\n## 2.3.3.  Risks related to well-being at work\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group  ensures  that  it  builds  a  performancefocused, attractive and collaborative work environment while also safeguarding the health and well-being of employees in the workplace.\n\nTo promote well-being in the workplace, focus groups have been created  with  the  aim  of  improving  employees'  work-life  balance. This approach meets employees' expectations on this subject.\n\nThese  practices  are  incorporated  into  principles  co-created  with European social partners. In 2019, the Group developed the 'Care &  Perform'  initiative,  in  partnership  with  the  European  Works Council,  whose  purpose  is  to  prevent  psychosocial  risks.  This initiative led to the drawing up of a charter based on principles of action relating to improvement of organization, workload and the work-life  balance  of  employees.  The  content  of  this  charter facilitated the signing of company agreements with social partners in order to offer new services to employees. In several European countries,  agreements  on  the  right  to  disconnect  and  work remotely have been concluded to meet specific needs and support the transition toward new working conditions.\n\nIn Italy and France, for example, an employee assistance program was  set  up  in  2021  and  offers  psychological  support  by specialized service providers.\n\nMore  generally,  within  the  context  of  changes  to  the  Group's organizational  models,  which  were  accelerated  by  the  covid-19 pandemic,  Air  Liquide  launched  a  global  project  in  2020  called 'Next Normal' to build on this shift in working methods.\n\nWith this project, entities can provide their employees with:\n\n- \u25a0 a new working framework including team management;\n- \u25a0 a structured remote working policy;\n- \u25a0 a reorganization of workspaces;\n- \u25a0 a framework for rethinking customer and patients interactions.\n\nTo  facilitate  the  roll  out  of  the  project,  Air  Liquide  developed  a reference  guide  in  2021.  First  shared  with  managers,  the  guide helps  the  entities  to  set  up  new  working  methods  based  on  the initial  global  experiences.  Working  groups  were  then  organized with employees in the entities to validate the undertakings.\n\nWith  the  MyVoice  program,  Air  Liquide  strives  to  offer  all employees  a  successful  professional  experience,  that  promotes listening and dialog, at every stage of their career with the Group. Paying close attention to the employee experience is a key factor in attracting, retaining and developing employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each  employee  was invited to walk 5,000 steps per day for five consecutive days. The objective  was  to  encourage  employees  to  take  time  for their  well-being,  as  their  work-life  balance  was  directly impacted  by  the  fully  remote  working  environment  during certain  periods  of  imposed  lockdowns.  In  return, Air  Liquide committed to make a donation to a humanitarian organization if the objective of 50 million steps was reached in one month. At the end of the month, the objective was exceeded.\n\n## 2.3.4.  Risks related to care coverage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of the sustainability objectives announced in March 2021, Air Liquide's ambition is to build upon TRUST  as  a  base  to  engage  with employees.\n\nOn this occasion, the Group committed to offer a common basis of care coverage to all employees by 2025.\n\nThis care coverage will guarantee:\n\n- \u25a0 a life insurance policy with an indemnity equivalent to a year's salary;\n- \u25a0 a health coverage including inpatient and outpatient care;\n- \u25a0 a minimum of 14 weeks paid maternity leave.\n\nFrom  May  to  September  2021,  the  entities  came  together  by country to assess the gaps in their current coverage and define a gradual plan to upgrade the situation by 2025.\n\nA team dedicated to this commitment has been set up within the Human Resources Department to steer deployment and measure progress within the Group each year.\n\n## 2.3.5.  Risks related to the protection of personal data\n\nIn  May  2018,  Air  Liquide  adopted  and  had  the  European  data protection  authorities  approve  Binding  Corporate  Rules  (BCR) which  embody  the  Group's  commitment  to  the  protection  of personal data. Considering European regulations to be among the most  protective  in  the  world,  Air  Liquide,  through  the  BCR, provides the same level of protection in all of its operating entities.\n\nThe BCR provide for:\n\n- \u25a0 the adoption of a personal data protection policy accessible to all  on  the  Group's  website  (https://www.airliquide.com/sites/ airliquide.com/files/2018/05/23/ air\\_liquide\\_bcr\\_global\\_privacy\\_policy.pdf);\n- \u25a0 the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who relies on  a  network  of  more  than  150  regional  or  local  Information Protection Coordinators (IPC) distributed throughout the Group (by  hub,  cluster,  activity  or  operating  entity)  to  steer  and coordinate actions to protect personal data;\n- \u25a0 the  signing  of  contracts  between  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  and  its subsidiaries which formalize the commitment of the subsidiaries to the BCR;\n- \u25a0 and the deployment of tools such as:\n- -records of personal data processing activities,\n- -initial employee training and refresher courses on the Code of Conduct given every two years,\n- -taking  into  account  the  protection  of  personal  data  by default and from the design stage of the processing,\n- -risk analyses regarding the protection of personal data,\n- -various  means  available  to  contact  the  DPO  and  IPC  to allow internal or external natural persons to make a request to  exercise  their  rights  and  report  any  personal  data protection violations.\n\nPersonal  data  processing  identified  as  the  most  critical  (for example,  processing  of  patients'  personal  data)  is  reviewed annually by internal experts.\n\nIn addition, the update of the Group's Code of Conduct, which will be  rolled  out  in  2022,  will  include  a  section  devoted  to  the protection of personal data.\n\n## 2.4.   MONITORING SCHEME OF MEASURES IMPLEMENTED AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS\n\nHuman Resources indicators are consolidated twice a year for all subsidiaries  included  in  the  financial  consolidation  scope.  The Human Resources Committee, represented by the Group's largest operational  departments,  meets  six  to  eight  times  a  year  to monitor measures implemented and assess their effectiveness.\n\n## 2.4.1.  Risks related to labor relations\n\nThe  Group  ensures  that  labor  relations  are  encouraged  and,  as part  of  this,  82%  of  Group  employees  had  access  to  a  dialogue structure in 2021.",

Risks related to the protection of personal data\n\nSince  May  2018,  regular  processes  have  been  measuring  the volume  of  requests  to  exercise  rights  and  of  possible  personal data violations and the contractual adherence of Group entities to BCR.  The  system  for  recording  requests  to  exercise  rights  and reporting  any  personal  data  protection  violations  is  presented  in paragraph 6 on the alert mechanism.\n\nIn  order  to  measure  the  level  of  maturity  of  the  Group's  entities with regard to the protection of personal data, a self-assessment questionnaire is gradually being rolled out within the Group. Most European entities started this process in 2021. It will be extended to  the  rest  of  the  European  entities  and  to  IT,  R&D  and Engineering  &  Construction  activities  in  2022  and  finally  to  the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Middle East and Africa hubs in 2023. This questionnaire covers:\n\n- \u25a0 the existence of a BCR adherence contract;\n- \u25a0 the  presence  of  a  local  representative  of  the  DPO  (the  local IPC  or  another  person  in  the  event  of  a  specific  obligation linked to the legislation of the country);\n- \u25a0 the  existence  of  the  records  of  personal  data  processing activities;\n- \u25a0 employee training;\n- \u25a0 protection analyses by design and by default, risk analyses;\n- \u25a0 the  process  for  exercising  rights  and  reporting  possible  data breaches;\n- \u25a0 contractual  clauses  with  third  parties  (in  particular  with subcontractors to which Air Liquide entrusts the processing of personal data on its behalf).\n\nThe questionnaires are reviewed and checked by the regional IPC and the DPO. The maturity of entities is assessed on a four-point scale and aggregated at the Group level.\n\nActivities related to the protection of personal data as well as the results  of  these  various  measures  are  presented  to  the  Digital Security  Committee,  to  the  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee, and  to  the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee  of  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nFinally, audits on the protection of personal data are carried out by the Group's Internal Audit department as part of the internal audit plan or at the request of the DPO.\n\n|                                                              | 2019   | 2020         | 2021               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|--------------------|\n| Exercise of rights  and alleged violations  of personal data | 57     | 34           | 56                 |\n| Number of subsidiaries  adhering to the BCR  \u207d \u1d43 \u207e           |        | - 351 of 399 | 341  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e  of 375 |\n| Maturity assessment  \u207d \u1d9c \u207e                                   | -      | -            | 2.74               |\n| Number of audits carried out                                 | 7      | 4            | 2                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Health and Safety/Security\n\nSafety and security are fundamental values for the Group and the 'zero accidents, on every site, in every region, in every entity' ambition remains a key priority. The Group, as a responsible industry player, is therefore committed to efficiently and under all circumstances reducing the exposure of its employees, contractors, customers, patients and suppliers to professional and industrial risks. This ambition was reaffirmed when the strengthened sustainability objectives were announced in March 2021.\n\nThe safety results for the past 30 plus years illustrate the long-term effectiveness of the Group's actions in this area.\n\n## 3.1.   RISK MAPPING\n\nIndustrial  risks  are  linked  to  the  various  industrial  products, processes  and  distribution  methods  implemented  by  the  Group. They are distributed over a large number of local production sites.\n\n## 3.1.1.  Risks related to worker safety\n\nOver and above the usual risks inherent in all industrial activities, Air Liquide's businesses entail more specific risks that may affect individuals.  Industrial  processes  and  road  transport  lead  to employee  exposure  to  the  corresponding  risks  which  are described in the following paragraphs.\n\nIn addition, industrial sites use a lot of motorized lifting gear which present specific risks in connection with handling (collision, falling packages,  etc.).  Training  and  qualification  are  thus  required  to operate them.\n\n## 3.1.2.  Risks related to process safety\n\nIndustrial risks must be factored in at the design phase of future installations.  During  the  construction  phase,  the  lack  of  a  strict accident  prevention  framework  would  affect  the  coordination among  the  various  stakeholders  and  expose  teams  to  risks  of accidents.\n\nCryogenics  is  used  to  separate  gases  by  distillation,  store  them and  transport  them.  This  very  low  temperature  technique  is connected with a risk of cryogenic burns from liquefied gases.\n\nLikewise,  high  temperature  techniques,  which  are  used  for instance in the production of hydrogen, particularly expose those involved to risks of fire or explosions.\n\nIn addition,  pressure  is  central  to  the  Group's  processes. Pressurized equipment is designed with safety devices, which limit the  risk  of  accidents  caused  by  an  uncontrolled  increase  of pressure.\n\n## 3.1.3.  Risks related to road safety\n\nEach  year,  delivery  vehicles,  sales  staff  and  technicians  travel hundreds of millions of kilometers. Non-compliance with the traffic regulations  or  the  lack  of  regular  maintenance  of  vehicles  would expose drivers and third parties to increased risks of accidents.\n\n## 3.1.4.  Risks related to product safety\n\nThe intrinsic properties of industrial and medical gases manufactured,  transformed  or  packaged  by  the  Group  classify them  in  the  hazardous  materials  category.  Their  use  is  safe provided that good practices and recommendations are complied with.\n\nBeyond the risks inherent to the intrinsic properties of gases, other risks must also be considered, such as:\n\n- \u25a0 the risk  of  faults  in  the  systems  supplying  gas  to  customers, which could lead to a disruption to supply, in terms of quality or volumes,  which  could  notably  have  an  impact  on  a  patient's health;\n- \u25a0 the  risk  of  possible  failure  to  comply  with  specific  standards and regulations, in particular in Healthcare, with the risk of noncompliance of products and services provided to patients.\n\n## 3.1.5.  Risks related to the security of individuals\n\nRisks related to the security of individuals are mainly triggered by business travel: security risks during trips to foreign countries, but also  public  health  risks  in  certain  countries  affected  by  'rare diseases'  or  with  medical  and  hospital  infrastructure  that  is considered 'at risk'.\n\nIn tangible terms, these risks concern all forms of travel and are related, for example:\n\n- \u25a0 before  departure,  to  the  lack  of  information  regarding  a destination country and the best practices to be implemented;\n- \u25a0 upon arrival, to recommendations relating to how to recognize the host and to means of transport;\n- \u25a0 during the trip, to the choice of accommodation and means of transport;\n- \u25a0 to  health  (and  food  safety)  recommendations  which  vary according to regions;\n- \u25a0 to physical security recommendations which vary according to the country and its political and social context;\n- \u25a0 to  information  regarding  the  available  means  for  seeking medical  advice,  a  consultation,  hospitalization,  or  even  a medical evacuation.\n\nThe same approach was therefore used for those traveling during the  global  public  health  crisis  due  to  the  covid-19  pandemic: information,  guidance,  travel  recommendations  and  measures adjusted for each individual and each country. The Group's duty to protect  its  employees  is  also  applied  in  the  same  way  to stakeholders  (service  providers  and  subcontractors)  when  they intervene at the request of Air Liquide, regardless of the country.\n\nOverall,  the risk  level  of  each  country is  decided  on  by  the Security  Department.  It  is  based  on  the  official  rating  of  five countries (France, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and Australia), coupled with an assessment by the global security service  provider  for  the  Group.  The  occurrence  of  serious  or repetitive events results in a review of the country's risk level. The final  validation  of  this  level  is  the  responsibility  of  the  country manager. In 2021, for the countries in which Air Liquide is present, three  are  classified  as  very  high  risk  (Nigeria,  Mali  and  Burkina Faso)  and  twelve  are  high  risk.  The  others  are  split  between moderate and low risk.",

        "page_content": "## Vigilance Plan\n\nFinally, the protection  of  sites against  malicious  attacks contributes to the protection of the individuals who work at these sites,  as  well  as  that  of  local  residents  and  customers.  Any intrusion at a site, regardless of the motive (simple theft or an act of terrorism), creates a disturbance or major damage that will have an impact on the work of employees. Depending on the nature of the  offense,  the  act  committed  may  also  have  an  impact  on  the safety  of  local  residents,  or  customers  who  may  suffer  delivery problems.\n\n## 3.2.   REGULAR ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES\n\nTo  assess  and  manage these risks,  the  Group  has  an  Industrial Management System (IMS), which operates based on:\n\n- \u25a0 the  accountability  of  the  departments  of  the  various  Group entities for the effective implementation of this system;\n- \u25a0 the  issue  of  key  management  and  organizational  procedures that aim to ensure:\n- -compliance with standards and regulations,\n- -design management,\n- -industrial risk management,\n- -hygiene, health and environmental management,\n- -management of road safety,\n- -management  of  skills  (training,  qualifications  if  necessary, and more),\n- -the management of operating and maintenance procedures,\n- -the management of industrial procurement,\n- -change management,\n- -the analysis and treatment of incidents and accidents,\n- -the  dissemination  of  shared  technical  standards  within Group entities.\n\nThe IMS document base is continuously updated and enriched.\n\nThe Safety  and  Industrial  System  Department  and  the  Industrial Departments of  the  World  Business  Lines  supervise  and  control the implementation of the IMS, by notably relying on:\n\n- \u25a0 the  presentation  of  various  dashboards  designed  to  monitor performance in terms of safety;\n- \u25a0 process  audits  to  verify  the  implementation  conditions  and compliance of operations with IMS requirements;\n- \u25a0 thorough safety reviews prior to the start-up of any new facility to prevent any accidents due to a construction defect;\n- \u25a0 technical  audits  to  ensure  the  compliance  of  operations  with Group rules.\n\nThis  regular  assessment  of  industrial  risks  that  may  affect individuals  covers  all  Group  activities  in  all  geographic  regions. The frequency of these assessments is adapted to each subject: for  example,  monthly  safety  performance  reviews  or  an  annual review of technical audits. Other subjects require that assessments be carried out at specially adapted intervals, as for example in the case of the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe  Industrial  Management  System,  IMS,  institutionalizes  the methodical  'Plan  -  Do  -  Check  -  Act'  approach  which  is particularly essential in terms of safety of industrial processes.\n\nThe efforts made to carry out risk assessments are bearing fruit and  the  lessons  learned  from  incidents  are  being  used  to strengthen the safety barriers of the installations, thus preventing recurrent incidents.\n\nIn  terms  of  the security of  industrial  and  commercial  facilities, regular visits are carried out on site. The purpose of these visits is to  ensure  the  correct  application  of  the  processes  set  out  in  the document  base.  They  are  carried  out  in  each  region,  at  the initiative of the local entity or the geographic area concerned, and sometimes  with  the  participation  of  the  Security  Department.  A report is drawn up after each country visit and sent to the entity.\n\nGiven the limitation of international travel to exceptional situations, on-site security visits in 2021 were postponed to a future period. However, a remote security visit process has been developed to maintain this important time of sharing despite the current context. This  supports  the  actions  of  the  entity  security  managers  in  the field.  Based  on  feasibility  tests  carried  out  by  the  Security Department  in  France  and  Russia,  the  entities  are  now  able  to carry out these remote visits themselves, which will continue and supplement the system of on-site visits.\n\n## 3.3.   APPROPRIATE ACTION TO MITIGATE RISKS OR PREVENT SEVERE IMPACTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.3.1.  Risks related to worker safety\n\nAir Liquide relies on continuous actions to raise the awareness of its  teams  through  specific  training  in  the  awareness  and  the mitigation  of  industrial  risks  that  may  affect  individuals.  Not  only are all employees trained in relation to risks relating to their own business line, they are also, more generally, trained in the Group's safety culture.\n\nSince their creation in 2013, Air Liquide is committed to ensuring that its Life-Saving Rules are complied with at each site and at all times.  The  interpretation  and  meaning  of  each  rule  is  widely shared.  Non-compliance  with  one  of  the  Life-Saving  Rules  is  a serious violation, which, depending on the circumstance, may lead to sanctions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following  on  from  the  2020  edition,  this 2021 edition highlights certain initiatives already deployed by European  entities  to  strengthen  the  safety  culture  toward customers and patients, contractors and, internally, employees, in order to promote replication.\n\nIn addition, each employee working on an industrial site receives specific  training  and  qualification  courses  and  is  equipped  with personal protective equipment allowing them to perform their tasks in  the  best  conditions.  Collective  protective  equipment  is  also installed in the various workshops, if necessary.\n\nAs  identified  in  the  mapping,  two  risks  involve  particularly  high exposure  for  individuals: those  related  to process  safety  and road safety . Targeted action plans have been introduced for each of these risks more than 10 years ago, and certain measures were further reinforced about five years ago.\n\n## 3.3.2.  Risks related to process safety\n\nThe safety of industrial processes is a complex issue as, although rare,  incidents  can  lead  to  very  serious  consequences  with multiple fatalities. In order to ensure that operations efficiently take this  risk  into  account,  Air  Liquide  has  introduced  specific  action plans, the purpose of which are to control the most serious risks relating  to  production  processes.  They  have  been  assigned  the necessary  resources  (expertise  and  budgets)  and  follow  a roadmap.  Their  progress  is  regularly  monitored  by  the  Group's Executive Management.\n\n## IN FRANCE, AIR LIQUIDE COLLABORATES TO ENSURE BETTER MANAGEMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RISKS\n\nIn  2021,  the  UPSIDE-Boucles  de  Rouen  association  was created  by  HAROPA  Port,  fourteen  manufacturers  from  the Lower  Seine  Valley  basin  and  France  Chimie  Normandie, chaired by an employee of Air Liquide France Industrie (ALFI). This  person  also  chairs  this  new  association  which  aims  to improve  communication  with  elected  officials  and  residents concerning risks and industrial safety and thus promote good reflexes in the event of an industrial accident. The association strives  to  strengthen  collaboration  between  companies  to manage  industrial  risks  and  pool  resources,  for  instance  to purchase firefighting equipment.\n\n## 3.3.3.  Risks related to road safety\n\nAir Liquide delivers products to its customers and patients by road in  75  countries.  The  Group  relies  on  a  structured  program, reinforced in 2020, to mitigate these risks on the road; the main measures include:\n\n- \u25a0 equipping vehicles with technologies to assist drivers, to warn them in the event of danger or to protect them in the event of an accident. This is a rapidly changing field and Air Liquide is committed  to  providing  the  best  technologies  possible  to  its own  fleet  of  vehicles,  as  well  as  those  of  transport professionals working on its behalf. Around half of the vehicles are  already  equipped,  and  the  aim  is  to  reach  80%  in  the coming years;\n\n- \u25a0 continuously assess and audit compliance by operations with internal  requirements  set  out  in  the  reference  frame  that  was updated  in  2020.  This  reference  frame  is  related  to  both material and human factors and serves to:\n- -regularly raise awareness among professional and occasional drivers on safe behavior on the road,\n- -develop  the  role  of  expert  drivers  (in  driving  and  loading/ unloading operations) who mentor new drivers and serve as role models within their organization. Identified on the basis of technical criteria, these expert drivers actively contribute to  forging  the  driver's  safety  mindset  and  participate  in improving training and qualification processes.\n\nThe current  momentum should lead to further progress, building on the efforts made over the past five years.\n\n## IN THE UNITED STATES, AIRGAS EQUIPS THE TRUCKS WITH ON-BOARD CAMERAS\n\nIn  2021, Airgas  launched  a  three-year  program  to  gradually equip its entire truck fleet with a camera system aimed toward the road and toward the interior of the cabin. The objective is to quickly correct any risky driving behavior such as using the phone  while  driving  or  failing  to  give  way.  Support  with coaches thus helps drivers recognize the importance of safer driving habits and best practices to improve their performance.\n\nThis system also has an advantage for determining liability in the event of an accident: it provides factual information which enables  drivers  to  be  exonerated  from  all  liability  in  the accident, where applicable.\n\nThe Group is also attentive to accidents involving third parties on the road where an Air Liquide vehicle could be involved. Equipping vehicles with on-board technologies, such as rearview cameras to reduce  blind  spots,  for  example,  and  making  drivers  aware  of responsible behavior on the road will limit impacts on third parties on the road.\n\n## 3.3.4.  Risks related to product safety\n\nIn compliance with regulations in force, each gas storage device is equipped with a label showing, among other things, the name of the product and the associated risks.\n\nIn the particular case of gas cylinders, the color of the cylinder is different  depending  on  the  main  risk  of  the  gas  it  contains.  The safety data sheets present the risks of each of these gases. The cylinders are fitted with a cap protecting the valve which must be operated by hand and whose connections differ depending on the gas  in  order  to  avoid  any  incorrect  connection.  Their  storage  is regulated and must be done in a dedicated place.",

Risks related to the security of individuals\n\nTo  reduce  travel-related  risks,  Air  Liquide  applies  a  series  of measures aimed at protecting those traveling  for  the  duration  of their trip:\n\n- \u25a0 fact sheets for the countries with one of the three highest levels of risk summarizing the main recommendations to be aware of before departure; these are regularly updated by the Security Department;\n- \u25a0 all  travel  reservations  to  a  very  high  risk  or  high-risk  country are  subject  to  a  validation  process  by  an  employee's managers,  then  by  the  Security  Officer  of  the  geographic region in question, who may even prohibit the trip;\n- \u25a0 within each entity and group of entities, a head of security is responsible  for  updating  the  country  fact  sheets  and  specific recommendations  for  the  subsidiary's  employees,  expatriates and travelers;\n- \u25a0 the  reservation  tool,  which  monitors  trips,  informs  the  host entities of the arrival of Group employees, and provides, where necessary, updated information;\n- \u25a0 for the duration of their trip, travelers benefit from support from the  global  service  provider  who  informs  them  of  any  local situations, answers any questions and can arrange for medical support  (ranging  from  advice  by  telephone  to  medical evacuation by air).\n\nSince  the  beginning  of  the covid-19  pandemic, particular  care and  attention  were  paid  to  the  Group  employees,  as  well  as  to service providers acting on behalf of Air Liquide. Since February 2020, a crisis unit has been evaluating the situation on a weekly basis,  under  the  authority  of  the  Group  Human  Resources Director.  Over  the  months,  this  unit  has  drawn  up  various protocols  intended  for  all  the  Group  entities,  and  in  particular  in 2020, at a time when the recommendations of governments were sometimes lacking.\n\nIn  2021,  due  to  the  diversity  of  situations  by  continent  and  by country, a local approach and recommendations issued directly by the entities have been favored, in compliance with the legislative and  regulatory  framework  of  each  country,  and  following  the Group's instructions as much as possible.\n\nFinally,  an  ad  hoc  organization,  supported  by  the  Group's Procurement  Department,  has  for  18  months  facilitated  the purchase  of  personal  protection  masks,  and  of  other  necessary products  in  the  context  of  the  entities'  activities,  to  protect employees and thus meet the needs of the subsidiaries.\n\nThe site  protection policy  helps  protect  the  employees  and service providers who work there, as well as the people living near the  industrial  sites.  This  policy  relies  on  a  site  assessment process, followed by the measurement of the difference between the  current  level  of  protection  and  the  required  standard  and, finally, on the action plan required to reduce these differences. The fundamentals of our site protection policy include secure fencing, a  well-managed  access  process,  an  adapted  security  and surveillance  system,  and  finally  the  means  to  intervene  and respond in the event of an intrusion.\n\nAll  information regarding the security of employees and sites, as well as the pandemic, can be found on the Security intranet site. This site can be viewed by all employees worldwide.\n\n## 3.4.   MONITORING SCHEME OF MEASURES IMPLEMENTED AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS\n\nSubsidiaries report all safety and security events as they arise in the Group's reporting tool. This tool was replaced at the beginning of  2021  by  a  new  tool  that  improves  both  the  quality  of  the information reported and the monitoring of corrective action plans.\n\nEach  month,  every  event  reported  is  reviewed  by  a  team  of experts.  The  most  serious  events  are  analyzed  in  detail  and lessons  learned  are  shared  with  Group  entities  that  could  be potentially affected by similar situations.\n\nThe Industrial and Safety Committee is composed of the heads of the  five  Industrial  Departments  of  the  World  Business  Lines,  the Group  Head  of  Safety,  as  well  as  a  representative  of  the Engineering  &  Construction  and  Global  Markets  &  Technologies World  Business  Units.  Its  purpose  is  to  examine  industrial  risks and  safety  performance,  as  well  as  monitor  the  progress  of  the main  improvement  measures,  in  particular  those  relating  to  the greatest  risks  and/or  cross-divisional  measures.  The  Committee meets six to eight times a year and is chaired by a member of the Group's Executive Committee.\n\nThe evolution of safety performance of operations and their level of  compliance  with  IMS  requirements  are  regularly  monitored  by the  Executive  Committee  as  well  as  by  the  Environment  and Society Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As shown in the chart below, this frequency rate has gradually improved over the past twenty years. A sharp drop was observed in 2020 compared to 2019 linked to the different periods of lockdown due to the covid-19 pandemic. A slight increase appears in 2021 related to the strong pick-up in activity but it remains below the frequency rate of 2019, which was the lowest in 20 years. The evolution of the frequency rate highlights the steady progress in the maturity of teams on the subject of safety as well as the development of a safety culture within the Group.\n\n## LOST-TIME ACCIDENT FREQUENCY RATE OF AIR LIQUIDE EMPLOYEES (a) (b)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Number of lost-time accidents with at least one lost day per million hours worked by Group employees.\n- (b) Including Airgas since 2017.\n\nWith  regard  to  risks  related  to  road  safety,  there  was  a deterioration  in  performance  in  2021  compared  to  the  previous year.  The  lockdown  of  people  in  many  regions  in  2020  -  which temporarily  reduced  road  traffic  -  had  a  positive  impact  on  the Group's road safety performance. However, it should be noted that the frequency rate (number of serious road accidents with injuries, per million kilometers) in 2021 remains lower than in 2019.\n\nIn 2021, no Air Liquide employee or contractor died on the road. However, several accidents involving an Air Liquide vehicle, some preventable, unfortunately led to the fatality of third parties.\n\nThe  analysis  of  road  accidents  in  recent  years  has  highlighted certain  recurring  causes,  such  as  fatigue  or  distraction  while driving.  This  is  why  Air  Liquide  has  launched  key  initiatives  to support  behavioral  driving  changes  and  the  use  of  digital technologies  to  assist  driving,  which  are  gradually  improving  the safety  of  road  transport  (paragraph  3.3.3).  Despite  the  covid-19 pandemic, the deployment of these initiatives is continuing.\n\n## ROAD SAFETY: FREQUENCY OF PREVENTABLE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS WITH INJURIES (a)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Per million km driven by truck of over 3.5 tonnes.",

        "page_content": "## 4. Environment\n\n## 4.1.   RISK MAPPING\n\n## 4.1.1.  Climate-related risks\n\nIn order to address climate change, Air Liquide takes into account the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as expressed in assessment reports and special reports. The Group intends to play an active role in achieving the targets  set  out  in  the  Paris  Agreement,  which  defines  a  global framework  to  avoid  dangerous  climate  change  by  limiting  global warming to well below 2\u00b0C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C above  pre-industrial  levels.  The  IPCC  Special  Report  'Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C' published in 2018 indicates that achieving the Paris Agreement's objective of keeping the average temperature rise  below 1.5\u00b0C requires reaching carbon neutrality, on a global scale, by 2050.\n\nIn this context, as a responsible company, Air Liquide recognizes the importance and urgency of addressing climate issues. Based on these scientific facts, Air Liquide has developed its strategy to achieve  carbon  neutrality  for  its  operations  (Scopes  1  and  2 emissions)  by  2050,  while  helping  its  customers  to  reduce  their carbon footprint.\n\nThe greenhouse gas emissions associated with its activities and exceptional  weather-related  phenomena  due  to  climate  change can impact the environment and people.\n\n## Climate risks related to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions\n\nThese risks can have the following consequences on people and the environment:\n\n- \u25a0 new competencies may be required of employees in order to maintain their employability, in particular given the implementation  of  new  technologies  and  the  development  of new markets;\n- \u25a0 the  massive  development  of  renewable  energies  used  to reduce  GHG  emissions  may  have  an  impact  on  local communities;\n- \u25a0 due to their consequences on global warming, GHG emissions may have an impact on the environment, in particular on water resources or crop yields.\n\n## Climate risks related to the physical impact\n\nAir Liquide operates in certain regions of the world exposed to an increase  (in  range  and/or  in  frequency)  in  weather-related phenomena due to climate change. These phenomena can have the following consequences on people:\n\n- \u25a0 the endangering of employees or neighboring communities by sites damaged during extreme climatic events such as floods, fires or hurricanes;\n- \u25a0 a  deterioration  in  the  working  conditions  of  employees  in certain regions due to a change in average temperatures.\n\n## Vigilance Plan\n\n## 4.1.2.  Water management-related risks\n\nAir Liquide acknowledges the human right to water and sanitation. Water  management  in  its  activities  can  have  two  main  types  of impact  on  people,  related  to  the  withdrawal  and  consumption  of water  on  the  sites  where  the  Group  operates,  or  related  to  the quality of water returned to ecosystems after usage.\n\n## Risks related to the withdrawal and consumption of water\n\nImpacts associated with water withdrawal may vary depending on the  location.  Areas  where  it  is  difficult  to  meet  human  and environmental needs for water due to poor availability, quality or accessibility are called water stress areas. In these areas, conflicts for water between different usages and users may arise.\n\n## Risks related to the quality of water returned to ecosystems\n\nThe quality and specifications of the water returned to ecosystems are important in assessing the impact of the Group's operations, either  because  of  the  presence  of  pollutants  or  contaminants content,  or  the  temperature,  which  can  induce  direct  or  indirect pollution and damages to ecosystems.\n\n## 4.2.   REGULAR ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES\n\nAssessment processes are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 methodology  guidelines,  such  as,  assessment  charts  to regularly review risks according  to  their probability of occurrence  and  their  potential  damage,  are  provided  to operations by the Sustainable Development Department which oversees  the  analysis  process.  Environmental  risks  are therefore assessed locally by the clusters (groups of countries) under the responsibility of their General Managers;\n- \u25a0 a  summary  of  each  assessment  is  reviewed  by  the  Risk Committee.  It  validates  guidelines,  analyzes  decision  making and ensures follow-up measures are taken;\n- \u25a0 the Environment and Society Committee examines the Group's strategy and commitments in terms of sustainable development and its environmental and societal measures, and reports back to the Board of Directors. It meets at least three times a year, and  holds  a  joint  session  with  the  Audit  and  Accounts Committee once a year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Vigilance Plan\n\n## Scope 1\n\nAir  Liquide's direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are mainly carbon  dioxide  and  nitrous  oxide  emissions,  all  expressed  in tonnes  of  CO2-equivalent.  For  large  units,  Scope  1  emissions correspond to the difference in carbon content between the natural gas  consumed  by  these  units  and  the  carbon  content  of  their products. Reporting takes into account a minimum of 95% of the Group's  emissions.  Reporting  is  subject  to  a  continuous improvement process.\n\n## Scope 2\n\nScope  2  totals  the  indirect  GHG  emissions  generated  by  the production of electricity and steam purchased outside the Group. These  emissions  are  related  to  the  production  of  electricity  and steam  in  the  various  countries  where  it  operates.  The  reporting takes into account a minimum of 95% of the Group's emissions. The  methodology  and  reporting  of  the  sources  of  indirect emissions  linked  to  electricity  and  steam  purchases  from  third parties  are  subject  to  a  continuous  improvement  process.  Thus, starting in 2021, the Group adopted a market-based reporting for its Scope 2.\n\nAir Liquide has improved the way in which indirect emissions from electricity  and  steam  purchases  are  recorded,  moving  from  a location-based  approach  based  on  the  average  emission  factors of  the  national  network,  to  a  much  more  precise  and  specific approach,  directly  related  to  supply  contracts,  called  a  marketbased  method.  With  this  approach,  the  Group  has  adopted  the method of accounting for Scope 2 emissions recommended by the GHG Protocol (1) . From now on, Air Liquide's initiatives in terms of electricity procurement, in particular the voluntary procurement of renewable electricity, are directly reflected in the reported Scope 2 emissions figures.\n\n## Scope 3\n\nThe Group reports other indirect GHG emissions under Scope 3 (categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11 and 13 of the GHG Protocol (2) ), which concern the Gas & Services businesses. The categories not reported represent emissions that are not applicable in Air Liquide's business model (8 and 14), or negligible (5, 12 and 15), or for which the methodology and reporting are in the process of being developed (10).\n\n## Assessing employee competencies to maintain employability\n\nThe  assessment  focused  on  the  most  exposed  activities,  which are in Engineering & Construction (E&C) and Large Industries:\n\n- \u25a0 Within E&C, the engineering and product line teams are those facing  the  greatest  changes  in  their  competencies.  They involve  emerging  disciplines  (electrolysis)  or  expertise  that needs  to  be  strengthened  to  meet  the  challenges  of  energy transition (CO2 capture and liquefaction, hydrogen liquefaction).  These  new  businesses,  combined  with  the current  growth  in  activity  for  E&C,  represent  opportunities  for employees positioned in less buoyant business segments.\n\nE&C  has  pursued  its  \"SPRING\"  technical  competencies assessment  exercise  in  2020  and  will  repeat  this  analysis  in 2022. It consists of an assessment of the skills of employees in the  technical  fields,  put  into  perspective  with  the  needs identified to support E&C's projected activity, in particular with the  development  of  technologies  supporting  the  Group's energy transition strategy. SPRING 2022 exercise will focus on the  Electrolysis  product  line  and  execution  skills  (engineering and site activities).\n\n- \u25a0 Three Large Industries professions are particularly exposed to a substantial change in their competencies:\n- -production  and  maintenance  teams  on  sites,  impacted  by the digitization and automation of industrial processes and by the setting up of Smart and Innovative Operations (SIO) centers in charge of remote control of production sites;\n- -sales  teams  are  being  affected  by  the  challenges  of  the energy transition, which are reflected in the development of the Group's offerings;\n- -for the  teams  in  charge  of  energy  management,  a 2021-2023  plan  has  been  drawn  up  to  support  the development  of  their  competencies  in  a  context  of increased  purchases  of  renewable  energy.  The  first  two stages were completed in 2021: (i) mapping of skills into six key  competencies  areas;  (ii)  identification  of  needs  for competencies  development  and  reinforcement  in  each geography.\n\n## 4.2.2.  Water management-related risks\n\n## Risks related to the withdrawal and consumption of water\n\nWater consumption is measured by subtracting water return from water withdrawal by the Group in the course of its business. The difference is due to:\n\n- \u25a0 the loss of water through evaporation in the cooling process of rotating machines, particularly for the production of air gases; and\n- \u25a0 its use as a raw material for products such as hydrogen.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  cooling  of  Air  Separation  Units,  there  are several types of cooling systems:\n\n- \u25a0 54% of these units have semi-open water circuits, where part of the water evaporates during the cooling process;\n- \u25a0 38% of these units have open circuits. Water runs through the plant for cooling purposes but all water withdrawn is returned. Both  types  of  units  require  continuous  back-up  water  for cooling;\n- \u25a0 finally,  the  other  units  have  closed  systems,  which  do  not withdraw  water  from  their  surrounding  environment.  These consume no water after the initial filling.\n\nAs water is a limited resource and not equally available across all regions, Air Liquide has assessed the risks associated with water consumption at its  sites  by  referring  to  the  'Aqueduct  3.0  Water Risk Atlas' map of the World Resource Institute (WRI) published in August  2019.  This  assessment  takes  into  account  the  specific data  for  each  site  according  to  its  location  in  relation  to  a watershed, groundwater and an administrative boundary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Each  site  is  thus identified  as  belonging  to  an  area  of  water  stress  or  not  (area defined according to the intensity of water conflict). This mapping also includes new units.\n\nIn 2021, according to the mapping of the Group's sites and based on the WRI map, 1% of the sites are located in areas considered as arid. For sites located in areas of high water stress, an analysis is underway and will be completed in 2022. It will make it possible to prioritize actions in the most water-intensive operations.\n\n## Risks related to the quality of water returned to ecosystems\n\nMeasurements  and  analyses  of  discharged  water,  to  assess  its quality,  are  carried  out  at  a  frequency  consistent  with  and according to the requirements laid down in local regulations.\n\n## 4.3.   APPROPRIATE ACTION TO MITIGATE RISKS OR PREVENT SEVERE IMPACTS\n\n## 4.3.1.  Climate-related risks\n\n## Environmental policies and procedures\n\nThe  procedures  relating  to  the  monitoring  and  reporting  of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are being drafted following the announcement  of  the  sustainability  objectives  in  March  2021. They will include:\n\n- \u25a0 a reminder  of  regulatory  requirements  to  which  the  Group  is currently subject in terms of GHG emissions;\n- \u25a0 the methodology for calculating Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions, as well as the reporting scope and frequency;\n- \u25a0 the criteria for reviewing investment decisions, which take into account environmental responsibility criteria, particularly concerning  GHG  emissions,  as  well  as  an  analysis  of  the opportunities and risks related to climate transition. For all its projects, for all geographies, even these without a current price for CO2, Air Liquide includes in its investment decision process a  carbon  price  of  50  euros  per  tonne,  the  local  current  price and  a  high  value  of  at  least  100  euros  per  tonne,  chosen  in function of the geography and context.\n\n## Group's Climate Objectives\n\nAs part of the sustainability objectives announced in March 2021, Air Liquide's ambition is to act for a low-carbon society.\n\nIn  full  support  of  the  Paris Agreement, the Group's commitments address  the  urgency  of  climate  change  and  energy  transition, targeting  carbon  neutrality  by  2050 with  key  intermediary milestones in 2025 and 2035:\n\n- \u25a0 to start reducing its absolute CO2 emissions around 2025;\n- \u25a0 to  reach  a  -33%  decrease  of  its  Scopes  1  and  2  CO2 emissions (3) by 2035, compared to the 2020 Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, calculated according to the market-based method, defined in paragraph 4.2.1.\n\nWithin this context, the Group also maintains its existing objective, announced in 2018, to reduce by -30% its carbon intensity (4) by 2025, on the basis of 2015 emissions.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the Group has identified five levers to reduce the carbon footprint of its assets detailed below.\n\nIn March 2021, Air Liquide raised its climate ambition beyond 2018 announcements,  which  were  based  on  a  -30%  carbon  intensity reduction  objective  by  2025  (compared  to  2015).  This  strategy defined in 2018 was based on the determination of levers aimed at decarbonizing assets and associated with quantified objectives.\n\nGiven several considerations (takeover of Sasol's Air Separation Units  in  South Africa  in  mid-2021  and  change  in  the  calculation method  of  indirect  emissions  linked  to  electricity  and  steam purchases), the objectives associated with the levers determined in  2018  are  no  longer  appropriate  to  meet  the  new  ambition  of reducing  absolute  CO2  emissions  while  maintaining  the  -30% carbon intensity reduction objective by 2025 (compared to 2015). These objectives are therefore no longer presented as in previous reporting periods.\n\nHowever, some of the levers identified for asset decarbonization remain  relevant  and  are  presented  below.  The  performance  of associated  indicators  and  of  newly  added  ones  continues  to  be measured, monitored and reported.\n\n## Assets: reducing the carbon impact of its production, distribution and service activities\n\n## Lever 1: Sourcing renewable electricity.\n\nAir  Liquide  follows  a  proactive  approach to renewable electricity procurement through direct contracts with producers (PPAs - Power Purchase Agreements).  The  share  of  renewable  electricity  should  increase  in  the  coming  years  as  new  procurement  contracts  are expected to be signed regularly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide has signed a long-term PPA with Vattenfall, to purchase a total of 25 MW of offshore wind capacity in the Netherlands. Over the duration of the contract, Air Liquide will source renewable electricity equivalent to 15% of the  Group's  current  consumption  for  its  activities  in  the  Netherlands  and  it  will  save  up  to  750,000  tonnes  of  CO2 emissions over the contract duration.\n\nIn  addition,  Air  Liquide  has signed a long-term PPA with TotalEnergies, through Lampiris its energy supply affiliate in Belgium, for a total capacity of 15 MW of offshore wind electricity in Belgium . Over the duration of the contract, the wind-generated electricity will save up to 270,000 tonnes of CO2.",

The Group continues to  roll  out  the  Smart  Innovative  Operations  (SIO)  program which optimizes energy consumption and procurement through centralized operation centers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide and PAO Severstal, one of the leading steel producers, have signed a new long-term contract for the construction of an air separation unit (ASU)  and  for the supply of oxygen to  the  Severstal  CherMK  site  in Russia. This new ASU is characterized by improved energy efficiency . In the framework of the agreement, the two companies have also committed to further reduce CO2 emissions arising from the oxygen production.\n\n## Lever 3: Developing innovative carbon capture technologies.\n\nAir  Liquide  has  developed  a  portfolio  of  proprietary  technologies  such  as  Cryocap\u2122,  which  allow  CO2  to  be  captured  and  stored  on Steam Methane Reformer (SMR) units for the production of hydrogen. Capture for CO2 valorization and storage is thus set to play a major role in reducing direct emissions from hydrogen production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide is involved in the 'Porthos' CO2 capture and storage (CCS) project in the Rotterdam region, in the Netherlands. This project aims to store an annual amount of 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 in storage areas under the North Sea, starting in 2024. The Air Liquide site in Rozenburg, in the Rotterdam port area will install a CryoCap\u2122 unit to capture CO  partly from hydrogen production facilities2 .\n\n## Lever 4: Installing electrolyzers for hydrogen production.\n\nAir Liquide is committed to producing low-carbon hydrogen on an industrial scale. The electrolysis of water is one of the key solutions to produce hydrogen with a minimal carbon footprint, when powered by low-carbon electricity. The installation of electrolyzers units therefore plays a crucial role to enable the production of low-carbon hydrogen on a large scale for industry and mobility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir  Liquide  inaugurated  the  world's  largest  PEM  (Proton  Exchange  Membrane)  electrolyzer. Supplied  with renewable energy, this unit produces up to 8.2 tonnes per day of low-carbon hydrogen in B\u00e9cancour, Qu\u00e9bec. With this large-scale investment, the Group confirms its long-term commitment to the hydrogen energy markets and its ambition to be a major player in the supply of low-carbon hydrogen.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  planning  to  build  in  Oberhausen,  Germany,  a  renewable  hydrogen  production  plant  by electrolysis . With a total capacity to reach 30 MW, a first phase of the project is expected to be operational by early 2023 with 20 MW. It will be the first large-scale renewable hydrogen production connected to both existing hydrogen and oxygen pipelines.\n\n## Lever 5: reducing the carbon footprint of air gases (N2, O2, Ar) delivered in bulk and in cylinders, or produced on customers sites.\n\nAir  Liquide  uses  a  large  fleet  of  trucks  for  the  supply  of  industrial  gases  to  its  customers.  These  vehicles  contribute  to  the  Group's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Air Liquide therefore takes targeted actions to reduce such emissions by leveraging digital tools to optimize deliveries, and by progressively converting its fleet to alternate fuels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide has signed a contract for the procurement of bio-sourced CO2 (biomass sector) from a CO2 capture, purification and liquefaction unit. Located near Brest, in France , this project, close to Air Liquide's local customers, will make it possible to limit the carbon footprint linked to the transport of the molecule, with a reduction of one million kilometers traveled by truck per year, i.e. a reduction of abound 900 tonnes of CO2 emissions.\n\nPresent  within  each  cluster  (group  of  countries), Climate  Champions are  responsible  for  rolling  out  the  Group's  emission  reduction objectives.  They  are  the  point  of  contact  of  the  Sustainable  Development  Department  in  the  clusters  (groups  of  countries).  They coordinate  the  development  of  a  roadmap  that  defines  all  the  operational  measures  required  to  achieve  the  objectives.  They  are responsible for monitoring the indicators, the roll-out of projects and reporting on progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Drawing on its technological expertise and its capacity for innovation, the Group offers them cleaner and more sustainable solutions to reduce their CO2 emissions. To achieve this ambition, the following levers have been identified:\n\n## Lever 1: Offering low-carbon industrial gases.\n\nIn addition to decarbonizing its own assets to supply low-carbon industrial gases, Air Liquide supports its customers in their objectives to reduce their carbon footprint. The Group provides them with its technologies and expertise in energy sourcing, including the takeover of customers' existing oxygen or hydrogen production units in order to decarbonize them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide and Jiangsu Shagang Group have signed a new long-term agreement to build and operate a lowcarbon gas plant which willl also be the world's largest for the steel industry in Zhangjiagang City, Jiangsu Province, China . Designed to use low-carbon energy, this state of the art plant will allow to significantly reduce CO2 emissions over time. It will be equipped with the proprietary solution Alive\u2122, an innovation that allows for the storage of up to 60 MW of energy per day and will replace old assets installed on the customer site.\n\n## Lever 2: Transforming production processes to reduce their carbon intensity.\n\nAir  Liquide  brings  technical  innovations  to  industrial  sectors  such  as  steel  and  chemicals.  In  order  to  reduce  the  CO2  emissions associated with conventional processes used in these sectors, a fundamental transformation of the means of production is necessary, using new processes and new raw materials such as hydrogen.\n\nAir Liquide and ArcelorMittal have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to transform the steel production process through the development of innovative solutions . This partnership is the first step towards the creation of a new low-carbon hydrogen and CO2 capture technologies ecosystem in the industrial basin of Dunkirk, France. The project  will  reduce  yearly  CO2  emissions  from ArcelorMittal's  steel-making  facilities  in  Dunkirk  by  2.85  million tonnes by 2030. Air Liquide will support this strategic initiative through the massive supply of low-carbon hydrogen and the implementation of CO2 capture technologies.\n\n## Lever 3: Offering carbon capture as a service.\n\nAir Liquide's presence in major industrial basins, combined with its expertise in carbon capture and liquefaction technologies allows the Group to contribute to major global initiatives aimed at aggregating large streams of CO2 in order to capture them for valorization and storage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe project Kairos@C - jointly developed by Air Liquide and its customer BASF , has been selected for funding by the European Commission through its Innovation Fund, as one of the seven large-scale projects out of more than 300 applications. Located in Antwerp, t his project will help avoid 14.2 million tonnes of CO2 emissions over the first 10 years of operation by combining CO2 capture, liquefaction, transportation, and storage on a large scale in the North Sea. The project will also be connected to shared CO2 transport and export infrastructures, including a first-of-its-kind CO2 liquefaction and export terminal, which will be built under the framework of the consortium Antwerp@C.\n\n## Ecosystems: contributing to the emergence of a low-carbon society\n\nAir  Liquide  contributes  to  the  development  of  a  low-carbon  society.  To  this  end,  the  Group  develops  hydrogen  and  biomethane  for industrial and mobility applications. These developments are expected to play a key role in the fight against climate change. The Group has therefore identified the following levers:\n\n## Lever 1: Promoting hydrogen for clean mobility.\n\nAir  Liquide  invests  in  low-carbon  hydrogen  production  as  well  as  in  distribution  networks  for  clean  mobility  in  order  to  support  the transition to a low-carbon society. Air Liquide is notably a founding member of the Hydrogen Council, a global initiative bringing together 123 companies, in 2021, that promote hydrogen as a key solution for the energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir  Liquide  contributes  to  the  progress  of  hydrogen  mobility  in  China. The  Group  supplied  and  installed 8 hydrogen dispenser units for the Daxing station in Beijing, China. With a capacity of 4.8 tonnes, this station can refuel 600 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (cargo van, garbage truck and bus) per day , making it the largest in the world  in  terms  of  refueling  capacity.  The  Daxing  hydrogen  station  is  part  of  the  200,000  square-meter  Beijing International  Hydrogen  Energy  Demonstration  Zone,  which  aims  to  build  an  innovation  ecosystem  that  integrates research & development, test and production related to hydrogen energy.",

Located in Rockford, Illinois, the production unit will be operational in 2024, and will have a capacity of 380 GWh per year, which represents the largest biomethane production capacity for the Group. The biomethane from this unit will be supplied for clean mobility and industrial customers consumption.\n\n## 4.3.2.  Water management-related risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water management policy\n\nTo  manage  the  risks  associated  with  water  withdrawal  and consumption  as  well  as  the  quality  of  the  water  returned  to ecosystems,  a  water  management  policy  was  published  in  the BlueBook (5) in  2021. It will be rolled out throughout the Group in 2022.  It  identifies  the  impacts  of  Air  Liquide's  activity  on  the availability and quality of water. The policy defines the principles of risk  management  based  on  a  thorough  assessment  of  the situation  at  each  site.  Finally,  it  describes  the  actions  to  be implemented to ensure appropriate water management.\n\nGroup  objectives  for  water  management  have  been  defined  for 2021. They include:\n\n- \u25a0 implementing a documented management plan by 2025 aimed at  reducing  water  withdrawal  and  usage  risks  for  waterintensive operations in high water stress areas;\n- \u25a0 defining  and  implementing  a  Group-wide  standard  for  all operations,  that  goes  beyond  existing  local  processes  and procedures,  to  ensure  that  the  quality  of  discharged  water meets or exceeds applicable local criteria.\n\n## Organizational structure and reporting tool\n\nAir Liquide has a network of water experts who are the dedicated contact point for all questions relating to water and its usage and who  verify  the  data  (sampling,  discharge,  quality).  In  2021,  the Group rolled  out  a  new  reporting  tool  to  improve  data  collection and accuracy.  Finally,  following  the  work  of  a  dedicated  working group,  Air  Liquide  will  strengthen  the  process  to  steer  water management  on  sites,  monitoring  of  usage  and  the  quality  of water returned to ecosystems.\n\n## Water treatment solutions\n\nAir  Liquide  provides  its  customers  with  efficient  and  easy-toimplement  solutions  for  water  treatment  to  face  environmental challenges especially in the fight against water stress and scarcity.\n\nOxygen  (O2),  ozone  (O3),  and  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  play  a fundamental  role  in  drinking  water  and  wastewater  treatment processes. These gases are key to balance mineral levels in water desalination plants, or to eliminate pollutants from surface drinking water. For industrial companies seeking technologies to treat and recycle water, these molecules help boost the removal of organic pollution  from  wastewater  and  to  avoid  corrosion  or  clogging  in cooling systems.\n\n## 4.3.3.  Employee commitment and training\n\n## Dedicated internal structure\n\nTo  support  the  Group's  Sustainable  Development  approach,  a network has been created by volunteer employees called ' Climate Ambassadors '.  Members undertake to organize local initiatives, raise  employee  awareness,  propose  solutions  that  contribute  to sustainable  development  and  share  best  practices  within  their entity.  At the  end  of  2021,  the  Group  had  450  Climate Ambassadors  present  in  the  various  regions  of  the  Group, compared  to  250  in  2020,  which  demonstrates  the  growing interest  of  employees  in  these  issues.  The  role  of  these ambassadors  will  be  extended  in  2022  to  cover  all  sustainable development issues.\n\nTheir  actions  are  relayed  on  a  dedicated  Intranet  site  where general information on sustainable development and the Group's strategy in this  area  is  also  available,  including  the  sustainability objectives  announced  in  March  2021,  educational  videos  and press articles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## THE CLIMATE AMBASSADORS OF ARGENTINA ORGANIZE A SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT MONTH\n\nIn  order  to  present  the  Group's  sustainability  objectives  and raise employee awareness, Argentina's Climate Ambassadors organized a 'Sustainable Development Month' in July  2021,  which  brought  together  more  than  250 participants. After a webinar presenting the Group's objectives,  a  challenge  was  launched,  providing  information and smaller challenges associated with each of the pillars of these  objectives.  Actions  were  focused  on  reducing  plastic waste,  employee  health  and  cognitive  bias.  A  closing workshop  was  organized  to  discuss  the  results  of  the challenge and interact with the participants.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has set up a training course on the energy transition, including webinars on the  causes  and  consequences  of  climate  change  and  on  Air Liquide's decarbonization strategy. The training sessions are open to  all  employees. They can also access the recordings available on  the  Air  Liquide  University  digital  platform.  Specific  training courses  were  introduced  for  operational  teams  to  inform employees  of  the  Group's  sustainability  objectives  and  their operational rollout.\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE OFFERS A CLIMATE AND ENERGY TRANSITION ON-BOARDING PROGRAM\n\nIn 2021, Air Liquide created a Climate and Energy Transition On-boarding program, consisting of six modules. Relayed by Air Liquide  University,  this  program  was  aimed  more specifically  at  employees  involved  in  investment  decisions and at the sales teams. The first three modules entitled 'In a Nutshell' dealt with the Group's Climate Objectives, customers and technologies and were open to other Group employees. The other three modules, reserved for the priority target  audience  and  entitled  'How-to',  focused  on  practical issues  for  the  employees  concerned,  around  investments, customer  interactions,  and  low-carbon  industrial  gases. Around 1,400 employees attended the program.\n\nIn  response to the climate risks associated with greenhouse gas emissions,  and  the  emerging  need  for  employees  to  have additional competencies to maintain their employability, initiatives have  been  launched,  particularly  in  Engineering  &  Construction (E&C) and Large Industries business lines, to support them in the transition  to  new  technologies  and  the  development  of  new markets:\n\n- \u25a0 in E&C, an Electrolysis product line integrating the entire value chain, from solution definition to project execution, was created in  2021.  It  has  integrated  nearly  30  employees  from  other organizations  within  E&C.  Cross-functional  mobility  remains the preferred way to develop rich career paths and strengthen the flexibility and employability of teams;\n- \u25a0 in Large Industries, actions have been taken according to the type of profession concerned:\n- -for  operations  and  maintenance:  a  training  curriculum  for site operations managers has been rolled out in 2020-2021 to support the digitization of industrial processes (maintenance,  reliability,  safety)  and  the  evolution  of  their functions,\n- -for  the  sales  teams:  the  training  curriculum  is  updated several times a year and rolled out to strengthen the teams' skills.  The  implementation  of  individual  development  plans is planned for 2022,\n- -for  energy  management  teams,  two  priority  actions  are being  deployed:  (i) the implementation  of  individual development plans; (ii) the development of a training offer on  six  key  competencies  areas  for  Energy  managers primarily, but also for Air Liquide management, sales teams and all Group teams exposed to these changes.",

For  this  purpose,  four  criteria  are used:\n\n- 1\u00b0  Air Liquide current spend with the supplier;\n- 2\u00b0  the risk relating to the nature of the supplier's activity;\n- 3\u00b0  the risk relating to the supplier's country of operation; and\n- 4\u00b0  the supplier's dependency on Air Liquide.\n\nThe amount of annual spend is used to prioritize the suppliers and systematically include in the identification of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers  those  on  whom  the  Group  spends  more  than  200,000 euros per year.\n\nThe nature of a supplier's activity depends on its allocation to one of  17  procurement  categories,  which  are  subdivided  into  429 procurement  sub-categories.  For  a  more  precise  methodology, each procurement sub-category is allocated a global sustainability risk  level,  which  includes  in  particular  the  environment,  human rights  and  working  conditions,  on  a  six-level  scale  (severe, medium high, high, medium low, low, very low).\n\nThe risk relating to the supplier's country of operation is assessed based on a weighting of recognized public indicators in terms of the environment (e.g. Environmental Performance Index, EPI), the health and social situation (e.g. Human Development Index, HDI) and human rights (e.g. Global Slavery Index, ITUC Global Rights Index), on a three-level scale (high risk, risk, no risk).\n\nThe dependency of suppliers on Air Liquide is also an important criterion.  For  example,  a  decrease  in Air  Liquide's  activity  with  a supplier could have a social impact on the jobs of its employees.\n\nThe  combination  of  the  four  selected  criteria  leads  to  the identification of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers. This identification allows  for  setting  priorities to implement  assessment  and improvement  measures.  In  addition  to  the  referenced  criteria above, the procurement functions in the geographies are free to define  more  stringent  conditions,  based  on  local  specificities,  to identify other Sustainability-Critical Suppliers.\n\n| Assessment criteria   | Assessment criteria             | Assessment criteria   | Assessment criteria      | Assessment criteria                           |                                    |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                       | 1\u00b0 Annual spend                 | 2\u00b0 Nature of activity | 3\u00b0 Country  of operation | 4\u00b0 Dependency                                 | Sustainability-Critical  Suppliers |\n| Risks                 |                                 |                       | All                      | Regardless  of the supplier  dependency ratio | According to the                   |\n| Risks                 | >\u20ac200K High and medium and high | High risk and risk    | All                      | Regardless  of the supplier  dependency ratio | According to the                   |\n| Risks                 | High and medium and high        | No risk               | All                      | Regardless  of the supplier  dependency ratio | According to the                   |\n| Risks                 | Medium low, low and very low    | All                   |                          | >25%                                          | According to the                   |\n\n## 5.1.2.  2021 Results\n\nThe  mapping  of  supplier-related  risks  is  updated  on  an  annual basis by a working group composed of the function in charge of sustainable  procurement  at  Group  level,  buyers  who  are specialized by category, and experts from the external platform.\n\nIn  2021,  based  on  the  methodology  described  above,  1,007 suppliers  were  identified  as  being  the  most  exposed  to  a sustainability risk. Nine  other  suppliers  were  identified  as Sustainability-Critical  Suppliers  but  were  excluded  following  the termination of commercial relations.\n\nThese  1,007  suppliers  represent  approximately  19%  of  the Group's  spend  in  2020.  The  three  most  exposed  procurement categories are electricity supply, transport services and respiratory equipment,  and  account  for  87%  of  annual  spend  with Sustainability-Critical Suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Assessment methodology\n\nThe evaluation of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers is mainly carried out using two kinds of questionnaires:\n\n- \u25a0 by  an external  platform  specialized in  the  assessment  of CSR performance (in 2021, EcoVadis) which deploys an online questionnaire based on the ISO 26000 standard to assess the commitment  of  suppliers  in  terms  of  CSR.  The  main  themes covered in this questionnaire include the environment, ethics, human  rights  and  working  conditions,  and  the  sustainable procurement procedures implemented by suppliers; or\n- \u25a0 by  Air  Liquide,  which  created  an internal  questionnaire in 2019, as a supplement to the solution offered by the external platform.  This  questionnaire  is  sent  to  Sustainability-Critical Suppliers selected for the assessment campaign who refused to reply to the questionnaire sent by the external platform.\n\n## 5.2.2.  Assessment results\n\nAnswers provided in the questionnaires and supporting documentation  produced  by  the  suppliers  are  assessed  by  the experts  from  the  EcoVadis  external  platform  or  by  Air  Liquide buyers, on a scale of 100 points. The score obtained reflects the supplier's CSR performance.\n\nAccording  to  the  results  of  the  assessment,  suppliers  can  be considered as a:\n\n- \u25a0 Responsible supplier : score greater than or equal to 45/100. The  supplier  meets  Air  Liquide  sustainable  performance requirements. Validity of the score: five years or upon renewal of its contract (whichever comes first);\n- \u25a0 Supplier  needing  improvement :  score  between  25/100  and 44/100 or when the supplier has one theme rated \u226420. Validity of the score: three years, during which the supplier will implement a corrective action plan. An on-site environmental/ social audit may be decided to help define the action plan;\n- \u25a0 Non-compliant supplier : score less than or equal to 24/100. Validity  of  the  score:  one  year.  A  corrective  action  plan  is required  in  the  month  following  its  rating  and  must  be implemented  before  the  supplier's  reassessment  12  months after its rating.\n\nThe  Sustainability-Critical Suppliers' assessment  procedures provide for a CSR audit, performed by an independent third party, of suppliers which are non-compliant twice in a row. In 2021, and for the first time since 2016, two suppliers were assessed as noncompliant twice in a row.\n\n| Assessment of a             | Supplier score for each                                           | Overall supplier score   | Overall supplier score   | Overall supplier score   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Sustainability-Critical     | of the 4 themes  (a)  assessed                                    | \u226545                      | between 25 and 44        | \u226424                      |\n| Supplier (score out of 100) | If all themes obtain a score >20 If one theme obtains a score \u226420 |                          |                          |                          |\n\n- (a) The environment, ethics, human rights and working conditions, and the sustainable procurement procedures implemented by suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nn\n\n- n Supplier needing improvement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResponsible supplier.\n\n- n Non-compliant supplier.\n\n## 5.3.   APPROPRIATE ACTION TO MITIGATE RISKS OR PREVENT SEVERE IMPACTS\n\n## 5.3.1.  Procedures\n\nIn order to mitigate risks or prevent severe impacts relating to the duty  of  vigilance,  Air  Liquide  rolls  out  all  elements  of  the sustainable  procurement  procedure,  including  in  particular  the following prevention measures:\n\n- \u25a0 application  of  the Procurement  Code  of  Conduct ,  which  is available in 11 languages, is mandatory for all Group employees engaged in Procurement activities;\n- \u25a0 the Supplier's  Code  of  Conduct ,  which  is  available  in  14 languages,  aims  to  promote  and  ensure  compliance  by  all suppliers of practices relating to human rights, the protection of the environment and safety. This code is publicly available on the Air Liquide website (https://www.airliquide.com/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-procurement);\n- \u25a0 a CSR  commitment  clause (covering  compliance  with  the Supplier's  Code  of  Conduct,  safety,  and  the  environment)  is included  in  the  contract  templates  with  suppliers,  including those for framework agreements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Corrective action plans\n\nA dedicated sustainable procurement function, within the Procurement  Department,  coordinates  the  implementation  of corrective action plans through  a  network  of  sustainable procurement  correspondents  present  in  each  hub  and  business line.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  evaluation  procedure  for  SustainabilityCritical  Suppliers  described  in  paragraph  5.2,  suppliers  needing improvement  and  non-compliant  suppliers  must  establish  a corrective action plan.\n\nDepending on the size of the company or the type of actions to be rolled  out,  these  plans  can  be  established  in  different  ways,  for example:\n\n- \u25a0 on  the  basis  of  the  improvement  areas  identified  during  the assessment  on  the  external  platform  or  in  the  internal questionnaire;\n- \u25a0 through  participation  of  the  suppliers  in  internal  training courses on CSR-related topics.\n\n## 5.3.3.  Training\n\nSome  training  courses  cover,  in  particular,  the  commitments  of new suppliers, the implementation of corrective action plans, the internal  assessment  questionnaire,  as  well  as  socially  inclusive procurement. For buyers, these training modules also present the consistency between  Sustainable Procurement  and  Group strategy,  explain  the  challenges  of  the  Sustainable  Procurement approach and position it as a source of value creation. A total of 282 buyers and 100 suppliers were trained in 2021.\n\n## 5.3.4.  The Observatory for Sustainable Procurement\n\nAir  Liquide  also  takes  part  in  collaborative  and  multi-sector initiatives for sustainable procurement, in particular as a member of ObsAR (the French Observatory for Sustainable Procurement, https://www.obsar.asso.fr/).  In  2018,  the  association  created  a working  group  around  the  issues  presented  by  the  Law  on  the duty  of  vigilance  for  procurement  functions,  following  which  a White Paper entitled 'Implementing adapted measures to manage the  duty  of  vigilance  for  suppliers  and  subcontractors',  offering best practices, methods and tools was published. Since 2021, Air Liquide  has  been  part  of  the  working  group  on  climate  change launched by ObsAR.\n\nIn  2021,  Air  Liquide  organized  training  sessions  in  English, Chinese, French and Russian to raise awareness among buyers and suppliers of the Group's Sustainable Procurement approach and  thus  strengthen  its  roll  out  throughout  the  organization. Training courses are organized by subject and by region.\n\n## 5.4.   MONITORING SCHEME OF MEASURES IMPLEMENTED AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  sustainable  procurement  procedure, and in particular the results of the Sustainability-Critical Suppliers' evaluations,  is  monitored  by  the  Procurement  Department.  A steering committee,  composed  of  the  Group's  sustainable procurement  function  and  each  of  its  regional  correspondents, meets  once  a  quarter  to  review  the  progress  made  in  terms  of objectives set by the Group.\n\nIn 2021, the assessment campaign addressed 42% (3) of the 1,007 Sustainability-Critical Suppliers:\n\n- \u25a0 249  suppliers  were  assessed  (57%  by  the  external  platform and 43% by Air Liquide using an internal questionnaire);\n- \u25a0 105  non-compliant  suppliers  or  needing  improvement  have prepared corrective action plans.\n\nAt the end  of  the  2021  assessment  campaign,  83%  of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers had a valid score (i.e. not requiring a reassessment as per paragraph 5.2.2).\n\n|                                                                                                                      | 2021 Objectives   | 2021 Results   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Lever 1:  share of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers addressed by the annual assessment  campaign who responded      | 73%               | 83%            |\n| Lever 2:  share of suppliers needing improvement who prepared a corrective action plan  (annual assessment campaign) | 64%               | 82%            |\n| Lever  3:  share  of  non-compliant  suppliers  who  prepared  and  implemented  a  corrective  action plan          | 90%               | 100%           |\n\nFollowing the assessment results and a review of corrective action plans, Air Liquide suspended its sales relationship with four suppliers during 2021.\n\nThese  performance  indicators  and  their  progress  report  were  presented  in  September  2021  during  the  Group  Procurement  Board meetings, which bring together the operational directors supervising the regions' Procurement Departments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

COLLECTION OF REPORTS\n\nSince 2015, the Group has had an alert mechanism across all of its  entities:  EthiCall  (https://www.safecall.co.uk/en/clients/ethicall/ english-report-an-incident/)  for  all  Group  companies  excluding Airgas, EthicsPoint (https://secure.ethicspoints.com/domain/ media/en/gui/28723/index.html)  for  Airgas  and  its  subsidiaries, allowing  all  employees  and  external  service  providers  (service providers  carrying  out  a  long-term  assignment  on  an Air  Liquide site) to file an alert.\n\nThis alert may cover:\n\n- \u25a0 behavior  or  situations  that  breach  the  Group's  health  and safety commitments;\n- \u25a0 serious Human Rights violations;\n- \u25a0 behavior  or  situations  that  breach  the  Group's  environmental commitments;\n- \u25a0 deviations from the Code of Conduct.\n\nThe  reporting  categories,  in  particular  forms  of  harassment, discrimination, violation of Human Rights or the environment, have been specified to take into account the requirements of the duty of vigilance. They  facilitate analysis and processing without restricting the free expression of the whistleblower.\n\nRegular  communication  (e.g.  via  posters,  Intranet,  reminders during annual and mandatory e-learning courses on the Code of Conduct,  management  communication,  on-boarding  sessions  for new employees) ensures that all employees are familiar with the alert mechanism and can easily file an alert in their own language either by telephone or through the provider's dedicated website.\n\nThe  Group  guarantees  that  any  whistleblower  who  reports  an event in good faith will not be sanctioned and will not suffer any retaliatory measures. These principles concerning the protections granted to whistleblowers (possibility of filing an alert in their own language in writing or by telephone, anonymously or not, respect for  confidentiality,  protection  against  any  form  of  retaliation)  are reaffirmed in the updated Code of Conduct published at the end of 2021 as well as on the EthiCall platform.\n\nAll  alerts  are  processed  confidentially  and  within  a  reasonable period of time, usually less than two months. Alerts are processed by internal teams according to their nature and their geographical origin.  Employees  responsible  for  processing  the  alerts  may  call upon  external  resources  if  necessary.  The  results  of  the  alert's investigation, the corrective measures and the possible sanctions envisaged are reviewed by a body independent of the entity from which the alert originated. The most serious cases are reviewed by an Ethics Committee at the relevant hub or business line level, or by the Group's Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\nThis  system  complements  other  means  of  reporting  incidents within  the  entities  (managers,  Human  Resources  Department, Legal Department, etc.). It enables alerts to be processed quickly and in a structured manner, thus minimizing their potential impact on individuals and the Group's organization.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  the  Group  extended  access  to  the  EthiCall whistleblowing  system  to  all  internal  and  external  stakeholders, after consulting employee representative bodies in France.\n\nThe  reporting  process  for  the  most  serious  safety  and  security accidents  ensures  that  the  relevant  management  and  heads  of safety  and  security  within  the  subsidiary,  cluster  (group  of countries), hub and Group (according to the level of severity) are rapidly  informed  of  these  incidents.  A  crisis  management  and incident  monitoring  process  is  therefore  implemented  to  ensure the best care of any victims, secure the situation and establish an investigation  team  which  is  both  qualified  and  adapted  to  the incident.\n\nFor  personal  data,  Air  Liquide  has  deployed  specific  tools  to collect  requests  for  the  exercise  of  rights  and  to  report  possible violations  of  personal  data.  In  addition, Air  Liquide  has  signed  a contract  with  a  company  responsible  for  finding  and  reporting personal  data  that  is  illegitimately  accessible  via  the  Internet. These requests and reports are recorded in a dedicated register.\n\n## 6.2.   MONITORING SCHEME OF MEASURES IMPLEMENTED AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS\n\nThe  alert  mechanism  is  supervised  by  the  Group  Ethics  Officer who  ensures  a  compliant  implementation,  in  particular  that  it  is properly  disseminated  throughout  the  Group,  that  alerts  are processed  appropriately,  and  that  whistleblowers  are  protected. The  Group  Ethics  Officer  reports  back  to  the  Group  Ethics  and Compliance Committee and to the Audit and Accounts Committee of  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the  main  indicators  and  lessons learned from this system.\n\nIn 2021, 192 alerts were reported in the alert mechanism, and in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 discrimination and moral harassment: 97 cases;\n- \u25a0 health, safety, and environmental violations: 17 cases.\n\n37% of alerts were found to be justified following investigation and led to sanctions and corrective measures.\n\nA  presentation  of  the  alert  mechanism  and  its  main  results  is shared each year with the employee  representatives of L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\nIn 2021, Air Liquide recorded 56 requests for the exercise of rights or reports of violations of personal data.",

The term of office is  for  four  years. The  Board aims to stagger the renewals of the\n\nterms of office. In May 2022, at the close of the General Meeting, following the expiration of the terms of office of four Directors and subject to the approval of the proposed resolutions, the Board of Directors will comprise twelve members: ten members appointed by the General Meeting, including four foreign members and five women (i.e., 50%), and two Directors representing the employees.\n\n## 1. Code of Corporate Governance\n\nThe Board of Directors confirmed that, in keeping with the Group's previous practices, the AFEP/MEDEF  Code  of  Corporate Governance  for  listed  companies  is  the  Code  to  which  the Company voluntarily  refers.  This  Code  in  its  updated  version,  is available on the website https://afep.com/wp-content/ uploads/2020/01/Afep\\_Medef-Code-revision-2020-EN-.pdf.\n\nThe Appointments and Governance Committee and the Remuneration  Committee  reviewed  current  practices  in  the Company with respect to the AFEP/MEDEF Code as amended in January  2020.  Pursuant  to  article  L.  22-10-10,  4\u00b0  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  those  provisions  of  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Code that are currently not applied and the reasons for this are stated in this Report. A summary is presented in table format on page 154.\n\nThe  Report  of  the  Haut  Comit\u00e9  de  Gouvernement  d'Entreprise (French High Committee on Corporate Governance) of November 2021  and  the  French  financial  market  authority  (Autorit\u00e9  des March\u00e9s  Financiers)  Report  on  Corporate  Governance  and  the remuneration of executive officers of listed companies published in December 2021, have been reviewed.\n\nThe principles governing the professional ethics of Directors, the diversity  policy  which  applies  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  together with the composition, role and rules of operation of the Board and its Committees  are  defined  in  the  internal  regulations.  The updated  version,  as  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on May  5,  2020,  is  published  in  its  entirety  on  the  Company's website : https://www.airliquide.com/sites/airliquide.com/ files/2020/05/05/internal-regulations-of-the-board-of-directorsmay-2020.pdf.\n\n## 2. Governance transitioning from combined roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer toward separate roles for Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAir  Liquide's  governance  is  historically  defined  by  an  effort  to remain relevant to the Group's challenges, to respect Shareholders'  rights,  to  balance  powers  and  to  ensure  best practices evolve.\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier joined the Group in 1981. He became Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  in  2006  after  having  served  as Chairman of the Management Board from 2001. Since 2018, the Board  of  Directors  with  the  assistance  of  its  Appointments  and Governance Committee, has been preparing a succession plan for the Executive Officer.\n\nAt  the  conclusion  of  this  work,  the  Board  of  Directors  of November  30,  2021  based  on  a  unanimous  resolution  following the Appointments and Governance Committee's recommendations, announced its intention to adopt a new mode of governance by separating the functions of the Chairman of the Board  of  Directors  from  those  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  to appoint Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as Chief Executive Officer, replacing Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in this role, who has led the Group for 20 years, and to renew Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's position as Chairman of the Board of  Directors subject to his position as Director being renewed by the  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2022.  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow's appointment  as  Director  will  also  be  proposed  to  the  General Meeting of  May  4,  2022. At  the  end  of  the  General  Meeting,  by decision of the Board of Directors, the term of office of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer would be renewed until May 31, 2022.\n\nThe  terms  of  the  new  governance  which  would  take  effect  on June 1,  2022  are  detailed  below  (paragraph  2.2  pages  131  and 132).  .",

CURRENT MODE OF GOVERNANCE: COMBINATION OF THE ROLES OF CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nAt  the  conclusion  of  the  May  16,  2018  General  Meeting  having renewed  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier's  term  as  Director,  the  Board  of Directors  decided  to  maintain  the  unity  of  the  functions  of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer entrusted to him.\n\nAs part of the annual assessment of its operation conducted at the end of 2021 and presented to the Board on February 15, 2022, the members  decided  that  the  existing  governance  was  balanced. This mode of Executive Management of the Company allows for regular,  personalized  exchanges  between  the  Shareholders  and the Executive Management through a single contact person, who has an in-depth knowledge of the Group and its businesses and makes  it  possible  to  ensure  that  the  definition  of  the  Group's strategy  takes  due  account  of  Shareholders'  expectations  and interests over the long term. This organization is also in keeping with the very specific shareholding structure of Air Liquide which has  always  consisted,  alongside  institutional  investors  from  all continents, of a significant number of individual shareholders (who hold  33%  of  the  capital  at  the  end  of  2021),  accompanying  the Group over the long term. In this regard, the Company regularly organizes, in particular through its Shareholder Services, meetings between  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the individual Shareholders. Accordingly, the Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer  chairs  the  Shareholders'  Communication Committee, which met three times in 2021, by video-conference in the context of the public health crisis.\n\nThe  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  also  regularly  meets the  institutional  shareholders,  through  the  intermediary  of  the Investor Relations Service, either individually or at group meetings which are organized several times a year. These are essentially question and answer sessions. In 2021, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier met with some  forty  institutional  investors  by  video-conference  in  small groups or one-on-one meetings, and over 300 investors in plenary sessions.  He  also  had  discussions  with  financial  analysts  during two  question  and  answer  sessions.  He  laid  out,  with  the Management team, the Group's sustainable development strategy and objectives in March 2021 during a live virtual event streamed publicly on the Air Liquide site and watched by some 300 investors and financial analysts.\n\nA procedure is in place which enables the Board of Directors to be informed  of  contacts  made  between  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer and the principal Shareholders.\n\nThe principal applicable governance rules are described below:\n\n- \u25a0 the  presence  of  an  independent  Lead  Director,  Mr  JeanPaul Agon,  who  has  specific  powers,  including  the  power  to ask the Chairman to convene the Board of Directors on a given agenda,  the  Chairman  being  bound  by  that  request.  The Lead  Director  may  be  asked  by  the  other  Directors  for individual  meetings,  whenever  they  consider  necessary  and the Directors are regularly questioned on their level of dialogue with the Lead Director. In order to further enrich the dialog with the  major  Shareholders,  the  latter  have  the  right,  at  their request,  to  meet  with  the  Lead  Director  (three  meetings  thus took place in 2021);\n\n- \u25a0 the  composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors  which  ensures  a preponderance of independent Directors and a balance of skills and nationalities. The articles of association grant a power to one-third  of  the  Directors  to  convene  a  Board  meeting  and determine  its  agenda,  if  a  Board  meeting  has  not  been convened for over two months. In addition, the Directors have the possibility of setting up working groups within the Board in the  event  of  a  significant  acquisition.  Every  year,  the  Board holds  an  executive  session,  chaired  by  the  Lead  Director, without  the  presence  of  the  Executive  Officers  and  former corporate officers or of any person internal to the Group;\n- \u25a0 the existence of specialized Committees on appointments and governance, remuneration, audit and environment and society. A  monitoring  task  was  entrusted  to  the  Appointments  and Governance  Committee  which  is  responsible  for  supervising the  proper  working  of  the  governance  bodies.  In  this  regard, pursuant  to  the  internal  regulations,  this  Committee  is  the organ of dialogue between the non-executive Directors and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in particular in the event of  conflicts  within  the  Board;  it  monitors  the  changes  in  the Corporate Governance practices and the process for evaluating  the  Board.  Since  2014,  as  part  of  the  annual evaluation  questionnaires,  the  Directors  are  systematically questioned  on  the  mode  of  exercise  of  the  Executive Management  (combination  of  roles)  and  on  the  actual individual  participation  of  the  members  to  the  work  of  the Board. Each  year, the Appointments  and  Governance Committee considers the procedure for the replacement of the Executive Management in the event of an emergency situation.\n\nThe  relationship  between  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 a balanced organization:\n- -limits  on  the  powers of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Board's agreement being required for significant transactions,\n- -regular  interactions  between  the  non-executive  Directors and the members of the Executive Committee at the time of specific  presentations  made  to  the  Board,  in  particular during the full-day session on strategy or during Committee meetings. The Directors may ask to meet members of the Executive Committee at any time,\n- -regular information being  provided  to  the  Directors, including in-between Board meetings;\n- \u25a0 an  annual  review  of  the  assessment  of  performance  and remuneration of the Executive Officers by the Committee which is  always  carried  out  without  the  presence  of  the  relevant Executive Officer;\n- \u25a0 the Executive Committee, which now comprises 14 members, ensures the coordination between the various Group programs and activities. The Executive Committee focuses principally on the  review  of  Group's  strategy,  operational  management  in terms  of  objectives,  state  of  progress  and  action  plans,  the conduct of projects for change, Human Resources strategy and development. The three Executive Vice Presidents form part of the Executive Committee.",

SEPARATION OF THE FUNCTIONS OF CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER BEGINNING ON JUNE 1, 2022\n\nThe Appointments and Governance Committee began its work on the  succession  of  the  Executive    Officer  as  of  2018.  This  work focused  on  the  most  appropriate  governance  structure  and  the choice  of  the  Executive  Management  candidate  that  might succeed  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier,  whose  position  as  a  Director  will  be proposed for renewal at the General Meeting of May 2022.\n\nOn the Committee's recommendation, the Board of Directors on November  30,  2021,  announced  its  intention  to  separate  the functions  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  from  Chief  Executive  Officer and to renew Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's term as Chairman of the Board of Directors, subject to his position as Director being renewed by the General Meeting of May 2022. The Board of Directors considers that the announced governance structure will provide the Group in the context of the succession with Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's unparalleled experience  following  his  20  years  at  the  Company's  helm,  his commitment  to  promoting  the  Group's  culture  and  values,  his governance expertise founded on transparency and close ties with the Company's Shareholders.\n\nThe  work  of  the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee intensified in 2020 and 2021 and were conducted in keeping with Air  Liquide's  fundamental  values,  the  Group's  interests  and notably those of its Shareholders, in addition to the continuity of the  strategy. The Appointments and Governance Committee met 18 times to define and then detail the succession plan.\n\nThe  Committee  reviewed  and  analyzed  the  Group's  main  talent and selected candidates exhibiting the required skills and qualities most  suited  to  the  Group's  future  challenges.  A  study  of  the evolution of the chosen candidates' careers and their achievements  in  their  managerial  responsibilities  was  conducted by  the  Committee  throughout  the  process.  The  Committee decided that, in light of the quality of profiles examined, an internal candidate  should  be  prioritized.  The  Board  of  Directors  was regularly notified about the various stages in the selection process conducted by the Appointments and Governance Committee.\n\nThe  Committee  decided  that  the  skills,  depth  of  experience  and personal  qualities  of  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  made  him  the  best candidate  to  succeed  to  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier.  As  a  result, Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow's  appointment  was  recommended  to  the Board of Directors with the full consent of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier. Having deemed Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's qualities to be well aligned with the Group's  performance  and  development  strategy,  the  Board decided in principle to appoint him as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow joined the Air Liquide Group in 1993. After a wide-ranging,  international  career,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  has  the benefit  of  his  extensive  experience  of  the  Group,  combining strategic vision and knowledge of its business lines. A member of the Executive Committee as Executive Vice President, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow currently supervises in particular the Europe Industries,  Healthcare  in  Europe  and Africa  Middle  East  &  India Hubs. The Global Healthcare activity, the Innovation, Technologies,  Digital  and  IT  functions  are  also  under  his supervision as well as the Customer orientation strategy.\n\nMr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow's  appointment  as  Director  will  also  be proposed  to  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2022.  The  Board  of Directors in fact considers essential for the Chief Executive Officer to participate as Director in the discussions and resolutions of the Board in charge of outlining the Company's strategic orientations. His  appointment  as  Director  ensures  a  perfect  balance  of governance and allows Shareholders to be involved in this choice. To comply with the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code and as his  predecessor  had  done,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  intends  to terminate  his  employment  contract  by  resigning  when  his appointment as Chief Executive Officer takes effect.\n\nBy blending continuity and renewal, the Board would like to adopt this new governance to provide a fluid and balanced organization at the conclusion of the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, effective June 1, 2022.\n\nThe  respective  missions  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and Chairman of  the  Board  of  Directors  beginning  on  June  1,  2022, which  were  examined  and  defined  by  the  February  15,  2022 Board  in  its  decision  in  principle  and  will  be  formalized  in  the Board's internal regulations, are described below.\n\nAs part of this separated governance, a proposal has also been put  forth  for  the  Lead  Director's  functions  to  be  maintained  (see information on the Lead Director on pages 137 and 138).\n\n## Tasks and Powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nAs  an  Executive  Officer,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  who  alone oversees  and  manages  the  operations  of  the  Company,  is invested  with  the  broadest  powers  to  act  in  all  circumstances  in the Company's name subject to certain decisions to be submitted to  prior  authorization  of  the  Board  of  Directors  as  established  in the articles of association and described in the internal regulations (see below).\n\nPursuant  to  article  13  of  the  articles  of  association,  the  prior authorization of the Board of Directors is required for the following decisions affecting the Company  or, as applicable, the 'Group'  (encompassing  the  Company  and  the  'controlled companies'):\n\n- a. Sureties, endorsements and guarantees given by the Company for an individual amount in excess of 100 million euros or for an annual  cumulative  amount  in  excess  of  500  million  euros, subject  to  the  specific  resolutions  taken  by  the  Board  of Directors.\n- b. External  sales  or  contributions  (to  companies  other  than majority controlled companies) concerning the Group:\n- -of real estate assets for an individual amount in excess of 80  million  euros  or  for  an  annual  cumulative  amount  in excess of 150 million euros;\n- -of  equity  investments,  either  in  whole  or  in  part,  for  an individual  amount in excess of 250 million euros or for an annual cumulative amount in excess of 400 million euros;\n- -signing of any merger, demerger agreement or agreement for  a  partial  business  transfer,  for  an  individual  amount  in excess  of  250  million  euros  or  for  an  annual  cumulative amount  in  excess  of  400  million  euros,  subject  to  the specific  provisions  applicable  to  the  Company  as  set  out below;\n- -of  lines  of  business,  for  an  individual  amount  in  excess  of 250 million euros or an annual cumulative amount in excess of 400 million euros.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

He  is  responsible  for  calling  meetings  of  the Board  of  Directors.  He  sets  the  dates  and  agenda  for  Board meetings, manages the conduct of the meetings themselves and leads their discussions.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors is in charge of the smooth running of the Company's bodies.

Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe internal regulations stipulate that:\n\n'The members are chosen for their skills, their integrity, their independence  of  mind  and  their  determination  to  take  into account the interests of all shareholders.'\n\n'Diversity  policy  concerning  the  Board  of  Directors :  the composition  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  with  regard  to  its members appointed by the Annual General Meeting upon the proposal  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  shall  reflect  diversity  and complementarity  of  experience,  in  particular  international experience, nationalities, age, gender, cultures and expertise, including  a  significant  number  of  executive  managers  or former executive managers; the Board of Directors shall look for persons possessing skills in the following areas: marketing, services, industry, finance, health, research and technology.'\n\nThe Board of Directors, which has 13 members, reflects a diversity of  profiles,  experience  and  complementarity  of  skills,  which  is appropriate  for  the  issues  faced  by  Air  Liquide.  The  Board  of Directors  considers  that  compliance  with  the  diversity  policy criteria listed above contributes to the quality of its debates.\n\nThe diversity policy which applies to the members of the Board is accompanied  by  guidelines,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  internal regulations  which,  although  not  written  in  stone,  also  guide  the composition of the Board, in particular in terms of the number of Directors appointed by the General Meeting (in principle between 10  and  12),  the  balance  between  (former)  executive  managers and  external  members,  the  duration  of  the  terms  of  office (four  years,  principle  of  staggering  renewals,  the  proportion  of members appointed by the General Meeting in office for more than twelve  years  cannot  exceed  one-third),  age  or  the  proportion  of members who qualify as independent, thus aiming to comply with the recommended  principles  in  terms  of  good  Corporate Governance practices.\n\nThe Board of Directors relies upon the work of the Appointments and  Governance  Committee  in  order  to  propose  to  the  General Meeting, any new appointment or renewal of the terms of office of Directors.  The  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee,  in liaison with an external consultant, carries out its search for new members  on  the  basis  of  its  evaluation  of  the  needs  and developments  expressed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  in consideration  of  the  principles  and  the  diversity  policy  defined above.  Based  on  a  list  of  candidates  submitted  by  the  external consultant, the Appointments and Governance Committee makes its initial selection. Once this first selection is made, the consultant schedules interviews with the potential candidates preselected by the Committee. After the interviews, the consultant draws up a list of candidates for review by the Committee and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, who takes part in the recruitment process. Meetings with candidates are held with Committee members and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Finally, the Committee submits to the Board a recommendation to appoint one or several candidates.\n\nIn 2021, the Appointments and Governance Committee began the search for candidates, including those with an excellent knowledge  of  Asia,  in  anticipation  of  the  replacement  of Ms  Sin  Leng  Low  whose  renewal  of  term  of  office  will  not  be proposed to the 2022 General Meeting. Indeed, Ms Sin Leng Low, who will not have quite reached the statutory age limit as of the date of the General Meeting, notified the Board of Directors that she  did  not  wish  to  be  a  candidate  for  renewal  of  her  term  of office. This work, which has been reported to the Board, forms part of the policy to continue to improve the diversity of profiles and the complementarity  of  experience,  expertise  and  cultures  on  the Board of Directors.\n\nIn accordance  with  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Code,  the  internal regulations  provide  for  a  maximum  of  four  other  terms  of  office held  within  French  or  foreign  listed  companies  for  non-executive Directors,  and  two  other  terms  of  office  for  Executive  Directors. Moreover,  an  obligation  to  provide  information  on  the  terms  of office held in other companies, including their participation on the Board  Committees  of  such  companies,  is  provided  for  nonexecutive Directors. Moreover, an obligation to ask for the opinion of  the  Board  of  Directors  (which  makes  a  decision  on  the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee)  before  accepting  a  new  corporate  office  in  a  listed company is also provided for the Company's Executive Officers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independence of Board members\n\nBased on the full definition of independence set out in the AFEP/ MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance, the internal regulations define  the  criteria  applied  within  the  Company  to  assess the independence of a Board member.\n\n'A member of the Board of Directors is independent when he/ she  has  no  relationship  of  any  kind  with  the  Company,  its Group  or  its  management  which  may  interfere  with  his/her freedom to exercise his/her judgment.\n\nIn  this  spirit,  the  criteria  which  may  provide  guidance  to  the Board in order to classify a member as independent will be as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 he/she is not and has never been an employee or member of the Executive Management of the Company;\n- \u25a0 he/she  does  not  hold  office  as  Chairman,  Chief  Executive Officer, Chairman or member of the Management Board of a company in which the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the  Chief  Executive  Officer  or  a  Senior  Executive  Vice President  of  Air  Liquide  is  a  Director  or  member  of  the Supervisory Board;\n- \u25a0 he/she  must  not  have  any  business  relations  with  the Air  Liquide  Group  which  represent  a  significant  part  of  the business activities (i) of the Company of which the Director is  a  member  of  the  Executive  Management  or  (ii)  of Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 he/she does not have any close family links with the Chief Executive Officer or a Senior Executive Vice President;\n- \u25a0 he/she  must  not  have  been  an  auditor  of  the  Company during the previous five years;\n- \u25a0 he/she  must  not  have  been  a  member  of  the  Board  of Directors  (or  Supervisory  Board)  of  the  Company  for  more than 12 years.'\n\nEvery year, an assessment of the independence of the Directors appointed  by  the  General  Meeting  is  included  on  the  agenda  of the  Board.  In  reliance  on  the  work  of  the  Appointments  and Governance  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  reviews  each  of the criteria contained in the Board's internal regulations and in the AFEP/MEDEF  Code  for  assessing  the  independence  of  each Director.\n\nThe Air Liquide Group is especially attentive to conflicts of interest situations,  even  potential  ones  and,  for  the  criteria  relating  to business relations, the Board relies upon a chart summarizing the purchases and sales implemented during the previous fiscal year between  companies  of  the Air  Liquide  Group  and  companies  of groups  within  which  an  Air  Liquide  Director  appointed  by  the General Meeting (or proposed Director) also exercises a term of office  or  executive  role  (see  on  this  point  the  information  on  the mandates  held  by  the  Directors  on  pages  155  to  168).  Such figures are weighed against the total purchases and sales of each group to measure  their significance. In addition to the aforementioned quantitative criteria,  the  Board  of  Directors carries  out  a qualitative review  of  the  situation  of  each  Director holding a term of office or executive role within the relevant group.\n\nFor  the  2021  fiscal  year,  this  chart  shows  that  the  amounts  of sales by the Air Liquide Group to any of the relevant groups or of its  purchases  from  any  such  groups  do  not  exceed  0.2%  of  the total sales or purchases by the Air Liquide Group or by any of the relevant groups.\n\nFrom  a  qualitative  point  of  view,  it  was  also  noted  that  neither Air  Liquide  nor  the  relevant  groups  have  a  relationship  of economic dependence  or exclusivity, as they are large international  groups  with  highly  diversified  activities.  It  was asserted  that,  in  light  of  the  highly  decentralized  organization  of the  Air  Liquide  Group,  its  size,  the  diversity  of  its  businesses, which  are,  for  the  most  part,  extremely  local,  and  its  broad geographical  presence,  the  relevant  Directors  do  not  become involved  in  business  relations  which  are  conducted,  within  the Air Liquide Group, entirely by the managers of the relevant hubs, Clusters (groups of countries/entities) and countries.\n\nAfter  a  review  of  each  individual  situation,  the  Board  concluded that  none  of  the  Directors  has  to  exercise  a  direct  or  indirect decision-making power in the contractual negotiations  leading  to the  business  affairs  discussed.  If  this  were  not  the  case,  he/she would  have  to  declare  a  conflict  of  interest  to  the  Board.  This matter  would  then  be  addressed  in  accordance  with  the  ethical rules provided for in the internal regulations.",

Universal Registration Document). The criteria used are very largely inspired by the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance. The Board continues to consider, however, that the Company's former employees or officers cannot be deemed to be independent even if they ceased to hold office more than five years ago .\n\nFurther  to  the  recommendation  made by the French financial market authority, a table showing the list of Directors in 2021 who are considered to be independent in light of the criteria provided for in the internal regulations and the AFEP/MEDEF Code, is set out below.\n\n|                                                          | As at December 31, 2021 Independence of the Directors elected by the General  Meeting in light of the criteria in the   | As at December 31, 2021 Independence of the Directors elected by the General  Meeting in light of the criteria in the   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                          | Internal regulations                                                                                                    | AFEP/MEDEF Code                                                                                                         |\n| Beno\u00eet Potier -

Pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the AFEP/ MEDEF  Code,  Mr  Philippe  Dubrulle  and  Ms  Fatima  Tighlaline, Directors representing the employees, were not taken into account when calculating this ratio.\n\nGiven the new composition of the Board of Directors following the Combined  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2022,  and  subject  to approval of the proposed resolutions regarding (i) the renewal of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier and the appointment of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as Directors,  both  considered  as  non-independent  by  the  Board  of Directors, and (ii) the renewal of the term of office of Ms Annette Winkler considered as an independent Director by the Board, the percentage of Independent Directors on the Board of Directors would be 80%.\n\n## 5. Professional ethics of Directors - Rights and obligations of Directors\n\nThe internal regulations summarize the main obligations imposed on Directors. The Director represent all the shareholders and shall act in all circumstances in the Company's corporate interest.\n\nEach Director  undertakes  to  meet  the  obligations  imposed  upon him/her  by  the  articles  of  association  and  the  various  legal, regulatory or internal Company provisions and, more specifically, the internal rules relating to the prevention of market abuse or the obligations to report transactions in the Company's shares.

        "page_content": "## Composition, preparation and organization of the work of the Board of Directors\n\nConsidering  the  restrictions  introduced  to  contain  the  spread  of coronavirus,  especially  early  in  the  year,  some  members  were unable  to  attend  Board  and  Committee  meetings  in  person  and some meetings were fully remote in respect of sanitary measures. The  highest  quality  videoconferencing  facilities  were  used  for these meetings to verify Directors' identity and facilitate  effective participation.\n\nEach Director shall keep him/herself informed and devote the time and attention required to perform his/her duties.\n\nUnder the Company's articles of association, each Director must hold at least 500 registered shares in the Company. The Director shall inform the Company of the number of shares which he/she holds. This provision do not apply to the Directors representing the employees.\n\nUnder the internal regulations:\n\n'The  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  must  inform  the Board of any situation of conflict of interest, even if it is only potential, with the Company and must refrain from taking part in  the  discussions  and  in  the  vote  on  the  corresponding decision.'\n\nThis  obligation  is  completed  by  a  formal  annual  declaration provided to the Company by each Director, attesting the absence of a potential conflict of interest involving him/her.\n\nAt  its  November  30,  2021  meeting,  the  Board  of  Directors  took note of the decision of Mr Pierre Breber to end his term of office as a Director effective as of November 26, 2021, due to a potential conflict of interest. This decision comes in response to Chevron's launching  of  a  new  energies  business  line  in  competition  with Air Liquide's hydrogen business line.\n\n## Declarations\n\nPursuant  to  the  declarations  made  to  the  Company  by  each corporate officer, the Company confirms that the corporate officers have no family ties with any other corporate officer and have not been convicted of fraud at any point during the last five years.\n\n## 6. Lead Director\n\nPursuant to the terms of article 13 of the articles of association, the  Board  of  Directors  is  obliged  to  appoint  a  Lead  Director,  as long  as  the  roles  of  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  are combined.\n\nWithin this framework, on May  3, 2017, and on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors appointed Mr Jean-Paul Agon, an  independent  Director,  as  Lead  Director.  Mr  Jean-Paul Agon's term  of  office  as  Director,  having  expired,  was  renewed  by  the General Meeting on May 16, 2018, for a period of four years.\n\nAt the end of that General Meeting, the Board of Directors decided to  renew  Mr  Jean-Paul Agon's  position  as  Lead  Director  for  the period of his term of office on the Appointments and Governance Committee. The same meeting of the Board of Directors decided to renew  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  position  as  Chair  of  the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  for  the  period  of  his term of office as Director.\n\nNo  official  charge  and/or  public  sanction  has  been  pronounced against  them  by  the  statutory  or  regulatory  authorities  (including any professional bodies) and they have not been barred by a court from  serving  as  a  member  of  a  Supervisory  Board,  Board  of Directors or other management body of an issuer or from taking part in the management or conduct of an issuer's business affairs at  any  point  during  the  last  five  years.  They  have  no  conflict  of interest (not even a potential conflict) with regard to L'Air Liquide S.A. The potential conflict  of  interest  regarding  Mr  Pierre  Breber (see above) led him to end his term of office as a Director.\n\nNo  arrangement  or  agreement  has  been  entered  into  with  the major  shareholders,  customers,  suppliers  or  other  persons, pursuant  to  which  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.'s  corporate  officers  were selected  as  such.  Such  persons  have  not  agreed  any  restriction on the transfer, within a certain period of time, of their holding in the capital of L'Air Liquide S.A. apart from the rules relating to the prevention  of  market  abuse,  the  statutory  obligation  for  the members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  who  are  elected  by  the General  Meeting  to  hold  at  least  500  registered  shares  in  the Company  throughout  the  period  of  their  term  of  office  and  the shareholding obligations which apply to the Executive Officers.\n\nA proposal will be submitted to the General Meeting of May 2022 to  extend  the  rectification  period  relating  to  the  owning  by  the Directors of 500 Company shares, from three months currently to six  months  (in  compliance  with  the  legal  time  limit),  (for  more information, see pages 427 and 428).\n\nThe  corporate  officers  have  not  been  linked  to  any  bankruptcy, receivership or liquidation at any point during the last five years.\n\nFinally, the Appointments and Governance Committee, under the management  of  the  Lead  Director,  currently  has  the  task  of preventing potential situations of conflict of interest on the Board.\n\nAs  every  year,  an  internal  memo  on  the  prevention  of  market abuse was sent to the Directors at the beginning of 2022 which outlines  in  greater  detail  the  applicable  legal  and  regulatory obligations by which they are bound pursuant to the European and national provisions.\n\nAll  the  provisions  governing  Directors'  rights  and  obligations  are included  in  the  manual  for  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors which is updated once a year.\n\nOn  the  recommendation  of  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  at  the  request  of Mr Jean-Paul Agon, who will have a total of twelve years of office on the Board of Directors at the end of the General Meeting, not to propose  to  the  General  Meeting  of  May  2022  the  renewal  of Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  term  of  office  as  a  Director.  Mr  JeanPaul Agon was warmly thanked for his contribution to the work of the Board of Directors, which he has supported since 2010, for his exceptional commitment as a Lead Director and Chairman of the Appointments and Governance Committee, and for his participation in the work of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe Board of Directors made a decision in principle relating to the appointment  of  an  independent  Lead  Director  with  unchanged\n\npowers  at  the  end  of  the  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2022. Moreover, in the context of the separated governance due to take effect  on  June  1,  2022,  the  functions  and  responsibilities  of  the Lead Director would be maintained.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

He conducts, upon delegation from the Chairman of the Appointments and Governance Committee when he is not the Committee Chairman himself, the work of the Appointments and Governance Committee concerning the governance tasks entrusted to the Committee,  notably  for  the  examination  of  the  choice  of  general  management  organization,  the  review  of  changes  in  and application of the rules of Corporate Governance, the preparation of the evaluation of the functioning of the Board, the review of ethical  issues,  the  attention  paid  to  the  proper  functioning  of  the  governance  bodies,  in  particular  in  the  transmission  of  the information requested by independent Directors; on all these points, the Lead Director can formulate all proposals and make any suggestions he considers necessary.\n- -More  specifically,  the  Lead  Director  coordinates,  within  the  Committee,  the  implementation  of  the  procedures  aimed  at identifying and analyzing potential situations of conflicts of interest on the Board; he draws the attention of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to potential situations of conflicts of interest identified in this manner.\n- -He reports on these matters to the Board of Directors.\n- 2. The Lead Director, after receiving the opinion of the Appointments and Governance Committee, may ask the Chairman of the Board of Directors to convene a meeting of the Board of Directors on any specified agenda, at any time and as often as required in the interests of the Company.\n- -Under the conditions provided for in article IV of these regulations, the Lead Director may also receive a delegation of authority to convene a meeting of the Board of Directors at the request of at least one-third of its members.\n- 3. The Lead Director, after receiving the opinion of the Appointments and Governance Committee, may propose the inclusion of additional points on the agenda for any Board meeting to the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n- 4. Once a year, the Lead Director calls a meeting of the members of the Board of Directors for a session to be held without the presence of the Group's executive Directors (or former executive Directors) or internal Directors and employee representatives. He organizes and leads the discussions of this annual session which he chairs.\n- 5. The Lead Director reviews the requests made by shareholders with regard to governance and makes sure that they are answered.\n- 6. The Lead Director reports on his activities to the Board of Directors every year.\n- 7. The Lead Director makes sure that a report is made to the shareholders on the governance issues falling within the scope of his responsibilities. A report on his activities is made in the Universal Registration Document.'\n\nB) provide that, within  the  scope  of  the  annual  evaluation  of  the Board,  the  Directors  will  be  systematically  asked  to  indicate whether  it  appears  to  them  to  be  necessary  for  the  Company's Executive Management organization to be reexamined;\n\nC) also provide, without prejudice to the provisions on convening the  Board  of  Directors,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  internal regulations of the Board of Directors, that the Lead Director, after receiving  the  opinion  of  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee,  may  ask  the  Chairman  to  convene  the  Board  of\n\nDirectors on a given agenda; this right may be exercised at any time  and  as  often  as  the  Company's  interests  may  require.  The Chairman is bound by such a request.\n\nIn  addition,  certain  governance  measures  promote  discussions between the Lead Director and the Directors and dialog between the Lead Director and the Shareholders (see page 130).\n\nSee  page  151  for  the  2021  report  on  the  exercise  of  the Lead Director's term of office.\n\n## 7. Role and tasks of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors determines  the  orientations  of  the Company's  activities  and  ensures  their  implementation,  in accordance  with  its  corporate  interest,  taking  into  account the social and environmental stakes of its activity . Accordingly, it examines and approves the Group's major strategic orientations. It ensures  the  implementation  of  these  orientations  by  the Executive Management.\n\nThe Board of Directors  regularly  reviews,  in  connection  with  the strategy which it has defined, opportunities and the financial, legal, operational,  social  and  environmental  risks,  together  with  the measures taken  accordingly.  It  ensures  that  a  system  has  been implemented  for  the  prevention  and  detection  of  corruption  and influence peddling.\n\nSubject  to  the  powers  attributed  to  the  General  Meetings  and within the limit of the corporate purpose, the Board deals with any issue  concerning  the  smooth  running  of  the  Company  and manages  corporate  business  pursuant  to  its  decisions.  The internal regulations stipulate that the specific powers vested in the Board of  Directors  include,  in  particular,  the  choice  of  Executive Officers, the determination of their remuneration and setting of the terms and conditions governing their employment and performance of their duties in accordance with current regulations; the  appointment  of  the  Lead  Director;  the  convening  of  the\n\nGeneral  Meeting  (and  determination  of  the  agenda  and  draft resolutions  within  this  scope)  ;  the  preparation  of  the  Financial Statements and Annual Management Report (including the Extrafinancial Performance Declaration) and the Corporate Governance report; the definition of the Group's gender policy in leaderships; establishing its proper rules for functioning (formation of Committees,  breakdown  of  Directors'  annual  remuneration,  and more).  In  addition,  the  Board  of  Directors  may  also  decide  or authorize simple bond issues.\n\nThe  Board  also  exercises  the  powers  delegated  to  it  by  the General Meeting, particularly with regard to the granting of stock options  or  award  of  performance  shares,  issues  of  marketable securities, share buyback or employee savings programs.",

Acting on a proposal by Executive Management, the Board  sets  the  diversity  targets  for  the  Group's  leaderships. Executive Management makes a submission to the Board on how the targets will be implemented, together with an action plan and schedule for completion. Executive Management reports its results to the Board every year.\n\nIn this context, the Board of Directors, at its meeting in February 2022, on the recommendation  of  the  Appointments  and Governance  Committee,  noted  the  progress  made  in  2021  in connection with the targets for 2025, namely 35% women at the managers and professionals level and 25% of executive positions (senior executives) held by women. At this meeting, the Board of Directors also set the objectives concerning the Executive  Committee  for  2026.  These  objectives,  which  are incorporated  into  the  non-discrimination  and  diversity  policy,  are set  out  in  detail  at  pages  326  and  364  of  this  Universal Registration  Document  and  are  supplemented  by  information relating  to  the  manner  in  which  the  Company  tries  to  obtain  a balanced  representation  of  women  and  men  on  this  Committee. The results concerning the gender mix with regard to the 10% of positions which carry the most responsibility are contained also at pages 326 et 364.\n\n## 8. Functioning of the Board of Directors\n\nInforming  the  Directors : the  internal  regulations  define  the methods  for  informing  the  Directors.  They  specify,  in  particular, that  prior  to  Board  meetings,  a  file  of  meeting  documentation  is sent  out  to  Board  members  covering  the  items  on  the  agenda. Files are provided in electronic form on a dedicated platform. The Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  assisted,  if  need  be,  by members  of  the  management  teams,  presents  to  the  Board  of Directors  a  quarterly  report  on  the  Company's  management,  the draft  annual  and  interim  Financial  Statements  and  the  various issues  requiring  the  Board's  authorization  or  opinion.  For  major substantive  issues  (major  projects,  M&A...),  a  very  detailed summary is prepared. Any member of the Board of Directors may request  any  additional  information  he/she  considers  necessary. He/she makes such a request to the Chairman of the Board.\n\nConduct  of  meetings : the  internal  regulations  define  the frequency of meetings and the rules for convening meetings and for participation by video-conference or telecommunications. They provide,  in  particular,  for  the  Lead  Director's  right  to  ask  for  a meeting  of  the  Board  of  Directors  to  be  convened  with  any specified  agenda  and  also  for  the  conditions  of  the  executive session  attended  by  the  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors without the presence of the Group's Executive Directors (or former Executive Directors) or internal Directors and employee representatives,  chaired  by  the  Lead  Director.  The  Statutory Auditors  are  also  heard  during  the  meetings  to  review  the Financial Statements.\n\nDuring the meeting, a summary presentation of the items is then made, allowing considerable time for exchanges and discussions. The  presentations  give  rise  to  questions  and  are  followed  by discussions.  A  round-the-table  discussion  is  systematically  held concerning  the  significant  points,  before  moving  to  vote  on  the items on the agenda. Detailed written minutes are then sent to the members for their review and comments, before the approval of the Board of Directors at its next meeting.\n\nPursuant to the possibility offered by law, the General Meeting of May  4,  2022  is  asked  to  amend  the  Company's  articles  of association  to  enable  the  Board  of  Directors  to  take  certain decisions  through  written  consultation.  (For  the  full  details,  see page 428 of this Document).\n\nFormation  of  Committees :  the  internal  regulations  define  the task  and  operating  procedures  for  the  four  Board  Committees (a description of Committees' tasks is provided at pages146, 149, 152 and 153).\n\nTraining measures : the internal regulations stipulate that training measures are offered to the Directors relating to the Company's businesses  and  specific  features,  in  particular  by  means  of  site visits  or  meetings  with  senior  executives,  and  to  the  Company's Corporate  Social  Responsibility  challenges.  More  particularly, trainings  on  the  Group's  accounting,  financial  and  operational specificities are offered to the members of the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\nEach  year,  the  Directors  are  asked  about  their  training requirements  and  a  training  request  form  is  systematically proposed once a year to each Director and to the new Directors. It consists of proposals for meetings with the heads of each of the major business lines and main central functions, and site visits.\n\nWithin  this  framework,  the  Directors  may  ask  to  meet  Executive Committee members or ask for specific training for each business line, activity or geographical zone.\n\nIn  2021,  focus  was  put  on  training  measures  for  the  three  new Directors appointed by the General Meeting of May 2021 and on the  continuing  training  measures  for  Directors  appointed  by  the General Meeting of May 2020. Some Directors took part in training measures/informational  meetings  regarding  in  particular  Finance and on the business lines of Healthcare/Europe Industries, Large Industries, Electronics, Global Markets & Technologies, Digital and H2E  with  the  concerned  members  of  the  Executive  Committee. Moreover, one-on-one meetings were also held regarding Human Resources  and  environmental  aspects  with  the  members  of  the Executive Committee in charge of these subjects. An 'Americas' presentation was also provided to American Directors.\n\nThe  Directors  representing  the  employees  may  receive  training relating to their rights and obligations as Directors, in accordance with  the  applicable  regulations.This  time  is  considered  as  actual working time and remunerated as such.\n\nThe  breakdown  of  the  trainings  carried  out  in  2021  by  the  two Directors  representing  the  employees  is  stated  on  page  140 below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Participation of employee representatives on the Board of Directors\n\n## 9.1.   WITH A DELIBERATIVE VOTE\n\nMr  Philippe  Dubrulle  was  appointed  in  2014  as  Director representing  the  employees  by  the  Group  committee  in  France, and was renewed in this quality on December 6, 2017. His term of office  is  due  to  expire  at  the  end  of  the  General  Meeting  of May  2022.  At  its  plenary  meeting  on  December  16,  2021,  the Group  committee  in  France,  in  charge  of  appointing  a  Director representing the employees pursuant to the articles of association when  the  number  of  Directors  (calculated  according  to  article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial Code) is below or equal to eight, renewed Mr Philippe Dubrulle for a period of four years which will expire at the end of the General Meeting called in 2026 to approve the 2025 Financial Statements.\n\nPursuant  to  the  applicable  regulations  at  the  time  of  his appointment,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Appointments  and Governance  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  had  defined  the amount  of  time  allocated  to  Mr  Philippe  Dubrulle  for  the preparation  of  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the Committees,  and  the  training.  Within  this  framework,  in  2016, Mr Philippe Dubrulle had followed the training course provided by Sciences  Po  in  partnership  with  the  IFA  and  obtained  the Company Director's certificate.\n\nAs part of the renewal of his term of office in 2017, the Board of Directors had defined a new training program. Mr  Philippe  Dubrulle,  who  in  2020  continued  his  training  in  the company's sustainable model organized by Centrale Supelec\\_Exed,  did  not  wish  to  follow  any  particular  external training in 2021.\n\nAppointed on October 1, 2020, by the European Works Council as Director representing the employees pursuant to the provisions of the  PACTE  Law  and  the  Company's  articles  of  association, Ms  Fatima  Tighlaline,  once  appointed,  participated  in  training sessions  organized  with  members  of  the  Executive  Committee regarding  specific  subject  areas  (including  Finance  and  Human Resources). In 2021, she also participated in sessions on subjects including Large Industries, H2E and Global Markets & Technologies.  Ms  Fatima  Tighlaline  also  completed  training  in 2021 provided  by  Sciences  Po,  in  partnership  with  the  IFA,  and obtained the Company Director's certificate.\n\nThe Board of Directors, in compliance with the PACTE Law and the  agreement  concluded  between  the  various  stakeholders  on December 10, 2021, defined the amount of time allocated to the employee Directors for (i) the preparation of meetings of the Board of Directors (15 hours/meeting) and of the Committees which they are  member  of  (5  hours/meeting)  as  well  as  (ii)  the  training (40 hours/year on a cumulative basis over the length of the term of office).\n\nMr  Philippe  Dubrulle  and  Ms  Fatima  Tighlaline  sit  on  the  Board with a deliberative vote. They are subject to all of the provisions of the internal regulations governing the rights and obligations of the Directors.\n\nWithin  the  scope  of  the  agreement  entered  into  with  the  various stakeholders  and  pursuant  to  the  provisions  in  force  within  the Group,  which  apply  to  all  the  employees  performing  duties  on Boards of Directors  of  the  Group  companies,  it  was  agreed  that employee Directors would not receive any remuneration.\n\nMr  Philippe  Dubrulle  is  also  a  member  of  the  Board  Committee which  is  in  charge  of  reviewing  the  environmental  and  societal issues. He contributes in particular to this Committee, as part of the assignments which are entrusted to it concerning the definition and roll-out of the Group's actions on environmental and societal matters,  the  vision  of  Group  employees,  who  are  essential stakeholders.  Mr  Philippe  Dubrulle,  who  had  made  known  his interest in issues relating to sustainable development, has sat on the  Environment  and  Society  Committee  since  it  was  formed,  in May 2017.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  announced  its  intention  to  appoint  a Director  representing  the  employees,  as  a  member  of  the Remuneration Committee beginning on May 4, 2022.\n\n## 9.2.   WITH AN ADVISORY VOTE\n\nSince the appointment in October 2020 of Ms Fatima Tighlaline as the  second  Director  representing  the  employees,  and  under  the agreement  entered  into  with  the  various  stakeholders,  a  sole member of the Social and Economic Council continues to attend Board of Directors' meetings with an advisory vote.\n\nThe delegate receives the same documents as those provided to the Directors for these meetings. The delegate is able to express his opinion on the questions discussed during the meetings.\n\nA  preparatory  meeting,  in  the  presence  of  a  member  of  the Executive Committee and the Secretary of the Board of Directors, is scheduled  before  each  Board  meeting.  This  preparatory meeting  is  the  opportunity  to  go  through  the  whole  file  for  the Board meeting with the Directors representing the employees and the Social and Economic Council delegate and to comment on the items  on  the  agenda.  It  offers  the  participants  the  opportunity  to raise their questions and make their initial comments.",

        "page_content": "## Composition, preparation and organization of the work of the Board of Directors\n\n## 10.  Appraisal of the Board of Directors\n\nThe internal regulations stipulate that:\n\n'The  Board  will  ensure  that  an  evaluation  is  carried  out periodically of its composition,  its  organization  and  its functioning as well as those of its Committees. An update will be made by the Board on this topic once a year and a formal evaluation will be carried out at least every three years. Within the scope of the evaluation of the Board, the Directors will, in particular, be asked to state whether it appears to them to be necessary for the choice of the Company's  general management organization to be re-examined.'\n\nAn evaluation of the functioning of the Board of Directors is carried out  every  year,  alternating,  one  year,  between  a  full  appraisal questionnaire leading to a summary showing the replies and the adoption  of  recommendations  for  action  and,  the  next  year,  a questionnaire  aimed  at  making  an  assessment  of  the  actions implemented in light of the recommendations made.\n\nAt  the  time  of  the  evaluation  conducted  in  2020  on  the  actions taken  following  the  full  evaluation  questionnaire  at  the  end  of 2019,  the  members  had  expressed  their  satisfaction  concerning the actions taken. They had also expressed a wish that the Board should continue to intensify its work on the Climate topics and on Sustainable Development strategy in general, with the assistance of the specialized Committees.  In  2021,  the  Sustainable Development strategy represented a very substantial share of the Board's  work,  notably  with  the  preparation  of  new  ESG/Climate Objectives communicated on March 23, 2021, the consolidation of investments  related  to  energy  transition,  or  the  roll-out  of  the hydrogen investment program (see pages 142 and 143 for more details of the work).\n\nA full evaluation of the functioning of the Board of Directors and its Committees  was  carried  out  in  2021.  In  this  regard,  a  full evaluation  questionnaire  was  submitted  to  the  members  of  the Board  of  Directors  and  individual  interviews  were  held  with  the Secretary to the Board.\n\nA  summary of the replies  to  this  full  questionnaire,  presented  to the Board by the Chairman of the Appointments and Governance Committee,  at  the  start  of  2022,  shows  a  very  favorable  overall perception of the way in which the Board operates. The members were unanimous in their praise for the quality of the governance surrounding  the  work  on  the  succession  to  the  Executive Management. They  also  highlight  the  freedom  of  expression  on the Board and the quality of members' contributions. They value the  exchanges  with  the  management  teams.  Feedback  is  very positive on the dialogue with the Lead Director and his significant level  of  commitment,  notably  in  connection  with  the  work  on succession. There is unanimous support for the executive session at the end of the year. The training courses offered, whose format was  adjusted  due  to  the  public  health  crisis,  were  considered useful and relevant, notably for the integration of new members. Areas of focus relate, in particular, to the future recruitments of an Asian  member  and  a  new  American  member,  continuing  to increase  meetings  with  management  and,  when  circumstances permit,  organizing  new  'deep  dive'  sessions  on  a  topical  issue (modeled  on  the  meeting  held  in  September  2020  focusing  on hydrogen),  together  with  site  visits.  The  wishes  expressed regarding  topics  of  interest  to  the  members  will  be  taken  into account  when  drawing  up  the  work  program  for  the  Board  and Committees.\n\nIn  light  of  the  collegiate  nature  of  the  Board,  the  assessment questionnaire  concentrates  on  the  collective  contribution  of members  to  the  Board  operation.  However,  the  questionnaire invites the Director to make an evaluation of the actual, individual contribution  of  Directors  in  the  reflections  of  the  Board  of Directors.  The  contribution  by  each  Director  is  assessed, furthermore,  by  the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee and then by the Board of Directors at the time of renewal of the terms of office of Directors and Committee members.\n\nThe  Board  also  decided  to  periodically  call  on  an  external consultant  within  the  scope  of  conducting  these  evaluations.  A comprehensive  external  evaluation  of  Board  operations  should take place in late 2022.\n\n## 11.  Executive session of the non-executive members of the Board of Directors\n\nPursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Code  which recommend  that  at  least  one  meeting  per  year  is  organized without  the  presence  of  the  executive  officers,  the  internal regulations stipulate that:\n\n'Once  a  year,  the  Lead  Director  calls  a  meeting  of  the members of  the  Board  of  Directors  for  a  session  to  be  held without  the  presence  of  the  Group's  executive  Directors  (or former executive Directors) or internal Directors and employee representatives.  He  organizes  and  leads  the  discussions  of this annual session which he chairs.'\n\nThe executive session is held at the close of a Board of Directors meeting  for  practical  purposes  and  availability  of  members.  The topics discussed by this meeting concern all of the work covered by  the  Board  of  Directors.  In  2021  and  as  it  had  done  in  prior years,  the  executive  session  took  place  at  the  close  of  the November  Board  of  Directors  meeting,  enabling  it  to  review  the work performed during the entire fiscal year, and in particular the preparation  of  the  succession.  A  report  was  provided  to  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

MONITORING OF THE GROUP'S MAIN STRATEGIES ON SIGNIFICANT ISSUES\n\nFollowing presentations made  in particular by Executive Management and certain senior executives, the Board of Directors closely considered the following in 2021:\n\n- i. monitoring  the impacts  of  the  covid-19  pandemic on  the Group and the measures put in place to protect the health of employees  on  an  organizational  level,  and  as  part  of  the relation with all stakeholders; continued fight against covid-19 by intensifying production and supply of medical oxygen in the hardest hit countries (India, Tunisia and others);\n- ii. assessing  performance ,  including,  in  particular  (i)  regularly monitoring the Group's financial performance, which improved in 2021 despite a still mixed health and economic situation, and the  Group  extra-financial  performance,  including  a  detailed review of extra-financial indicators and  their evolution, (ii) monitoring  of  the  Group's  efficiency  program  and  its alignment with the annual target of 400 million euros, (iii) the regular review of the Group's asset portfolio to focus on the key businesses or regions, which led in 2021 to the disposal of its subsidiaries Air Liquide Hellas and Vitalaire Hellas in Greece, and pursuit of a program of targeted acquisitions especially in Healthcare  in  Europe  (acquisition  of  Betamed  S.A.,  a  major Polish  player  in  home  healthcare)  and  in  the  Industrial Merchant business line in the United States and China;\n- iii. issues  regarding  the  Group's strategy and  medium-term outlook,  taking  into  account  environmental  and  social  stakes and analysis of the competitive environment; work on defining the  Group's  medium-term  objectives  and  the  outlines  of  the new medium term plan of the Group (2021-2025);",

With regard to the composition of its Committees, the Board of  Directors  decided  in  May  2021  to  renew  Mr  Xavier Huillard's  term  of  office  as  a  member  of  the Appointments and Governance Committee, Chairman of the Remuneration  Committee  and  member  of  the  Working Group Shareholder Relations ;\n- -Mr Brian Gilvary's resignation (1) from his term of office as Director  on  September  15,  2021.  The  Board  of  Directors took  note  of  this  resignation  at  its  September  29,  2021 meeting  and  reviewed  the  composition  of  the  Audit  and Accounts Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and of the Working  Group  Shareholder  Relations  on  which Mr Gilvary held a position;\n- -Mr  Pierre  Breber's  decision  to  end  his  term  as  Director effective November 26, 2021, owing to a potential conflict of interest which the Board noted at its meeting on November 30, 2021.\n- \u25a0 The  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee,  will  propose  that the General Meeting on May 4, 2022:\n- -in  connection  with  a  separated  governance  as  announced following  the  decision  in  principle  made  by  the  Board  of Directors in February, in view of the renewal of the term of office  of  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  the  appointment  of  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  as Chief Executive Officer:\n- - to  renew  for  a  period  of  four  years  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier's term of office as Director,\n- - to appoint for a period of four years Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as Director,",

Ms  Annette  Winkler  will continue to provide the Board of Directors with the benefit of her  experience  as  the  former  division  head  of  a  large German industrial group with an international reach and her in-depth knowledge of the automotive sector.\n- \u25a0 The  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Appointments and Governance Committee, decided:\n- -not  to  propose  the  renewal  of  Ms  Sin  Leng  Low's  term  of office as Director, which is due to expire at the close of the May  2022  General  Meeting.  This  term  of  office  could  in theory be renewed one last time since Ms Sin Leng Low will not have quite reached the statutory age limit of 70 years as of the date of the General Meeting of May 2022. The Board however took note of Ms Sin Leng Low's wish not to have her  term  of  office  renewed.  Ms  Sin  Leng  Low  was  very warmly thanked for her contribution to the work of the Board of Directors, of which she has been a member since 2014, and her participation in the work of the Audit and Accounts Committee, of which she has been a member since 2015;\n- -not to propose the renewal of the term of office of Mr JeanPaul  Agon,  Director  since  2010  and  Lead  Director  since 2017,  which  is  also  due  to  expire  at  the  close  of  the May  2022  General  Meeting.  The  Board  also  took  note  of Mr  Agon's  wish  not  to  have  his  term  of  office  renewal proposed to the General Meeting. Mr Jean-Paul Agon was warmly thanked for his contribution to the work of the Board of  Directors,  which  he  has  supported  since  2010,  for  his exceptional commitment as a Lead Director and Chairman\n- of  the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee,  and  for his participation in the work of the Remuneration Committee;\n- -to  review the composition of the Board Committees at the end of the General Meeting of May 4, 2022 and to appoint an independent Lead Director.\n\n## Remuneration of the Directors\n\nThe Board set the formula for distributing Directors' remuneration among its members for 2021 within the budget authorized by the General  Meeting  of  May  5,  2020  for  a  maximum  amount  of 1.3 million euros per fiscal year.\n\nPursuant  to  the  policy  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  of May  4,  2021,  (i)  the  fixed  remuneration  allocated  to  Committee Chairs  has  now  been  harmonized,  since  their  functions  involve a  significantly  comparable  workload,  likewise  the  amount  of  the remuneration allocated for attending each Committee meeting and (ii) remote  attendance  (by  video-conference  or  phone)  of  Board and  Committee  meetings  is  remunerated  in  the  same  way  as attending  in  person  (instead  of  half  the  lump-sum  amounts allocated  for  each  meeting).  This  change  does  not  alter  the preference  of  the  Board  and  its  members  to  attend  meetings  in person  where  possible,  but  it  recognizes  the  advances  in communication technologies.\n\n## Appraisal (see above)\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  approved  the  wording  of  the  full questionnaire sent to Directors at the end of 2021. Furthermore, it heard the feedback provided by the Chair of the Appointments and Governance Committee on the Directors' responses.\n\n## 13.  The Committees of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  set  up  four  Board  Committees:  the Audit and Accounts Committee, the Appointments and Governance  Committee,  the  Remuneration  Committee  and  the Environment and Society Committee. A review of the composition\n\nof the Committees will be carried out by the Board of Directors at\n\nthe end of the Shareholders' General Meeting of May 4, 2022.\n\n## 13.1.  THE AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2021,  the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee comprised three members: Ms Si\u00e2n Herbert-Jones, Committee Chair, Ms Sin Leng Low and Ms Anette Bronder. 100% of the members, including the Chair, are independent .\n\nThe  Committee  members  combine  experience  in  business management with financial expertise (see professional careers in the bibliographical memos on Directors on pages 155 et seq.). A qualified  chartered  accountant  who  worked  in  an  audit  firm  for 13 years (PwC), Ms Si\u00e2n Herbert-Jones joined the Sodexo group in 1995, where she was Group Chief Financial Officer from 2001 until  December 2015. Ms Si\u00e2n Herbert-Jones, in her capacity as Chair  of  the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee,  provides  the Committee with her extensive financial expertise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

During the presentation by the Group Chief Financial Officer, the Committee more particularly analyzed  the  provisions,  the  'Other  operating  income  and expenses' items, cash flow, taxation, the risk exposure (including societal  and  environmental  risks),  in  addition  to  the  outlook.  It reviewed the drafts presentations on the financial statements for analysts.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Committee  heard  the  presentations  of  the Statutory  Auditors  underlining  the  key  points  of  the  results  and took note of their conclusions.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the Committee reviewed the amount of  fees  paid  to  the  Statutory Auditors  in  respect  of  the  previous fiscal  year.  The Audit  Committee  was  also  informed  of  the  nonaudit  services  which  were  approved  in  2021  within  the  scope  of the approval procedure for the Group's non-audit services, which was validated by the Board.\n\nThe  Committee  took  due  note  of  the  contents  of  the  three  draft reports  issued  by  the  Statutory  Auditors,  pursuant  to  European Regulation  No.  537/2014.  The  reports  on  the  statutory  accounts and  the  consolidated  statements  include  a  description  of  the principal audit topics and  are  included  in  the  Universal Registration  Document  while  the  third,  more  detailed  report,  is intended for the Audit Committee only.\n\nThe  Committee  analyzed  the  performance,  monitored  efficiency programs,  the  Group's  financing  policy,  debt  and  liquidity management,  and  investment  and  divestiture  decisions.  The Committee  also  monitored  the  various  impacts  from  regulatory changes, specifically tax reforms and ESEF reporting in order to file  financial  statements  in  this  format,  including  in  this  Universal Registration  Document.  The  Committee  was  also  notified  about the completion of the Group's first green bond issue, which raised 500  million  euros  dedicated  to  several  sustainable  development projects, including in hydrogen and biogas.\n\nThe  Committee  managed  and  monitored  the  selection  process required by the regulation in force implemented in order to appoint a Principal Statutory Auditor to replace Ernst & Young et Autres, whose term of office expires at the end of the General Meeting of May 2022 and could not be proposed for renewal given the length of  its  prior  term  of  office. At  the  end  of  its  work,  the  Committee submitted a recommendation to the Board involving a choice to be made between two firms,  and  indicated  its  reasoned  preference for KPMG S.A., in order to propose the appointment of the latter to the General Meeting of May 4, 2022.\n\nThe  Committee,  based  on  its  positive  assessment  of  the  work performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit during its first  term of office, decided to recommend to the Board of Directors to renew this  term  of  office  which  is  also  due  to  expire  at  the  end  of  the General Meeting of May 2022.\n\nAs  the  appointments  of  the  Deputy  Statutory  Auditors,  Auditex company  and  Mr  Jean-Christophe  Georghiou,  are  also  due  to expire  at  the  end  of  the  next  General  Meeting,  the  Committee recommended  in  accordance  with  the  regulatory  provisions  in force to propose that the General Meeting record the expiration of these  terms  of  office  and  to  not  replace  the  Deputy  Statutory Auditors.  It  has  therefore  been  recommended  that  the  Company articles  of  association  be  amended  to  delete  references  to  the Deputy  Statutory  Auditors.  (See  all  of  the  information  regarding Statutory Auditors in the draft resolutions on pages 418 and 419 of the Universal Registration Document).\n\nIn  this  context,  the  Committee  reviewed  the  breakdown  of  the subsidiaries audit for the 2022-2027 period.\n\nFurthermore,  in  the  course  of  fiscal  year  2021,  specific presentations  were  made  to  the  Committee  in  particular  on  the following  points:  (i)  safeguarding  digital  assets  and  managing cyber crises, (ii) GDPR regulatory compliance in connection with protecting  personal  data  program,  (iii)  compliance  with  local regulations/monitoring  exports,  (iv)  status  report  by  Air  Liquide University  since  its  creation  10  years  ago,  (v)  reliability  of deliveries  in  certain  business  lines,  (vi)  technological  risks, (vii) pending  litigation  and  (viii)  tax  risks.  The  Committee  also monitored  compliance  with  regulations  on  ethics,  prevention  of corruption and influence-peddling as part of the current review of procedures within the Group.\n\nThe  Committee  heard  regular  reports  on  the  main  assignments carried out by the Group Control Department, the follow-up of any corrective  actions  taken  and  the  Control  Department's  main assignments for the forthcoming fiscal year. The Committee also regularly  monitored  the  process  for  deployment  of  the  risk management procedure within the Group. It reviewed the Group's risk map  and  its  evolution.  The  Committee  reviewed  the information  provided  in  the  Universal  Registration  Document concerning the internal control and risk management procedures and recommended its approval by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Committee is tasked with monitoring the management of all the risks identified by the Group, even if particular attention is paid to accounting or financial risks; a methodology for the monitoring of each type of risk (including, in particular, the identification of the management  and  control  bodies  and  procedures)  and  an appropriate  time  scale  (annual  review  or  regular  review  at  less frequent  intervals,  depending  on  the  type  of  risks)  was  defined. The  Committee  also  ensured  in  particular  that  the  specific  risks relating to climate change were taken into account when preparing financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The work program prepared for the 2022 fiscal year is consistent with this  approach.  It  was  presented  to  the  Board  for  discussion.  In addition, the Committee discussed topics specifically presented at the Board of Directors meeting.\n\nThe Audit  and Accounts  Committee  also  reviewed  for  2021  the conclusions based  on  implementation  of  the  assessment procedure  for  ordinary  agreements  entered  into  on  arm's  length terms. It is noted that, pursuant to the PACTE Law, this procedure provides  a  methodology  for  regularly  assessing  whether  the agreements involving  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  that  are  not  qualified  as regulated agreements meet these conditions. It also reminds the Group  of  the  rules  for  classifying  agreements  entered  into  by L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  as  either  regulated  agreements  or  as  ordinary agreements entered into on arm's length terms. Application of this procedure  during  the  past  fiscal  year  did  not  give  rise  to  any reclassification  of  an  ordinary  agreement  entered  into  on  arm's length terms as a regulated agreement.\n\nSeveral days  prior to each  meeting,  a  file of meeting documentation,  available  in  electronic  form,  is  provided  to Committee  members  on  a  dedicated  platform.  Each  Committee meeting  is  preceded  by  a  preparatory  meeting  attended  by  the Committee Chair, assisted by the Committee Secretary, the Group Chief Financial Officer and the Group Control Director. In order to prepare  the  meetings  where  financial  statements  are  reviewed, the Committee Chair meets with the Statutory Auditors, without the presence  of  the  Company  representatives.  During  the  meeting, each  presentation  made  by  the  Group  Chief  Financial  Officer, Group  Control  Director,  the  senior  executive  specializing  in  the area  under  discussion,  or  the  Statutory  Auditors  during  the financial statement review meetings is followed by discussion.\n\nAn  oral  report  and  then  written  minutes  of  each  meeting  are prepared for the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Committee  Chair  receives  summaries  of  the  internal  audit reports.  In  addition,  after  presentation  meetings  for  the  accounts for  the  fiscal  year,  the  Committee members can meet alone with the  Statutory  Auditors,  without  the  presence  of  the  Company representatives.\n\nAs  recommended  in  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Code  of  Corporate Governance,  the  following  measures  are  taken  so  that  the  time during which the financial statements are available to be reviewed is  sufficient:  preparatory meeting with the Committee Chair more than one week prior to the meeting, as provided for above; files made  available  to  Committee  members  five  to  seven  days  in advance.  These  measures  enable  the  members  to  review  the financial  statements  well  in  advance  of  the  meeting.  When compatible  with  the  schedules  of  the  members  travelling  from abroad,  the  Committee  meetings  relating  to  the  financial statements are held the day before the Board meeting.\n\n## Joint session of the Audit and Accounts Committee/ Environment and Society Committee\n\nThe internal regulations of the Board of Directors provide:\n\n'Once  a  year,  the  members  of  the  Environment  and  Society Committee  and  the  members  of  the  Audit  and  Accounts Committee shall meet at a joint session.\n\nAt this session, the members of the two Committees shall, in particular, review the environmental and societal risk-mapping, and  shall  jointly  review  certain  specific  environmental  and societal risks and the associated control procedures, and the procedures  relating  to  the  preparation  and  processing  of  the extra-financial information.'\n\nIt  is  noted that an initial joint session of the Audit Committee and the Environment and Society Committee was held for the first time in June 2019. This joint session, requested by the Directors in the Board's evaluation questionnaire, permits good interaction between  the  two  Committees,  in  particular  with  regard  to  the review of risks. The Audit Committee reviews the procedures for managing all of the risks, including any environmental and societal risks,  which  are  examined  in  detail  by  the  Environment  and Society  Committee. The  joint  session  thus  makes  it  possible  for the  members  to  discuss  subjects  which  concern  both  the Committees.\n\nThe  joint  session  also  helps  ensure  a  consistent  approach,  as reflected  in  the  reconciliation  of  the  financial  and  extra-financial data in the Integrated Management Report.\n\nDuring the joint session of November 2021, members of the Audit and  Accounts  Committee  and  the  Environment  and  Society Committee  reviewed  the  mapping  of  environmental  and  societal risks  (and  changes  to  the  referential)  and  procedures  to  control these  risks. A  summary  of  the  environmental  and  societal  risks/ substantive  topics  reviewed  during  the  year  by  the  Environment and Society Committee was also presented.\n\nThe members of both Committees also reviewed the procedures for  preparing  and  processing  extra-financial  information  and conducted an in-depth  analysis  of  certain  specific  environmental and societal risks such as energy management, feedback on the internal  program  to  measure  employee  engagement  (MyVoice 2021) and The Next Normal(s) program, a global project launched in  2020  to  capitalize  on  the  transformation  of  work  against  the backdrop  of  evolving  organizational  models  accelerated  by  the covid-19 pandemic.",

The Committee reviewed and analyzed the Group's main candidates and selected those exhibiting the required skills and qualities. The Committee  conducted  a  study  of  the  evolution  of  the  chosen candidates'  careers  and  their  achievements  in  their  managerial responsibilities  throughout  the  process.  The  Committee  decided that, in light of the quality of profiles examined, it should prioritize internal  candidates.  The  Committee  thoroughly  reviewed  and analyzed  potential  candidates  profiles,  selected  and  tracked  the development of several candidates, and then gradually narrowed down its choices. Committee members then conducted interviews, which  they  discussed  in  detail  to  be  able  to  give  an  informed recommendation to the Board. At the same time, the Committee also  examined  what  the  most  appropriate  governance  structure might be, along with the timetable.\n\nAt the conclusion of its work, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors:\n\n- \u25a0 separating  the  functions  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u25a0 renewing  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors  with  specific  missions  over  and  above  those entrusted to him by law;\n- \u25a0 appointing  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  as  Chief  Executive  Officer, whose  appointment  would  also  be  recommended  to  the General Meeting of May 2022 as Director of L'Air Liquide S.A.;\n- \u25a0 maintaining an independent Lead Director.\n\nThis new governance would take effect on June 1, 2022.\n\n## Concerning the composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Committee  verified  that  the  composition  of  the  Board  of Directors  complied  with  the  rules  provided  in  the  internal regulations. Taking into consideration the diversity policy detailed on  page  133,  it  made  recommendations  on  the  desirable  future changes in the composition of the Board of Directors in the short and  medium-term  and  continued  to  manage  the  search  and assessment procedure for potential candidates.\n\nThis search prompted the Committee to recommend to the Board of  Directors  to  propose  to  the  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2021 (i) to  appoint  Mr  Pierre  Breber,  Mr  Bertrand  Dumazy  and Mr Aiman Ezzat as Directors and (ii) to renew the term of office of Mr Xavier Huillard as Director.\n\nThe Committee also recommended to the Board to propose to the General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2022  to  renew  the  term  of  office  of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as Director (see page 144), appoint Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  as  Director  (see  page  144)  and  renew  the term of office as Director of Ms Annette Winkler (see page 145).\n\nThe Committee also recommended to the Board the appointment of  a  Director  representing  employees  on  the  Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Concerning the composition of the Committees, the Lead Director and the Working Group Shareholder Relations\n\nIn 2021,  the  Committee  reviewed  the  composition  of  the Committees  and  the  Working  Group  \"Shareholder  Relations\".  In this  regard,  the  Committee  recommended  to  the  Board  of Directors  to  renew  the  term  of  office  of  Mr  Xavier  Huillard  as member  of  the  Appointments  and  Governance  Committee, Chairman  of  the  Remuneration  Committee  and  member  of  the Working  Group  \"Shareholder  Relations\".  Furthermore,  in  light  of Mr Thierry Peugeot's term of office as Director expiring at the end of the  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2021,  the  Committee recommended to the Board of Directors not to replace him on the Audit and Accounts Committee at this stage. The Board meeting on  May  4,  2021  approved  this  new  composition  of  the Committees.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the composition of the Committees following the departure of Mr Brian Gilvary (1) as of September 15, 2021. It recommended appointing (i) Ms  Anette  Bronder  as  member  of  the  Audit  and  Accounts Committee, (ii) Ms Kim Ann Mink as member of the Remuneration Committee and (iii) Mr Pierre Breber (2) as member of the Working Group  \"Shareholder  Relations\"  (see  informations  relating  to  the working Group page 154 of this Universal Registration Document). The  Board  meeting  on  September  29,  2021,  approved  this  new composition.\n\n## Concerning the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the management teams\n\nThe Committee reviewed the specific procedure and the scenario envisaged  in  the  event  of  the  replacement  of  the  Executive Management  in  an  emergency  situation.  This  procedure  is reviewed each year and updated as needed. In early 2022, it was amended to take into account the proposed governance changes.\n\n## Successions\n\nApart  from  the  work  focusing  on  the  succession  of  the Executive Officer, the Committee reviewed the organization of the Group and its management teams. It conducted a detailed review of  high-potential  profiles,  a  process  it  undertakes  regularly.  It closely examined the composition of the management teams and the future successions to be planned.\n\n## Concerning governance\n\nOver the course of 2021, the Committee reviewed the organization of the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, which was held in closed session  due  to  the  pandemic,  examining  in  particular  the measures implemented to ensure the integrity of all aspects of the meeting in respect of Shareholders' rights. As part of this process, the  Committee  reviewed  the  business  continuity  plan  aimed  at providing a replacement in the event that any of its members are unable to participate in the General Meeting.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the personal situation of each member of the Board of Directors in light of the independence criteria set forth in the internal regulations. In particular, it reviewed the chart summarizing  the  flows  (purchases  and  sales)  which  occurred during  the  past  fiscal  year  as  between  the  companies  in  the Air Liquide Group and those Group companies at which a Director of  Air  Liquide  (or  candidate  proposed  for  such  office)  also exercises  a  term  of  office  or  an  executive  role  and  made  its assessment in the light of both quantitative and qualitative criteria. Pursuant  to  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Code,  page  135  gives  a  table detailing each Director's position with respect to the independence criteria.",

In light of the Board of Directors' decision in principle, a Director representing the employees will be appointed as  a  member  of  the  Remuneration  Committee.  This  deviation should  no  longer  be  mentioned  in  the  Report  on  Corporate Governance prepared for fiscal year 2022.\n\nAt the start of 2021, the Committee reviewed the summary of the replies  to  the  simplified  evaluation  questionnaire  of  the  Board  of Directors  in  respect  of  the  2020  fiscal  year.

The Appointments and Governance Committee also reviewed the results  concerning  the  gender  mix  with  regard  to  the  10%  of positions  which  carry  the  most  responsibility.  The  Committee made a recommendation to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Committee  reviewed  the  training  initiatives  offered  to Directors. These are detailed on page 139 and on page 140 for Directors representing the employees.\n\n## Tasks of the Lead Director: report on his activities\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon has been Lead Director since May 3, 2017.\n\nThe Lead Director's activities during the fiscal year related to the following points:\n\n- \u25a0 The Lead Director conducted the work of the Appointments and Governance  Committee  concerning  the  governance  tasks entrusted to the Committee and in particular:\n- -the succession of the Executive Officer;\n- -a  review  of  the  Company's  practices  in  light  of  the recommendations  of  the AFEP/MEDEF  Code,  the  French financial market  authority  and  the  Haut  Comit\u00e9  de Gouvernement  d'Entreprise,  included  in  their  respective 2021 reports;\n- -the preparation of the full questionnaire for evaluation of the functioning of the Board, which included a specific section enabling  each  Director  to  give  his/her  opinion  on  the individual  contributions  of  the  Directors  to  the  Board's reflections.

THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2021,  the  Remuneration  Committee  had three  members:  Mr  Xavier  Huillard,  Committee  Chair, Mr Jean -Paul Agon and Ms Kim Ann Mink. 100% of the Committee members are independent .\n\n## Composition and tasks as defined by the internal regulations\n\nThe Remuneration Committee must be comprised of three to five members of the Board of Directors and the majority of its members must be independent. The Committee meets at least three times a year. The conclusions of Committee meetings are presented by the Committee Chair for discussion and decision-making at the next Board of Directors' meeting.\n\n## TASKS\n\n## Pursuant to the internal regulations, the tasks of the Remuneration Committee are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 'examine  the  performance  and  all  the  components  of  remuneration  for  the  corporate  officers  and  make  the  corresponding recommendations to the Board of Directors (including, in particular, with regard to the determination of the remuneration policy and its application);\n- \u25a0 propose, where applicable, the remuneration of the Vice Chairman or Vice Chairmen;\n- \u25a0 examine the remuneration and retirement policy applied to Executive Management and in particular to Executive Committee;\n- \u25a0 examine  the  proposals  by  the  Executive  Management  concerning  the  granting  of  stock  options  and  other  incentive  systems related to the share price to other Group employees and propose their granting to the Board of Directors;\n- \u25a0 examine and propose to the Board of Directors the allocation of the fixed annual sum awarded to the Directors set by the General Meeting, in compliance with the legislation relating to the remuneration policy for the corporate officers.\n\nThe Committee can request the assistance of outside experts if necessary. The Company shall provide the Committee in such a case with the corresponding funding.'\n\n## The Remuneration Committee's work in 2021\n\nThe  Remuneration  Committee  met  three  times  in  2021  with  an effective  attendance  rate,  or  attendance  rate  by  telephone,  of 100% of its members. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is not present for any discussions by the Committee relating to him personally. At Board meetings, the Committee Chair reports on the work of the Remuneration Committee. At the General Meeting, the Committee Chair reports on the Board's decisions concerning the remuneration applicable to the Group's Executive Officers.\n\n## Remuneration of the Executive Officers/long-term incentive policy\n\nFor  2021 , the  Committee  evaluated  the  performance  of  the Executive Officer and the level of achievement of the objectives of his  variable  remuneration  for  fiscal  year  2020  and  drafted recommendations to the Board. It reviewed the draft reports and resolutions  to  be  put  to  the  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2021, concerning  the  remuneration  of  the  corporate  officers  (a  report containing  information  on  the  remuneration  of  the  Executive Officer and the Directors and provided for in article L. 22-10-9 I of the  French  Commercial  Code)  and  the  Executive  Officer's individual remuneration for 2020.\n\nFollowing comments from Shareholders, the Committee recommended  that  the  way  rates  are  calculated  for  the achievement of each quantifiable objective of the annual variable remuneration be further clarified in the report on the remuneration of Executive Officers submitted to the vote of the General Meeting, and that the remuneration policy applicable to Executive Officers submitted to a vote contains not only the structure and principles of  the  remuneration,  but  also  the  actual  figures  for  short-term remuneration and LTI.\n\nThe  Committee  was  informed  of  the  collective  transfer  of  the defined  contribution  pension  plan,  set  up  for  all  employees  and corporate officers, to a PERO  (Plan  d'\u00c9pargne  Retraite d'Entreprise Obligatoire -  mandatory  company  retirement savings plan) from January 1, 2021, for compliance with the new legal  and  regulatory  framework  arising  from  the  PACTE  Law.  It recommended applying the PERO to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier beginning on  this  date.  This  implementation  was  integrated  into  the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2021.\n\nAs  part  of  its  work  on  2021  LTI  plans  and  attributions  of performance shares and/or stock options, the Committee renewed its recommendation to attribute only performance shares (instead of  a  mix  of  stock  options  and  performance  shares)  to  all beneficiaries (including the Executive Officer), in accordance with the general market trend and in order to simplify and standardize the  scheme.  The  Committee  reviewed  the  satisfaction  of  the performance conditions in the 2019 LTI plans, for which the threeyear review period expired on December 31, 2021.\n\nFor 2022 , the Committee reviewed the remuneration policy of the corporate officers subject to the General Meeting of May 4, 2022.\n\nIt  recommended  the  performance  conditions  for  the  2022  LTI plans,  which  were  then  adopted  by  the  Board  of  Directors  in February 2022, specifically incorporating climate criteria aligned to the  objective  of  reducing  in  the  Group's  Carbon  intensity.  It reviewed  the  shareholding  rules    which  apply  to  the  Executive Officers.\n\nFor  the  Board  of  Directors  meeting  in  February  2022,  the Committee prepared the record of the performance conditions of the  short-term  variable  remuneration  and  pension  insurance contract for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nIn  preparing  the  Company  Executive  Management  succession plan, the Committee worked on the new draft remuneration policy for Company Officers established in keeping with the prior policy, while  taking  into  account  evolutions  related  to  the  changes  in governance under a separate governance mode (remuneration of the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors - see pages 199 to 212). Following this work, it drafted its recommendations to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Committee  also  reviewed  the  calculation  and  scope  of  the equity ratio presented in the Universal Registration Document and recommended expanding it by adding a ratio calculated based on a scope of 'whole of France' to take into account recommendations  on  remuneration  contained  in  the  AMF  and HCGE reports and investor feedback (see page 181).",

Remuneration of the Executive Officer (including information stated in article L. 22-10-9 I of the French Commercial Code)\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in relation to his office, as decided upon by the Board of  Directors  on  February  9,  2021  and  presented  in  the  Company's  2020  Universal  Registration  Document  (pages  188  to  195)  was approved by the Ordinary General Meeting on May 4, 2021 (12 th resolution). This  General  Meeting also approved the information relating  to  the  remuneration  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Directors  which  was  presented  in  the  Report  on Corporate Governance (1) (11 th resolution).\n\nThe Board of Directors maintained the fixed remuneration for 2021 at the same level as for 2018, 2019 and 2020, the level of the total annual target remuneration thus being stable.\n\nIn 2021, the structure and principles applicable to the remuneration are in line with previous fiscal years.\n\nThe principal elements of the remuneration policy for the Executive Officer approved in 2021 are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 In accordance with a recurring practice at Air Liquide, the fixed remuneration represents approximately 25% ,  the target variable remuneration approximately 35% and  the  long-term  incentive  (hereafter  ' LTI ')  granted  approximately 40% of  the  total  annual remuneration.  Accordingly,  the  weight  of  the  variable  remuneration  and  the  LTI,  which  are  subject  to  performance  conditions, represents approximately 75% of this total remuneration.\n\nThe collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription and the termination indemnity are also subject to performance conditions.\n\nThe  performance  conditions,  as  described  below,  reflect  the Group's  ambition  to  achieve  profitable  long-term  growth,  while acting responsibly in the interests of all the stakeholders .\n\n## \u25a0 Variable remuneration:\n\n- -the variable part is expressed as a target variable remuneration and as a maximum (as a % of the fixed remuneration). For the quantifiable criteria, the target variable remuneration corresponds to an achievement of 100% of the target objective set at the start of the year. The fixed target objectives are demanding and are completely consistent with the trajectory of the NEOS company program;\n- -a greater relative weight is given to the quantifiable criteria as compared to the qualitative criteria;\n- -a weighting is allocated to each of the qualitative criteria.\n\n## \u25a0 LTI:\n\n- -All  the  LTI  granted  to  the  Executive  Officers  are  subject  to  performance  conditions  calculated  over  a  period  of  three years. Since 2020, the LTI plans incorporate a performance condition linked to the Group's Carbon Intensity, in addition to the ROCE and TSR criteria.\n- -Limits on the grants to Executive Officers: in accordance with the authorizations given by the General Meeting on May 7, 2019, the number of performance shares granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.1% of the share capital and the number of stock options granted, if any, to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.2% of the share capital. The Board of Directors also sets annual limits for the grants, which remain well below these sub-limits, it being noted that, as stated above, the LTI must represent approximately 40% of the total target annual remuneration for the Executive Officer.\n- -The other principles which apply to the LTI are unchanged ( proration of the LTI in the event of the Executive Officer's departure during the period of assessment of the performance conditions, the level of requirement of the objectives, the rules which apply to the Executive Officers as described on pages 177 to 178.\n\nFinally, as in 2020, the Board of Directors decided on September 29, 2021 only to grant performance shares (instead of a mix of stock options and performance shares) to all the beneficiaries, in order to simplify and standardize the LTI plan.\n\nThe elements of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's remuneration, as determined by the Board of Directors pursuant to the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2021, are described below.\n\n(1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For  the  record,  in  respect  of  2020,  the  fixed  remuneration represented 47.6% and the variable remuneration (paid in 2021) represented 52.4%.\n\n## 2.1.1.  Fixed remuneration for 2021\n\nIn accordance with the policy approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2021, the fixed remuneration was determined taking account of the level of responsibilities, the experience in executive management duties and market practices.\n\nAs announced, the Executive Officer's fixed remuneration for 2021 amounts to 1,325,000 euros, stable since 2018 .\n\n## 2.1.2.  Variable remuneration for 2021 for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe principles and criteria for the variable remuneration, as decided upon by the Board of Directors on February 9, 2021 were approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2021 (12 th resolution).\n\nOn  the  proposal  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  on  February  15,  2022  assessed  the  performance  of  the Executive Officer in 2021.\n\nThe criteria for the variable remuneration, their weighting and their rate of achievement are detailed in the following summary table.\n\n## A. Quantifiable financial criteria\n\nIn  accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, the variable remuneration for 2021 is based  on  two  financial  criteria:  increase  in  recurring  net  earnings  excluding  foreign  exchange  impact  per  share  (hereinafter ' recurring EPS '), and comparable growth in consolidated revenue . Details of these criteria are contained in the summary table below (page 175).\n\nThe increase in the recurring EPS criterion makes it possible to take into account all the items in the income statement. The criterion of an  increase  in  sales  reflects  the  momentum  of  the  activity.  These  two  criteria,  growth  in  revenue  and  the  recurring  EPS,  reflect  the Group's ambition to achieve profitable growth. Moreover, the achievement of the efficiency objectives contributes to the increase in the recurring EPS.\n\nFor  each  criterion,  the  Board  of  Directors  had  defined  a  target  objective.  The  target  objectives  were  exacting  and  were  completely consistent with the trajectory of the main objectives of the NEOS company program.\n\nA formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) by taking  into  account,  on  the  basis  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  fiscal  year,  the  value  achieved  for  the  criterion  as compared  to  the  target  objective  set.  Thus,  in  the  event  of  a  performance  that  exceeds  the  objective  set,  the  value  of  the  variable remuneration is adjusted upward within the maximum limit set for each criterion. In the event of a performance that is below the lower",

The achievement of each performance condition is assessed without any set-off between criteria.\n\nFurthermore, according to this formula, the rate of achievement of each objective is calculated linearly as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 an initial linear gradient between the lower limit of the objective, corresponding to the trigger threshold (0% below this threshold) and the target (corresponding to a 100% achievement of the objective);\n- \u25a0 a second linear gradient between the target (100%) and the maximum achievement level (116% of the target).\n\nThe objectives are not made public for confidentiality reasons. Nevertheless, the rate of achievement of each objective for the variable remuneration  (as  a  percentage  of  the  fixed  remuneration  and  as  a  percentage  of  the  target  variable  remuneration  allocated  to  that criterion) is communicated in the summary table at page 175.\n\nFollowing an excellent year 2021, the objectives of the quantifiable criteria were carried out to the maximum achievement level.\n\n## B. Qualitative personal criteria\n\nPursuant to the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2021, the variable remuneration for 2021 is also based on the following (qualitative) personal criteria:\n\n## \u25a0 Corporate Social Responsibility (hereinafter 'CSR'):\n\n- -Safety and reliability: continue efforts to improve safety (lost time accident frequency rate, road traffic accidents and job-related accidents);\n- -Continue  the  roll-out  of  the  Sustainable  Development  strategy  (implementation  of  the  Group's  new  ESG/Climate  Objectives  contribution to the development of the hydrogen ecosystem).\n- \u25a0 Organization/Human Resources (talent development, succession plans, diversity policy).\n- \u25a0 Individual performance: this criterion responds to the Board of Directors' desire to keep a part of the variable remuneration subject to the Board's assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment. This may be beneficial to the Executive Officer,  if  the  Company  is  facing  an  unfavorable  environment  which  was  not  anticipated  at  the  time  the  objectives  were  set,  or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated.\n\nAn identical target and maximum weight are set for each qualitative criterion.\n\nFor 2021, after a detailed analysis by the Remuneration Committee of the achievements for the fiscal year, the Board of Directors noted the following elements concerning each of the personal criteria:\n\n## CSR:\n\nPerformance was considered very good:\n\n## \u25a0 Safety and reliability\n\nBased on the estimated hours worked, the lost-time accident frequency rate of the Group's employees stood at 1.1 in 2021, compared to  0.9  in  2020  and  1.2  in  2019.  After  an  exceptional  year  in  2020  in  terms  of  safety,  during  which  the  Group  achieved  its  best performance since the introduction of this indicator, 2021 was marked by a slight decline in the indicator; nevertheless, it remains a sharp improvement compared to its 2019 level. A similar trend can be observed for subcontractors. One of the explanatory factors for this decrease is linked to the context of the covid-19 pandemic; mandatory measures requiring employees to work remotely in certain countries have restricted the presence at operating sites of managers and HSE officers who are responsible for safety. In addition, some actions to improve safety have had to be cancelled or postponed: for example, some of the on-site industrial audits by Group experts, due to the prohibition on travel in some countries. Counterbalancing measures have been implemented, such as virtual audits conducted remotely using video cameras.\n\n2021 was marked by the deaths of four subcontractors (three of which were linked to construction activities and one to the handling of a heavy load on site). For the record, 2020 had been marked by the deaths of two employees and of one subcontracted driver.\n\nConcerning industrial  safety/reliability ,  the  Group's IMS program  ( Industrial  Management  System )  set  up  15  years  ago  has helped  improve  the  management  of  industrial  risks.  Based  on  the  experience  acquired,  a  large-scale  project,  namely  the  IMS Streamlining program, was launched in 2018 in order to develop it and improve its efficiency . Despite the covid crisis, the roll-out of  the  new  IMS  reference system continued in 2021 throughout all clusters (groups of countries). In August 2021, the first cluster (group of countries) successfully completed this roll-out for the entities in its scope. The roll-out is expected to be terminated across all clusters (groups of countries) by the end of 2022.\n\nIn  2020, process  safety received  special  attention  from  management  through  an  ambitious  plan  to  upgrade  more  than  600  air separation units. This plan follows an industrial accident that occurred at a third-party industrial site in China. It enables to improve the safety at the production sites of the Group. Its implementation continued in 2021. Over 450 units were upgraded over the course of these two years. The remaining units concerned will be upgraded by mid-2022. It can be noted that Air Liquide played a leading role in influencing its peers and inviting them to work together to develop harmonized international standards for everyone's benefit.\n\nFinally, in 2021, road safety continued to be the subject of a consolidated action plan aimed at raising awareness among all persons affected by the principal road traffic risks, and encouraging them to behave responsibly at all times when on the road, notably by means of an internal communication campaign, including subcontracted drivers. Moreover, the introduction of technical assistance in trucks (whose implementation commenced a few years ago) continued in 2021, despite the public health crisis. This new technology makes  it  possible  to  have  an  effective  impact  on  driver  behavior,  and  to  identify  areas  for  improvement.  In  order  to  obtain  the maximum benefit, emphasis was placed on more intensive driver coaching by Master Drivers, based on the information provided by this onboard technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are structured around the notion of ACT: Act for Climate, Care for patients, Trust as the base to engage the communities at large. These objectives were well-received and, notably with regard to the CO2 emissions, were considered by the markets to be very ambitious. They are based on a solid roll-out plan. All industrial clusters (groups of countries) have brought their Climate roadmaps into line with these new objectives, with detailed action plans for the medium-term of the new plan, 2021-2025.\n\nIn  each  of  these  clusters  (groups  of  countries),  the  roles  of  'Climate  Champions',  responsible  for  coordinating  this  matter,  and volunteer \"Sustainability Ambassadors', who carry out local initiatives and share good practices, have also been adjusted.\n\nThe  Environment  and  Society  Committee  met  on  four  occasions  in  2021.  It  first  reviewed  the  Group's  new  Sustainable Development objectives which were published in March 2021, and then later in the year the reporting and the follow-up indicators put in place to monitor these new objectives. The environmental and societal risks, the Vigilance Plan and progress made in the management of some specific risks were also reviewed.\n\nMoreover, the ratings obtained by the Group in terms of sustainable development from the various specialist agencies continue to place it among the best performers in its sector.\n\n## -Contribution to the development of the hydrogen ecosystem:\n\nAs part of his work on the Hydrogen Council, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier co-chaired two CEO Events in 2021 (in January and October), each of which was attended by around fifty CEOs of international groups, and where the speakers notably included Ms Ursula von der Leyen and Mr Hoesung Lee (Chairman of the GIEC), thus confirming that the Hydrogen Council has acquired full legitimacy on the international scene.\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier also co-chaired a meeting in July 2021 between Mr John Kerry and around twelve CEOs from the Hydrogen Council,  ahead  of  the  decision  by  the  US  administration  to  provide  strong  support  for  hydrogen  in  the  stimulus  packages announced in autumn (Infrastructure Bill and Build Back Better). Finally, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier represented the Hydrogen Council in October  2021  at  the  Hydrogen  Energy  Ministerial  Meeting  (HEM)  convened  by  the  Japanese  government  and  the  IEA  and attended by around twenty international ministers.\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier is  completing  his  5 th year  as  co-chair  of  the  Hydrogen  Council  in  2021  and  is  thus  coming  to  the  end  of  his 2 nd term  of  office.  He  will,  therefore,  step  down  in  January  2022,  but  has  positioned  himself  in  order  to  remain  the  official representative of the Hydrogen Council in Europe.\n\nIn France, following the creation of the National Hydrogen Council (NHC) in 2020, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier co-chaired four sessions of the NHC in 2021, three of which were attended by ministers and played a major role in the NHC becoming the body which is lawfully recognized by the Government to draw up its strategic priorities, notably in connection with the 2030 France investment plan.\n\nAt the European level, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier was asked to take part in the annual debates organized by the European Commission, notably  as  part  of  the  \"European  Clean  Hydrogen  Alliance\"  initiative,  and  made  active  contributions  to  the  work  of  the  ERT (European Round Table) on Hydrogen topics.\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier has also made an active contribution to the emergence of the first infrastructure  fund  dedicated  to  hydrogen (Hy24, in partnership with Ardian and FiveT), which was launched in the autumn of 2021, notably under his leadership and that of the CEOs of TotalEnergies and Vinci. This initiative will help mobilize the financial community more actively in the development of the hydrogen ecosystem.\n\nFinally, in recognition of the rapid acceleration of the Hydrogen markets over the course of 2020, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier decided at the end of 2020 to introduce an international structure within the Group to manage the Group's hydrogen developments (H2 Force). A detailed  review  of  the  hydrogen  activity  was  proposed  to  the  Board  meeting  in  September  2021,  one  year  after  the  meeting dedicated  to  the  strategic  challenges  of  energy  transition.  This  review  has  made  it  possible  to  validate  the  Group's  strategic directions  and  the  significant  achievements  made  by  the  H2  Force  teams  and,  more  specifically,  by  the  Europe  Hub  since September 2020.\n\n## Organization and Human Resources:\n\nPerformance was considered excellent. In keeping with past practice, the Group's talent development policy was pursued, with regular reviews. As in previous years, these reviews are conducted at the level of operating clusters (groups of countries) of the Group and up to the Executive Committee. Special attention was paid to international development opportunities in the context of reduced mobility due to the covid crisis; the diversity of profiles was also carefully examined in order to promote, at the level of the Group's key positions, the numerous cultures which make up the Group, and in order to continue to consolidate the gender balance.\n\nReviews of the Group's most promising talent took place with the Appointments and Governance Committee.\n\nIn parallel to the work on governance and preparation for the succession of the Group's Executive Management, special attention has been paid to changes made to the Executive Committee. The key points were the replacement of Ms Fabienne Lecorvaisier as Group CFO  by  Mr  J\u00e9r\u00f4me  Pelletan,  and  Ms  Fabienne  Lecorvaisier  being  in  charge  of  Sustainable  Development,  in  order  to  oversee  the achievement of the ESG objectives of the Group. Other operational moves have been carefully reviewed, notably the succession at the head of Airgas, with Mr Marcelo Fioranelli replacing Mr Pascal Vinet who has in turn taken on an operational role in Europe and AMEI, becoming Vice President of Europe Industries and the Africa/Middle East & India hubs, with effect from September 2021.\n\nFurthermore,  a  review  was  dedicated  to  the  Group's  talents  in  technical  and  industrial  roles,  and  the  technical  talent  development program of the Group (Technical Community Leaders) has evolved in order to consolidate the Group's expertise in Hydrogen Mobility. The international Hydrogen business line has evolved and has acquired greater resources and a more agile organization, in line with the Group's strategic challenges.",

See  reconciliation  in  Chapter  1,  page  57  of  this  2021  Universal  Registration Document.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of the variable remuneration is above target and amounts to 2,192,875 euros, up by 50% as compared to the variable  remuneration  for  2020.  This  variation  between  2020  and  2021  is  due  to  a  base  effect:  in  2020, Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier's  variable remuneration  had  decreased  by  more  than  29%  compared  to  2019,  since  the  objectives  for  the  quantitative  criteria  of  his  variable remuneration, determined before the start of  the  pandemic,  were  not  modified  during  the  course  of  the  fiscal  year  despite  the  major impact on those indicators of the crisis caused by the pandemic. The 2020-2021 increase reflects the quality of the performance during 2021 compared to a non-standard year 2020.\n\nThe total amount of the variable remuneration due for the 2021 fiscal year will be paid in 2022, after approval of the financial statements by  the  General  Meeting,  it  being  noted  that  its  payment  is  conditional  on  the  approval  by  a  General  Meeting  of  the  elements  of remuneration paid during or awarded in respect of the 2021 fiscal year to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier.\n\n## 2.1.3.  Total fixed and variable remuneration for 2021 - Changes\n\nFor the reasons explained above, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's total fixed and variable remuneration for 2021 is up by 26% compared to 2020.\n\n## 2.1.4.  Other elements of annual remuneration\n\nThe benefits in kind paid for the benefit of the Executive Officer in 2021 include the use of a company car and the contributions to the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

LTI: STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES\n\n## 2.2.1.  2021 performance share plan (plan dated September 29, 2021)\n\n## A. Principles of grant for 2021\n\nFor  the  Executive  Officer,  the  grant  for  2021  forms  part  of  the  2021  remuneration  policy  defined  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on February 9, 2021 and approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2021.\n\nThe grant of LTI to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in 2021 represents an IFRS value of 2,249,608 euros, which is stable since 2018 , as announced.\n\nMoreover,  for  the  record,  since  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided,  following  the  general  market  trend,  to  grant  only  performance shares (instead of a mix of stock options and performance shares) to all the beneficiaries, in order to simplify and standardize the LTI scheme.\n\n## B. Performance conditions of the 2021 plans\n\nAll the performance shares granted to any beneficiary are subject to performance conditions which are calculated over three years. The performance conditions were set by the Board of Directors at the start of the year, at the February meeting, in order to comply with a reference period of three full years.\n\nFor reasons of confidentiality, the exact objectives set for each performance condition will be made public ex post, at the end of the  Board  of  Directors'  meeting  at  the  time  when  the  financial  statements  are  adopted  for  the  2023  fiscal  year.  The  results achieved,  the  rate  of  achievement  of  the  performance  conditions  and  the  percentage  of  performance  shares  definitively awarded will also be published at the end of this Board meeting. The percentage of performance shares definitively awarded may in no event exceed 100% of the initial grant. The achievement of each performance condition is assessed without any set-off between criteria.\n\n- In  keeping  with  the  Group's  responsible  growth  approach,  the  2021  performance  share  plans  incorporate,  as  they  did  in  2020, a performance condition linked to the Group's carbon intensity . Accordingly, the number of performance shares definitively awarded pursuant to the 2021 Plans will depend:\n- (i) for 50% of the performance shares granted, on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the Return on Capital Employed after tax ( ROCE ) (1) recorded at the end of the 2023 fiscal year.\n- At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This  lower  limit  corresponds  to  a  ROCE  level  which  is  200  basis  points  less  than  the  objective  set,  which  provides  a  degree  of flexibility, making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n- The objective has been set within the trajectory of the ROCE target announced by the Company that is maintained at more than 10%, with  achievement set for 2023-2024, which reflects the impact of the crisis but also a pro-active investment policy in a context of numerous and qualitative opportunities;\n\n## (ii) for 40% of the performance shares granted:\n\n- -for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on an objective of Total Shareholder Return set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends, for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 fiscal years (' AL TSR '). The objective of an absolute TSR is set in accordance with historic performances. At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis, to a lower limit below which there will be no grant,\n- -for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends - sourced from Bloomberg (' B TSR '), as compared to the CAC 40 TSR index, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg) for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 fiscal years.\n- The rate of achievement will be 0% if the average of the Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR, 50% if it is equal to the average of the CAC 40 TSR, and 100% if it is at least 2% higher than the average of the CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible.\n\nThe TSR criteria make it possible to align the Company's performance with Shareholders' expectation of steady profits;\n\n- (iii) for  10% of the performance shares granted, on the reduction in Air Liquide's carbon intensity ,  defined  as  the  following  ratio, recorded as at December 31, 2023: Greenhouse gas emissions of the Air Liquide group for the year 2023 in kg-equivalent CO \u2082 /2023 EBITDA (calculated at constant exchange rate on the basis of the 2015 foreign exchange rates) expressed in euros. Greenhouse gas emissions include direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2).\n\nThe objective was determined within the trajectory of the Group's Climate Objectives announced at the end of 2018 which aim to reduce the carbon intensity by -30% between 2015 and 2025.\n\nDIAGRAM SHOWING THE PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO THE PERFORMANCE SHARES IN 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 40%              | 40%                 | 10%              |\n|------------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| TSR over 3 years | TSR over 3 years    | Carbon intensity |\n| 50%              | 50% B TSR           |                  |\n| AL TSR           | (AL TSR/CAC 40 TSR) |                  |",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\n## C. Rules applying to the Executive Officers\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy, the grant to the Executive Officer is examined by the Remuneration Committee at the same time as the allocation to Group employees and is decided by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe grant of performance shares was examined in light of the total amount of the Executive Officer's annual remuneration, taking into account several external market surveys and ensuring that the interests of the Shareholders are respected.\n\nBefore the grant, it was verified that the conditions provided for in article L. 22-10-60 of the French Commercial Code, which aims at involving  all  staff  in  France  in  the  Company's  performance  are  satisfied.  Therefore  in  2021,  over  98%  of  all  the  employees  in  the Company and in the Group's French entities are covered by an incentive plan or a special or voluntary profit-sharing plan.\n\n## Limits on the grants to Executive Officers\n\nWithin the scope of the sub-limits authorized by the General Meeting for 38 months, the Board of Directors sets lower annual limits for the grants  to  the  Executive  Officers,  expressed  (i)  as  a  percentage  of  the  share  capital  and  (ii)  as  a  multiple  of  their  remuneration,  in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe limits set by the Board of Directors for 2021 are identical to those for 2020 and are as follows (no subscription option having been attributed in 2021):\n\n- (i) the  total  number  of  performance  shares  granted  in  2021  to  the  sole  Executive  Officer  cannot  give  rise  to  a  number  of  shares exceeding 0.012% of the share capital (it being understood that an allocation sub-limit of 0.1% of the share capital for 38 months was set by the General Meeting on May 7, 2019);\n- (ii) the total aggregate IFRS value of the performance shares granted to the Executive Officer cannot exceed approximately 1.5 times the amount  of  the  Executive  Officer's  maximum  gross  annual  remuneration  (fixed  +  variable  maximum),  it  being  noted  that  the performance shares granted represent approximately 40% of the total target annual remuneration.\n\n## Maintaining the proration principle\n\nPursuant to the decision made by the Board on February 9, 2021 and the policy approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2021, the 2021 grant of LTI to the Executive Officer remains subject to the principle of a pro rata calculation.\n\nIn practice, if the Executive Officer leaves the Group for a reason other than his resignation or removal from office for serious cause (2) , the total allocation rate (after applying the performance conditions) would be reduced pro rata for the duration of actual presence of the Executive Officer within the Group during the period of assessment of the performance criteria. Furthermore, no grant is made to the Executive Officer at the time of this departure, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe Executive Officer will remain subject to all the provisions of the plans and, more specifically, those relating to the duration of the vesting, lock-up and holding periods in respect of the shares and stock options granted.\n\nIn  agreement with him and in accordance with best governance practices, the Board decided at its meeting of February 15, 2022 to apply to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier this proration principle when he ends his term of office as Chief Executive Officer on May 31, 2022 , even though he remains within the Group and could in principle therefore continue to acquire his rights during his term as non-executive Chairman. The LTI granted to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in  2020  and  2021 will  therefore  be  prorated,  to  the  effect  that  the  2020  LTI  grant  to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier will be reduced by -19.5% and the 2021 grant by -52.9%, while the definitive award remains subject to performance conditions and all other conditions (including shareholding obligations) continue to apply.\n\n## Shareholding and share ownership obligations\n\n## Shareholding obligation pursuant to the French Commercial Code\n\nOn  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  defined  the  shareholding  obligations  resulting  from  articles L. 225-185 and L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code applicable to the shares resulting from the exercise of stock options and performance shares, respectively, as from September 28, 2015, as follows:\n\nFor  each  stock  option/performance  share  plan  granted  to  the  Executive  Officers  with  effect  from  September  28,  2015,  the  Executive Officers shall hold, in registered form, until the termination of their duties, a minimum quantity of shares corresponding to 50% of the capital gain on acquisition, net of social security charges and tax, resulting from each exercise of stock options/each definitive award of performance shares.\n\nHowever,  this  percentage  will  be  lowered  to  5%,  as  soon  as  the  quantity  of  shares  held  by  the  Executive  Officer  resulting  from  the exercise of stock options or the definitive award of performance shares (all plans combined since the 2007 plan for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier) represents a minimum amount equal to at least three times the Executive Officer's gross annual fixed remuneration.\n\nThis rule is regularly reviewed by the Board at the time of each grant. In 2021, the Board of Directors decided to maintain this rule in identical form.\n\nThe previous obligations to hold shares resulting from the exercise of stock options, decided by the Board of Directors on May 9, 2007, which apply with effect from the grant of stock options on May 9, 2007 for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, remain in force with regard to the relevant stock option plans, up until the September 22, 2014 stock option plan inclusive.\n\nThe application of this rule was reported to the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022.\n\n(2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  obligation  will remain in force until it is exceeded by the effect of the rules resulting from the French Commercial Code. The number of shares required to  be  held  is  assessed  as  of  January  1  and  July  1  of  each  year.  The  Board  noted  that  the  valuation  of  the  shares  held  as  at January 1, 2021 and July 1, 2021 and as at January 1, 2022 by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer was much greater than the amounts required and concluded that the share ownership obligation was complied with by the Executive Officer.\n\nRecommendations encouraging the ownership of a minimum number of Company shares equivalent to 0.5 times their gross fixed annual remuneration, have also been made to members of the Executive Committee since 2009.\n\n## Other rules applicable to the Executive Officers\n\n- \u25a0 Restriction on the exercise of stock options and the sale of performance shares during the 'black-out periods' prior to the publication of  the  financial  statements.  These  abstention  periods  open  30  days  before  the  announcement  of  the  annual  and  half-year consolidated  results  and  15  calendar  days  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  quarterly  financial  information.  They  end  on  the  date  of publication of the information at close of business.\n- \u25a0 Commitment not to carry out hedging transactions with regard to the risk concerning the performance shares awarded/options arising from the exercise of options, throughout the length of their term of office.\n\n## 2.2.2.  Grants to the Executive Officer within the scope of the September 29, 2021 plan\n\n## Plan Regulations\n\nThe grant to the Executive Officer is governed by the September 29, 2021 'France' performance share plan which applies to all the beneficiaries in France. This Plan contains:\n\n- \u25a0 a three-year vesting period;\n- \u25a0 followed by a two-year holding period during which the shares cannot be sold.\n\n## DIAGRAM OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARE MECHANISM - 2021 PLAN (FRANCE)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContinued presence in the Company is a condition under the Plan in order to qualify for performance shares at the end of the vesting period, the loss of rights for the Executive Officer occurring in the event of resignation or removal from office for serious cause.\n\nThe Executive Officer is also subject to additional conditions as described above.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recording of the achievement of the performance conditions under the September 30, 2019 performance share plans (4)\n\nOn the basis of the financial statements for the 2021 fiscal year submitted for the approval of the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, recorded the rate of achievement of the performance conditions, which apply to the whole of the performance shares awarded to any beneficiary and were determined at the time of the grant of the September 30, 2019 performance share plans.\n\nIn 2019, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors decided, following the general market trend, to grant only performance shares to all beneficiaries for purposes of simplification and standardization.\n\nThe 2019 annual plans provided that the number of performance shares definitively awarded would depend on the rate of achievement of the following objectives:\n\n- (i) for 60% of the performance shares granted , on the rate of achievement of an objective set for this purpose by the Board, consisting of the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) recorded at the end of the 2021 fiscal year. At the objective set, the grant is 100% and  then  decreases  on  a  straight-line  basis  to  a  lower  limit  below  which  there  will  be  no  award.  This  lower  limit  corresponds  to a ROCE level which is 200 bps less than the objective set, which provides a degree of flexibility, notably making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe  objective  had  been  set  within  the  trajectory  of  the  NEOS  company  program  which  aimed  at  a  ROCE  of  more  than  10%  in 2021-2022.\n\nThe ROCE level for the aforementioned period was 9.3%, i.e. an objective achieved as to 75.50%;\n\n## (ii) for 40% of the performance shares granted:\n\n- -for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): of an objective of Total Shareholder Return ('AL TSR') defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares, for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 fiscal years. At the objective set of +6%, the grant of shares is 100%, and then decreases on a straight-line basis to +2%.\n- This growth, over the aforementioned period, amounts to 18.70% per annum, i.e. 100% of the target achieved,\n- -for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): of the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment in Air  Liquide  shares,  reinvested  dividends  -  sourced  from  Bloomberg  (' B TSR '),  as  compared  to  the  CAC  40  index,  reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg) for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 fiscal years.\n- The applicable formula provided that the rate of achievement of this performance condition was (i) 0% if the average Air Liquide TSR was lower than the average CAC 40 TSR, (ii) 50% if the average Air Liquide TSR was equal to the average CAC 40 TSR, and (iii) 100% if the average Air Liquide TSR was at least 2% higher than the average CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR was impossible.\n- The rate of return for Air Liquide over the aforementioned period is 18.77%. That of the CAC 40 index over the same period is 19.12%. This gives the difference between the average rate of return for Air Liquide and the average rate of return for the CAC 40 as -0.36%, i.e. an objective achieved as to 0%.\n\nConsequently,  the  Board  of  Directors  recorded  that  the rate  of  achievement  of  the  performance  conditions for the September 30, 2019 share performance plans amounts to 65.3% .

For the Executive Officer, these elements and the corresponding amounts due or awarded in respect of 2021 are contained at pages 190 to 195 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## For employees:\n\nIndividual  bonuses  (seniority  bonuses,  study  bursary,  vacation,  accommodation,  transportation,  etc.),  profit-sharing  bonus,  incentives,  and  employer's contribution on profit-sharing/incentives.\n\nThe post-employment benefits, and notably the pension and similar commitments have not been taken into account in the calculations. For the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, these elements are presented at pages 196 to 198. The only amount that will be paid directly to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in 2022 in respect of 2021 relates to the collective pension insurance contract that has been set up, following legislative changes and in accordance with the remuneration policy, as of January 1, 2020, to replace the acquisition of conditional rights under the defined benefit pension plan with effect from that date and in order to maintain equivalent rights to those that would have existed under this plan, if it could have been maintained for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier. This amount stands at 170,000 euros in respect of 2021 and is intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer pursuant to the collective pension insurance contract. Taking this amount into consideration, the ratios for 2021 for the Company amount to 49 (remuneration ratio compared to the employees average) and 69 (remuneration ratio compared to the employees median), and to 94 for the whole of France scope (remuneration ratio compared to the employees average in France), i.e. a low impact.\n\n- (b) The data for 2020, which had been presented as an estimate, based on the nominal/target variable component in the 2020 Universal Registration Document, has been updated.\n- (c) The data for 2021 is presented as an estimate, based on the nominal/target variable component (value of variable components in respect of 2021 not known for the entire scope of the Company at the date of publication). The final ratios based on the variable remunerations paid in respect of 2021 will be published in the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe variation in the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer between 2020 and 2021 is due to a base effect: in 2020, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's remuneration had decreased by more than 10% compared to 2019, since the objectives for the quantitative criteria of his variable remuneration, determined before the start of the pandemic, were not modified during the course of the fiscal year despite the major impact on those indicators of the crisis caused by the pandemic. The 2020-2021 increase reflects a return to normal. However, since the impact of the financial criteria on employee remuneration is limited, the employees' remuneration has not been affected in the same way.\n\n- (d) L'Air Liquide S.A. is the listed company, which has more than 1,000 employees (Head Office, R&D, Innovation, and European Projects). The calculation takes into account employees continuously in post over two consecutive years from 2016 to 2021.\n- (e) On annual basis.\n- (f) The scope of the Group in France represents more than 95% of the Group's employees present in France (representing more than 11,500 employees). The calculation takes into account employees continuously in post over two consecutive years from 2018 to 2021.\n- (g) After taking into account the proration of LTI grants under the 2020 and 2021 plans for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, the 2020 and 2021 ratios are adjusted as follows:\n\n2020:\n\n2021:\n\n44 => 40\n\n63 => 57\n\n83 => 76\n\n49 => 39\n\n69=> 55\n\n94 => 75",

LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS\n\nThe elements set out below which Mr Beno\u00eet Potier benefits from are taken into account for the determination of his total remuneration.\n\n## 2.4.1.  Company's pension and similar benefit obligations\n\nIn addition to the mandatory basic and supplementary pension schemes (Agirc-Arrco) with which he is, or was affiliated, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier has been authorized to benefit from various supplementary social benefit schemes set up by L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\n## A. Collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription (as of January 1, 2020)\n\nPursuant to the PACTE Law and Ordinance No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019, the supplementary pension plans which make the vesting of rights  conditional  upon  the  beneficiaries'  presence  at  the  Company  at  the  time  of  retirement  can  no  longer  grant  a  right  to  acquire supplementary conditional rights as from January 1, 2020. For the period up until this date, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's conditional rights under the defined benefit pension plan ('plan S') remain frozen and subject in their entirety to the pension plan regulations (see details below).\n\nSince January 1, 2020, a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription replaced the acquisition of rights under  the  defined  benefit  pension  plan  above.  Pursuant  to  the  PACTE  Law  and  Ordinance  No.  2019-1234  of  November  27,  2019, implementation of this new scheme for the benefit of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier was approved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020, pursuant to the remuneration policy (11 th resolution).\n\nIn this scheme, the amount paid by the Company is split between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer. This amount is paid in arrears every year for the period until the end of the executive office. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions.\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier cannot apply for the entitlements under this pension insurance contract in the form of capital and/or life annuity before the age at which he becomes entitled to claim his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nThis scheme was selected from among several alternatives and represents the lowest cost for the Company, being over 20% less than that  of  the  previous  defined  benefit  plan  (see  description  of  this  plan  below).  For  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier,  it  simply  supplements  the  rights accumulated under the aforementioned defined benefit pension plan and makes it possible to maintain rights which are equivalent to those which would have existed under such plan, if it had been possible for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier to continue to acquire rights under this plan after December 31, 2019. Although, pursuant to the new legislation, this pension insurance contract is not subject to a condition of the beneficiary's presence at the Company at the end of his career, in any event, with regard to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, the application of this condition under the defined benefit pension plan has become totally theoretical: a beneficiary who is over 55 years of age and has at least five years' length of service (which is the case for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier) shall retain his rights, even if his term of office is terminated provided that he does not resume any professional activity before his retirement. Consequently, the fact that this condition does not apply to the new scheme is neutral in this specific situation.\n\nThe gross annual contribution amounts to approximately 10% of the annual target fixed and variable remuneration for 2021, subject to the  achievement  of  identical  performance  conditions  to  those  which  apply  to  the  defined  benefit  pension  plan,  which  had  been determined by the Board of Directors and approved by the General Meeting of May 16, 2018 in its 10 th resolution. Consequently, the total amount of contributions for a fiscal year depends on the average annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements,  approved  by  the  General  Meeting)  for  the  last  three  fiscal  years  prior  to  the  said  fiscal  year.  For  the  purposes  of  this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC is measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps is calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.\n\nThe performance coefficient applied to the nominal amount pursuant to the collective pension insurance contract is determined as shown in  the  table  below, with a growth of the increase per linear segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC) over three years in bps  \u207d \u1d43   | Performance coefficient applied to  the nominal amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                   | 100%                                                     |\n| 250                                                                     | 66%                                                      |\n| 200                                                                     | 50%                                                      |\n| 100                                                                     | 25%                                                      |\n| < 100                                                                   | 0%                                                       |\n\nFinally, the new scheme is taken into account when determining the upper limit of 45% of the Reference Remuneration that applies to the defined benefit pension plan (see page 184), this upper limit being not reached.\n\nCompliance with the conditions set forth above is verified on an annual basis, before the Ordinary General Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the last completed fiscal year, by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn  respect of 2021, the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, took note of the 100% achievement of the performance conditions. Accordingly, the amount to be paid in 2022 in respect of 2021 under the pension scheme with individual and optional subscription will amount overall to 340,000 euros (split, in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, between a payment of 170,000 euros (gross) to the insurer in the form of an insurance premium, and a payment of 170,000 euros (gross) to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and similar charges and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer).\n\nAccordingly, in respect of this financial year, under the collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription:\n\n- \u25a0 the total amount paid corresponds to 10.3% of the target annual fixed and variable remuneration for 2021;\n- \u25a0 In the event of a conversion of the capital  paid  to  the  insurer  into  a  life  annuity,  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier's  rights  under  this  scheme  are estimated, at December 31, 2021, and including the payment to be made in 2022 in respect of the 2021 fiscal year, at 13,600 euros gross per year.\n\nThis  collective  pension  insurance  contract  with  individual  and  optional  subscription  thus  replaced  the  acquisition  of  conditional  rights under  the  defined  benefit  pension  plan  ('plan  S'),  which  was  frozen  and  since  January  1,  2020  has  allowed  no  acquisition  of supplementary conditional rights. The conditional rights to which Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is entitled pursuant to this plan for the period running up until December 31, 2019 remain subject to the provisions of the plan's regulations, including in particular the condition that he ends his professional career at the Company.\n\nFor the record, pursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 137-11 of the same Code, the collective defined benefit pension plan 'S' had been set up by Air Liquide for the benefit of the employee senior executives and corporate officers:\n\n- (i) whose remuneration exceeded 24 times the annual social security ceiling (PASS);\n- (ii) who had a total of three years' length of service with the Air Liquide group, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance; and\n- (iii) who  were  not  classed  as  a  participant  under  the  supplementary  defined  benefit  pension  plan  with  guaranteed  cover  ('garantie  de ressources') which was closed in 1996.\n- Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's conditional rights under this scheme:\n- (i) may be applied for, if the beneficiary definitively ends his professional career at the Company and decides to claim his mandatory basic and supplementary pension (Arrco-Agirc) entitlements, whether or not at the full rate.\n- In the event of the termination of his corporate office at the Company's initiative, a beneficiary who is over 55 years of age and has at least  five  years'  length  of  service  shall  retain  his  rights,  if  he  does  not  resume  any  professional  activity  until  his  retirement.  The condition of ending his career at the Company is then considered to be met, as he has not performed any activity after leaving the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This rule, which is in line with the position of the social security administration reflects the Human Resources policy at Air Liquide, for which long careers within the Group constitute a key element; given the length of service of the potential beneficiaries of this scheme, some of whom have spent the whole of their career within the Group, it would not be justified for them to lose the benefit of this scheme in the event of a forced departure (except in the event of gross or willful misconduct) at the end of their careers.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the position of the social security administration, the rules also provide for the maintenance of the potential rights of the beneficiaries in the event of a disability of the 2 nd or 3 rd category;\n\n- (ii)  will be equal to 1% for each year of service (as at December 31, 2019) of the average of the three best years in the last five years of remuneration  exceeding  24  times  the  annual  social  security  ceiling  ('PASS')  (the  'Reference  Remuneration').  The  basis  for calculation of the pension annuity will be limited to the fixed and variable remuneration only, to the exclusion of any other form of remuneration, whether paid by the Company or by any French or foreign subsidiary. For this calculation, the average of the total variable  portions  taken  into  account  cannot  exceed  100%  of  the  average  of  the  total  fixed  portions  taken  into  account.  Where applicable, an annuity equal to 60% of the aforementioned benefits will be paid to the surviving spouse, subject to certain conditions, notably with regard to age;\n- (iii) will be capped, in all cases, as they are for all the senior managers and executives benefiting from the defined benefit plan, and for all pension plans combined, whether public or private, in France or abroad, at 45% of the Reference Remuneration. Should this ceiling be reached, the amount paid under the defined benefit plan would be reduced accordingly;\n- (iv) have been the subject of:\n- -contributions paid to an insurance body, that are deductible from the corporate income tax base, and\n- -provisions in the Group's consolidated financial statements;\n- (v)  are estimated, as at December 31, 2021, at 648,379 euros gross per year, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier having a total of 38.6 years' length of service in the Group as at December 31, 2019;\n- (vi) will be subject to the employer's contribution due on pension annuities provided for by article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security ode at a rate of 32%. C\n\nThe application of this scheme to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier had been authorized by decisions of the Board of Directors on February 12, 2010, February  17,  2014  and  February  14,  2018  and  approved,  in  resolutions  specific  to  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier,  by  the  General  Meetings  on May  5,  2010  (9 th resolution),  May  7,  2014  (10 th resolution)  and  May  16,  2018  (10 th resolution).  Between  May  16,  2018  and December 31, 2019 (when this scheme was frozen as per Ordinance No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019), an increase in Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's conditional entitlements under the scheme was subject to performance conditions. These performance conditions were similar to those now applicable to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier under the collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription set up on January 1, 2020 to replace the frozen defined benefit pension plan.\n\n## B. Defined contribution pension plans - Transfer to a PERO on January 1, 2021\n\n- \u25a0 For the record, pursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 242-1, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the same Code, the Air Liquide group has set up, at several companies including L'Air Liquide S.A., a defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of all the employees (Article 83 of the French General Tax Code).\n\nThe  individual  application  of  this  plan  to  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  had  been  authorized  by  a  decision  of  the  Board  of  Directors  on February 12, 2010, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9 th resolution).\n\nIn order to bring it into line with the new legal and regulatory plan arising from the PACTE Law, this defined contribution pension plan has been transferred collectively to a mandatory company retirement savings plan (PERO) on January 1, 2021.\n\nThe application of this plan to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as from January 1, 2021 was authorized by the Board of Directors on February 9, 2021 and this item was incorporated into the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021.\n\nIn keeping with the prior plan, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier benefits from the 'PERO' defined contribution pension plan which applies to all the employees and the Executive Officers, contributions to which are paid in equal shares by the employer and the beneficiary on the fraction of remuneration which does not exceed eight times the annual social security ceiling (PASS).\n\nThese contributions are assessed on bracket 1 (formerly bracket A) (the portion of remuneration that is less than one PASS) at a rate of  2.30%, and on bracket 2 (formerly brackets B and C) (those portions of remuneration amounting, respectively, to between one PASS and eight times the PASS) at a rate of 6.45%, and are distributed in the following manner: 50% borne by the Company and 50% borne by the beneficiary.\n\nFurthermore,  they  are  deductible  from  the  corporate  income  tax  base,  are  subject  to  the  social  levy  at  the  rate  of  16%,  and  are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of the higher of the following two values: 5% of the PASS or 5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of five times the PASS.\n\nFor information purposes, contributions paid in 2021 by the Company for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier totaled 9,759 euros.\n\nThis  amount  paid  by  the  Company,  in  2021  for  that  fiscal  year,  to  the  third  party  responsible  for  managing  the  aforementioned supplementary defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is also stated in the footnotes to Table 2 (see page 172).\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier's pension entitlements under this plan:\n\n- -may be applied for, at the earliest, when he has claimed his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme; -are estimated, as at December 31, 2021, at 9,667 euros gross per year.\n- \u25a0 In addition, pursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 242-1, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the same Code, L'Air Liquide S.A. set up a defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of the senior executives, defined by reference to a collective bargaining agreement coefficient, and of corporate officers who have at least one year's length of service.\n\nSince  2015,  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  no  longer  benefits  from  this  defined  contribution  pension  plan  set  up  for  the  benefit  of  the  senior executives, the contribution paid for his benefit having been transferred to the life insurance plan (see below).",

These contributions  were  last  set  at  2.5%  of  the portion of remuneration that is lower than eight times the PASS. Furthermore, they were subject to the same tax and social security treatment as those paid pursuant to the defined contribution pension plan set up for the benefit of all the staff (see above);\n- -are estimated, as at December 31, 2021, at 194,829 euros gross per year.\n\n## 2.4.2.  Other life benefits\n\n## A. Life insurance plan\n\nSince  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  is  no  longer  a  beneficiary  of  the  defined  contribution  pension  plan  for  senior  executives  (see  above), L'Air Liquide S.A. has entered into a collective life insurance contract which enables him to create savings which are available at any time.\n\nThe insurance contract provides that the beneficiary can ask for the payment of a single capital sum or conversion of the capital into a life annuity.\n\nThe Executive Officer's rights under this plan are financed by contributions paid by the Company to an insurance body and concern the brackets of remuneration ranging from 0 to 24 times the PASS, with the following rates:\n\n- \u25a0 2.5% on the remuneration fraction up to 8 PASS;\n- \u25a0 25% on the remuneration fraction between 8 and 16 PASS;\n- \u25a0 40% on the remuneration fraction between 16 and 24 PASS.\n\nIn  the  event  of  a  conversion  of  the  capital  into  a  life  annuity,  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier's  rights  under  this  plan  are  estimated,  at December 31, 2021, at 83,471 euros gross per year.\n\nThe opening of this plan, for the third bracket (16 to 24 times the PASS) and then the second bracket (8 to 16 times the PASS), and finally its  extension  to  the  first  bracket  (0  to  8  times  the  PASS)  of  the  Reference  Remuneration,  at  an  unchanged  cost  for  the  Company, responded to a concern for good management. The contributions paid by the Company to the third-party plan manager are assessed on the basis of the portions of the Reference Remuneration of the beneficiaries corresponding to each of the three brackets, in accordance with conditions identical to those of the previous plan.\n\nThe contributions are reviewed each year on the basis of the amount of the PASS. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions.\n\nFor Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, the signature of this contract, for the third and then the second bracket, was authorized by decisions of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2012 and February 13, 2013 in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 7, 2013 in a specific resolution (7 th resolution). The extension of the plan to the first bracket concerning the band of Reference Remuneration amounting to between 0 and 8 times the annual social security ceiling was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 6, 2015, in a specific resolution for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier (7 th resolution).\n\nThe amount paid by the Company in 2021 in respect of the 2020 fiscal year to the insurance body pursuant to the life insurance plan for the benefit of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is disclosed in the footnotes to Table 2 (see page 172). The amount which will be paid in 2022 in respect of 2021 is also stated in these notes.\n\n## B. Death and disability benefits plan\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier benefits from the additional 'incapacity, disability, death' benefits plan, unified as from January 1, 2015, covering all the personnel and the corporate officers who are duly authorized to benefit from such plan, which provides in particular for:\n\n- \u25a0 the grant to the beneficiaries:\n- -of additional daily indemnities in the event of incapacity and a disability annuity set, all benefits combined, at a maximum annual\n\namount of 460,723 euros, and\n\n- -of a death benefit, the maximum amount of which is set at 120 times the PASS in the event of an accident.\n\nThe life insurance contract entered into with the insurer specifies the limits of the incapacity/disability and death benefits for the same insured party;\n\n- \u25a0 the payment in full, by the Company, of the contributions calculated as a percentage of the Reference Remuneration which is capped at:\n- -16 times the PASS for the incapacity and disability cover, and\n- -24 times the PASS for the death cover.\n\nThe contribution rate for 2021 amounts to 0.92% of the Reference Remuneration up to 16 PASS and to 0.71% between 16 and 24 PASS. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at a rate of 8%, and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of an amount equal to the sum of 6% of the PASS and 1.5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of 12% of the PASS.\n\nThe individual application to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier of this unified benefit plan covering all the personnel, in respect of his duties as Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  was  authorized  by  decision  of  the  Board  of  Directors  on  November  20,  2014,  in  accordance  with  the regulated  agreements  and  commitments  procedure,  and  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  on  May  6,  2015  in  a  specific  resolution (7 th resolution).\n\nThe contribution paid in 2021 for that fiscal year by L'Air Liquide S.A. in respect of the death and disability benefits plan for the benefit of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, amounts at 8,392 euros and this amount is also disclosed in the footnotes to Table 2 (see page 172).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Termination indemnity\n\nThe main terms of the termination indemnity applicable to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier are:\n\n- \u25a0 only the cases of forced departure of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier from his terms of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (removal from office, request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or a change in control (in the latter case, the termination indemnity is due, if the departure occurs within six months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at 24 months of gross fixed and variable remuneration;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity due decreases gradually as Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, approaches  the  age  limit  defined  in  the  Company's  articles  of  association;  in  the  event  of  a  forced  departure  in  the  24  months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit set by the articles of association, the amount of the indemnity due will be capped at the number of months' gross remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches such age limit; in any event, no indemnity shall be paid should the beneficiary claim his pension entitlements on the date of his forced departure;\n- \u25a0 the right to payment of the indemnity is subject to the achievement of the performance conditions, the proportion of the indemnity due decreasing depending on the rate of achievement of such conditions (see below for details of the performance conditions).\n\n## Performance conditions applicable to the termination indemnity\n\nPayment of the termination indemnity concerning Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is subject to compliance, duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors at the time of or subsequent to the termination of his duties, with conditions related to the beneficiary's performance assessed in light of the Company's performance, defined as of today as follows:\n\nEntitlement to the indemnity referred to above shall depend on, and the amount of the indemnity paid will be adjusted on the basis of, the average of the annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (assessed  using  the  net  equity  method),  calculated  (on  the  basis  of  the  certified  consolidated  financial  statements,  approved  by  the General Meeting) with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which the departure occurs. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured with regard to each fiscal year, and the average of the three annual gaps for the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which such departure takes place will be calculated.\n\nGiven the fundamental importance, in the highly capital-intensive industrial gas industry, of the management and control of investment processes, this gap makes it possible to measure the regular creation of value over the three years prior to the departure.\n\nThe proportion of the indemnity due will be established as indicated in the table set forth below, with an increase in the indemnity by straight-line segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC) over three years in bps  \u207d \u1d43 \u207e   | Proportion of indemnity due   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                     | 100%                          |\n| 250                                                                       | 66%                           |\n| 200                                                                       | 50%                           |\n| 100                                                                       | 25%                           |\n| < 100                                                                     | 0%                            |\n\nThe decision of the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 (1) relating to this indemnity was made in accordance with the regulated agreements  and  commitments  procedure  and  published  on  the  Company's  website  on  February  16,  2018.

The variable remuneration for participation at the Board and Committee meetings is more important than the fixed remuneration .\n\nPursuant to the policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, (i) the fixed remuneration allocated to Committee Chairs has now  been  harmonized,  since  their  functions  involve  a  significantly  comparable  workload,  likewise  the  amount  of  the  remuneration allocated for attending each Committee meeting and (ii) remote participation at meetings is remunerated in the same way as in-person attendance in order to take into account the quality of means of communication allowing members connecting via video-conference to attend meetings and take part in discussions under qualitative conditions equivalent to in-person meetings. While it does not alter the preference of the Board and its members to attend meetings in person where possible, it recognizes the advances in communication technologies.\n\nThe amounts decided for break down as: 2021\n\n## 3.2.1.  Fixed remuneration (for an entire fiscal year)\n\n- \u25a0 Each member receives fixed annual remuneration set at 20,000 euros.\n- \u25a0 The Chairs of the Audit and Accounts Committee, the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Environment and Society Committee receive additional fixed annual remuneration of 20,000 euros.\n- \u25a0 The Lead Director receives additional fixed annual remuneration of 20,000 euros.\n\n## 3.2.2.

        "page_content": "## Amounts\n\nin respect of the past fiscal year or accounting valuation\n\n## Comments\n\n## Assessment for 2021:\n\nFollowing an excellent year 2021, the objectives of the quantifiable criteria were carried out to the maximum achievement level.\n\nThe amount of the variable remuneration relating to the financial criteria is as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Recurring EPS : 87% of the fixed remuneration, representing 116% of the target remuneration for this criterion;\n- \u25a0 Revenue : 35% of the fixed remuneration, representing 116% of the target remuneration for this criterion.\n\nThe amount of the variable remuneration relating to the qualitative criteria is as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 CSR : 13.5% of the fixed remuneration, representing 90% of the target remuneration for this criterion;\n- \u25a0 Organization/Human Resources : 15% of the fixed remuneration, representing 100% of the target remuneration for this criterion;\n- \u25a0 Individual  performance: 15%  of  the  fixed  remuneration,  representing  100%  of  the  target remuneration for this criterion.\n\nThe amount of the variable remuneration relating to the personal objectives is thus 43.5% of the fixed remuneration, representing 96.7% of the target remuneration for the personal objectives. The Board of Directors noted the following elements:\n\n## CSR:\n\nPerformance was considered very good:\n\n## \u25a0 Safety and reliability:\n\nBased on the estimated hours worked, the lost-time accident frequency rate of the Group's employees stood at 1.1 in 2021, compared to 0.9 in 2020 and 1.2 in 2019. After an exceptional year in 2020 in terms of safety, during which the Group achieved its best performance since the  introduction  of  this  indicator,  2021  was  marked  by  a  slight  decline  in  the  indicator; nevertheless, it remains a sharp improvement compared to its 2019 level. A similar trend can be observed for subcontractors. One of the explanatory factors for this decrease is linked to the  context  of  the  covid-19  pandemic;  mandatory  measures  requiring  employees  to  work remotely in certain countries have restricted the presence at operating sites of managers and HSE officers who are responsible for safety. In addition, some actions to improve safety have had to be cancelled or postponed: for example, some of the on-site industrial audits by Group experts, due to the prohibition on travel in some countries. Counterbalancing measures have been implemented, such as virtual audits conducted remotely using video cameras.\n\n2021  was  marked  by  the  deaths  of  four  subcontractors  (three  of  which  were  linked  to construction activities and one to the handling of a heavy load on site). For the record, 2020 had been marked by the deaths of two employees and of one subcontracted driver.\n\nConcerning industrial safety/reliability ,  the  Group's IMS program ( Industrial Management System ) set up 15 years ago has helped improve the management of industrial risks. Based on the experience acquired, a large-scale project, namely the IMS Streamlining program, was launched in 2018 in order to develop it and improve its efficiency . Despite the covid crisis, the roll-out of the new IMS reference system continued in 2021 throughout all clusters (groups of countries). In August 2021, the first cluster (group of countries) successfully completed this roll-out for the entities in its scope. The roll-out is expected to be terminated across all clusters (groups of countries) by the end of 2022.\n\nIn  2020, process safety received  special  attention  from  management through an ambitious plan to upgrade more than 600 air separation units. This plan follows an industrial accident that occurred  at  a  third-party  industrial  site  in  China.  It  enables  to  improve  the  safety  at  the production  sites  of  the  Group.  Its  implementation  continued  in  2021.  Over  450  units  were upgraded over the course of these two years. The remaining units concerned will be upgraded by mid-2022. It can be noted that Air Liquide played a leading role in influencing its peers and inviting  them  to  work  together  to  develop  harmonized  international  standards  for  everyone's benefit.\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moreover, the introduction of  technical  assistance  in  trucks  (whose  implementation  commenced  a  few  years  ago) continued in 2021, despite the public health crisis. This new technology makes it possible to have an effective impact on driver behavior, and to identify areas for improvement. In order to obtain  the  maximum  benefit,  emphasis  was  placed  on  more  intensive  driver  coaching  by Master Drivers, based on the information provided by this onboard technology.\n\n## \u25a0 Continued roll-out of the Sustainable Development strategy: Implementation of the Group's new ESG/Climate objectives\n\nThe Group's new Sustainable Development objectives were announced by Mr Beno\u00eet Potier on March 23,  2021,  and  represent  major  progress  compared  to  the  2018  objectives.  They  are structured around the notion of ACT: Act for Climate, Care for patients, Trust as the base to engage  the  communities  at  large.  These  objectives  were  well-received  and,  notably  with regard to the CO2 emissions, were considered by the markets to be very ambitious. They are based on a solid roll-out plan. All industrial clusters (groups of countries) have brought their Climate  roadmaps  into  line  with  these  new  objectives,  with  detailed  action  plans  for  the medium-term of the new plan, 2021-2025.\n\nIn each of these clusters (groups of countries), the roles of 'Climate Champions', responsible for  coordinating  this  matter,  and  volunteer  \"Sustainability Ambassadors', who carry out local initiatives and share good practices, have also been adjusted.\n\nThe Environment and Society Committee met on four occasions in 2021. It first reviewed the Group's new Sustainable Development objectives which were published in March 2021, and then later in the year the reporting and the follow-up indicators put in place to monitor these new objectives. The environmental and societal risks, the Vigilance Plan and progress made in the management of some specific risks were also reviewed.\n\nMoreover,  the  ratings  obtained  by  the  Group  in  terms  of  sustainable  development  from  the various specialist agencies continue to place it among the best performers in its sector.\n\n## Contribution to the development of the hydrogen ecosystem\n\nAs part of his work on the Hydrogen Council, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier co-chaired two CEO Events in 2021  (in  January  and  October),  each  of  which  was  attended  by  around  fifty  CEOs  of international groups, and where the speakers notably included Ms Ursula von der Leyen and Mr  Hoesung  Lee  (Chairman  of  the  GIEC),  thus  confirming  that  the  Hydrogen  Council  has acquired full legitimacy on the international scene.\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier also co-chaired a meeting in July 2021 between Mr John Kerry and around twelve CEOs from the Hydrogen Council, ahead of the decision by the US administration to provide  strong  support  for  hydrogen  in  the  stimulus  packages  announced  in  autumn (Infrastructure Bill and Build Back Better). Finally, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier represented the Hydrogen Council in October 2021 at the Hydrogen Energy Ministerial Meeting (HEM) convened by the Japanese government and the IEA and attended by around twenty international ministers.\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier is completing his 5 th year as co-chair of the Hydrogen Council in 2021 and is thus coming to the end of his 2 nd term of office. He will, therefore, step down in January 2022, but  has  positioned  himself  in  order  to  remain  the  official  representative  of  the  Hydrogen Council in Europe.\n\nIn  France,  following  the  creation  of  the  National  Hydrogen  Council  (NHC)  in  2020, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier co-chaired four sessions of the NHC in 2021, three of which were attended by ministers and played a major role in the NHC becoming the body which is lawfully recognized by  the  Government  to  draw  up  its  strategic  priorities,  notably  in  connection  with  the  2030 France investment plan.\n\nAt  the  European  level,  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  was  asked  to  take  part  in  the  annual  debates organized by the European Commission, notably as part of the \"European Clean Hydrogen Alliance\"  initiative,  and  made  active  contributions  to  the  work  of  the  ERT  (European  Round Table) on Hydrogen topics.\n\nMr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  has  also  made  an  active  contribution  to  the  emergence  of  the  first infrastructure fund dedicated to hydrogen (Hy24, in partnership with Ardian and FiveT), which was launched in the autumn of 2021, notably under his leadership and that of the CEOs of TotalEnergies and Vinci. This initiative will help mobilize the financial community more actively in the development of the hydrogen ecosystem.",

A detailed review of the hydrogen activity was proposed to the Board meeting in September 2021, one year after the meeting  dedicated  to  the  strategic  challenges  of  energy  transition.  This  review  has  made  it possible to validate the Group's strategic directions and the significant achievements made by the H2 Force teams and, more specifically, by the Europe Hub since September 2020.\n\n## Organization and Human Resources:\n\nPerformance  was  considered  excellent.  In  keeping  with  past  practice,  the  Group's  talent development policy was pursued, with regular reviews. As in previous years, these reviews are conducted  at  the  level  of  operating  clusters  (groups  of  countries)  of  the  Group  and  up  to  the Executive Committee. Special attention was paid to international development opportunities in the context  of  reduced  mobility  due  to  the  covid  crisis;  the  diversity  of  profiles  was  also  carefully examined in order to promote, at the level of the Group's key positions, the numerous cultures which make up the Group, and in order to continue to consolidate the gender balance.\n\nReviews of the Group's most promising talent took place with the Appointments and Governance Committee.\n\nIn parallel to the work on governance and preparation for the succession of the Group's Executive Management, special attention has been paid to changes made to the Executive Committee. The key  points  were  the  replacement  of  Ms  Fabienne  Lecorvaisier  as  Group  CFO  by  Mr  J\u00e9r\u00f4me Pelletan, and Ms Fabienne Lecorvaisier being in charge of Sustainable Development, in order to oversee the achievement of the ESG objectives of the Group. Other operational moves have been carefully  reviewed,  notably  the  succession  at  the  head  of  Airgas,  with  Mr  Marcelo  Fioranelli replacing  Mr  Pascal  Vinet  who  has  in  turn  taken  on  an  operational  role  in  Europe  and AMEI, becoming Vice President of Europe Industries and the Africa/Middle East & India hubs, with effect from September 2021.\n\nFurthermore, a review was dedicated to the Group's talents in technical and industrial roles, and the  technical  talent  development  program  of  the  Group  (Technical  Community  Leaders)  has evolved  in  order  to  consolidate  the  Group's  expertise  in  Hydrogen  Mobility.  The  international Hydrogen  business  line  has  evolved  and  has  acquired  greater  resources  and  a  more  agile organization, in line with the Group's strategic challenges\n\n## Individual performance:\n\nThe individual performance was considered excellent, the Executive Officer having managed, in a global context that remained difficult, due in particular to rising energy and raw material prices, supply  difficulties,  and  the  persistence  of  the  pandemic  context,  the  Group  with  agility  which enabled it to overcome these obstacles and deliver excellent results for the year.\n\nTherefore,  the  total  amount  of  the  variable  remuneration  is  above  target  and  amounts  to 2,192,875 euros, up by 50% as compared to the variable remuneration for 2020. This variation between 2020 and 2021 is due to a base effect: in 2020, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's variable remuneration had  decreased  by  more  than  29%  compared  to  2019,  since  the  objectives  for  the  quantitative criteria  of  his  variable  remuneration,  determined  before  the  start  of  the  pandemic,  were  not modified during the course of the fiscal year despite the major impact on those indicators of the crisis  caused by the pandemic. The 2020-2021 increase reflects the quality of the performance during 2021 compared to a non-standard year 2020.\n\nThe total amount of the variable remuneration due for the 2021 fiscal year will be paid in 2022, after approval of the financial statements by the General Meeting, it being noted that its payment is conditional on the approval by a General Meeting of the elements of remuneration paid during or awarded in respect of the 2021 fiscal year to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier.\n\nFor the record, the variable remuneration paid in 2021 in respect of 2020 totaled 1,459,719 euros. It  was  paid  following  approval  of  the  resolution  relating  to  elements  of  remuneration  paid  or awarded to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier for 2020 (10 th resolution) by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021.\n\nThere  is  no  deferred  annual  variable  remuneration  mechanism,  multi-annual  variable  remuneration  mechanism  or  exceptional remuneration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are calculated:\n\n- (i) for 50% of the performance shares granted, on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) (c) recorded at the end of the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nAt the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 basis points less than the objective set, which provides a degree of flexibility, making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe  objective  has  been  set  within  the  trajectory  of  the  ROCE  target  announced  by  the Company that is maintained at more than 10%, with achievement set for 2023-2024, which reflects the impact of the crisis but also a pro-active investment policy in a context of numerous and qualitative opportunities;\n\n## (ii) for 40% of the performance shares granted\n\n- -for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on an objective of Total Shareholder  Return  set  by  the  Board,  defined  as  the  average  annual  growth  rate  of  an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends, for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 fiscal years  ('AL  TSR').

Implementation of this new scheme for the benefit of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier was approved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020 pursuant to the remuneration policy (11 th resolution).\n\nIn this scheme, the amount paid by the Company is split between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer. This amount is paid in arrears every year for the period until the end of the executive office. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions.\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier cannot apply for the entitlements under this pension insurance contract in the form of  capital  and/or  life  annuity  before  the  age  at  which  he  becomes  entitled  to  claim  his  pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme.\n\nThe performance conditions that apply are similar to those that applied to the defined benefit plan: the total amount of contributions for a fiscal year depends on the average annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (net  equity  method),  calculated  (on  the  basis  of  the  certified  consolidated  financial  statements, approved by the General Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC is measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps is calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.\n\nThe  performance  coefficient  applied  to  the  nominal  amount  pursuant  to  the  collective  pension insurance contract is determined as shown in the table below, with a growth of the increase per linear segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC)  over three years in bps  (a)   | Performance coefficient applied to  the nominal amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                    | 100%                                                     |\n| 250                                                                      | 66%                                                      |\n| 200                                                                      | 50%                                                      |\n| 100                                                                      | 25%                                                      |\n| < 100                                                                    | 0%                                                       |\n\n(a) bps: basis points.\n\nIn respect of 2021, the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, took note of the 100% achievement of the performance conditions. Accordingly, the amount to be paid in 2022 in respect of 2021 under the pension scheme with individual and optional subscription will amount overall to 340,000 euros (split, in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, between a payment of 170,000 euros (gross) to the insurer in the form of an insurance premium, and a  payment  of  170,000  euros  (gross)  to  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  intended  to  cover  the  social  security contributions and similar charges and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer).\n\nPension commitment pursuant to a defined contribution pension plan\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier benefits from the 'PERO' defined contribution pension plan which applies to all the employees  and  the  Executive  Officers,  contributions  to  which  are  paid  in  equal  shares  by  the employer and the beneficiary on the fraction of remuneration which does not exceed eight times the annual  social  security  ceiling  (PASS).  The  application  of  this  plan  to  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  as  from January 1, 2021 was authorized by the Board of Directors on February 9, 2021 and this item was incorporated into the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021.\n\nThe amount of the contributions paid in 2021 (for that fiscal year) under the supplementary defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier amounts to 9,759 euros.\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Remuneration policy applicable to corporate officers\n\n## (submitted for the approval of the General Meeting pursuant to article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code)\n\nIn accordance with article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code, the remuneration policy applicable to the corporate officers of L'Air Liquide S.A., as established by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022 and described in this section, is submitted for approval by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022, in resolutions 14 to 16 for the Company Officers (section 5.1 below) and in the 17 th resolution for the Directors (section 5.2 below).\n\n## 5.1.   REMUNERATION POLICY APPLICABLE TO COMPANY OFFICERS\n\nThe  following  remuneration  policy  applicable  to  Company  Officers  is  establised  in  the  context  of  the  Group's  governance  evolution announced on December 1, 2021 in relation to the succession of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in the function of Chief Executive Officer. At its meeting on November 30, 2021, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors announced its intention to separate the functions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, to renew Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's term as Chairman of the Board of Directors, and to appoint Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as Chief Executive Officer at the close of the General Meeting on May 4, 2022, with effect from June 1, 2022.\n\nTherefore, the remuneration policy applicable to Company Officers described below and subject to the approval of the General Meeting breaks down as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the  remuneration  policy  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  (concerning  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  for  the  period  running  from January 1, 2022, to May 31, 2022);\n- \u25a0 the remuneration policy of the Chief Executive Officer (concerning Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow with effect from June 1, 2022);\n- \u25a0 the remuneration policy of the Chairman of the Board of Directors under a separated governance mode (concerning Mr Beno\u00eet Potier beginning on June 1, 2022).\n\nThis  remuneration  policy  applicable  to  Company  Officers  was  established  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  February  15,  2022,  on  the recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  based  on  its  work  in  connection  with  the  succession  plan.  During  this  work,  the Company Officers do not attend deliberations by the Remuneration Committee relating to their personal case and do not take part in deliberations  or  votes  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the  remuneration  components  that  concern  them.  The  decision-making  process followed to determine the policy is also applicable when said policy is reviewed and implemented.\n\nTo determine the remuneration policy, the Board of Directors takes into account the principles of completeness, balance, comparability, consistency, comprehensibility and proportionality as recommended by the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance.\n\nThe  presented  policy  is  a  continuation  of  that  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2021  while  taking  into  account  evolutions resulting from the changes in governance decided in the context of the succession. The established policy is therefore competitive and aligned with the Group's strategy and medium and long-term goals. While drafting it, the Board, based on the work of the Remuneration Committee, relied on an in-depth study of standard practices including a detailed benchmark of the remuneration of Executive and nonexecutive  Officers  at  CAC  40  companies  and  a  panel  of  international  companies  (major  European  groups (1) )  that  have  adopted  a separated governance. Both in terms of structure and level, the remuneration policy was therefore established in accordance with Group practices, its new governance context and market practices.\n\n## 5.1.1.  Remuneration policy applicable to Executive Officers\n\n## A. General principles\n\nIn  keeping  with  the  Group's  practices,  the  remuneration  policy  applicable  to  Executive  Officers  determined  by  the  Board  of  Directors includes incentive elements reflecting the Group's strategy, which is steered toward profitable long-term growth by acting on behalf of a sustainable  future,  with  regard  to  the  corporate  interest  and  the  interests  of  all  the  stakeholders.  In  a  highly  capital-intensive  industry, profitable  long-term  growth  requires  constant  attention  to  be  paid  to  each  investment  decision  and  to  the  competitiveness  of  every operation, while maintaining an ongoing effort over time in favor, in particular, of safety and security, innovation, employee development, and environmental and societal stakes. It is tailored to the Group's specific situation, reflects the level of responsibility of Group executives and  remains  competitive.  In  this  context,  the  elements  taken  into  account  for  the  determination  of  the  remuneration  of  the Executive Officers are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 an annual short-term component, comprising a fixed remuneration and a variable remuneration;\n- \u25a0 a long-term incentive (hereafter 'LTI') through the grant of performance shares and/or stock options, both subject in full to performance conditions calculated over three years;\n- \u25a0 other benefits attached to the performance of the Executive Officer's term of office, specifically including:\n- -a supplementary pension scheme,\n- -additional social coverage in terms of death and disability benefits and healthcare expenses,\n- -benefits in kind (including unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers),\n- -commitments in the event of termination of duties (indemnity in the event of cessation of functions at the Company's initiative in certain very limited circumstances, subject to performance  conditions calculated over three years and, for the Chief Executive Officer, a non-competition indemnity).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Specifically, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier resigned from his employment contract in May 2010 and Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow announced his intention to unilaterally end his employment contract by means of resignation as from his appointment as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nFurthermore, if such a situation were to arise, the remuneration applicable to a Senior Executive Vice President would be determined on the basis of the policy applicable to a Chief Executive Officer of the Company, after taking account, however, of the difference in profile, experience, and level of responsibility, consistent with the earlier practices applied at the Company for this type of Executive Officer.\n\n## B. Structure and main characteristics common to the general remuneration of Executive Officers\n\n- (A) The structure and principles applied to remuneration are in line with previous fiscal years, subject to changes related to the succession of the functions of Chief Executive Officer.\n- \u25a0 The remuneration policy provides for a proportionate balance between the three components of the total annual remuneration (i.e.  the  fixed  remuneration,  the  variable  remuneration  and  the  long-term  incentives,  comprising  performance  shares  and/or  stock options).\n- i. The fixed remuneration represents approximately 25%, the variable remuneration approximately 35% and the LTI approximately 40%  of  the  target  total  annual  remuneration.  The elements  subject  to  performance  conditions represent  in  principle approximately 75% of this total target remuneration. The achievement of each performance condition is assessed without any setoff between criteria.\n- ii. Due to the cessation of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier will not be awarded LTI for 2022. The fixed remuneration for 2022 therefore represents 40% and the target variable remuneration represents 60% of his target total annual remuneration specific for 2022.\n- iii. The variable  remuneration continues  to  be  expressed  as  a target variable  remuneration  (as  a  percentage  of  the  fixed remuneration) with a maximum .  The total target variable remuneration which is determined represents at most 90% of the total maximum variable remuneration, for a very good performance.\n- \u25a0 The annual variable remuneration includes quantifiable and qualitative criteria.\n- (B) Regarding the weighting of criteria chosen, a greater relative weight is given to the quantifiable criteria as compared to the qualitative criteria.\n\nThe  target  weighting  and  the  maximum  weighting  are  made  public  ex  ante  and  appear  below  in  the  section  applicable  to  each Executive Officer; the actual weight of each criterion for the determination of the variable remuneration due in respect of the fiscal year will be established on the basis of the performance measured for each criterion in light of the target objective, on the basis of the application of a  formula  for  the  financial  criteria  and  the  assessment  of  the  Executive  Officer's  performance  by  the  Board  of  Directors  upon  the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee for the qualitative criteria.\n\nThe rate of achievement of the objectives for the variable remuneration, expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration allocated to this criterion, will be made public ex post.\n\nThe quantifiable elements of the annual variable remuneration include, as in 2021:\n\n- \u25a0 a criterion  of  an  increase  in  the  recurring  net  earnings  (excluding  exceptional  and  significant  transactions  which  do  not  impact  the operating income recurring) excluding currency impact, per share (hereinafter 'recurring EPS'), which makes it possible to take into account all the items in the income statement;\n- \u25a0 a criterion of comparable growth in consolidated revenue (excluding significant scope impact and the impact of currency and energy), which reflects the momentum of the activity.\n- The two criteria of  the  recurring  EPS  and  the  revenue  reflect  the  Group's  strategy  to  achieve  profitable  growth  taking  into  account medium and long-term objectives. The efficiency objective contributes to the increase in the recurring EPS.\n\nEach quantifiable criterion is assigned a target weighting (expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration) corresponding to a 100% achievement of the target objective set at the beginning of the year, and a maximum weighting (also expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration). For each quantifiable criterion, the Board of Directors has defined an exacting target objective, which is not made public  for  confidentiality  reasons.  Nonetheless,  the  rate  of  achievement  of  the  objectives  for  the  variable  remuneration  as  a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration allocated to that criterion is made public ex post.\n\nFor each quantifiable criterion, a formula adopted by the Board of Directors makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) by taking into account, on the basis of the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, the value achieved for the criterion as compared to the target objective set. Thus, in the event of a performance that exceeds the objective  set,  the  value  of  the  variable  part  is  adjusted  upward  within  the  maximum  limit  set  for  each  criterion.  In  the  event  of  a performance that is below the lower limit set for each objective, the variable remuneration corresponding to this criterion is equal to zero.\n\nThe qualitative elements of the annual variable remuneration continue to be based, as to two-thirds, on several categories or subcategories of objectives which are defined each year and, as to one-third, on an assessment of the individual performance. For 2022, they incorporate the pursuit of long-term objectives related to Safety, Sustainable Development relating to the ESG Objectives announced by the Group on March 23, 2021 ('ACT for a sustainable future'), Human Resources and preparation of the management succession plans, thus supporting the Company's sustainability and reflecting its extra-financial performance objectives.\n\nThe grant  of  LTI  to  the  Executive  Officers  is  examined  by  the  Remuneration  Committee  at  the  same  time  as  the  allocation  to  Group employees and is decided by the Board of Directors. It is made within the scope of plans, adopted at pre-established periods in autumn, in the form of performance shares and/or share subscription options granted without any discount. It is examined in light of the total amount",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nof the Executive Officer's annual remuneration, taking into account several external market surveys and ensuring that the interests of the Shareholders are respected.\n\nAccording to the principle that has been adopted since 2016, the award of LTI to the Executive Officer and his evolution over time are assessed  in  terms  of  the  IFRS  value  (and  not  in  terms  of  the  volumes  granted),  for  all  stock  option  and  performance  share  plans combined.\n\nWithin the scope of the sub-limits authorized by the General Meeting, the Board of Directors sets lower annual limits for the grants to the Executive Officers, expressed (i) as a percentage of the share capital and for each Executive Officer (ii) as a multiple of their remuneration, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe total aggregate IFRS value of the LTI granted cannot exceed 1.5 times the amount of the Executive Officer's maximum gross annual remuneration  (maximum  annual  fixed  +  variable),  it  being  noted  moreover  that,  in  accordance  with  the  relative  proportion  of  various elements  of  remuneration  referred  to  above,  the  grant  of  LTI  represents  approximately  40%  of  the  Executive  Officer's  total  annual remuneration.\n\nLTI grants to Executive Officers are subject to the proration principle on the basis of the actual presence of the Executive Officer: in the event of a departure from the Group of the Executive Officer for a reason other than resignation or removal from office for serious cause (2) , the total allocation rate (after applying the performance conditions) would be reduced pro rata for the duration of actual presence of the Executive  Officer  within  the  Group  during  the  period  of  assessment  of  the  performance  criteria.  The  Board  decided  to  apply  to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier this proration principle when he ends his term of office as Chief Executive Officer even though he maintains the position of  non-executive corporate officer within the Group. The LTI attributed to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in 2020 and 2021 will therefore be prorated under the conditions described above.\n\nIn addition, no grant of LTI will be made to the Executive Officer at the time of departure of the Executive Officer, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code. No LTI will therefore be granted to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier for 2022.\n\nAs with all beneficiaries, all the LTI granted to the Executive Officers are subject to demanding performance conditions calculated over a period of three years. The performance conditions, which apply to the plans decided upon in autumn, are set by the Board of Directors at the start of the year, at the February meeting, in order to comply with a reference period of three full years.\n\nOn  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  has  retained  for  all  LTI  beneficiaries  (Executive  Officers  and employees) the ROCE, Total Shareholder Return (AL TSR and relative TSR) and Group carbon intensity criteria.\n\n- \u25a0 The ROCE, which makes it possible to measure the Return on Capital Employed, is relevant in a highly capital-intensive industry.\n- \u25a0 The Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in turn makes it possible to align the Company's performance with the regular profits expected by its Shareholders.\n- \u25a0 Moreover, consistent with the Group's responsible growth approach, the LTI plans incorporate since 2020 a performance condition linked to the Group's Climate Objectives.\n\nThus, the performance conditions which apply to the Executive Officers and to all the beneficiaries of the LTI Plans which will be allocated in 2022 have been determined by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022. The number of LTI that will be definitively awarded/can be exercised pursuant to the 2022 Plans will depend:\n\n- (i) for 50% of the LTI granted, on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the Return on Capital Employed after tax (' ROCE (3) ') recorded at the end of the 2024 fiscal year.\n- At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 basis points less than  the  objective set, which provides a degree of flexibility, notably making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe objective has been set within the trajectory of the ROCE target announced by the Company that is maintained at more than 10% for 2023-2024, despite the impact of the crisis and a pro-active investment policy in a context of numerous and qualitative opportunities, notably in relation to the energy transition;\n\n## (ii) for 40% of the LTI granted:\n\n- -for 50% of the LTI referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on an objective of Total Shareholder Return set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air  Liquide  shares,  reinvested  dividends,  for  fiscal  years  2022,  2023  and  2024 (' AL TSR ').  The  objective  of  an  absolute TSR is set in accordance with historic performances. At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award;\n- -for 50% of the LTI referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, reinvested dividends - sourced from Bloomberg (' B TSR '),  compared to the CAC 40 TSR index, reinvested dividends (sourced from Bloomberg), in fiscal years 2022, 2023 and 2024. The rate of achievement will be 0%, if the average of the Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR, 50% if it is equal to the average of the CAC 40 TSR and 100%, if it is at least higher than 2% of the average of the CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible;\n- (iii) for 10% of the LTI granted: change in the Group's absolute CO2 emissions over the period 2022-2024 in line with the objective for a shift in 2025 in accordance with the Climate Objectives announced by the Group on March 23, 2021 (ACT for a sustainable future), as follows:\n\nComparison of the Air Liquide group's CO2 Emissions for the year 2024, expressed in millions of tonnes, to those same emissions for the year 2021, the 2021 basis of comparison being adjusted to take account of any possible takeovers of existing units at the Group's customers over the period 2022-2024, on a 12-month pro-forma basis and notably the takeover of the Sasol units in South Africa.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These emissions are accounted for as 'market based' (4) .\n\nThe rate of achievement of the performance conditions will be recorded in 2025 by the Board at the time when the financial statements are approved for the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nFor each performance condition, a formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to determine, following the end of the three fiscal years during which the performance has to be achieved, the percentage of performance shares definitively awarded/stock options that can be exercised.\n\nThe demanding objectives set for each performance condition are made public ex post , at the end of the Board meeting in the month of February following the end of the three fiscal years during which the performance has to be achieved. The rate of achievement of the performance conditions and the percentage of LTI definitively  awarded/that  can  be  exercised  are  also  published  at  the  end  of  this Board meeting.\n\nFor the beneficiaries of the 'France' performance share plan, including Executive Officers, the vesting period is three years from the Board meeting which decided upon their grant. This period, at the end of which the performance shares are definitively awarded, is followed by a two-year holding period. The stock options are in principle subject to a four-year lock-up period, followed by a six-year exercise period. Added to this is a condition of presence which stipulates the loss of the stock options/rights to the performance shares in the process of being acquired, in the event of resignation or removal from office for serious cause.\n\n## Executive Officers are also subject to specific shareholding and share ownership obligations:\n\n- \u25a0 Shareholding obligation pursuant to the French Commercial Code: on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board defined the shareholding obligations resulting from articles L. 225-185 and L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code applicable to the shares resulting from the exercise of stock options and performance shares respectively as from September 28, 2015. They lead to the obligation, for the Executive Officer, to hold, in registered form, until the termination of his duties, a minimum quantity of shares corresponding to 50% of the capital gain on acquisition, net of social security charges and tax, resulting from each exercise of stock options/each definitive award of performance shares. This percentage is lowered to 5%, as soon as the quantity of shares held by the Executive  Officer  represents  an  amount  equal  to  at  least  three  times  the  Executive  Officer's  gross  annual  fixed  remuneration. Application of this rule is regularly examined by the Remuneration Committee.\n- \u25a0 Additional  share  ownership  obligation  -  Recommendation  made  by  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Code:  the  Board  of  Directors  outlined  an additional obligation in 2008 according to which the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer must hold in a registered share account an amount equivalent to twice his gross annual fixed remuneration (one time the gross annual fixed remuneration for a Senior Executive Vice President); this obligation will remain in force until it is exceeded by the effect of the rules resulting from the French Commercial Code. The number of shares required to be held is assessed as of January 1 and July 1 of each year. The Board of Directors of February  15,  2022,  decided  that  the  rule  applicable  to  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  will  also  apply  to  the Chief Executive Officer once the functions are separated. Newly appointed corporate officers must be in compliance within four years of their initial appointment.\n- \u25a0 Executive Officers are subject to the obligation regarding the restriction on the exercise of stock options and the sale of performance shares during the 'black-out periods' prior to the publication of the financial statements (these abstention periods start 30 days prior to the  announcement of annual and half-year consolidated results  and  15  calendar  days  prior  to  the  publication  of  quarterly  financial information.  They  end  on  the  date  of  publication  of  the  information  at  close  of  business)  and  on  the  commitment  not  to  carry  out hedging  transactions  with  regard  to  the  risk  concerning  stock  options/shares  resulting  from  the  exercise  of  stock  options  and concerning the performance shares awarded, throughout the length of their term of office.\n- \u25a0 The selection of the components for the remuneration of the Executive Officers by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, described above, is made by taking into account the conditions of remuneration and employment of the Company's employees . Accordingly, the quantifiable and qualitative components of the variable remuneration for the Company's Executive Officers and senior executives are identical. These objectives are also reflected in those for the Company's employees who have a short-term variable remuneration. Moreover, the LTI performance conditions are identical for all the employee beneficiaries (for the record, approximately 2,000 Group employees in 2020 and 2021) and for the Executive Officers. These alignments provide for greater coherence of efforts in achieving the Company's performance objectives. The importance given to the safety objectives helps implement a high-quality working environment for the employees that has a direct impact on their engagement and performance. The variable  remuneration  also  incorporates  objectives  of  talent  development,  the  achievement  of  which  requires  in  particular  the implementation  of  varied,  relevant  programs  for  the  training  and  development  of  employees  throughout  their  career  and  the implementation of new ways of working within the entire Group.\n- \u25a0 Executive Officers benefit moreover from long-term commitments and commitments relating to termination of duties as described below in the section '2022 Remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (until May 31, 2022)' and '2022 Remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer (as from June 1, 2022)', in addition to other annual remuneration items (benefits in kind, supplementary social benefit schemes) which may be terminated under ordinary law conditions.",

Pursuant to the AFEP/MEDEF Code,  it  is  stated  that  he  would  not  be  a  beneficiary  if  an  LTI  grant  took  place  during  this  period .  It  is  also  stated  that Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  does  not  benefit  from  any  remuneration  or  indemnity  due  to  the  announced  cessation  of  his  term  of  office  as Chief Executive Officer on May 31, 2022.\n\n## 1. Fixed remuneration\n\nThe fixed remuneration is determined on the basis of the level of responsibility, the experience in the executive management duties and market practices.\n\nThe annual fixed remuneration for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, in application of the above principles, will be an annual amount of 1,325,000 euros (identical since 2018). The amount will be prorated for the period from January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022, to the effect that the amount paid will be equal to 552,083 euros.\n\nThis represents 40% of his 2022 theoretical target annual remuneration (i.e. of his annual fixed and target variable remuneration) given the absence of an LTI grant for fiscal year 2022 during which he will end his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to the AFEP/ MEDEF Code.\n\n## 2. Variable remuneration\n\nThe quantifiable components of the annual variable remuneration include, pursuant to the principles above ('Structure and principle characteristics common to the general remuneration of Executive Officers'), a criterion relating to an increase in the recurring net earnings (excluding exceptional and significant transactions which do not impact the operating income recurring) excluding currency impact, per share  (hereinafter  'recurring  EPS')  and  a  criterion  relating  to  comparable  growth  in  consolidated  revenue  (excluding  significant  scope impact and the impact of currency and energy). The weighting of each criterion is shown in the table below.\n\nThe qualitative criteria of the annual variable remuneration for the period running from January 1 to May 31, 2022, during which they will be assessed are detailed in the table below and relate:\n\n- \u25a0 as to one-third, to Corporate Social Responsibility (hereinafter 'CSR');\n- \u25a0 as to one-third, to organization and to Human Resources;\n- \u25a0 as to  one-third,  to  individual  performance.  This  criterion  responds  to  the  Board  of  Directors'  desire  to  keep  a  part  of  the  variable remuneration  subject  to  the  Board's  assessment,  in  order  to  take  account  of  the  unpredictability  of  the  environment.  This  may  be beneficial  to  the  Executive  Officer,  if  the  Company  is  facing  an  unfavorable  environment  which  was  not  anticipated  at  the  time  the objectives were set or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated.\n\nAn identical target and maximum weight are set for each qualitative criterion.\n\nThe allocation key for the quantifiable/qualitative criteria and, within each category, the target and the maximum weights for each element, determined by applying the principles set forth above, is as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Target  \u207d \u1d43 \u207e                    | Target  \u207d \u1d43 \u207e         | Maximum                          | Maximum               |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Indicator                                                                                                                                                                                                              | As a % of the fixed remuneration | As a % based on a 100 | As a % of the fixed remuneration | As a % based on a 100 |\n| Financial criteria (quantifiable) including:                                                                                                                                                                           | 105                              | 70                    | 122                              | 73                    |\n| Increase in recurring net earnings  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e  excluding  the foreign exchange impact, per share (recurring EPS)                                                                                                           | 75                               | 50                    | 87                               | 52                    |\n| Comparable growth in consolidated revenue  \u207d \u1d9c \u207e                                                                                                                                                                       | 30                               | 20                    | 35                               | 21                    |\n| Personal criteria (qualitative) including:                                                                                                                                                                             | 45                               | 30                    | 45                               | 27                    |\n| CSR:                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                  |                       |                                  |                       |\n| \u25a0 Safety and reliability: continue efforts to improve safety (lost time accident frequency rate, road traffic accidents and job-related accidents)                                                                     |                                  |                       |                                  |                       |\n| \u25a0 Roll-out of the action plans relating to the Group's new sustainable development objectives;

Other elements of annual remuneration\n\nThe benefits in kind include the use of a company car as well as contributions to the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers. By way of information, these benefits amount to around 10,800 euros on an annual basis.\n\nIn accordance with the Group's internal practice, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, like any other Executive Officer, does not receive any remuneration in respect of his office as Director, if he holds executive duties at L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\n## 4. Long-term remuneration components\n\nPursuant  to  the  AFEP/MEDEF  Code,  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  will  receive  no  LTI  grant  in  2022,  the  year  he  ends  his  term  of  office  as Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## 5. Long-term commitments and commitments relating to termination of duties\n\nThe Board of Directors takes into account, in the overall assessment and determination of the Executive Officers' remuneration, the other commitments  relating  to  the  elements  of  remuneration  described  below,  some  of  which  have  been  submitted  for  the  approval  of  the General Meeting within the scope of the regulated agreements and commitments procedure (5) .\n\nThe long-term commitments and commitments relating to termination of duties made with regard to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in his capacity of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer will be maintained until the end of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, i.e., May 31, 2022.\n\n## 5.1.   Long-term commitments\n\n## The Company's pension obligations\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier has been authorized to benefit from different supplementary pension schemes set up by L'Air Liquide S.A., as follows:\n\n## Collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription\n\nPursuant to the PACTE Law and Ordinance N o 2019-697 of July 3, 2019, the supplementary pension plans which make the acquisition of rights  conditional  upon  the  beneficiaries'  presence  at  the  company  at  the  time  of  retirement  can  no  longer  grant  a  right  to  acquire supplementary conditional rights as from January 1, 2020. For the period up until this date, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's rights under the defined benefit pension plan ('Plan S') will remain frozen and subject in their entirety to the pension plan regulations.\n\nSince January 1, 2020, a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription replaces the acquisition of rights under the aforementioned defined benefit pension plan. Pursuant to the PACTE Law and Ordinance N o 2019-1234 of November 7, 2019, implementation of this new scheme for the benefit of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier was approved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020, pursuant to the remuneration policy (11 th resolution).\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier cannot apply for the entitlements under this pension insurance contract in the form of capital and/or life annuity before the age at which he becomes entitled to claim his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme.\n\nThe scheme was selected from among several alternatives and represents the lowest cost for the Company, being more than 20% less than that of the previous plan. For Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, it simply supplements the rights accumulated under the defined benefit pension plan known as 'Plan S,' and makes it possible to maintain rights which are equivalent to those which would have existed under such plan, if it had been possible for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier to continue to acquire rights under this plan after December 31, 2019. Although, pursuant to the new legislation, this pension insurance contract is not subject to a condition of the beneficiary's presence at the Company at the end of his career, in any event, with regard to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, the application of this condition under the defined benefit pension plan had become totally  theoretical:  a  beneficiary  who  is  over  55  years  of  age  and  has  at  least  five  years'  length  of  service  (which  is  the  case  for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier) shall retain his defined benefits pension plan rights even if his term of office is terminated, provided that he does not resume any professional activity before his retirement. Consequently, the fact that this condition does not apply to the new mechanism is neutral in this specific situation.\n\nIn this scheme, the amount paid by the Company is split between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer. This amount will be paid in arrears every year for the period until the end of the executive office.\n\nThe amounts contributed under this contract are specific to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier and adapted to his individual situation in light of his history and the fact that it is only intended to apply up until the end of his career as an Executive Officer (i.e., until May 31, 2022).\n\nSubject  to  the  achievement  of  performance  conditions  set  forth  above,  which  are  similar  to  those  which  apply  to  the  defined  benefit pension  plan,  which  had  been  determined  by  the  Board  of  Directors  and  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  of  May  16,  2018,  in  its 10 th resolution, the maximum annual gross amount of payments to be made in 2023 in respect of 2022 for this pension contract will be 140,658 euros, for the period of January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022.",

For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps will be calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.\n\nThe performance coefficient applied to the nominal amount pursuant to the collective pension insurance contract will be determined as shown in the table below, with a growth of the increase per linear segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC) over three years in bps  (a)   | Performance coefficient applied to  the nominal amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                   | 100%                                                     |\n| 250                                                                     | 66%                                                      |\n| 200                                                                     | 50%                                                      |\n| 100                                                                     | 25%                                                      |\n| < 100                                                                   | 0%                                                       |\n\nFinally, the pension rights acquired under this contract are taken into account when determining the upper limit of 45% of the Reference Remuneration that applies to the defined benefit pension plan ('Plan S'), this upper limit being not reached.\n\n## Mandatory Company Savings Plan (PERO)\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier benefits from the defined contribution pension plan which applies to all the employees and the Executive Officers, the contribution to which is paid in equal shares by the employer and the beneficiary on the remuneration which does not exceed eight times the PASS.\n\nNote that in order to bring it into line with the new legal and regulatory plan arising from the PACTE Law, this retirement plan is being transferred collectively to a mandatory company retirement savings plan (PERO) on January 1, 2021. As Mr Beno\u00eet Potier benefits from this collective plan (the application of this plan to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as from January 1, 2021, was authorized by the Board of Directors on February 9, 2021, and this element was incorporated into the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2021), his rights under this plan were also transferred to the PERO on this date. As for the defined contribution plan, the employer and beneficiaries pay equal contributions into the mandatory company retirement plan on the fraction of the remuneration up to a limit of eight times the PASS. For information purposes, contributions paid in 2021 by the Company for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier under the PERO totaled 9,759 euros.\n\nIndividual  application  of  the  defined  contribution  plan  to  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  was  authorized  by  decision  of  the  Board  of  Directors  on February 12, 2010, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9 th resolution).\n\n## Other benefits\n\n## Life insurance plan\n\nAs Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is no longer a beneficiary of the defined contribution pension plan for employee senior executives, a collective life insurance contract was signed, in order to create savings on behalf of the beneficiary which are available at any time.\n\nThe contract provides that the beneficiaries can request the payment of a single capital sum or the conversion of the capital into a life annuity.\n\nThe Executive Officer's rights under this plan are financed by contributions paid by the Company to an insurance body and concern the brackets of remuneration ranging from 0 to 24 times the PASS, with the following rates:\n\n- \u25a0 2.5% on the remuneration fraction up to 8 PASS;\n- \u25a0 25% on the remuneration fraction between 8 and 16 PASS;\n- \u25a0 40% on the remuneration fraction between 16 and 24 PASS.\n\nThe opening of this plan, for the third bracket (16 to 24 times PASS) and then the second bracket (8 to 16 times PASS), and finally its extension to the first bracket (0 to 8 times PASS) of the Reference Remuneration, at an unchanged cost for the Company, responded to a concern for good management. The contributions paid to the third-party plan manager are assessed on the basis of the portions of the beneficiaries' Reference Remuneration which correspond to each of the three brackets, in accordance with conditions which are identical to those of the previous plan. The contributions are reviewed each year on the basis of the amount of the PASS.\n\n## For informational purposes:\n\n- \u25a0 in 2021, in respect of fiscal year 2020, they totaled 222,134 euros to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier;\n- \u25a0 in 2022, in respect of fiscal year 2021, they will total 222,134 euros;\n- \u25a0 in 2023, the payment for the period from January 1, 2022, through May 31, 2022, will total 91,897 euros.\n\nFor Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, the signature of this contract, for the third and then the second bracket, was authorized by decisions of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2012 and February 13, 2013 in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 7, 2013 in a specific resolution (7 th resolution). The extension of the plan to the first bracket concerning the band of Reference Remuneration amounting to between 0 and 8 times the annual social security ceiling was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 6, 2015, in a specific resolution for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier (7 th resolution).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was approved by the General Meeting on May 16, 2018 in a specific resolution (9 th resolution). The main terms are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 only the cases of forced departure of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier from his terms of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (removal from office, request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or a change in control (in the latter case, the termination indemnity is due if the departure occurs within six months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at 24 months of gross fixed and variable remuneration;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity due decreases gradually as Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, approaches  the  age  limit  defined  in  the  Company's  articles  of  association;  in  the  event  of  a  forced  departure  in  the  24  months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit set by the articles of association, the amount of the indemnity due will be capped at the number of months' gross remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches such age limit; in any event, no indemnity shall be paid should the beneficiary claim his pension entitlements on the date of his forced departure;\n- \u25a0 the right to payment of the indemnity is subject to the achievement of the performance conditions, the proportion of the indemnity due decreasing depending on the rate of achievement of such conditions (see below for details of the performance conditions).\n\nThis mechanism is maintained until the date on which Mr Beno\u00eet Potier ends his term of office as Chief Executive Officer and from which he will exercise his pension rights. Given that Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is approaching the statutory age limit, the indemnity to which he would have a right would in any event be reduced in compliance with that described above.\n\n## Performance conditions applicable to the termination indemnity:\n\nThe Board of Directors decided that the payment of the termination indemnity concerning Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is subject to compliance, duly acknowledged  by  the  Board  of  Directors  at  the  time  of  or  subsequent  to  the  termination  of  his  duties,  with  conditions  related  to  the beneficiary's performance assessed in light of the Company's performance, defined as of today as follows:\n\nEntitlement to the indemnity referred to above shall depend on, and the amount of the indemnity paid will be adjusted on the basis of, the average of the annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (assessed  using  the  net  equity  method),  calculated  (on  the  basis  of  the  certified  consolidated  financial  statements,  approved  by  the General Meeting) with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which the departure occurs. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured with regard to each fiscal year, and the average of the three annual gaps for the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which such departure takes place will be calculated.\n\nThe proportion of the indemnity due will be established as indicated in the table below, with an increase in the indemnity by straight-line segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC) over three years in bps  \u207d \u1d43   | Proportion of indemnity due   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                   | 100%                          |\n| 250                                                                     | 66%                           |\n| 200                                                                     | 50%                           |\n| 100                                                                     | 25%                           |\n| < 100                                                                   | 0%                            |\n\n## Unemployment insurance for the company managers and corporate officers\n\nBy decision of the Board of Directors in May 2006, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier benefits, in his capacity as a corporate officer, from the unemployment insurance for Company managers and corporate officers taken out by the Company. The contributions paid by the Company are added back to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's remuneration as benefits in kind (which for 2021 were 8,004 euros, for illustrative purposes).\n\nThe amount of the contribution to be paid in 2022 for the period running from January 1 to May 31 is estimated at 3,311 euros.\n\nThis  decision  had  been  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  on  May  9,  2007,  in  accordance  with  the  regulated  agreements  procedure (7 th resolution).  The  Board  of  Directors  confirmed,  at  its  meeting  in  May  2018,  that  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  continues  to  benefit  from  this unemployment insurance within the scope of the latest renewal of his duties.\n\nThe commitments described above may be terminated according to ordinary law.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\n## D. 2022 Remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer (as from June 1, 2022)\n\nThe elements comprising  the  total  remuneration  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  (as  from  June  1,  2022)  subject  to  the  approval  of  the General Meeting of May 4, 2022 are described below.\n\nPursuant to the principles of the remuneration policy of Executive Officers described above, the Board of Directors of February 15, 2022, on  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  defined  the  criteria  for  the  determination,  distribution  and  allocation  of  the elements which make up the Chief Executive Officer's total remuneration applicable as from his appointment to this position by the Board in connection with the implementation of a separated governance, i.e., as from June 1, 2022, as described below.\n\nThe positioning of the remuneration was drafted based on an in-depth study of industry practices, including a benchmark of remunerations at CAC 40 groups with a separated governance mode and a representative panel of European companies (6) , with the assistance of an outside firm based on publicly available data. With regard to this panel, it exhibits the necessary characteristics of competitiveness and comparability. The overall target remuneration (fixed + target short-term variable + LTI) that would be granted to him would be slightly above the median and below the average of CAC 40 companies with separated governance, and in any event, would remain below the levels of European industrial groups analyzed in the identified benchmark.\n\nIt is attractive and takes into account Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's experience and skills, and his successful career within the Group that he joined in  1993.  His  remuneration  elements,  including  long-term  commitments,  also  take  into  account  the  intention  of  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow to unilaterally end his employment contract (7) by means of resignation as from the start of his corporate office , in compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code and best governance practices.\n\nMoreover, in connection with the General Meeting's proposal to appoint Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as Director, it is worth noting that pursuant to a recurring principle of the Group's remuneration policy, Company Officers do not receive remuneration in respect of their office as Director as  long  as  they  remain  Executive  Officers.  For  this  reason,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow,  if  he  is  appointed  as  Director,  will  receive no remuneration for his office as Director .\n\n## 1. Fixed remuneration\n\nThe fixed remuneration is determined on the basis of the level of responsibility, the experience in the executive management duties and market practices.\n\nThe annual fixed remuneration recommended for Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in 2022 is, in application of the aforementioned principles, an annual amount of 1,100,000 euros. For fiscal year 2022, it will be calculated pro-rata for the period extending from the date on which the new Chief Executive Officer assumes his functions (June 1, 2022) to December 31, 2022, to the effect that the amount paid will be equal to 641,667 euros.\n\n## 2. Variable remuneration\n\nPursuant to the principles set forth above ('Structure and main characteristics common to the general remuneration of Executive Officers'), the Board of Directors of February 15, 2022, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, defined the elements of the variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer for 2022 as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the  quantifiable  elements  of  the  annual  variable  remuneration include  a  criterion  relating  to  the  increase  in  the  recurring  net earnings (excluding exceptional and significant transactions which do not impact the operating income recurring) excluding currency impact,  per  share  (hereinafter  'recurring  EPS')  and  a  criterion  relating  to  comparable  growth  in  consolidated  revenue  (excluding significant scope impact and the impact of currency and energy). The weighting of each criterion is shown in the table below;\n- \u25a0 the qualitative criteria of the annual variable remuneration were defined in keeping with the continuity of qualitative objectives of the Executive Officer during prior fiscal years, making changes however corresponding to developments in strategy and extra-financial performance criteria. They are detailed in the table below and relate:\n- -as to one-third, to ESG objectives published by the Group at the Sustainable Development Day on March 23, 2021 (hereinafter 'ESG'),\n- -as to one-third, to organization and to Human Resources,\n- -as to one-third, to individual performance. This criterion responds to the Board of Directors' desire to keep a part of the variable remuneration subject to the Board's assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment. This may be beneficial to the Executive Officer, if the Company is facing an unfavorable environment which was not anticipated at the time the objectives were set, or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated.\n\nA target and a maximum weight are set for each qualitative criterion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other elements of annual remuneration\n\nThe benefits in kind include the use of a company car as well as contributions to the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers. By a resolution on February 15, 2022, the Board of Directors decided that Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow would, as a corporate officer and given the fact that he decided to end his employment contract as from his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, benefit from the  unemployment insurance for Company managers and corporate officers taken out by the Company. The contributions paid by the Company are included in Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's remuneration as benefits in kind.

Long-term remuneration components\n\nPursuant to the principles and processes of the LTI grant described above ('Structure and main characteristics common to the general remuneration  of  Executive  Officers'),  the  Board  of  Directors  on  February  15,  2022,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration Committee, provided for an attribution to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow for his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, for fiscal year 2022, of performance shares totaling 962,500 euros (based on an IFRS value), corresponding pro-rata for the period running from June 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, to an annual value of 1,650,000 euros.",

Long-term commitments\n\nThe Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, defined the elements of pension schemes from which Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow will benefit for the duration of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer. These elements specifically  include  a  supplementary pension plan defined by taking into account the results of the benchmark formed from a panel of CAC 40 companies and European companies with separated governance, the plan currently applicable to the Group's senior managers, the overall balance of the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer, and an effort to outline a plan ensuring competitive coverage at the best cost for the Company.\n\nAll of these elements are, as with other remuneration elements, subject to the approval of the General Meeting voting on the remuneration policy applicable to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe overall  amount of the Company's contributions to the supplementary pension plans detailed below represents 15% of the target annual reference remuneration (fixed remuneration + target variable remuneration), value approaching the average of the CAC 40 panel (14%) and European panel examined (17%).\n\n## Mandatory company retirement savings plan (PERO)\n\nIn  addition  to  the  mandatory  pension  plans,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  currently  benefits,  as  an  employee,  from  the  supplementary  defined contribution pension plan which applies to all the employees and Executive Officers, which was transformed into the Mandatory Company Retirement Savings Plan (PERO) as of January 1, 2021.\n\nThe Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, decided that Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow will benefit from the PERO as from his appointment as Chief Executive Officer and until the end of his term of office, subject to a vote in favor of the present remuneration policy by the General Meeting.\n\nThis  plan  is  financed  by  monthly  contributions  based  on  remuneration  not  exceeding  eight  PASS  and  equally  distributed  between  the employer and the beneficiary. They are deductible from the corporate income tax, are subject to the social levy at the rate of 16%, and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of the higher of the following two values: 5% of the PASS or 5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of five times the PASS.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  employer's  contribution  to  this  plan  for  the  period  running  from  June  1  to  December  31,  2022,  is  estimated  at 5,722 euros.\n\n## 'Senior managers' defined contribution pension plan\n\nAs a senior manager, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow currently benefits from the 'article 83' defined contribution pension plan instituted for the benefit of senior managers for the portion of his remuneration of between 0 and 8 PASS, inclusive. The Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, decided that Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow will continue to benefit from this pension plan as  from  his  appointment  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  until  the  end  of  his  term  of  office,  subject  to  a  vote  in  favor  of  the  present remuneration policy by the General Meeting.\n\nThis plan is financed by annual contributions paid in their entirety by the company on the remuneration fraction below eight PASS and are subject to the same tax and social security treatment as those paid under the PERO.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  employer's  contribution  to  this  plan  for  the  period  running  from  June  1  to  December  31,  2022,  is  estimated  at 5,210 euros.\n\n## Collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription\n\nTraditionally, the Executive Officer benefits from a supplementary pension plan. Mr Beno\u00eet Potier therefore benefited until January 1, 2020, from a defined benefits pension plan ('Plan S'), while the acquisition of rights under this plan was replaced with effect from such date, pursuant to the PACTE Act, Ordinance No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019, and Ordinance No. 2019-1234 of November 27, 2019, by a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription, implementation of which was approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020.\n\nMoreover,  in  addition  to  defined  contribution  pension  plans  and  senior  manager  defined  contributions  mentioned  above, Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  benefited  from  a  supplementary  pension  mechanism  applicable  under  certain  conditions  to  the  Group's  senior managers. As  this  mechanism  is  not  applicable  to  Executive  Officers,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  will  no  longer  benefit  from  it  as  from  his appointment as an Executive Officer, i.e., beginning on June 1, 2022.\n\nIn order to replace the pension plan previously applicable to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow and allow him to benefit from a supplementary pension plan  as  an  Executive  Officer,  the  Board  of  Directors  sought  a  solution  in  keeping  with  the  mechanism  from  which  he  benefited  as  an employee senior manager but adapted to his new responsibilities and his overall remuneration as Chief Executive Officer, at an optimized cost for the Company and at a contribution level consistent with market practices. The Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, decided to ensure that, as of his appointment as Chief Executive Officer and until the end of his term of office, subject to a vote in favor of the present remuneration policy by the General Meeting, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow would benefit from a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription (known as 'article 82 of the French General Tax Code') for the fraction of his Reference Remuneration [Fixed remuneration + Target variable remuneration] exceeding 8 PASS. The amount paid by the Company will be split between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow intended to partially cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer. This amount shall be paid in arrears every year for the period until the end of the executive office, after recording the performance conditions associated with this pension plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The gross annual amount of payments will total approximately 345,000 euros, subject to the achievement of performance conditions similar to those applying to the 'article 82' supplementary pension plan applicable until now to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier. Consequently, the total amount of contributions for a fiscal year will depend on the average annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified consolidated financial statements, approved by the General Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps will be calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.\n\nThe performance coefficient applied to the nominal amount pursuant to the collective pension insurance contract will be determined as shown in the table below, with a growth of the increase per linear segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC) over three years in bps  \u207d \u1d43 \u207e   | Proportion of indemnity due   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                     | 100%                          |\n| 250                                                                       | 66%                           |\n| 200                                                                       | 50%                           |\n| 100                                                                       | 25%                           |\n| < 100                                                                     | 0%                            |\n\nThe  amount  of  2023  payments  in  respect  of  2022  for  the  period  of  June  1,  through  December  31,  2022,  is  estimated  at  around 202,000 euros, subject to performance conditions.\n\n## 6. Commitments relating to termination of duties\n\n## 6.1.   Termination indemnities\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  February  15,  2022,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Remuneration  Committee,  decided  to  apply  to Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow,  who  decides  to  end  his  employment  contract  unilaterally  as  of  his  appointment  as  Chief  Executive  Officer,  a termination indemnity, subject to very strict triggering conditions similar to that applying to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The main terms are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 only the  cases  of  forced  departure  of  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  from  his  term  of  office  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  (removal  from  office, request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or a change in control (in the latter case, the termination indemnity is due, if the departure occurs within six months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at the 24 previous months of annual gross fixed and variable remuneration actually paid (24 months of fixed remuneration + 2 previous annual variable remunerations actually paid) on the date of termination of his duties (subject to the exceptions described below and in the paragraph 6.2). As an exception to this rule, in the event of departure during the course of the 2022 fiscal year, the amount of indemnity will be limited to 12 months of fixed and variable remuneration (sum of the annual fixed remuneration for 2022 and the target annual variable remuneration for 2022) ; in the event of departure during the two following fiscal years (2023 or 2024), for the calculation of the indemnity of 24 months of fixed and variable remuneration, will be taken  into  account,  concerning  the  variable  remuneration,  the  target  variable  remuneration  awarded  in  the  absence  of  variable remuneration paid in respect of a fiscal year (for each fiscal year concerned), and the annual fixed remuneration of the ongoing fiscal year and that of the previous fiscal year;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity due decreases gradually as Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer, approaches the age limit defined in the Company's articles of association; in the event of a forced departure in the 24 months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit set by the articles of association, the amount of the indemnity due will be capped at the number of months' gross remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches such age limit; in any event, no indemnity shall be paid should the beneficiary claim his pension entitlements on the date of his forced departure;\n- \u25a0 the right to payment of the indemnity is subject to the achievement of the performance conditions, the proportion of the indemnity due decreasing depending on the rate of achievement of such conditions (see below for details of the performance conditions).\n\n## Performance conditions applicable to the termination indemnity\n\nThe Board of Directors decided that the payment of the termination indemnity concerning Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow is subject to compliance, duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors at the time of or subsequent to the termination of his duties, with conditions related to the beneficiary's performance assessed in light of the Company's performance, defined as of today as follows:\n\nEntitlement to the indemnity referred to above shall depend on, and the amount of the indemnity paid will be adjusted on the basis of, the average of the annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (assessed  using  the  net  equity  method),  calculated  (on  the  basis  of  the  certified  consolidated  financial  statements,  approved  by  the General Meeting) with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which the departure occurs. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured with regard to each fiscal year, and the average of the three annual gaps for the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which such departure takes place will be calculated.",

Indemnity relating to a non-competition commitment\n\nTo safeguard the legitimate interests of the Company, the Board of Directors decided at its February 15, 2022 meeting to grant a noncompetition indemnity in consideration of the commitment that would be made by the Chief Executive Officer not to directly or indirectly serve at a competitor of the Group nor a business competing with that of the Company, for a term of two years as from the date on which he ends his term of office.\n\nThe amount of this indemnity, payable monthly, would be equal to one year of gross annual fixed and variable remuneration received by the Chief Executive Officer (excluding sums received in respect of long-term variable remuneration), wherein the aggregated termination indemnity and non-competition indemnity are capped at 24 months of annual gross fixed and variable remuneration paid to the Chief Executive Officer on the date on which he ends his term of office.\n\nPayment of the non-competition indemnity shall not apply from the moment the Chief Executive Officer exercises his pension entitlements. In any event, no indemnity shall be paid beyond age 65.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  reserves  the  right  to  fully  or  partially  waive  the  non-competition  commitment  upon  the  departure  of  the  Chief Executive Officer, in which case no indemnity will be owed.\n\n## 5.1.2.  Remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman of the Board of Directors under a separated governance mode\n\n## A. Remuneration principles and structure\n\nThe Board of Directors of February 15, 2022, defined, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the principles, structure and characteristics of the remuneration of a Board of Directors' Chair not assuming the position of Chief Executive Officer. As part of the succession of Executive Management, this policy is intended to apply to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as of the termination of his duties as Chief Executive Officer and his appointment as Chairman of the Board of Directors beginning on June 1, 2022, subject to the renewal of his term of office as Director.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors,  in  compliance  with  the  recommendation  of  the AFEP/MEDEF  Code  (article  25.2),  decided  to  attribute  to  the separate  Chairman  only  a  fixed  remuneration,  thereby  excluding  any  variable  remuneration,  LTI  or  exceptional  remuneration.  The remuneration level is based on his experience, the scope of his missions, and market practices.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, the Chairman may receive remuneration as a Director (section 5.2 'Remuneration policy applicable to Directors'). Nevertheless, in the case of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, it has been decided that he will not receive any remuneration as a Director.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors has all of the material means to fulfill his mission.\n\nDepending  on  the  circumstances,  the  Chairman  may  be  authorized  to  benefit  from  the  death  and  disability  benefits  plan  covering  all personnel in addition to corporate officers authorized to benefit therefrom.\n\n## B. 2022 remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Directors (as from June 1, 2022)\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  principles  described  above,  the  Board  of  Directors  on  February  15,  2022,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Remuneration Committee, defined the remuneration elements applicable to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as of his appointment as Chairman of the Board under a separated governance mode, i.e., as from June 1, 2022.\n\nThe positioning of the remuneration was drafted based on an in-depth study of industry practices, including a benchmark of remunerations of  board  chairs  at  a  representative  panel  of  companies  with  a  separated  governance  mode  within  the  CAC  40,  and  European companies (8) , with the assistance of an outside firm.\n\nTo determine the remuneration elements applicable to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, the Board of Directors also took into account the specific role of the Chairman of the Board of Directors in the context of management succession and the missions that the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, wanted to entrust to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier for the duration of the transition in order to benefit from his experience, his vast knowledge of the Group and its business lines, its shareholders and stakeholders and its strategic  stakes  (see  Chapter  3,  section  2.2  paragraph  'Tasks  and  powers  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors;  management transition').\n\nTaking  these  elements  into  account,  the  Board  of  Directors  proposes  to  pay  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  an  annual  fixed  remuneration  of 800,000 euros, to the exclusion of any variable and long-term remuneration (including LTI) and any exceptional remuneration. The Board also  decided  that  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  will  receive  no  additional  remuneration  in  his  capacity  as  Director.  For  2022,  his  remuneration  as Chairman of the Board of Directors will be calculated pro-rata for the period of June 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022, i.e., an amount of 466,667 euros.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

REMUNERATION POLICY APPLICABLE TO DIRECTORS\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  for  Directors  of  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  was  drawn  up  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  February  15,  2022,  upon  the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee which had carried out in-depth analyses on the subject on which it reported to the Board of  Directors.  The  decision-making  process  followed  to  determine  the  policy  is  also  applicable  when  said  policy  is  reviewed  and implemented.\n\nThe  principles  and  structure  of  the  remuneration  policy  for  Directors  are  in  line  with  the  policy  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  of May 4, 2021.\n\nThe remuneration policy for the Directors aims to determine, pursuant to the total package voted by the Ordinary General Meeting (to date, a maximum annual pay package of 1.3 million euros, in accordance with the 12 th resolution voted by the Combined General Meeting on May 5, 2020), a remuneration which is competitive internationally to attract the best skills and expertise, in compliance with the Board's diversity policy.\n\nFirst of all, it provides for fixed remuneration (prorated if the term of office commences or comes to an end during the course of the year) allocated to the Directors. This remuneration is increased for the Lead Director, and an additional fixed remuneration is allocated to the Chairs of the four Board Committees, to take account of the level of responsibilities incurred and the work involved as a result of these duties.\n\nIt also includes a variable remuneration, which is the highest part, on the basis of each Director's attendance at the meetings of the Board and the Committees/working group, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code, in the form of the allocation of a fixed amount for each attendance at a meeting.\n\nPursuant to the policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, (i) the fixed remuneration allocated to Committee Chairs has now been harmonized, as their functions involve significantly comparable responsibilities, likewise the amount of the remuneration allocated for attending each Committee meeting and (ii) remote attendance of meetings is remunerated in the same way as attending in person in order to take into account the quality of means of communication allowing members connecting via video-conference to attend meetings and take part in discussions under conditions that are equivalent to them being physically present at meetings. While it does not alter the preference of the Board and its members to attend meetings in person where possible, it recognizes the advances in communication technologies.\n\nIn order to take account of the distance for Directors coming from abroad, a fixed amount per trip is added to the variable remuneration for such Directors if attending in person (the remuneration for intercontinental travel being higher than that provided for intracontinental travel). Travel expenses are refunded by the Company.\n\nThis policy promotes attendance and effective participation by the Directors in the work of the Board and Committees, which fosters dialog between the Directors and with the management team, and, more generally, a complete understanding by the members of the Company's activities and issues, including any social and environmental issues, which ensures solid governance for the Company's sustainability.\n\nThe recognition of the role of the Lead Director, who receives additional remuneration in this regard, reflects the importance accorded by the Group to his governance tasks, in connection with the meetings of the Board and the Appointments and Governance Committee, and in an informal manner between such meetings, thus promoting best governance practices. For this reason, the Company has decided, as indicated in the section 'Composition, preparation and organization of the work of the Board of Directors' (paragraph 6), to maintain the function of the Lead Director the same under a separated governance mode. The consideration, in the remuneration policy, of the work of the four specialist Committees is evidence of the importance accorded to the preparation of the principal Board decisions, whether in terms of  the  proper  running  of  the  governing  bodies,  the  review  of  the  financial  statements  and  the  financial  situation,  the  risk  analysis,  the consideration of the societal and environmental issues across all the Group's activities or indeed the determination of an incentivizing remuneration policy for the Executive Officers, including objectives in line with those of the Company.\n\nAccordingly, the remuneration policy, which is balanced and incentivizing, contributes to the quality of the Board's work, the latter being thus able to determine the orientations of the Company's activity and its strategy in the best interests of the Company, its employees and all the stakeholders.\n\nIt is stated that the Company Officers do not receive remuneration in respect of their office as Director or as Chair of a Committee/working group while they perform executive duties at L'Air Liquide S.A. Moreover, pursuant to the provisions in force at the Group which apply to all the employees who perform duties on the Group companies' Boards of Directors, and in agreement with the various stakeholders, the employee Directors do not receive remuneration in respect of their office as Director. Travel expenses are refunded by the Company.",

Allotment policy\n\nThe Company attributes annually, in principle, performance shares and/or stock options (hereinafter referred to as 'LTI') in favor of its Executive Officers and its employees. Performance share plans for its employees have been in place since 2008, and have been open to the Executive Officers and the members of the Executive Committee since 2015.\n\nThese attributions are decided upon by the Board of Directors pursuant to the authorizations granted by the General Meeting, and most recently by the Combined General Meeting of May 7, 2019 for a period of 38 months. The renewal of these authorizations is presented to the General Meeting of May 4, 2022.\n\nSince 2019, the Board of Directors has decided, in accordance with the general market trend, to grant performance shares only (instead of a mix of stock options and performance shares) to all beneficiaries, in order to simplify and standardize the scheme.\n\nThe system for the LTI plans is aimed at three sets of beneficiaries:\n\n- \u25a0 the Company's Executive Officer, for whom the attribution of LTI and his evolution over time continue to be valued in terms of the IFRS valuation (and not as attributed volumes), all stock option and performance share plans included;\n- \u25a0 the members of the Executive Committee and the Group's managers who hold positions with a high level of responsibility or who make special contributions to the Group, all of whom benefit, beginning in 2015 for the Executive Committee and since 2019/2020 for the other beneficiaries, from attribution exclusively in the form of performance shares;\n- \u25a0 the specific contributors, such as those employees distinguished by the quality of their conduct in exceptional situations, the inventors and innovators, the middle managers, as well as an expanded category of new employee beneficiaries.\n\nThe criteria used to draw up the lists of the beneficiary employees reflect the jobs and the geographical areas in which the Group carries out  its  activities  and  the  specific  contribution,  the  particular  potential,  or  indeed  the  individual  or  collective  conduct  of  the  persons concerned,  which  has  been  noted  in  exceptional  situations.  The  lists  of  beneficiary  employees  are  also  drawn  up  with  the  desire  to ensure a certain rotation and an expansion of the beneficiary population. Accordingly, around 1/3 of the beneficiaries of the plans dated September 29, 2021 are employees who had not been awarded stock options/performance shares during the last five years.\n\n## ALLOTMENTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2021\n\n| Total number of performance shares   | 376,435   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|\n| % of the share capital               | 0.08%     |\n| Number of grants  \u207d \u1d43 \u207e              | 2,195     |\n| % of employees                       | 3.40%     |\n\nPerformance conditions apply to all the performance shares which are awarded to all the beneficiaries. They are described on page 176.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the aggregate total of outstanding performance shares for which the definitive grant date has not yet occurred and the outstanding stock options have not yet been exercised is a number of shares representing 0.58% of the share capital on this date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Stock option plans (Information to be regarded as the Special Report of the Board of Directors within the meaning of article L. 225-184 of the French Commercial Code)\n\nPursuant to the decisions of the Board of Directors, following the authorizations of the General Meeting and on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Company has adopted plans granting a certain number of stock options to certain employees of the Company and its subsidiaries worldwide, including the Executive Officer.\n\nThese stock options are granted for a price which cannot be lower than the average opening market price over the 20 trading days preceding the attribution date. The maximum exercise period is 10 years since the stock option plan dated October 14, 2011.\n\nThe stock options cannot be exercised before a minimum period of four years after they are awarded. The Board of Directors has the power to terminate this lock-in period if there is a takeover bid for the Company's shares or a merger or takeover of the Company.\n\nThe outstanding stock options thus attributed by the Board of Directors in the context of the authorizations voted by the General Meetings and which have not yet been exercised amounted, after adjustment, to 1,558,410 stock options (at an average price of 78.69 euros) as at December  31,  2021,  i.e.  0.33%  of  the  shares  which  make  up  the  capital,  including  276,940  stock  options  (at  an  average  price  of 81.70 euros) awarded, during their term of office, to the Executive Officer present as at December 31, 2021.\n\nOf the total stock options authorized for issue by the General Meeting of May 7, 2019, there was still a potential attribution of 9,505,821 stock options as at December 31, 2021 (no stock options were attributed since 2019, as the Board of Directors decided to only attribute performance shares).\n\nTABLE 8.

Performance share plans (information to be regarded as the special Report of the Board of Directors within the meaning of article L. 225-197-4 of the French Commercial Code)\n\n## 3.1.   DESCRIPTION\n\nSince 2008, performance share attributions have been designed to retain and motivate talented employees dynamically and to reward performance over the medium term.\n\nThe Extraordinary General Meeting of May 7, 2019 authorized the Board to attribute performance shares to the Group's employees, within an upper attribution limit equal to 0.5% of the share capital over 38 months; pursuant to this upper limit, it fixed the limit on the number of shares that can be attributed to the Executive Officers over the same period, which amounts to 0.1% of the share capital. A new resolution proposing this authorization is presented to the General Meeting of May 4, 2022.\n\nFor  each  attribution,  the  Board  determines  two  different  plan  regulations  (the  'France'  Plan  and  the  'World'  Plan)  which  govern  the attribution of performance shares to the beneficiaries determined by the Board of Directors. The 'France' and 'World' Plans mainly differ in the number of years of presence required, and to the correlative absence of any holding requirement for the 'World' Plan as described below.\n\nThe performance shares are accompanied by:\n\n- \u25a0 a condition of presence during the vesting period: the shares granted to a beneficiary will only be definitively acquired if they continue to be an employee or Executive Officer of a Group company during a vesting period, which is calculated from the attribution date three years for the beneficiaries of the 'France' Plan and four years for the beneficiaries of the 'World' Plan. In the event of retirement, the beneficiary retains their rights, being no longer required to satisfy the continued presence requirement;\n- \u25a0 performance conditions which relate, since the first attribution in 2008, to all performance shares awarded to any beneficiary; see the performance conditions in the summary table for attribution of performance shares below;\n- \u25a0 a holding obligation: with effect from the definitive attribution date, the beneficiaries of the 'France' Plan have an obligation to hold the shares for an additional two years during which the said shares cannot be transferred (other than in the event of a death or disability).\n\nTo date, the performance shares delivered have been treasury shares issued as part of the Company's buyback program (see page 406).\n\nThe outstanding performance shares attributed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the authorizations voted by the General Meetings, for which the definitive attribution has not yet occurred, amounted, after adjustment, to 1,185,073 shares as at December 31, 2021, i.e., 0.25% of the shares that make up the share capital.\n\nOut  of  the  total  performance  shares  whose  award  was  authorized  by  the  General  Meeting  of  May  7,  2019  for  38  months, 1,304,924 performance shares remained potentially available for award as at December 31, 2021.",

If the objective set is achieved or exceed, the award is 100% (no additional award in the event of an overperformance).\n- (e) In view of the proration rules applying to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, as recalled on pages 177 and 194, the maximum number of shares delivered, after recording of the performance criteria, will be prorated in the following proportions: 80.5% for the 2020 plan (i.e. a reduction of -19.5%); and 47.1% for the 2021 plan (i.e. a reduction of -52.9%).\n- * Number of performance shares after applying the rate of achievement of the performance conditions recorded by the Board on February 15, 2022 (2019 plans). As of December  31,  2021  the  outstanding  performance  shares  which  have  not  yet  been  definitively  awarded  amounted  to  1,311,960  shares;  after  applying  the  rate  of achievement of the performance conditions, it amounts to 1,185,073 shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLANS DATED SEPTEMBER 29, 2021\n\nPursuant to the authorization of the Combined General Meeting of May 7, 2019, in connection with the 'France' and 'World' Plans dated September 29, 2021, the Board of Directors made a conditional allocation of a total of 376,435 shares representing 0.08% of the share capital in terms of the number of shares to 2,154 distinct beneficiaries (161,360 shares allocated to the beneficiaries of the 'France' Plan and 215,075 shares allocated to the beneficiaries of the 'World' Plan).\n\nThe IFRS individual fair value for these performance shares amounts to 119.66 euros for the 'France' Plan and to 115.38 euros for the 'World' Plan (see details of this IFRS value in Note 22.5 'Share-based payments' in the consolidated financial statements).\n\nSubject  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  presence  and  performance  conditions,  these  shares  will  be  fully  vested  for  the  beneficiaries  on September 29, 2024 for the 'France' Plan (but cannot be sold until September 29, 2026) and on September 29, 2025 for the 'World' Plan.\n\nFor this award, the Board adopted performance conditions calculated over three fiscal years (for a full description, see page 176).\n\nThe rate of achievement of the performance conditions will be recorded by the Board of Directors at its meeting to approve the financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year.\n\nThe Board decided to apply to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier the principle of proration on termination of his office as Chief Executive Officer on May 31, 2022, even if he maintains the position of non-executive officer within the Group. The performance shares attributed to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in 2020 and 2021 will therefore be prorated (for more details see page 177).\n\n## SEPTEMBER 29, 2021 PERFORMANCE SHARES PLANS - DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF BENEFICIARIES\n\n|                                                                                                              | Number of  beneficiaries   | Number of shares   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|\n| Executive Officers of L'Air Liquide S.A.                                                                     | 1                          | 18,800             |\n| Senior executives (who are not corporate officers of L'Air Liquide S.A.),  managers and special contributors | 127                        | 141,735            |\n| Other employees, new beneficiaries                                                                           | 2,026                      | 215,900            |\n\n## SEPTEMBER 29, 2021 PERFORMANCE SHARES PLAN - SHARES ALLOCATED TO THE 10 EMPLOYEES (EXCLUDING EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF L'AIR LIQUIDE S.A.)

RATE OF ACHIEVEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS FOR THE AWARD OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019\n\nBased on the financial statements adopted for the 2021 fiscal year, subject to the approval of the next General Meeting, the Board of Directors' meeting of February 15, 2022 recorded the rate of achievement of the performance conditions defined at the time of the award of the performance share plans dated September 30, 2019. Consequently, the total proportion of shares subject to conditions which are fully vested for the beneficiaries is 65.3% (for more details, see page 180).",

        "page_content": "Employee savings and share ownership\n\n## EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND SHARE OWNERSHIP\n\nFor many years, Air Liquide has pursued an active policy promoting employee profit-sharing and incentive schemes in connection with the Group's growth and the development of employee share ownership in the Company's capital.\n\n## 1. Profit-sharing\n\nProfit-sharing and incentive schemes have been organized for many years in Group companies in France and paid almost 57.0 million euros for 2020 performance. This year these schemes cover over 99% of employees in France.\n\nUnder the main Company Savings Plans, Group employees in France can make payments to dedicated and diversified investment funds, managed by equal-representation supervisory boards, on a voluntary basis or based on profit-sharing, incentives and, where applicable, contributions, and thus benefit from the preferential tax regime applicable in consideration for locking-in their assets over a period of five years.\n\nIn  2021,  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  paid  7.91  million  euros  (excluding  contribution)  to  1,182  beneficiaries  in  respect  of  profit-sharing  and incentives. Company contributions to the Company Savings Plan are negotiated every year and amounted to nearly 1.23 million euros in 2020. These payments correspond to an average amount of 6,691 euros per employee excluding employer contribution.\n\nIn  2021,  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  employees  invested  90.5%  of  their  profit-sharing  and  incentives  in  savings  plans,  respectively  in  bondweighted assets (29%) and equity-weighted assets (71%).\n\nA total of 31% of employee savings was invested in corporate mutual fund holding only Air Liquide shares instead of 42% last year.\n\n## 2. Employee share ownership\n\nThe Group is keen to involve its employees in its development. These employees share ownership transactions contribute significantly to increasing employee motivation and sense of belonging to the Group.\n\nSince  1986,  the  Company  has  regularly  performed  share  capital  increases  reserved  for  Group  employees,  for  which  subscription  is offered at a preferential rate. The most recent capital increase, conducted in November 2021, resulted in the subscription of 1,098,738 shares by 22,420 Group employees, representing 33.81% of the eligible employees in 74 countries.\n\nIn France, the shares subscribed in these capital increases are also eligible for the preferential tax regime applicable provided that they are blocked over a period of five years, while those held abroad are governed by the legal regulations prevailing in each relevant country.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  the  share  of  capital  held  by  Group  employees  and  former  employees  was  estimated  at  2.7%,  of  which  1.9% corresponds  (within  the  meaning  of  article  L.  225-102  of  the  French  Commercial  Code)  to  shares  subscribed  by  employees  under employee-reserved capital increases or held through mutual funds. The percentage of Group employees holding L'Air Liquide S.A. shares totaled around 48% of the workforce.\n\nAir  Liquide  wishes  to  pursue  this  strategy  and  further  the  development  of  its  employee  share  ownership,  by  regularly  offering  share capital increases to employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee share purchase plan (2021) Supplementary report\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\nWe submit  this  additional  report  pursuant  to  article  R.  225-116  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  on  the  use  we  have  made  of  the delegation of authority which you granted to the Board of Directors, at the Combined General Meeting of the Company's shareholders of May 4, 2021, in its seventeenth resolution, for a maximum period of 26 months, in order, in accordance with article L. 225-138-1 of the French  Commercial  Code  and  articles  L.  3332-18  et  seq.  of  the  French  Labor  Code,  to  increase  the  share  capital,  on  one  or  more occasions, within the limit of 4 million shares with a par value of 5.50 euros each, the subscription of such shares being reserved for the employees of the Company and of French or foreign companies that are related to it within the meaning of articles L. 225-180 of the French Commercial Code and article L. 3344-1 of the French Labor Code, and who adhere to a company or group savings plan.\n\n## 3.1. AUTHORIZATIONS AND DECISIONS\n\nWe wish to remind you that, pursuant to this delegation of authority by the General Meeting:\n\n- \u25a0 by decision dated February 9, 2021 and confirmed on July 28, 2021, the Board of Directors decided on the principle of a capital increase  limited  to  1,100,000  shares  in  favor  of  Group  employees  who  have  adhered  to  a  company  or  Group  savings  plan  in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  articles  L.  3332-18  et  seq.  of  the  French  Labor  Code  and  article  L.225-138-1  of  the  French Commercial Code;\n- \u25a0 for this purpose, the Board of Directors, at the aforementioned meetings, delegated to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer all the necessary powers to decide on the completion of this capital increase and implement this transaction and, in particular:\n- -to decide on the list of companies eligible for the transaction,\n- -to set the subscription price (including, where applicable, the subscription prices applicable locally),\n- -to set the terms and conditions and deadline for paying up the shares subscribed,\n- -to determine the dates for the opening and closing of the subscription period,\n- -to record the creation of the new shares and completion of the corresponding capital increase,\n- -to deduct the expenses, duties and fees incurred as a result of the issue, where applicable, from the amount of the corresponding issue premium,\n- -to draw up the additional report stating the final terms of the transaction,\n- -to amend the articles of association accordingly,\n- -and to do anything else that may be appropriate or required for the implementation of the transaction.\n\nAccordingly,  making  use  of  the  delegation  of  authority  granted  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer decided, on October 30, 2021, to carry out this transaction, he set the opening and closing dates for the subscription period and set the subscription price for the new Air Liquide shares within the scope of the increase in capital reserved for employees.\n\n## 3.2. MAIN FEATURES OF THE TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe increase in capital reserved for employees fell within the scope, provided for by the applicable legal and regulatory provisions, of the France Share Purchase Plan ('PE France') and the International Group Share Purchase Plan ('PEGI') which are currently in force.\n\nSubscription to this increase in capital was open to the eligible employees and corporate officers of French and foreign companies of the Group in which L'Air Liquide S.A. owned more than 50% of the share capital or voting rights and who have adhered to the PE France or the PEGI, on condition that these employees have been employed for at least three months by the date of the end of the subscription period (stricter conditions with regard to length of service are set by certain countries pursuant to local regulations). In addition, the capital increase was open to retired employees of the Group's French subsidiaries which had adhered to the PE France, provided those persons had retained assets in the Air Liquide Group's PE France.\n\nIt is to be noted that, pursuant to decisions made by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on March 30, 2009, November 2, 2010, October 29, 2013, March 16, 2016 and October 30, 2018, certain companies, of which L'Air Liquide S.A. owns 40%-50%, whether directly or indirectly, were allowed to adhere to the PE France or the PEGI.\n\nPursuant to a decision by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on October 30, 2021, the same right was also granted to Group companies located in China, Brunei, Kuwait, Japan and the United Arab Emirates, and whose employees came within the scope of the 2021 transaction.\n\nHowever, for reasons relating to the local context, employees of the Group's foreign subsidiaries in the following countries were not able to participate in the transaction: Qatar, Nigeria and Vietnam.\n\nThe subscription price was set at 113.23 euros (120.31 euros for the United States) per share, corresponding to the average of the opening trading  prices  for  the Air  Liquide  share  over  the  twenty  trading  days  prior  to  the  date  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer's decision setting the dates of the subscription period, i.e. 141.53 euros per share (the 'Reference Price'), that average then being reduced by 20% (15% for the United States) and rounded up to the nearest euro cent.\n\nThe maximum subscription amount per eligible employee was limited to 25% of the gross annual remuneration of each subscriber, in accordance with the regulations applicable to employee savings plans (this limit including, in France, all other voluntary payments made into company or group savings plans, or into collective retirement savings plans (PERCO) in 2021). An additional employer contribution in shares  was  proposed  by  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.,  and  by  French  subsidiaries  that  have  adhered  to  the  PE  France  and  adopted  the  2021 amendment agreement with regard to this point, on the basis of 1 free share for 4 shares subscribed with a maximum of 3 free shares per employee.\n\nThe subscription period for the shares ran from November 8, 2021 to November 18, 2021 inclusive (up until noon, Paris time).",

They will be admitted for trading on the Euronext Paris market under the same ISIN code (FR0000120073) as the existing Air Liquide shares and shall grant entitlement to any dividend distribution decided by the General Meeting of shareholders after the date of the decision recording the increase in capital (i.e. December 9, 2021).

IMPACT OF THE ISSUE OF 1,098,738 SHARES ON THE SITUATION OF SHAREHOLDERS AND THEIR PERCENTAGE OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND THEORETICAL IMPACT ON THE STOCK MARKET VALUE OF THE SHARE\n\n## 3.3.1.  Impact on the shareholders' holding in the Company's share capital\n\nBased on L'Air Liquide S.A.'s share capital as at December 9, 2021, prior to the increase in capital reserved for employees, namely 473,914,199 shares, the impact of the issue on the stake of a shareholder who owns 1% of L'Air Liquide S.A.'s share capital prior to the issue and who does not subscribe for that issue is as follows:\n\n|                                                                       | Percentage of capital held by the shareholder (a)   | Percentage of capital held by the shareholder (a)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                       | Undiluted basis                                     | Diluted basis                                       |\n| Prior to the issue of new shares resulting from this capital increase | 1%                                                  | 0.994%                                              |\n| After the issue of new shares resulting from this capital increase    | 0.998%                                              | 0.991%                                              |\n\n## 3.3.2.  Impact of the issue on the percentage of the Company's shareholders' equity\n\nBased on the shareholders' equity shown in the individual company financial statements as at December 31, 2021, the impact of the issue on the equity share of a holder of one Air Liquide share prior to the issue and who does not subscribe for the issue is as follows:\n\n|                                                                       | Percentage of shareholders' equity  (in euros) (a)   | Percentage of shareholders' equity  (in euros) (a)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                       | Undiluted basis                                      | Diluted basis                                        |\n| Prior to the issue of new shares resulting from this capital increase | 24.62                                                | 24.76                                                |\n| After the issue of new shares resulting from this capital increase    | 24.82                                                | 24.96                                                |\n\n## 3.3.3.  Theoretical impact on the stock market value of the Air Liquide share\n\nThe theoretical impact of the issue of 1,098,738 shares at the issue price on the share's stock market value is calculated as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Theoretical share price prior to the transaction = average of the last 20 opening trading prices of the Air Liquide share prior to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's decision setting the subscription price and the dates of the subscription period (namely the average opening trading prices of the share between October 4, 2021 and October 29, 2021). This theoretical price amounts to 141.53 euros.\n- \u25a0 Share price after the transaction = [(theoretical share price prior to the transaction x number of shares prior to the transaction) + (issue price x number of new shares)]/(number of shares prior to the transaction + number of new shares).\n\nThe average issue price of the reserved capital increase amounts to 113.96 euros.\n\nIn  light  of  these  assumptions,  the  share's  theoretical  stock  market  value  after  the  transaction  would  amount  to  141.47  euros  for  a theoretical value of the share price prior to the transaction of 141.53 euros.\n\nIt is specified that this theoretical approach is provided for information purposes only and does not in any way predict future trends in the share price.\n\nThe dilutive effect of this share issue will be neutralized by buybacks of its own shares by the Company, carried out during the 2021 and 2022 financial years, within the framework of the share buyback programs presented to the Board of Directors and already approved (General Meeting of May 4, 2021) or which will be presented for approval at the next General Meeting of May 4, 2022.\n\nParis, February 15, 2022\n\nThe Board of Directors of L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The IFRS standards and  interpretations  as  adopted  by  the  European  Union  are available at the following website:\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accounting-standardsregulation-ec-no-1606-2002/amending-and-supplementary-acts/ acts-adopted-basis-regulatory-procedure-scrutiny-rps\\_en\n\nThe Group has not anticipated any new standards, amendments to existing standards or new interpretations published by the IASB but not yet approved or not yet mandatory in the European Union, as of December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Financial Statements are presented in millions of euros. They were approved by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022. They will be submitted for approval to the Shareholders' Meeting on May 4, 2022.\n\n## NEW IFRS AND INTERPRETATIONS\n\n- 1. Standards, interpretations and amendments endorsed by the European Union whose application is mandatory as of January 1, 2021\n\nThe following texts are not applicable to the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 amendments  to  IFRS  4  'Insurance  Contracts  -  deferral  of IFRS 9', issued on June 25, 2020.\n- 2. Standards, interpretations and amendments endorses by the European Union whose application is optional in 2021\n\nThe Group Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021  do  not  include  any  potential  impacts  from  the  standards, interpretations and amendments endorsed by the European Union as of December 31, 2021, for which adoption is only mandatory as of fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2021. These texts are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 amendments  to  IFRS  3  'Business  Combinations',  to  IAS  16 'Property,  Plant  and  Equipment',  to  IAS  37  'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities  and  Contingent Assets',  and  the  annual Improvements 2018-2020, issued on May 14, 2020.\n\nThe Group did not apply the amendment to IFRS 16 'Covid-19 Related  Rent  Concessions  beyond  30  June  2021',  issued  on March 31, 2021 and of which the implementation is optional.\n\nFinally, the following texts are not applicable to the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts', issued on May 18, 2017.\n- 3. Standards, interpretations and amendments not yet endorses by the European Union\n\nThe impacts on the Financial Statements of texts published by the IASB  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  not  yet  endorsed  by  the European Union are currently being analyzed. These texts are as follows:\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation  of  Financial  Statements: Classification  of  Liabilities  as  Current  or  Non-current  and Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Deferral of  Effective  Date',  issued  on  January  23,  2020  and  July  15, 2020 respectively;\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements', issued on February 12, 2021;\n- \u25a0 amendments  to  IAS  8  'Accounting  Policies,  Changes  in Accounting  Estimates  and  Errors:  Definition  of  Accounting Estimates', issued on February 12, 2021;\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction', issued on May 7, 2021.\n\n## USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  Financial  Statements  requires  Group  or subsidiary  management  to  make  estimates  and  use  certain assumptions  which  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  carrying amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  recorded  in  the  consolidated balance sheet, the notes related to these assets and liabilities, the profit  and  expense  items  in  the  income  statement  and  the commitments  relating  to  the  period-end.  Balance  sheet,  income statement and cash flow statement line items could differ should the subsequent actual results differ from the estimates. The most significant estimates and assumptions concern namely:\n\n- \u25a0 the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment used for calculation of depreciation and  amortization: these estimates  are  described  in  section  5.e  of  the  accounting policies;\n- \u25a0 the  assumptions  used  to  determine  provisions  for  employee retirement benefit obligations: the actuarial assumptions used (employee turnover, mortality, retirement age, salary increase, etc.),  and  the  discount  rates  used  to  determine  the  present value  of  obligations,  as  described  in  section  11.b  of  the accounting policies and in note 24.3;\n- \u25a0 the estimates and assumptions concerning assets' impairment tests, as described in section 5.f. of the accounting policies and in note 11.2;\n- \u25a0 the  methods  used  to  recover  deferred  tax  assets  on  the balance sheet;\n- \u25a0 the risk assessment to determine the amount of provisions for contingencies and losses;\n- \u25a0 the  accounting  methods  for  the  margin  of  the  Engineering  & Construction  contracts  that  are  set  out  in  section  3.b  of  the accounting policies.\n- \u25a0 the  assumptions  retained  to  evaluate  the  lease  liability (IFRS 16): lease term and discount rate. They are described in section 5.g of the accounting principles.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  considers  that  climate  risks  are  material, even though their quantified impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements  of  the  Group  is  not  material.  The  Group  takes  into account  these  risks  in  its  closing  assumptions  and  incorporates their  potential  impact  in  its  Financial  Statements.  In  particular, climate  risks  are  taken  into  account  when  carrying  out  closing procedures,  in  particular  the  analysis  of  the  useful  lives  of property, plant and equipment used for calculation of depreciation and  amortization,  the  review  of  the  estimates  and  assumptions concerning assets' impairment tests, and the risk assessment to determine the amount of provisions for contingencies and losses. The  consideration  of  climate  risks  by  the  Group  is  described  in particular in note 32.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The carrying amount of other assets and liabilities hedged against fair value risk is adjusted to take into account the changes in fair value attributable  to  the  hedged  risks.  In  addition,  the  principles  of fairness, going concern, and consistency were applied.\n\n## 1. CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nThe consolidation methods used are:\n\n- \u25a0 full consolidation method for subsidiaries;\n- \u25a0 assets, liabilities, expenses and revenue of joint operations are recognized in relation to the Group's interest in these entities;\n- \u25a0 equity method for joint ventures and associates.\n\n## a. Subsidiaries\n\nAll  the  subsidiaries  or  companies in which the Air Liquide Group exercises  exclusive  control  are  fully  consolidated.  Control  exists when all the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities;\n- \u25a0 the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity;\n- \u25a0 the Group has the ability to use its power over the entity so that it affects the amount of the returns.\n\nCompanies are fully consolidated from the date the Group obtains control  and  until  the  date  on  which  control  is  transferred  outside the Group.\n\n## b. Joint operations\n\nJoint  operations  are  joint  arrangements  whereby  the Air  Liquide Group  has  joint  control  with  one  or  several  parties  through  a contractual  agreement,  which  gives  it  rights  to  the  assets  and obligations for the liabilities of the entity.\n\nAssets,  liabilities,  expenses  and  revenue  of  joint  operations  are recognized  in  relation  to  the  Group's  interest  in  these  entities. These amounts are recorded on each relevant line of the Financial Statements as for the consolidated entities.\n\n## c. Joint ventures\n\nJoint  ventures  are  joint  arrangements  whereby  the  Air  Liquide Group  has  joint  control  with  one  or  several  parties  through  a contractual  agreement,  which  gives  it  rights  to  the  net  assets  of the entity.\n\nJoint  ventures  are  consolidated  using  the  equity  method.  Under this  one,  the  net  assets  and  net  profit  of  a  company  are recognized pro rata to the interest held by the Group in the share capital.\n\nOn acquisition of an investment in a joint venture, goodwill relating to  the  joint  venture  is  included  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the investment.\n\n## d. Associates\n\nAssociates are investments over which the Air Liquide Group has significant  influence (generally when the Group has more than a 20% interest), but no control.\n\nAssociates are consolidated using the equity method. Under this one, the net assets and net profit of a company are recognized pro rata to the interest held by the Group in the share capital.\n\nOn  acquisition  of  an  investment  in  an  associate,  the  goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe Financial Statements of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are prepared as of December 31.\n\n## e. Inter-company transactions\n\nAll inter-company  receivables  and  payables,  income  and expenses and profits or losses are eliminated.\n\n## 2. TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF COMPANIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS NOT THE EURO\n\nThe functional currency of an entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it carries out its operations. In the majority of cases, the functional currency corresponds to the local currency.  However,  a  functional  currency  other  than  the  local currency  can  be  retained  for  certain  entities,  provided  that  it represents the currency of the main transactions carried out by the entity  and  that  it  ensures  faithful  representation  of  its  economic environment.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the Financial Statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 balance sheet items, at the official year-end exchange rates;\n- \u25a0 income  statement  and  cash  flow  statement  items,  using  the average exchange rate over the period for each currency.\n\nExchange  differences  are  recognized  under  a  separate  item 'Translation  reserves'  in  gains  and  losses  recognized  directly  in equity.\n\nCumulative foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  as  of  January  1, 2004  arising  from  the  translation  into  euros  of  the  Financial Statements  of  subsidiaries  whose  functional  currency  is  not  the euro have been maintained as a separate component of equity.\n\nOn  removal  from  the  scope  of  consolidation,  the  cumulative exchange differences of a company whose functional currency is not the euro are recognized in the income statement.\n\nSince  July  1,  2018,  Argentina  appears  among  hyperinflationary countries.  The  impacts  of  hyperinflation  of  this  country  for  2020 financial year are not significant for the Group.\n\n## 3. REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe  analysis  of  revenue  recognition  is  based  on  the  Group's activities, as follow:\n\n## a. Gas & Services\n\nThe  supply  of  gas  involves  local  production  in  order  to  limit transport  costs.  Therefore,  Air  Liquide  gas  production  units  are located  throughout  the  world  and  can  supply  several  types  of customers and industries, with the relevant volumes and services required:",

        "page_content": "## Large Industry\n\nThis business is characterized by the supply of large quantities of gas  contracted  for  a  period  of  15  years  or  longer  with  a  limited number  of  customers.  The  Group  guarantees  a  high  level  of reliability  and  availability  of  gas  supply  with  continued  service, over the long-term. In return, these contracts include guaranteed minimum  volumes  through  firm  purchase  clauses  (take-or-pay). Due to the volume of gas to be supplied, Air Liquide supplies its Large Industry customers directly by pipelines, from a dedicated plant or different plants connected by a network.\n\nThese plants represent significant investments that are generally made  in  a  way  to  share  the  production  assets  with  the  other business  lines  of  the  Group,  particularly  the  Industrial  Merchant business, or intended to serve the customers in an industrial basin that is connected on a pipeline network. In these cases, the assets are not identified under the meaning of IFRS 16 'Leases' and no lease contract is contained in the contracts with customers. When the  customer's  gas  supply  comes  from  a  dedicated  plant,  the Group may decide on the use of these plants under the meaning of  IFRS 16 'Leases'. Consequently, the gas supply contracts for the Large Industry business do not contain leases.\n\nCustomers of the Large Industry business simultaneously receive and consume the benefits granted by the gas supply service or its availability. As  a  result,  the  revenue  recognition  related  to  these contracts occurs when the gas is supplied or when the reserved capacity is made available.\n\n## Industrial Merchant, Healthcare and Electronics\n\nThe  Industrial  Merchant  business  relies  mainly  on  the  gas production capacity of Large Industry and thereafter develops its own distribution logistics. This business is characterized by a wide range of customers and markets. The contract terms can be up to five years for cylinders and liquid gas supply and up to 15 years for small on-site gas generators.\n\nHealthcare  business  supplies  medical  gases,  hygiene  products, services  as  well  as  medical  devices  to  hospitals  and  patients  in their homes. It also produces and distributes healthcare specialty ingredients  for  the  cosmetics,  pharmaceutical  and  vaccine markets.\n\nThe  Electronics  business  supplies  its  customers  with  (i)  carrier gases with a business model based on long-term contracts and on guaranteed  minimum  volumes  with  take-or-pay  type  clauses, (ii) electronics  specialty  materials  in  the  form  of  pure  or  mixed gases,  (iii)  advanced  materials,  (iv)  equipment  and  installations and  (v)  services  notably  on-site  quality  control  and  fluid management services.\n\nFor  safety  and  quality  reasons, Air  Liquide  supplies  gas  with  its own  equipment  (small  generators,  storage  tank,  cylinders). Customers have no right of control on the identified assets under the meaning of IFRS 16 'Leases'. Consequently, the gas supply contracts  for  these  businesses  do  not  contain  leases  and  the revenue recognition occurs as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 gas  supply:  the  revenue  recognition  occurs  when  the  gas  is supplied or when the reserved capacity is made available;\n- \u25a0 sale  of  standard  equipment  and  materials:  the  revenue recognition  occurs  when  the  control  of  these  equipment  and materials  is  transferred,  which  generally  takes  place  at  their delivery;\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- \u25a0 specific  equipment  and  installations:  the  transfer  of  control occurs  over  the  time,  together  with  their  construction. Consequently,  the  revenue  recognition  occurs  based  on  the stage of completion of the contracts at the balance sheet date;\n- \u25a0 service:  the  revenue  recognition  occurs  when  the  service  is provided.\n\n## b. Engineering & Construction\n\nAir  Liquide  enters  into  contracts  to  design  and  build  production units  worldwide  for  the  Group's  own  account  and  for  third-party customers.\n\nThe control  of  installations  is  transferred  progressively  with  their design/construction.  Consequently,  the  revenue  recognition  is based on the stage of completion of the contracts at the balance sheet date. The costs associated are recognized as an expense in the period when incurred. The stage of completion is assessed by using the ratio of contract costs incurred at the balance sheet date versus total estimated contract costs.\n\nThe margin realized at the stage of completion is recognized only when it can be reliably measured. When it is probable that total contract  costs  will  exceed  total  contract  revenue,  the  expected loss  is  immediately  recognized  as  a  provision  for  onerous contracts.\n\n## c. Global Markets & Technologies\n\nThe  Global  Markets  &  Technologies  business  focuses  on  new markets  requiring  a  global  approach.  This  business  is  growing mainly within the following markets:\n\n- \u25a0 new markets relating to the energy transition, as well as space, aerospace, and extreme cryogenics markets. As a consequence  of  its  nature,  the  analysis  of  the  revenue recognition  on  this  market  is  done  on  a  case-by-case  basis depending on the nature of performance obligations;\n- \u25a0 gas  usages  by  the  actors  in  the  maritime  sector,  namely offshore  oil  and  gas  platforms,  offshore  wind  turbines,  or cryogenic  transportation  by  sea.  The  analysis  carried  out  for Industrial Merchant is applicable to this market.\n\n## 4. TAXES\n\n## a. Income tax expense\n\nThe  tax  rate  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  fiscal  regulations enacted or substantively enacted at the fiscal year closing date in each of the countries where the Group's companies carry out their business.\n\nThe Group's applicable tax rate corresponds to the average of the theoretical  tax  rates  in  force  in  each  of  the  countries,  weighted according to profit obtained in each of these countries.\n\nThe  average  effective  tax  rate  is  calculated  as  follows:  (current and deferred income tax expense)/(net profit before tax less share of  profit  of  associates,  dividends  received  and  net  profit  from discontinued operations).\n\n## b. Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred  taxes  are  recognized  for  all  temporary  differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base (excluding non-deductible goodwill and the other exceptions provided in IAS 12), the tax loss carryforwards and the unused tax credits.  Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognized  on  all  deductible temporary differences provided that it is  highly  probable  that  the tax benefits will be realized in future years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The liability method is applied and  any  changes  to  the  tax  rates  are  recognized  in  the  income statement,  except  those  related  to  items  directly  recognized  in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the entities have a legally enforceable right to offset and if they relate to income tax levied  by  the  same  taxation  authority.  Deferred  taxes  are  not discounted.\n\nDeferred taxes are mainly due to temporary differences between the tax and economic depreciation of assets, the carryforward of tax  losses  and  provisions  not  immediately  deductible  for  tax purposes, such as employee benefit provisions.\n\nWhen the Group decides not to distribute profits retained by the subsidiary within the foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability is recognized.\n\n## 5. NON-CURRENT ASSETS\n\n## a. Goodwill and business combinations\n\n## Business combinations as of January 1, 2010\n\nThe Group has prospectively applied IFRS 3 revised and IAS 27 revised since January 1, 2010.\n\nWhen  the  Group  obtains  control  of  an  acquiree,  the  business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method on the acquisition date, in accordance with IFRS 3 revised:\n\n- \u25a0 the  identifiable assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured at fair value;\n- \u25a0 any  minority  interests  in  an  acquiree  are  measured  as  the minority  interest's  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree's  net identifiable assets or at fair value. This option is applied on a case-by-case basis;\n- \u25a0 the consideration transferred and any contingent consideration are measured at fair value;\n- \u25a0 acquisition-related  costs  are  recorded  as  expenses  in  the periods in which they are incurred.\n\nFor  a  business  combination  achieved  in  stages,  any  previously held  equity  interests  in  the  acquiree  are  measured  at  the acquisition-date  fair  value.  Any  resulting  gains  or  losses  are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe  measurement  period  of  a  business  combination  shall  not exceed  12  months  as  of  the  acquisition  date.  Any  adjustments, after the measurement period, of the consideration transferred and the  fair  values  of  acquired  assets  and  assumed  liabilities  are recorded in the income statement.\n\nOn the acquisition date, goodwill is recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as the difference between:\n\n- \u25a0 the  consideration  transferred  plus  the  amount  of  minority interests  in  the  acquiree  and  the  fair  value  of  the  previously held equity interest; and,\n- \u25a0 the  fair  value  of  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.\n\nNegative goodwill is recognized immediately through profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of cash-generating  units  that  benefit  from  business  combination synergies. Subsequently, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are any indications of  impairment,  in  accordance  with  the  method  described  in section 5.f.\n\n## Business combinations prior to January 1, 2010\n\nBusiness  combinations  achieved  prior  to  January  1,  2010  have been  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  the  former  versions  of IFRS  3  and  IAS  27.  These  standards  had  already  adopted  the acquisition method in the version published by the IASB in March 2004. The main provisions that differed from the revised standards are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 minority interests were measured based on their share of the net  identifiable  assets  of  the  acquiree  and  the  fair  value measurement option did not exist;\n- \u25a0 earn-outs  were  included  in  the  acquisition  cost,  without  time limits,  when  the  payment  was  deemed  probable  and  the amount could be reliably measured;\n- \u25a0 acquisition-related  costs  were  recorded  in  the  cost  of  the business combination.\n\nFor an acquisition achieved in stages, the fair value remeasurement of any previously held net asset was recognized in equity.\n\nFor  an  acquisition  of  minority  interests  in  a  previously  held company, the difference between the acquisition cost and the net carrying amount of the minority interests was recorded in goodwill.\n\nAt  the  time  of  the  transition  to  IFRS  and  in  accordance  with  the exemption  offered  by  IFRS  1,  the  Group  decided  not  to  apply IFRS  3  'Business  combinations'  retrospectively  for  acquisitions that took place prior to January 1, 2004.\n\n## b. Research and Development expenditures\n\nResearch and Development expenditures include all costs related to the scientific and technical activities, patent work, education and training  necessary  to  ensure  the  development,  manufacturing, start-up,  and  commercialization  of  new  or  improved  products  or processes.\n\nAccording to IAS 38, development costs shall be capitalized if, and only if, the Group can meet all of the following criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 the  project  is  clearly  identified  and  the  related  costs  are itemized and reliably monitored;\n- \u25a0 the technical and industrial feasibility of completing the project is demonstrated;\n- \u25a0 there is a clear intention to complete the project and to use or sell the intangible asset arising from it;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  has  the  ability  to  use  or  sell  the  intangible  asset arising from the project;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  can  demonstrate  how  the  intangible  asset  will generate probable future economic benefits;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  has  adequate  technical,  financial  and  other resources  to  complete  the  project  and  to  use  or  sell  the intangible asset.\n\nWhen  these  conditions  are  not  satisfied,  development  costs generated  by  the  Group  are  recognized  as  an  expense  when incurred.\n\nResearch  expenditure  is  recognized  as  an  expense  when incurred.",

        "page_content": "## c. Internally generated intangible assets\n\nInternally generated  intangible  assets  primarily  include  the development  costs  of  information  management  systems.  These costs are capitalized only if they satisfy the criteria as defined by IAS 38 and described above.\n\nInternal and  external development  costs  on  management information  systems  arising  from  the  development  phase  are capitalized.  Significant  maintenance  and  improvement  costs  are added  to  the  initial  cost  of  assets  if  they  specifically  meet  the capitalization criteria.\n\nInternally  generated  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  their useful lives.\n\n## d. Other intangible assets\n\nOther  intangible  assets  include  separately  acquired  intangible assets such as software, licenses, and intellectual property rights. They also include the technology, brands and customer contracts valued  upon  the  acquisition  of  companies  in  accordance  with IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  certain  brands,  intangible  assets  are amortized  using  the  straight-line  method  over  their  useful  lives. Information management systems are generally amortized over a period  comprised  between  five  and  eight  years  and  customer contracts  over  a  maximum  period  of  25  years,  considering  the probabilities of renewal.\n\n## e. Property, plant and equipment\n\nLand, buildings and equipment are carried at their acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nIn the event of mandatory dismantling or asset removals, related costs  are  added  to  the  initial  cost  of  the  relevant  assets  and provisions are recognized to cover these costs.\n\nInterest  costs  on  borrowings  to  finance  the  construction  of property, plant, and equipment are capitalized during the period of construction when they relate to the financing of industrial projects over a twelve-month construction period, or longer.\n\nWhere  parts  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  have different useful lives, they are accounted  separately  and depreciated over their own useful lives.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs are recognized as expenses when incurred.  The  costs  of  major  inspections  and  overhauls  are recognized  as  a  separate  component  of  the  asset  and  are depreciated over the period between two major overhauls.\n\nDepreciation  is  calculated  according  to  the  straight-line  method over the estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 buildings: 20 to 30 years;\n- \u25a0 cylinders: 10 to 40 years;\n- \u25a0 production units: 15 to 20 years;\n- \u25a0 pipelines: 15 to 35 years;\n- \u25a0 other equipment: 5 to 30 years.\n\nThe estimated useful lives are reviewed regularly and changes in the estimates are recorded prospectively from the date of change.\n\nLand is not depreciated.\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## f. Impairment of assets\n\nThe Group regularly assesses whether there are any indications of asset impairment. If such indications exist, an impairment test is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is greater than its recoverable amount, defined as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell (net fair value) and the value in use.\n\nImpairment  tests  are  performed  systematically  once  a  year  for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.\n\nAssets  that  do  not  generate  largely  independent  cash  flows  are grouped according to the cash-generating units (CGUs) to which they  belong.  A  cash-generating  unit  is  an  identifiable  group  of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the  cash  inflows  of  other  assets  or  groups  of  assets.  They  are mainly  determined  on  a  geographical  basis  and  by  reference  to the markets in which the Group operates.\n\nIn practice, the Group performs impairment tests at various levels pursuant to these principles:\n\n- \u25a0 dedicated and on-site plants are tested individually;\n- \u25a0 pipelines and plants that provide these pipelines are tested at the network level;\n- \u25a0 liquid  gas  and  hydrogen/CO  plants  are  grouped  together according to the plants' customer market;\n- \u25a0 other assets are allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units.\n\nThe  cash-generating  units  of  the  Gas  &  Services  activity  are determined  on  a  geographical  basis.  The  other  activities  are managed  at  a  worldwide  level  (Engineering  &  Construction  and Global Markets & Technologies).\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cashgenerating units that benefit from business combination synergies and which represent the levels at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.\n\nWhen  performing  impairment  tests  on  cash-generating  units  or groups  of  cash-generating  units  comprising  goodwill,  the  Group uses the market multiples approach to determine if the goodwill is subject to impairment. Insofar as the fair value is not significantly greater than the net carrying amount of the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units, the Group  confirms the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit or group of cashgenerating  units  using  the  estimated  cash  flow  approach  (value in use).\n\nFor  other  cash-generating  units  or  groups  of  cash-generating units, and assets whose value is tested on an individual basis, the Group  determines  the  recoverable  amount  using  the  estimated cash flow approach (value in use).\n\nThe market multiples used are determined based on the market value  of  the  Air  Liquide  Group.  The  differences  between  the resulting  multiples  and  those  of  comparable  companies  are  not material.\n\nThe growth rates, taken into account with respect to the cash flow estimates for cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units,  are  determined  based  on  the  activity  and  geographical location of the CGU considered.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cash  flows  are  measured  over  the  asset's  estimated  period  of use,  taking  into  account  customer  contract  terms  and  technical obsolescence.\n\nThe discount rate depends on the nature, the location of the asset and  the  customer  market.  It  is  determined  according  to  the minimum  level  of  profitability  expected  from  the  investment considering industrial and commercial risks and credit terms.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of an asset, a cash-generating unit or  a  group  of  cash-generating  units  is  lower  than  its  carrying amount,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized  immediately  through profit and loss. An impairment loss of a cash-generating unit is first allocated to goodwill.\n\nWhen  the  recoverable  amount  exceeds  the  carrying  amount again,  the  previously  recognized  impairment  loss  is  reversed  to the income statement, with the exception of impairment losses on goodwill, which cannot be reversed.\n\n## g. Leases\n\nIn  the  course  of  its  activity,  the  Group  enters  as  a  lessee  in contracts mainly for the following types of assets:\n\n- \u25a0 land, buildings and offices;\n- \u25a0 transportation  equipment,  in  particular  for  Industrial  Merchant and Healthcare business lines;\n- \u25a0 other equipment.\n\nAccording  to  IFRS  16,  any  contract  (apart  from  exceptions mentioned below) containing a lease leads to recognition on the lessee's balance sheet of a right-of-use of the leased asset and a lease liability related to the present value of the commitments for future lease payments (lease liability).\n\nA contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys to the Group the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. In particular, the Group has concluded that  transportation  contracts  which  confer  to  the  supplier  the substantive right to substitute the vehicle throughout the period of use and/or the control on the choice of the route, the driver and maintenance  policy,  are  service  contracts  and  do  not  meet  the definition of a lease under IFRS 16.\n\nIn addition, the Group has chosen not to apply IFRS 16:\n\n- \u25a0 to the lease  contracts  having  a  lease  terms  of  12  months  or less;\n- \u25a0 to the lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value, in particular, office and telephony equipment, computers and small IT equipment. Lease contracts for data centers are analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe main assumptions used to measure the right-of-use and the lease liability are:\n\n- \u25a0 lease  term.  It  corresponds  to  the  non-cancellable  period  for which  a  lessee  has  the  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset, together  with  periods  covered  by  an  option  to  extend  or  to terminate  the  lease  if  the  Group  is  reasonably  certain  to exercise (for options to extend) or not to exercise (for options to terminate) such options. The probability to exercise or not an option is determined by type of contracts or on a case-by-case basis  according  to  contractual  terms,  regulatory  environment and  the  nature  of  the  underlying  asset  (in  particular,  its technical specificity and strategic location);\n\n- \u25a0 the discount rate used for evaluation of the lease liability. The discount  rate  retained  is  the  lessee's  incremental  borrowing rate.  Due  to  the  centralized  financing  in  the  Group,  it corresponds  for  each  subsidiary  to  the  interest  rate  for intragroup borrowings determined according to the currency of the lease contract, the country and the lease term taking into account the repayment profile (linear amortization of the lease liability).\n\nDeferred taxes relating to the right of use asset and lease liability arising from a single transaction are recognized on a net basis.\n\n## 6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## a. Non-current financial instruments\n\n## Non-consolidated investments\n\nInvestments in non-consolidated companies that are not accounted  for  using  the  equity  method  are  classified  as  assets measured at fair value. These investments are not held for trading, consequently,  at  initial  recognition,  the  Group  may  make  an irrevocable  election  to  present  in  other  comprehensive  income subsequent changes in the fair value. In this case, changes in fair value  are  not  reclassified  to  net  result  upon  disposal  of  these investments.\n\nDividends from these investments are recognized in other financial income.\n\n## Loans and other financial assets\n\nLoans  and  other  financial  assets  are  initially  recognized  at  their fair value and subsequently carried at amortized cost. Impairment tests are performed at each closing date. Any impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\n## b. Trade and other-receivables\n\nTrade  and  other  receivables  are  measured  at  their  transaction price upon initial recognition and then at amortized cost less any impairment losses based on expected credit losses model.\n\nExpected  credit  losses  are  estimated  on  the  basis  of  a  matrix consisting  in  using  historical  loss  rates  adjusted  depending  on actual observable conditions. Expected credit losses are estimated at each closing date in the following manner:\n\n- \u25a0 segregating  trade  receivables  into  appropriate  groups,  in particular  depending  on  the  activities  of  the  Group,  type  and size of client and its market segment;\n- \u25a0 within  each  group  of  trade  receivables,  determining  of  agebands;\n- \u25a0 for each age-band identification of losses realized in previous financial year;\n- \u25a0 adjusting if necessary historical loss rate depending on actual observable  conditions  in  order  to  take  into  account,  in particular,  current  market  conditions,  type  of  client,  credit management  practices  of  the  Group  as  well  as  specific information concerning individual customers;\n- \u25a0 application  of  loss  rates  estimated  in  this  way  to  each  ageband of trade receivables.\n\nFor  all  construction  contracts  in  progress  at  the  year-end,  the gross amounts payable by and to customers represent the sum of costs  incurred  plus  profits  recognized  using  the  percentage  of completion method, equivalent to total revenue recorded using the percentage  of  completion  method,  less  the  amount  of  advances received.",

Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash balances, current bank accounts, and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible  into  cash  and  do  not  present  a  material  risk  of  a change in value.\n\nShort-term  investments  include  temporary  cash  investments maturing in less than three months (commercial paper, certificates of  deposit  and  money  market  funds)  whose  minimum  long-term rating is A (S&P) or A2 (Moody's).\n\nAs  cash  investments  maturing  in  less  than  three  months  are exposed  to  a  negligible  risk  of  a  change  in  value,  they  are recognized at historical cost (including accrued interest) which is considered to approximate fair value.\n\n## d. Trade payables\n\nThe  Group  sets  up  supplier  paying  services  agreements  with partner  banks  to  facilitate  the  processing  of  supplier  invoices payments.  The  Group  analyzes  the  main  contract  features  that enable to keep the trade payables qualification. In particular, the Group ensures that the following characteristics are met:\n\n- \u25a0 no deviation  of  the  payment  terms  of  the  underlying  payable between the financing party and the original supplier. In other words,  the  Group  must  pay  to  the  bank  no  later  than  the payment term of invoice;\n- \u25a0 payment terms negotiations between Air Liquide and supplier must be conducted independently of any negotiation on paying service  agreement.  In  particular,  payment  terms  shall  not  be subject to the supplier's success in selling invoices to the bank;\n- \u25a0 the  terms  of  contract  with  the  supplier  shall  not  be  explicitly linked  to  any  payment  term  extension.  Payment  term  with  a particular supplier must be homogenous, independently of the participation of a particular invoice in the program or not;\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- \u25a0 payment terms should stay within the ordinary industry/sector norms  and  local  regulation,  and  should  not  be  tied  to  the participation in the paying services agreement;\n- \u25a0 program  structures  should  avoid  debt-like  features  such  as interest and fees paid by Air Liquide to the bank or supplier;\n- \u25a0 tri-party agreements between Air Liquide, the supplier and the bank  that  pre-arrange  the  financing  of  the  invoices  owed  by Air Liquide to the supplier shall be avoided.\n\n## e. Current and non-current borrowings\n\nBorrowings  include  bonds  and  other  bank  borrowings  (including the put options granted to minority shareholders).\n\nAt inception, borrowings are recognized at fair value corresponding  to  the  net  proceeds  collected.  At  each  balance sheet date, except for put options granted to minority shareholders (see  section  10  'Minority  Interests'),  they  are  measured  at amortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest  rate  (EIR)  method. Under  this  method,  the  borrowing  cost  includes  the  redemption premiums and issuance costs initially deducted from the nominal amount of the borrowing in liabilities.\n\nBorrowings  maturing  in  less  than  one  year  are  classified  as current borrowings.\n\nBorrowings  hedged  by  interest  rate  swaps  are  recognized  on  a hedge accounting basis.\n\n## f. Derivative assets and liabilities\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks relating to the Group's financial and operating activities. For all these transactions, the Group applies hedge accounting and documents, at the inception of the transaction, the type of hedging relationship, the hedging instruments, and the nature and term of the hedged item.\n\nApplying hedge accounting has the following consequences:\n\n- \u25a0 fair value hedges for existing assets and liabilities: the hedged portion of the item is carried at fair value in the balance sheet. Any  changes  in  fair  value  are  recognized  in  the  income statement, where they are offset by the corresponding changes in fair value of the hedging instruments (except for the impact of premiums/discounts);\n- \u25a0 future cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the change in fair  value  of  the  hedging  instrument  is  recorded  directly  in equity (items that may be subsequently reclassified to income statement),  while  the  change  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged item is not recognized in the balance sheet. The change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized in other financial income or expenses. When the hedged transactions occur and are  recorded,  amounts  recorded  in  other  comprehensive income are reclassified in the income statement;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  ineffective  portion changes in fair value is recognized in 'Other financial incom and  expenses'.  Once  the  foreign  entity  subject  to  the  n investment hedge is sold, the loss or profit initially recognize in translation reserves is recognized in profit or loss, within th e nt y of e et d e gain or loss generated.\n\nHowever, in limited circumstances, certain types of derivatives do not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting;  they  are  carried  at  fair  value through 'Other financial income and expenses' with an offsetting entry in financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of assets, liabilities and derivatives is based on the market price at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 7. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\n## a. Assets classified as held for sale\n\nNon-current  assets  or  disposal  groups  are  classified  as  held  for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than  through  continuing  use.  This classification  occurs  when  the  Group  takes  the  decision  to  sell them and that the sale is considered highly probable.\n\nThe assets and liabilities held for sale are presented on different lines of the balance sheet. They are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated (amortized) as of the date they are classified as assets or disposal groups held for sale.\n\nWhen  a  sale  involving  the  loss  of  control  of  the  subsidiary  is considered  highly  probable,  all  the  assets  and  liabilities  of  this subsidiary are classified as being held for sale, independently of whether or not the Group retains a residual interest in the entity after its sale.\n\n## b. Discontinued operations\n\nA  discontinued  operation  is  a  clearly  identifiable  component  that the  Group  either  has  abandoned  or  that  is  classified  as  held  for sale:\n\n- \u25a0 representing a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;\n- \u25a0 being part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or,\n- \u25a0 being a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nOnce the criteria  are  met,  the  profit  and  loss  and  the  cash  flow from  discontinued  operations  are  presented  separately  in  the income  statement  and  the  consolidated  cash  flow  statement  for each period.\n\n## 8. INVENTORIES AND WORK-IN-PROGRESS\n\nInventories  are  measured  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net  realizable value. Cost includes raw materials, direct and indirect labor costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\nNet  realizable  value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  in  the  normal course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## 9. SHARE CAPITAL, RESERVES AND TREASURY SHARES\n\nAir Liquide's share capital is composed of ordinary shares.\n\nRetained earnings include the following items:\n\n- \u25a0 translation  reserves:  exchange  differences  arising  from  the translation  into  euros  of  Financial  Statements  prepared  by foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro are recorded in translation reserves. Fair value changes in net investment  hedges  of  these  foreign  subsidiaries  are  also recorded in this reserve;\n- \u25a0 fair value of financial instruments: this item records accumulated fair value changes in the effective portion of cash flow hedge derivatives (transactions not yet recognized in the accounts);\n- \u25a0 actuarial gains and losses: all actuarial gains and losses and adjustments  arising  from  the  asset  ceiling,  net  of  deferred taxes, are recognized in consolidated reserves in the period in which they occur.\n\nWhen the Group buys back its own shares, they are classified as treasury  shares  at  the  purchase  price  and  presented  as  a deduction from equity for the consideration paid. The profit or loss from  the  sale  of  treasury  shares  is  recognized  directly  in  equity, net of tax.\n\nFurthermore,  acquisitions  or  disposals  of  minority  interests, without change in control, are considered as transactions with the Group's shareholders. Thus, the difference between the price paid to  increase the percentage of interest in entities that are already controlled  and  the  additional  share  of  equity  thus  acquired  is recognized  in  Shareholders'  equity.  Similarly,  a  decrease  in  the Group's percentage interest in a controlled entity is accounted for as an equity transaction with no impact on profit or loss.\n\nDisposals of shares with loss of control give rise to the recognition in disposal gains or losses of the change in fair value calculated for  the  total  investment  at  the  date  of  disposal. Any  investments retained,  where  applicable,  will  be  measured  at  fair  value  at  the date when control is lost.\n\n## 10. MINORITY INTERESTS\n\nTransactions with minority interests, without impact on the control, are considered as transactions with the Group's shareholders and are registered in shareholders' equity.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS  32,  put  options  granted  to  minority shareholders are recorded as borrowings at the option's estimated strike price.\n\nThe  share  in  the  net  assets  of  subsidiaries  is  reclassified  from 'Minority interests' to 'Borrowings'.\n\nDue to the absence of any specific IFRS guidance, the Group has elected to recognize the consideration for the difference between the strike price of the option granted and the value of the minority interests  reclassified  as  borrowings  in  shareholders'  equity  Group share.\n\nMinority interests in profit and loss do not change and still reflect present ownership interests.",

        "page_content": "## 11. PROVISIONS\n\n## a. Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event;\n- \u25a0 it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation;\n- \u25a0 a  reliable  estimate  can  be  made  of  the  amount  of  the obligation.\n\nRestructuring provisions include only the direct costs arising from the  restructuring  and  are  recognized  in  the  period  in  which  the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the  restructuring  has  either  begun  or  been  announced.  When these  plans  involve  termination  benefits,  the  resulting  provisions are recognized at the earlier of the following dates:\n\n- \u25a0 when  the  Group  can  no  longer  withdraw  the  offer  of  those benefits;\n- \u25a0 when the provision of the related restructuring is recognized.\n\nA  provision  for  losses  on  contracts  is  recognized  when  the expected  benefits  from  the  contract  are  lower  than  the  cost  of satisfying the obligations under the contract.\n\n## b. Pensions and employee benefits\n\nThe  Group  provides  its  employees  with  various  pension  plans, termination benefits, jubilees and other post-employment benefits for both active and retired employees. The characteristics of each plan vary according to the laws and regulations applicable in each country as well as each subsidiary policy.\n\nThese benefits are covered by two types of plan:\n\n- \u25a0 defined contribution plans;\n- \u25a0 defined benefit plans.\n\nThe  Group  grants  both  defined  benefit  and  defined  contribution plans.\n\nDefined contribution plans are plans under which the employer's sole  obligation  is  to  pay  regular  contributions.  The  employer's obligation is limited to payment of the planned contributions. The employer  does  not  grant  any  guarantees  on  the  future  level  of benefits paid to the employee or retiree (means-based obligation). The  annual  pension  expense  is  equal  to  the  contribution  paid during the fiscal year which relieves the employer from any further obligation. It is recognized in 'Personnel expenses'.\n\nDefined benefit plans are those by which the employer guarantees the  future  level  of  benefits  defined  in  the  agreement,  most  often depending on the employee's salary and seniority ('result-based obligation'). Defined benefit plans can be:\n\n- \u25a0 either  financed  by  contributions  to  a  fund  specialized  in managing the amounts received;\n- \u25a0 or managed internally.\n\nIn  the  case  of  defined  benefit  plans,  retirement  and  similar obligations are measured by independent actuaries, according to the projected unit credit method. The actuarial calculations mainly take  into  account  the  following  assumptions:  salary  increases, employee turnover, retirement date, life expectancy, inflation and appropriate discount rates for each country.\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDefined  benefit  plans  are  covered  by  external  pension  funds  in certain  cases.  The  assets  of  these  plans  are  mostly  invested  in bonds or equities carried at their fair value.\n\nAll  actuarial  gains  and  losses  as  well  as  any  adjustment  arising from the asset ceiling are recognized in the period in which they occur.\n\nActuarial  assumptions  used  vary  according  to  the  demographic and  economic  conditions  prevailing  in  each  country  where  the Group has pension plans.\n\nDiscount  rates  used  to  measure  the  present  value  of  the Company's obligations and the net interest cost are determined by reference  to  market  yields  on  High-Quality  corporate  bonds. Where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market yields on government bonds with the same maturity at the valuation date shall  be  used.  In  the  Euro  zone,  the  United  States,  the  United Kingdom and Canada, discount rates were determined using tools designed by independent actuaries. Their database uses several hundred different corporate bonds with a minimum AA-rating and maturities ranging from one to 30 years. Cash flows of expected benefits  are  subsequently  discounted  using  rates  associated  to each maturity.\n\nValuations  are  carried  out  annually  by  independent  actuaries  for significant plans and every three years for other plans unless there are  material  changes  in  assumptions  or  major  events  that necessitate a new calculation. Impacts related to defined benefit plans are registered as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the  service  cost,  the  gain  relating  to  curtailments  and settlements,  and  the  actuarial  gains  and  losses  from  other long-term benefits and recognized in 'Personnel expenses'. In addition,  the  service  cost  of  defined  benefit  plans  which  are capped, linked to length of service and require the presence of the  beneficiary  in  the  company  at  the  time  of  retirement  is spread over the period between the date on which the services rendered began to generate rights and the date on which the additional services cease to generate rights;\n- \u25a0 net  interest  cost  for  defined  benefits  is  registered  in  'Other financial income and expenses';\n- \u25a0 past service cost is recorded in profit or loss according to the nature of the change to the plan that generated it (i.e. either in 'Personnel  expenses'  or  in  'Other  financial  income  and expenses');\n- \u25a0 actuarial  gains  and  losses  from  defined  benefit  plans, retirement  termination  payments,  and  medical  plans  are recorded in 'Gains and losses recognized directly in equity'.\n\n## 12. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES\n\nForeign  currency  transactions  are  recognized  according  to  the following principles:\n\n- \u25a0 foreign currency transactions are translated by each company into its  functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction;\n- \u25a0 at  year-end,  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the closing exchange rate.\n\nExchange  differences  relating  to  commercial  transactions  are recognized in operating profit. For financial transactions, exchange differences  are  recognized  in  financial  income  and  expenses except for differences resulting from the hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity that are directly recognized in equity until the net investment is removed from the consolidation scope.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nContingent  assets  and  liabilities  arise  from  past  events,  the outcome of which depends on future uncertain events.\n\nContingent liabilities represent:\n\n- \u25a0 possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will  be  confirmed  only  by  the  occurrence  of  uncertain  future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or,\n- \u25a0 present obligations that arise from past events, but that are not recognized  because  it  is  not  probable  that  an  outflow  of resources  embodying  economic  benefits  will  be  required  to settle  the  obligation  or  because  the  amount  of  the  obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\nContingent assets and liabilities that are material are disclosed in the  notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  except  for contingent  liabilities  assumed  in  a  business  combination,  which are recognized in accordance with IFRS 3 revised.\n\n## 14. GOVERNMENT GRANTS\n\nGovernment grants received are initially recognized in 'Other noncurrent  liabilities'.  They  are  then  recognized  as  income  in  the income statement for the period:\n\n- \u25a0 on the same basis as the subsidized assets are depreciated in the case of government grants related to assets;\n- \u25a0 deducted  from  the  costs  intended  to  be  compensated  in  the case of government grants other than those related to assets.\n\nThe  Group  analyzes  the  substance  of  government  incentives delivered  through  the  tax  system  and  selects  an  accounting treatment coherent with such substance.\n\n## 15. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n\nThe  Group  grants  stock  options  and  performance  shares  to Executive Officers and some employees.\n\nStock options and performance shares are measured at fair value on the grant date. Their fair value is recognized as a 'Personnel expense' in the income statement with a corresponding increase in  equity,  and  amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\n\nThe  valuation  is  performed  by  an  independent  expert,  using mathematical  models  appropriate  to  the  characteristics  of  each plan. It takes  into  account  the  market  vesting  conditions associated to each one. The fair value measured at the grant date is not  subject  to  re-evaluation  due  to  changes  in  market conditions.\n\nVesting conditions, other than market ones, have no impact on the fair  value  measurement  of  services  received  but  adjust  the expense  that  is  recognized  according  to  the  number  of  equity instruments actually granted.\n\nThe  dilution  effect  of  non-vested  stock  option  plans  and performance  share  allocations  is  reflected  in  the  calculation  of diluted earnings per share.\n\nFor  employee  savings  plans,  the  capital  increases  reserved for  employees  and  performed  under  conditions  that  differ  from market  conditions  result  in  the  recognition  of  an  expense.  This expense corresponds to the contribution paid by the entity and the discount on the share price less the cost of non-transferability for the employees.\n\n## Share subscription option plans\n\nOptions are valued using the following main underlying assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 volatility: implicit;\n- \u25a0 risk-free interest rate: zero-coupon benchmark rate at the plan issue date and matching the various maturities retained;\n- \u25a0 dividend growth rate:  based  on  the  historical  average  annual growth rate;\n- \u25a0 employee resignation rate: that of individuals belonging to the same age group as the plan beneficiaries. The resignation rate is used to extrapolate the number of options which will not be exercised due to the resignation of beneficiaries;\n- \u25a0 the probability of achieving the market vesting conditions.\n\n## Performance shares allocation plans\n\nPerformance  shares  are  measured  at  fair  value,  taking  into account a discount on non-transferable shares. The cost of nontransferability  is  measured  as  the  cost  of  a  two-step  strategy consisting in the forward sale of shares being non-transferable for four years (or five years depending on the plan) and the purchase on the spot market of the same number of shares funded by an amortizable loan with an in fine capital repayment.\n\nValuation is based upon the following main underlying assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 risk-free  interest  rate:  four-year  zero-coupon  benchmark  rate (or five-year depending on the plan) at the plan issue date plus a credit margin that would be proposed to employees;\n- \u25a0 dividend growth rate:  based  on  the  historical  average  annual growth rate;\n- \u25a0 employee resignation rate: that of individuals belonging to the same age group as the plan beneficiaries. This resignation rate is  used  to  extrapolate  the  shares  which  will  not  be  allocated due to the resignation of beneficiaries;\n- \u25a0 the probability of achieving the market vesting conditions.\n\n## 16. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION QUOTAS\n\nIn  certain  countries,  the  Group  is  subject  to  greenhouse  gas emission quota systems.\n\nIn  the  absence  of  any  specific  IFRS  guidance,  the  Group  has elected  to  apply  the  ANC  Regulation  No.  2012-03.  The  Group does  not  buy  CO2  quotas  for  the  purpose  of  generating  profits from fluctuations in price; therefore, at each closing date:\n\n- \u25a0 a liability  is  recognized  if  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are higher than the CO2 quotas held by the Group. It corresponds to the cost of CO2 quotas in shortfall to cover the greenhouse gas already emitted; or,\n- \u25a0 an  asset  is  recognized  if  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  are lower than the CO2 quotas held by the entity. It corresponds to the CO2 quotas available to cover the future greenhouse gas emissions, valued at historical cost.",

SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nThe Group is structured according to the following activities: Gas &  Services,  Engineering  &  Construction  and  Global  Markets  & Technologies.\n\nThe  Group's  main  operational  decision-making  body  is  the Executive Management assisted by the Executive Committee.\n\nThe  Gas  &  Services  activity  is  organized  by  geographical  area, which  is  the  responsible  level  for  operations  management  and performance monitoring. These geographical areas are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 Europe;\n- \u25a0 Americas;\n- \u25a0 Asia Pacific;\n- \u25a0 Middle East & Africa.\n\nWithin  the  Gas  &  Services  segment,  the  geographical  areas determine sales policies and development projects in liaison with the  four  business  lines  (Large  Industries,  Industrial  Merchant, Healthcare and Electronics).\n\nThe Engineering & Construction segment is managed separately on a worldwide scale. The segment designs, develops and builds industrial gas production plants for the Group and third parties. It also designs and manufactures plants in the traditional, renewable and alternative energy sectors.\n\nThe  Global  Markets  &  Technologies  segment  is  also  managed separately on a worldwide scale. It focuses on new markets which require  a  global  approach,  drawing  on  science,  technologies, development models, and usages related to digital transformation.\n\nResearch and Development and corporate activities do not meet the  operating  segments  definition  and  are  thus  presented  within reconciliation.\n\nThe  information  communicated  in  the  tables  covering  segment information  is  presented  according  to  the  same  accounting principles  as  those  used  for  the  Group  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nRevenue is analyzed by geographical area of production (country of origin).\n\nInter-segment  revenue  between  Gas  &  Services,  Engineering  & Construction  and  Global  Markets  &  Technologies  activities corresponds to the sales between these operating segments.\n\nThe  Group  operating  performance  is  assessed  on  the  basis  of each segment's recurring operating income.\n\nSegment assets include non-current assets, with the exception of 'Deferred tax assets', 'Investments in associates', 'Fair value of non-current derivatives (assets)', as well as 'Inventories and workin-progress', 'Trade receivables' and 'Other current assets'.\n\nSegment liabilities correspond to 'Provisions, pensions and other employee  benefits',  'Trade  payables',  'Other  current  liabilities' and 'Other non-current liabilities'.\n\nSegment profits, assets and liabilities consist of amounts directly attributable  to  each  segment,  provided  they  can  be  allocated  to the segment on a reasonable basis.\n\n## 2. NET DEBT\n\nThe net debt includes:\n\n- \u25a0 current and non-current borrowings, as defined in section 6.e of  accounting  policies,  minus  the  fair  value  of  hedging derivative assets to cover borrowings;\n\nreduced by:\n\n- \u25a0 cash  and  cash  equivalents,  as  defined  in  section  6.c  of accounting policies, minus the fair value of hedging derivative instruments recorded in liabilities to cover loans.\n\nThe net debt does not include the lease liabilities as defined in section 5.g of accounting policies.\n\n## 3. INFORMATION ON INTERESTS IN JOINT ARRANGEMENTS OR ASSOCIATES\n\nThe materiality of the interests in joint arrangements or associates is assessed according to the following criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 contribution  of  the  entity  to  the  Group's  operating  income recurring;\n- \u25a0 share of these interests in the Group's net assets;\n- \u25a0 dividends paid to these interests.\n\n## 4. INFORMATION ON MINORITY INTERESTS\n\nThe materiality of the minority interests is assessed according to an analysis of:\n\n- \u25a0 the minority interests' share in the Group's net assets;\n- \u25a0 the contribution  to  the  Group's  operating  income  recurring  of the subsidiary having minority interests;\n- \u25a0 dividends paid to minority interests.\n\n## 5.

The  key  model  assumptions used,  such  as  market  multiples  and  the  discount  rate,  took  into account the stock market and world economic context.\n\nThe market multiples used were determined using the Air Liquide Group market value as of December 31, 2021. Multiples obtained do not materially differ from those of companies whose activity is similar to that of the Group.\n\nThe  growth  rates  used  for  estimating  the  cash  flows  of  cashgenerating  units  or  groups  of  cash-generating  units  were significantly  lower  than  the  Group's  historical  average  growth rates. Growth rates are comprised between 1% and 3% in mature markets, and up to 5.5% in emerging markets.\n\nThe  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  used  was  4.1%  as  of December  31,  2021  (4.4%  as  of  December  31,  2020).  The weighted average cost of capital is adjusted for the activity and the geographical location of the cash-generating units being tested.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021  and  December  31,  2020,  the recoverable  amounts  of  each  cash-generating  unit  or  groups  of cash-generating  units  significantly  exceeded  their  net  carrying amounts.\n\nConsidering  the  activity  of  the Air  Liquide  Group,  no  reasonably possible change  in  key  assumptions  would  result  in  an impairment. The Gas & Services activity favors synergies between the  different  business  lines  by  pooling  assets  for  a  given geographical area. The geographical development of the activity is generally  based  on  local  industrial  investments  and  external growth operations throughout the Large Industries business line. The  supply  of  gas  to  clients  of  the  Large  Industries  business  is contracted  for  a  minimum  duration  of  15  years. These  customer contracts provide a good visibility and guarantee of future income.",

In  the  event  of retirement,  the  beneficiary  retains  his  rights,  being  no  longer required to satisfy the continued service requirement;\n- b) performance requirements for all performance shares allocated to  all  beneficiaries  which  are  now  identical  to  performance requirements applicable to stock-options;\n- c) a holding requirement for performance shares: as from the final grant date, the beneficiaries of the 'France' Plan are required to hold their shares for two additional years during which such shares may not be transferred (except in the event of disability or death).\n\nOptions granted to the ten employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (excluding corporate officers) who were attributed the highest number of options\n\nIn 2021, no options have been granted.\n\n## Options exercised in 2021 by the ten employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (excluding corporate officers) with the highest number of options exercised\n\n| Grant date         | Number of options  exercised   |   Average price (in euros) \u207d \u1d43 \u207e |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 10/14/2011         | 7,198                          |                            57.28 |\n| 10/14/2011 Belgium | 3,393                          |                            57.94 |\n| 9/27/2012          | 68,004                         |                            70.14 |\n| 9/26/2013          | 20,179                         |                            74.06 |\n| 9/22/2014          | 9,605                          |                            77.67 |\n| 9/28/2015          | 4,500                          |                            84.08 |\n| TOTAL              | 112,879                        |                            70.85 |\n\n- (a) Historical data.\n\nOptions exercised in 2020 by the ten employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (excluding corporate officers) with the highest number of options exercised\n\n| Grant date   | Number of options exercised   |   Average price (in euros) \u207d \u1d43 \u207e |\n|--------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 10/14/2011   | 38,822                        |                            57.28 |\n| 9/27/2012    | 37,111                        |                            70.14 |\n| 9/26/2013    | 25,802                        |                            74.06 |\n| 9/22/2014    | 24,804                        |                            77.67 |\n| 9/28/2015    | 3,194                         |                            84.08 |\n| TOTAL        | 129,733                       |                            68.85 |\n\n- (a) Historical data.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Provisions  are  determined  based  on  a  case-by-case  risk assessment  and  events  occurring  during  ongoing  proceedings may result in a risk reappraisal at any time. These litigations are by  nature  diverse  and  involve  various  Group  subsidiaries. Contingency  provisions  recorded  with  respect  to  all  Group litigations  amounted  to  228.5  million  euros  as  of  December  31,\n\n2021  (215.9  million  euros  as  of  December  31,  2020)  and  are presented  in  'Other  provisions'.  They  include  provisions  for industrial  disputes  and  for  tax  risks,  excluding  taxes  on  income, respectively for 111.1 and 117.4 million euros.\n\nThe  Group  does  not  provide  the  detail  of  these  provisions, considering that disclosing the amount provided for each individual litigation could be prejudicial to the Group. Nevertheless, no single litigation is likely to have a material effect on the Group's financial position or its profitability.",

PENSION PLANS\n\nThe most significant pension plans relate to France, Germany and the United States.\n\nIn  France,  Air  Liquide  provides  an  additional  retirement  benefit based on the final salary which is paid in addition to other normal pension  plans.  On  December  31,  1995,  this  plan  was  closed to employees under age 45 or with less than 20 years of service as  of  January  1,  1996;  the  latter  being  covered  by  a  defined contribution plan. These plans are unfunded. The annual amounts paid with regards to additional benefits cannot exceed a threshold set  originally  at  12%  of  total  payroll  or  12%  of  pre-tax  profits  of companies  involved.  This  12%  threshold  will  be  proportionately reduced  by  comparing  the  number  of  plan  beneficiaries  for  the year to the number of plan beneficiaries for the previous year. In 2017,  this  additional  benefit  was  funded  subsequently  to  the Article 50 of the law of January 20, 2014 securing the future and fairness of pensions plans.\n\nIAS 19 'Employee Benefits' provides a very restrictive definition of defined contribution plans; any plans not complying fully with the conditions required are defined benefit plans by default.\n\nThis  restrictive  definition  of  defined  contribution  plans  requires Air  Liquide  to  account  for  these  additional  benefits  as  a  defined benefit plan in spite of the limited obligations for the Company and the nature of the obligations not being stable or continuous.\n\nThe  qualification  as  a  defined  benefit  plan  results  in  the recognition of a provision with regards to the future obligations.\n\nWith  the  Company's  obligations  being  limited,  the  valuation  of what will actually be paid to retirees is uncertain. Since the effect of  this  threshold  cannot  be  measured  reliably,  the  provision recognized  represents  the  actuarial  value  of  the  amounts  to  be paid out to retirees until the plan is closed, excluding any potential threshold  effect.  The  additional  retirement  benefit  paid  by Air Liquide is aligned with the indexation of French statutory and supplementary  pension  plans  up  to  a  maximum  annuity.  Any additional annuity will not be subject to any indexation. The effects related  to  the  revaluation  cap  and  floor  were  accounted  for  in 'Other financial expenses'.\n\nIn Germany, there are two main Air Liquide pension plans.\n\nThe  first  plan  provides  the  retirees  of  Lurgi  (Engineering &  Construction  activity)  with  a  lifetime  annuity,  based  on  the income  and  length  of  service  vested  in  the  plan  at  the  time  of retirement,  the  normal  retirement  age  being  65.  The  plan  also provides  disability  and  widowhood  pensions.  This  plan  is  now closed  to  new  entrants,  the  latter  benefiting  from  a  defined contribution plan.\n\nThe  second  plan  is  an  old  plan  covering  employees  of  the  Gas & Services activity. The plan provides a lifetime annuity, based on the  average  income  earned  over  the  employee's  career  and  the length  of  service  vested  at  the  time  of  retirement,  the  normal retirement  age  being  65.  The  plan  also  provides  disability,  preretirement  and  widowhood  pensions.  It  is  now  closed  to  new entrants,  with  new  employees  benefiting  from  another  defined benefit plan. Providing a minimum length of service of ten years, the plan provides a lifetime annuity based on the average income earned  over  the  employee's  career  and  the  length  of  service vested at the time of retirement, the normal retirement age being 65. The  plan  also  provides  disability, pre-retirement and widowhood pensions.\n\nIn  accordance with common market practice in Germany, limited funding contributions are made to pension funds as both plans are mainly managed internally.\n\nIn  the  United  States,  Air  Liquide  grants  retirees  supplemental benefits  in  addition  to  the  normal  pension  plans.  The  US  plan provides  a  traditional  final  average  pay  benefit  to  those  who continue  to  accrue  benefits.  A  retiring  employee  may  elect  to receive their pension benefit as a lump sum or a lifetime annuity. This plan was closed to new participants in 2004 and was frozen in  2016.  Therefore,  employees  who  joined  the  Company  before 2004  are  no  longer  acquiring  new  rights  on  this  defined  benefit plan, but benefit from the defined contribution plan that has been opened since 2004 to new employees.\n\nA new plan was implemented on January 1, 2017 (Supplemental Saving  plan).  This  plan  comes  on  top  of  the  basic  savings  plan offering  additional  retirement  benefits  beyond  the  tax  limit  of  the basic  plan.  It  represents  an  annual  cost  of  around  7  million  US dollars.",

PENSION PLAN RISK ANALYSIS\n\n## Sensitivity to movements in discount rates and other variables\n\nThe present value of obligations related to defined benefit plans is measured  by  discounting  future  cash  flows.  Discount  rates  are determined  based  on  Government  bonds  rates  or,  when  the financial markets are sufficiently liquid, on 'high-quality' corporate bond rates, which can vary from one period to another.\n\nChanges  in  discount  rates  can  materially  change  the  present value of the Group's obligations and the expense recorded in the year.\n\n## Impact of a -0.25% decrease in discount rates\n\n|                 |   Impact on obligations as of December 31, 2021 (in millions of euros) | % of total obligations as of  December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Europe / Africa |                                                                     55 | 3.3 %                                             |\n| Americas        |                                                                     28 | 3.0 %                                             |\n| Asia-Pacific    |                                                                      1 | 1.0 %                                             |\n| TOTAL           |                                                                     84 | 3.1 %                                             |\n\n|                 |   Impact on obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in millions of euros) | % of total obligations as of  December 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Europe / Africa |                                                                     62 | 3.4 %                                             |\n| Americas        |                                                                     30 | 3.2 %                                             |\n| Asia-Pacific    |                                                                      1 | 1.0 %                                             |\n| TOTAL           |                                                                     93 | 3.3 %                                             |\n\nThe amount of obligations is affected to a lesser extent by revised wages and inflation indexes, as well as legal changes regarding retirement age or official mortality tables.",

Any  adverse  movement  in  these  variables would require additional Group contributions to the pension funds on a timely basis.\n\nPlan  assets  consist  of  shares,  bonds  and  other  assets  whose value is subject to market fluctuations. A downturn in the financial markets would increase the net liabilities of defined benefit plans. The plans' coverage ratios would decrease accordingly, requiring additional Group contributions on a timely basis.\n\n| 2021                | Shares   | Shares   | Bonds     | Bonds   | Real estate   | Real estate   | Cash      | Cash   | Others    | Others   | TOTAL     | TOTAL        |\n|---------------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------------|\n| (in millions euros) | Amounts  |          | % Amounts |         | % Amounts     |               | % Amounts |        | % Amounts |          | % Amounts | %            |\n| Europe / Africa     | 87       | 20.7 %   | 127       | 30.2 %  | 112           | 26.7 %        | 69        | 16.3 % | 26        | 6.1 %    |           | 421  100.0 % |\n| Americas            | 192      | 23.1 %   | 556       | 66.8 %  | 62            | 7.5 %         | 6         | 0.7 %  | 16        | 2.0 %    |           | 832  100.0 % |\n| Asia-Pacific        | 6        | 11.4 %   | 40        | 79.6 %  | 1             | 1.0 %         | 2         | 4.9 %  | 2         | 3.1 %    |           | 51  100.0 %  |\n| TOTAL               | 285      | 285      | 723       | 723     | 175           | 175           | 77        | 77     | 44        | 44       | 1,304     | 1,304        |\n\n| 2020                | Shares   | Shares   | Bonds     | Bonds   | Real estate   | Real estate   | Cash      | Cash   | Others    | Others   | TOTAL     | TOTAL        |\n|---------------------|----------|----------|-----------|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------|--------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------------|\n| (in millions euros) | Amounts  |          | % Amounts |         | % Amounts     |               | % Amounts |        | % Amounts |          | % Amounts | %            |\n| Europe / Africa     | 80       | 20.8 %   | 128       | 32.9 %  | 107           | 27.6 %        | 46        | 11.8 % | 27        | 6.9 %    |           | 388  100.0 % |\n| Americas            | 187      | 23.5 %   | 553       | 69.6 %  | 22            | 2.8 %         | 4         | 0.5 %  | 29        | 3.6 %    |           | 795  100.0 % |\n| Asia-Pacific        | 5        | 9.5 %    | 44        | 82.5 %  | -             | 0.0 %         | -         | 0.0 %  | 4         | 8.0 %    |           | 53  100.0 %  |\n| TOTAL               | 272      |          | 725       |         | 129           |               | 50        |        | 60        |          | 1,236     |              |\n\n<!-- image -->",

NET DEBT BY CURRENCY\n\nThe Group ensures a natural hedge and reduces its exposure to currency fluctuations by raising debt mainly in the currency of the cash flows that are generated to repay the debt. In most countries, and  especially  outside  the  euro,  US  dollar,  Japanese  yen  and Chinese  renminbi  zones,  financing  is  raised  in  either  local  or foreign currency (EUR or USD) when sales contracts are indexed to foreign currency. Debt in other currencies is mainly denominated  in  Singapore  dollar,  in  Canadian  dollar,  in  British pound sterling and in Brazilian real.\n\nAs  part  of  intra-group  multi-currency  financing,  the  Central Treasury Department converts the debt raised in financial markets\n\ninto  various  currencies  to  finance  subsidiaries  in  their  functional currencies  or  their  cash  flow  currencies.  The  breakdown  of  this hedging portfolio is shown in the table below.\n\nAccordingly,  a  portion  of  the  euro  debt  raised  was  converted (2,061.9  million  euros)  to  other  currencies  to  finance  foreign subsidiaries.  As  an  example,  3,671.4  million  euros  were  raised initially  in  US  dollar,  1,052.1  million  were  raised  in  euros  and converted in US  dollar using currency swap contracts. 292.6 million euros were in cash or cash equivalent, leading to an adjusted net debt in US dollars of 4,430.9 million euros.\n\n| 2021 (in millions of euros)   | Gross debt -  original issue   | Interest rate and  currency swaps   | Cash and cash  equivalents   | Adjusted net debt   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| EUR                           | 7,743.7                        | (2,061.9)                           | (1,340.1)                    | 4,341.7             |\n| USD                           | 3,671.4                        | 1,052.1                             | (292.6)                      | 4,430.9             |\n| JPY                           | 117.7                          | 82.9                                | (19.2)                       | 181.4               |\n| CNY                           | 230.8                          | (115.5)                             | (208.6)                      | (93.3)              |\n| ZAR                           | 310.3                          | -                                   | (27.6)                       | 282.7               |\n| Other currencies              | 621.0                          | 1,042.4                             | (358.5)                      | 1,304.9             |\n| TOTAL                         | 12,694.9                       | -                                   | (2,246.6)                    | 10,448.3            |\n\n| 2020 (in millions of euros)   | Gross debt - original  issue   | Interest rate and  currency swaps   | Cash and cash  equivalents   | Adjusted net debt   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| EUR                           | 7,136.6                        | (1,022.1)                           | (1,093.9)                    | 5,020.6             |\n| USD                           | 4,206.0                        | 162.3                               | (176.1)                      | 4,192.2             |\n| JPY                           | 135.0                          | 91.7                                | (7.9)                        | 218.8               |\n| CNY                           | 394.4                          | (195.4)                             | (263.0)                      | (64.0)              |\n| Other currencies              | 528.7                          | 963.5                               | (250.5)                      | 1,241.7             |\n| TOTAL                         | 12,400.7                       | -                                   | (1,791.4)                    | 10,609.3            |\n\n## 25.6.

OTHER FINANCING INFORMATION\n\nFour  financial  covenants  are  associated  to  bank  debt  facilities exceeding 50 million euros: they are long term loans used by Air Liquide Arabia  (Saudi Arabia), Air  Liquide  Kuzbass  (Russia)  and Air Liquide Large Industries South Africa (South Africa), for a total outstanding  amount  of  486  million  euros  as  of  December  31, 2021. Financial covenants were all met as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe amount of bank credit facilities subject to financial covenants represents  around  5.4%  of  the  Group's  gross  debt  as  of December 31, 2021.\n\nBonds issued by L'Air Liquide S.A. and Air Liquide Finance, and making  up  the  carrying  amount  of  bonds  as  of  December  31, 2021, include a change of control clause.\n\n## Note 26 Financial risk policy and management\n\n## 26.1.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk  management  is  a  priority  for  the  Group.  Consequently,  the Finance  Department  governance  relies  on  Strategic  Finance Committees and Operational Finance Committees.\n\nThe  Finance  Department  centrally  manages  the  main  financial risks, in accordance with decisions taken by the Strategic Finance Committee  to  which  it  reports  on  a  regular  basis.  The  Finance Department  also  performs  country  and  customer  risks  analyses associated  with  investment  decisions  and  attends  Investment Committee meetings.\n\nThe financial policy adopted by Air Liquide, the purpose of which is to  minimize  the  risks  incurred  by  the  Group  and  its  subsidiaries, enables  the  Group  to  ensure  sustainable  funding  sources.  To minimize  the  refinancing  risk  related  to  debt  maturity  schedules, the  Group  diversifies  financing  sources  and  spreads  maturities over  several  years.  In  2021,  the  average  debt  maturity  was  6.0 years. As of December 31, 2021, the long-term debt (gross debt maturing in more than one year) represented 83% of the overall Group debt, compared to 82% as of December 31, 2020.\n\nInterest rate, commodities and foreign currency hedging strategies validated  by  the  Operational  Finance  Committee  are  set  up depending on market opportunities with a concern for optimization, while complying with prudence and risk limitation principles.\n\nThe  Group  also  pays  continuous  attention  to  its  bank  and customer counterparty risks by regularly monitoring ratings issued by  main  international  rating  agencies  and  the  level  of  risk associated with these counterparties. An internal ratings system, set-up  in  2018,  is  used  for  the  most  important  when  no  leading credit ratings agency information is available.\n\n## a) Foreign exchange risk\n\n## Principles\n\nFinancial  instruments  are  only  used  to  hedge  transaction-based foreign  exchange  risk.  The  risk  is  attached  on  the  one  hand  to financial  cash  flows  arising  from  royalties,  dividends,  intra-group loans  and  borrowings  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  and  on the  other  hand  to  foreign  currency  commercial  cash  flows  from operating  entities.  Although  in  slight  increase,  commercial  cash flows  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  do  not  represent significant amounts compared to consolidated revenue.\n\nForeign  exchange  risk  related  to  royalties,  dividend  flows  and intra-group loans and borrowings in foreign currencies is hedged by  the  Central  Treasury  Department  using  currency  forwards  or options  with  an  overall  term  of  less  than  18  months.  Currency hedging  of  intra-group  loans  and  borrowings  uses  currency forwards.\n\nForeign  currency  commercial  cash  flows  from  operating  entities are  hedged  either  as  part  of  the  annual  budgetary  process  for subsidiaries  with  recurring  flows  in  foreign  currency  or  at  the signing date of a sale or purchase contract for non-recurring flows for  the  Engineering  &  Construction  business  line.  Around  a hundred subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange risk. These subsidiaries  mainly  use  currency  forwards  set  up  by Air  Liquide Finance (internal counterparty for hedging transactions) except in countries where it is prohibited by local regulations. The majority of these contracts have short maturities (three to twelve months) and  market  transactions  are  regulated  by  master  agreements  of the French Banking Federation ('FBF') or by master agreements of the International Swaps and Derivative Association ('ISDA') for local  hedging  operations.  These  do  not  include  collateralization commitments or margin calls.\n\nWhen preparing their budget at the year-end, subsidiaries report their  foreign  exchange  risk  exposure  to  the  Central  Treasury Department in order to hedge the commercial cash flows expected in the  following  year.  In  each  case,  the  Central  Treasury Department  monitors  the  adequacy  of  the  hedges  with  the identified risks and performs a full revaluation of all hedges, every six months.\n\nThe foreign exchange translation risk (consolidation in euros of the assets  and  liabilities  in  currencies)  was  not  subject  to  hedging. Indeed,  investments  are  essentially  funded  in  the  currency  in which  the  cash  flows  are  generated,  thus  creating  a  natural currency hedging.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This approach enables the Group to limit the effect of interest rate fluctuations on financial expenses.\n\nConsequently,  at  the  2021  year-end,  94%  of  the  total  debt  was fixed-rate debt. The fixed-rate/floating-rate breakdown is reviewed on  a  regular  basis  by  the  Finance  Committees,  depending  on interest rate fluctuations and the level of Group debt.\n\nThe Group policy is to maintain the major portion of total debt at fixed  rates  and  to  protect  the  residual  balance  using  optional\n\n## Sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations on floating-rate debt\n\nThe Group net debt exposed to interest rate fluctuations amounted to around 983 million equivalent euros as of December 31, 2021, for an average outstanding amount of 0.7 billion equivalent euros (total  debt  adjusted  for  interest  rate  hedging  instruments  and short-term  securities)  in  slight  increase  compared  to  December 31, 2020 (0.6 billion equivalent euros).\n\nAn  increase  or  decrease  in  interest  rates  by  100  basis  points (\u00b11%) on all  yield  curves  would  have  an  effect  of  approximately \u00b17 million euros on the Group's annual financial expenses before tax, assuming outstanding debt remains constant.\n\n## Sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations on derivatives and their underlying hedged items\n\nThe table below shows the effect of a 0.5% fluctuation of interest rates in all foreign currencies on the interest rate derivatives portfolio in the Group's net profit and equity, as of December 31, 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                             | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                             | +0,5%                | +0,5%                | -0,5%                | -0,5%                |\n| (in millions of euros)                                      | P&L impact           | Equity impact        | P&L impact           | Equity impact        |\n| Interest rate derivatives and their hedged underlying items | -                    | 15.3                 | -                    | (15.7)               |",

        "page_content": "As  of  December  31,  2021, Air  Liquide  Finance  has  no  firm  and optional interest rate hedging derivatives,\n\nAll hedging instruments used for interest rate or foreign exchange risk management purposes relate to identified risks and were set up to comply with the Group's financial policy. The effect on equity primarily stems from the fixed-rate hedging instruments contracted by the subsidiary Air Liquide Finance.\n\n## c) Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty  risks  for  Air  Liquide  potentially  include  customers and bank counterparties.\n\nThe  Group's  subsidiaries  serve  a  large  number  of  customers (more  than  two  million  worldwide)  located  in  extremely  diverse markets: chemicals, steel, refining, food, pharmaceuticals, metals, automotive,  manufacturing,  healthcare,  research  laboratories, electronics,  etc.  In  2021,  the  Group's  main  customer  represents around 1.8% of revenue, the Group's 10 main customers around 12% of sales, and the Group's 50 main customers around 28% of sales. The geographical risk is limited by the Group's sustainable coverage in 75 countries on all continents. This diversity reduces customer and market risk.\n\nTo  better  assess  its  exposure,  the  Group  has  implemented procedures to regularly monitor the financial situation of its major customers as well as a monthly reporting for the Group's 174 main transnational customers in order to monitor the related consolidated risk.\n\nMoreover, customer risk assessment and in particular the quality of the customer's site is an important component of the investment decision process.\n\nBank  counterparty  risk  relates  to  the  outstanding  amounts  of deposits, current accounts, market values of derivatives and to the credit  lines  contracted  with  each  bank.  Pursuant  to  its  financial policy,  in  the  majority  of  cases,  the  Group  requires  a  long-term Standard & Poor's 'A' credit rating or a Moody's 'A2' rating from its counterparties to accept commitments on financial instruments.\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe  Group's  credit  lines  are  also  spread  among  several  banks from various geographical areas to avoid the risk of concentration while  complying  with  the  same  credit  rating  requirements.  The Operational  Finance  Committee  regularly  reviews  and  approves the list of bank counterparties related to investments and the list of financial  instruments.  With  regards  to  short-term  investments, outstandings are subject to  strict  limits  per  counterparty  and  are monitored daily.\n\nIFRS 13 Fair  Value  Measurement  specifies  that  the  valuation  of currency,  interest  rate  and  commodity  hedging  instruments  must take  into  account  the  counterparty  credit  risk  attached  to  these transactions. Considering the aforementioned counterparty selection criteria, the effect on the periodic valuations, by applying the historical default probabilities method is immaterial.\n\n## d) Liquidity risk\n\nIt is Group financial policy to spread over time the maturity of longterm  debt  in  order  to  avoid  concentration  of  annual  refinancing needs. Liquidity risk is also reduced by the stability of cash flows generated from operations as well as by having confirmed credit lines  in  place.  The  financial  covenants  attached  to  the  current financing  arrangements  described  in  note  25.7  do  not  affect  the Group's access to liquidity.\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  short-term  financing  in  the  form  of commercial  paper  amounted  to  244  million  euros  as  of December 31, 2021, an increase by 43 million euros compared to the  end  of  2020.  The  average  amount  of  commercial  paper amounted to 516 million euros in 2021, compared to 970 million euros in 2020.\n\nThe  Group  policy  requires  that  commercial  paper  in  issue  be backed  by  confirmed  long-term  credit  lines.  In  2021,  this requirement was met, with an amount of confirmed credit lines of 3,600  million  euros  largely  exceeding  maximum  outstanding commercial paper.\n\nThe table below presents the maturities of the bilateral and syndicated credit lines:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                      | 2022   |   2023 |   2024 | 2025   |   2026 | 2027   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Bilateral lines and syndicated credit lines | -      |    200 |    500 | 2,500  |    400 | -      | 3,600   |\n\nWhen  the  Group  makes  short-term  financial  investments  other than bank deposits, it systematically favors monetary instruments with a short-term maturity in order to limit the risk of non-liquidity or high volatility.\n\nThe following tables represent the future cash flows related to the main  balance  sheet  items  and  to  the  derivative  financial instruments recognized at the end of the last two periods. Interest flows are calculated in accordance with IFRS 7 and represent the\n\ninterest payable for each relevant period. Interest flows related to floating interest rate  or  foreign  currency  instruments  were calculated  using  the  closing  interest  and  exchange  rates  as  of December  31,  2020  and  2021.  The  flows  related  to  debt repayment obligations  differ  from  the  amounts  recognized  in  the Group's balance sheet due to the accounting treatment applied to borrowings and the exclusion of hedging instruments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As Air  Liquide  does  not  purchase  electricity  or  natural  gas  for speculation or arbitrage on commodity price trends purposes, no forward  contracts  relating  to  energy  meet  the  definition  of  a derivative  instrument.  The  contracts  enter  into  as  part  of  the Company's normal business to be used in the industrial process and do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument.\n\nFurthermore,  in  a  global  context  of  highly  volatile  electricity  and natural gas market prices, Air Liquide continues to index long-term customer  contracts  to  hedge  these  risks.  For  natural  gas  and electricity  prices,  the  opening  of  some  markets  led  the  Group, under these circumstances, to replace the regulated tariffs by local market indices.\n\nNonetheless,  a  few  contracts  remain  for  which  price  indexation alone  cannot  guarantee  a  total  and  effective  hedge  against  the risk  of  energy  prices  fluctuations.  These  risks  are  therefore hedged by Air Liquide,  particularly  by Air  Liquide  Finance,  using adequate  commodity  derivatives,  which  are  mainly  swaps  with maturities of generally less than two years. For contracts for the supply  of  industrial  gas  produced  from  renewable  energy,  new risks to be taken into account (long-term commitment, fixed price, intermittency,  management  of  environmental  certificates,  etc.) could lead the Group to make greater use of appropriate hedging instruments.\n\nThe fair value recognition of these derivative instruments had no material  impact  on  Group  equity  or  profits  as  of  December  31, 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  consideration, Exeltium  and  its  shareholder  clients  signed  long-term  electricity supply contracts. The contract signed by Air Liquide has a 20-year term  and  can  be  suspended  by Air  Liquide  after  10  years.  This contract provides long-term visibility over the price of the electricity to  be  supplied.  This  project  was  approved  by  the  European Commission.\n\nThe 2021 plan performance shares granted to corporate officers and  Executive  Committee  members  cannot  be  exercised  unless certain performance conditions are achieved.\n\nNo  stock  options  or  performance  shares  were  granted  to  other non-executive Directors under these plans.",

        "page_content": "The  Group's  energy  purchase  commitments  amounted  to 2,673.9 million euros as of December 31, 2021 (1,155.3  million  euros  as  of  December  31,  2020).  This  amount includes  the  energy  purchase  commitments  relating  to  the Exeltium contract.\n\nAlmost  all  of  these  commitments  are  covered  by  mutual commitments  received  from  clients  in  connection  with  long-term gas supply contracts. These commitments are not disclosed in the table above.\n\n## Note 31 Contingent liabilities\n\nTo  the  best  of  the  Group's  knowledge,  there  is  no  exceptional event or litigation which has affected in the recent past or which is likely to materially affect its financial situation or profitability.\n\nIn  September 2010, the Brazilian competition authority ('CADE') fined  the  major  industrial  gas  companies  operating  in  Brazil, including Air Liquide Brazil, for unfair trade practices prior to 2004. Air  Liquide  Brazil  was  fined  197.6  million  Brazilian  reals  before interest on arrears amounting to 384.6 million Brazilian reals as of December 31, 2021 (equivalent to 31.2 million euros for the fine and 29.5 million euros for interest on arrears).\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nCommitments  to  purchases  of  molecules  as  part  of  take-or-pay contracts amounted to 4,158.5 million euros as of December 31, 2021  (3,868.5  as  of  December  31,  2020),  and  are  reported  in other commitments related to operating activities. These amounts include Helium purchase commitments.\n\nConfirmed credit lines are shown in note 25.\n\nCommitments related to associates amounted to 41.4 million euros as of December 31, 2021.\n\nAir  Liquide  Brazil  has  strongly  contested  this  decision  and  has consequently  filed  an  application  to  annul  the  fine  before  the Brasilia  Federal  Court.  In  May  2014,  the  CADE  ruling  was annulled  in  first  instance  by  this  Court.  In  September  2014,  the CADE filed an appeal against this decision, which was rejected by the Court of Appeals in November 2015. In November 2016, the CADE and  the  Procurator's  Office  had  both  filed  a  new  appeal against this decision to the Superior Court and the Supreme Court of Justice, which is still to be ruled as of December 31, 2021. At this stage, the Group considers it probable that Air Liquide Brazil will  prevail,  mainly  following  appeals  filed  by  the  CADE  against other companies  and  dismissed  by  the  Superior Court. Consequently, no provision has been recorded.\n\n## Note 32 Climate risks consideration\n\nAccording to the terms and conditions described in the paragraph related to the use of estimates and assumptions in the accounting principles, the Group takes into account climate risks in its closing assumptions  and  include  their  potential  impact  in  the  Financial Statements.\n\nThe  main  climate  risk  identified  by  the  Group  relates  to greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  costs  incurred  for  measures related to gas emissions are already taken into account as part of the  investment  decision  and  in  the  running  costs  of  the  Group's plants. These costs are passed on to most of the Large Industry customers in accordance with the terms of the contract.\n\nThe potential impacts on the Financial Statements of the Group's sustainable development objectives, published in March 2021 and in the process of being deployed, has been studied. No significant impact has been identified, either on the useful life or on the value of the assets, on the client portfolio or on the cash flows generated by  existing  activities  or  on  provisions  for  risks  and  charges.  The decarbonization  objectives  can  be  achieved  in  particular  by adapting existing assets or by meeting new capacity needs for the use of innovative technologies that are already controlled by the Group.\n\nThe  ETS  (Emission  Trading  Scheme)  European  Directive  which established a quota system for greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union has entered in its Phase IV, covering the period 2021-2030, with in particular  an  increase  in  the  reduction  factor. The overall quantity of allowances will decrease at an increased annual rate, resulting in an overall reduction of emissions from the sectors under the EU ETS of 61% by 2030 compared to 2005.\n\nWith phase III, the Group is required to obtain CO2 quotas for the portion of emissions from hydrogen production sites not covered by free allocations, as well as for all emissions from cogeneration sites.  As  the  Group  manages  CO2  quotas  solely  to  cover  its industrial needs, they are classified as a commodity and managed as such. The quotas are therefore valued at acquisition cost and presented in inventories.\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  a  provision  when  the  year-end  quotas covering greenhouse gas emissions are insufficient, based on the best  estimate  of  the  outflow  of  resources  required  to  settle  the obligation.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the amounts recognized in assets and liabilities are immaterial.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The transaction was closed on January 11, 2022, following regulatory approval.\n\nThe  accounting  impacts  from  this  transaction,  including  the revaluation  of  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  at  fair market value, are being assessed and will be booked in the first half of 2022.\n\n## Foreign exchange rates and main consolidated companies\n\n## FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES\n\n## Main foreign exchange rates used\n\n## Average rates\n\n| Euros for 1 currency   |   2020 |   2021 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| USD                    |   0.88 |   0.85 |\n| CNY                    |   0.13 |   0.13 |\n| CAD                    |   0.65 |   0.67 |\n| Yen (1,000)            |   8.22 |   7.7  |\n\n## Closing rates\n\n| Euros for 1 currency   |   2020 |   2021 |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|\n| USD                    |   0.81 |   0.88 |\n| CNY                    |   0.12 |   0.14 |\n| CAD                    |   0.64 |   0.69 |\n| Yen (1,000)            |   7.91 |   7.67 |",

This Statutory Auditors' report includes information required by European regulation and  French  law,  such  as  information  about  the  appointment  of  the  Statutory  Auditors  or  verification  of  the  information  concerning  the  Group presented in the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of L' Air Liquide,\n\n## OPINION\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of L'Air Liquide ('the Group') for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## BASIS FOR OPINION\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur  responsibilities  under  those  standards  are  further  described  in  the  Statutory  Auditors'  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with  independence  requirements  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (Code  de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for Statutory Auditors, for the period from January 1, 2021 to the date of  our  report  and  specifically  we  did  not  provide  any  prohibited  non-audit  services  referred  to  in Article  5(1)  of  Regulation  (EU)  No 537/2014.\n\n## JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Financial Statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt  is  in  this  complex  and  evolving  context  that,  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of Articles  L.  823-9  and  R.  823-7  of  the  French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Large Industries activity: qualification of the contracts and related revenue recognition method\n\n## Risk identified\n\nThe  gas  supply  of  the  Large  Industries  activity  is  based  on  long  term  contracts  with  a  limited  number  of  customers  and  requires significant industrial investments.\n\nAs described in  note  '3.a.  Revenue  recognition  -  Gas  &  Services'  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  these  investments  are usually made to share production capacity with the other business lines of the Group, particularly the Industrial Merchant business or to serve customers connected to pipelines in an industrial region. In such cases, Group management considers that those assets are not identified as defined in the standard IFRS 16 'Leases'.\n\nWhen assets used for the long term supply agreements are dedicated to a customer, Group management considers that the Group retains the right to direct the use of these assets as defined in the standard IFRS 16 'Leases'. Accordingly, gas supply agreements linked to those assets are not considered as leases. These industrial investments continue to be controlled by the Group and are recorded as property, plant and equipment, the full amounts received for the contracts being, otherwise, recognized as revenue. Customers of the Large Industries business simultaneously receive and consume the benefits granted by the gas supply service or its availability. As a result,  the  revenue  recognition  related  to  these  contracts  occurs  when  the  gas  is  supplied  or  when  the  reserved  capacity  is  made available.",

        "page_content": "## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDue to the complexity of those contracts and the impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the judgments made when the contract is signed, or in case of subsequent significant modifications, we have considered the qualification of Large Industries long-term contracts and related revenue recognition criteria as a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures consisted notably in:\n\n- \u25a0 considering the criteria to qualify the Large Industries long term contracts applied by Group management, considering in particular the specific nature of the underlying assets;\n- \u25a0 considering  internal  control  procedures  implemented  by  Group  management  to  confirm  the  compliance  of  these  contracts  with standard terms and conditions on which Group management's IFRS 16 analysis is based;\n- \u25a0 assessing the compliance to standard terms of the new significant contracts of the current year for the Large Industries activity and conditions and the impact of potential deviations on the accounting treatment;\n- \u25a0 assessing the appropriateness of the disclosure included in note '3.a. Revenue recognition - Gas & Services' to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Large Industries activity: useful lives of production units and measurement of their recoverable amount\n\n## Risk identified\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the net book value of property, plant and equipment amounts to 22, 532 million euros, or 48,2% of the Group total assets, that include the significant industrial investments to execute the customer agreements of the Large Industries activity. Large Industries production units are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life, usually between 15 and 20 years. The estimated useful lives are reassessed on a regular basis and the resulting change in estimates, if any, are recorded on a prospective basis.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  can  be  exposed  to  certain  risks  specific  to  industrial  investments.  Expected  returns  on  investment  and  their recoverable value can, for example, be adversely impacted by events such as the economic context, overruns and construction delays, start-up  conditions,  technology  changes,  geographical  location,  counterparty  risk  or  Group's  sustainable  development  objectives  and commitments.\n\nAs disclosed in note '5.f. Impairment of assets' to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Group management determines on a regular basis whether asset impairment indicators exist. If a triggering event is identified, an impairment test is performed to confirm whether the net book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value. These principles lead Group management to test production assets (either individually  or  within  the  cash  generating  unit  to  which  they  are  attached),  in  particular  in  case  of  significant  start-up  delays,  project termination, significant decrease in expected business volumes, early termination or non-renewal of related customer contracts.\n\nAs part of the preparation of its medium-term plan, the Group had carried out in 2020 a strategic review of its activities and its assets portfolio,  taking  into  account  the  impacts  of  the  health  crisis  on  specific  markets.  The  measurement  of  the  recoverable  value  of  the equipment relies on significant estimates relating to  the  Group's  capacity  to  generate  future  cash-flows,  re-use  certain  equipment  for other internal or external customers, to sell the assets, or to obtain indemnification, notably from customers.\n\nDue to the significant value of each production asset and the cumulative value of these assets, the key assumptions used to assess their useful life, their re-use or the compensation to be received, we have considered the useful life and measurement of the recoverable value of Large Industries production assets as a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures consisted notably in:\n\n- \u25a0 considering the procedures performed by Group management to assess and update the depreciation period of the equipment and assess the consistency of their useful lives with contractual terms and available internal technical studies;\n- \u25a0 analyzing the Group's process to identify impairment indicators and considering the strategic review of its activities and its assets portfolio performed by Group management;\n- \u25a0 considering the work carried  out  by  the  Group  to  determine  the  recoverable  values  of  the  plants,  including  key  assumptions  and estimates used to determine the future cash flows and reconciling them to the underlying operational data and to the long-term growth rate of these cash flows;\n- \u25a0 analyzing the accounting translation of impairment losses resulting from the determination of recoverable values;\n- \u25a0 considering discussions of the Group with its customers and advisors.\n\n## Impairment test of goodwill\n\n## Risk identified\n\nIn connection with its external growth strategy, the Group monitors the related goodwill at the level of group of cash generating units. For the  Gas  &  Services  activity,  goodwill  are  mostly  allocated  on  a  geographical  basis.  For  the  world  business  units  Engineering  & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies, goodwill is monitored at the business unit level. As at December 31, 2021, goodwill amounts to a net book value of 13,992 million euros (29,9% of the Group total assets).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Impairment of assets' to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe  determination  of  fair  value  and  recoverable  value,  and  the  sensitivity  to  the  fluctuation  of  market  multiples  and  key  data  and assumptions used, require significant management judgement and estimates. We have considered the measurement of the recoverable value of the groups of cash generating units as a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures consisted notably in:\n\n- \u25a0 considering the principles used to determine the groups of cash generating units;\n- \u25a0 analyzing  principles  and  methods  used  to  determine  the  market  value  and  their  measurement  based  on  multiples  of  market capitalization;\n- \u25a0 considering  in  particular  for  cash  generating  units  (or  groups  of  cash  generating  units)  subject  to  a  value  in  use  valuation, management key assumptions and estimates, notably the underlying operating data and long-term growth rates of the cash-flow. We have also assessed with the support of our valuation experts who are part of the audit team, the discount rates applied and performed sensitivity tests;\n- \u25a0 assessing the appropriateness of the information included in note '11. Goodwill' to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verification required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the Group's Management Report.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to their fair presentation and their consistency with the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe attest  that  the  consolidated  non-financial  statement  required  by Article  L.  225-102-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (Code  de commerce)  is  included  in  the  Group's  information  given  in  the  management  report,  being  specified  that,  in  accordance  with  Article L. 823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the information contained therein and the information has to be subject to a report by an independent third party.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Format of the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the Statutory Auditor relating to the annual and Consolidated Financial Statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Financial Report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code  (Code  mon\u00e9taire  et  financier),  prepared  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer (Pr\u00e9sident-Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral), complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe  were  appointed  as  Statutory  Auditors  of  L'Air  Liquide  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  held  on  May  12,  2016  for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on May 5, 2010 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in its sixth year of uninterrupted engagement and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres in its twelfth year of uninterrupted engagement.\n\nPreviously, ERNST & YOUNG Audit was Statutory Auditor of L'Air Liquide from 1983 to 2009.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  the  preparation  and  fair  presentation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in  accordance  with International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  as  adopted  by  the  European  Union  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect  a  material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  of  users  taken  on  the  basis  of  these  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25a0 identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs  and  performs  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence  considered  to  be  sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u25a0 obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u25a0 evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the Consolidated Financial Statements;\n- \u25a0 assesses the appropriateness  of  management's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- \u25a0 evaluates the overall presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- \u25a0 obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and for the opinion expressed on these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Accounts Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most  significance  in  the  audit  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  the  current  period  and  which  are  therefore  the  key  audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe  also  provide  the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee  with  the  declaration  provided  for  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  N\u00b0  537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Accounts Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine et Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 4, 2022 The Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nFran\u00e7oise Garnier\n\nS\u00e9verine Scheer\n\nJeanne Boillet\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Guillaume Postel\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

General principles\n\nThe  statutory  accounts  of  the  Company  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  have been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  rules  and principles generally accepted  in  France  according  to  the provisions  of  the  French  Chart  of  Accounts (Plan  Comptable G\u00e9n\u00e9ral) (A.N.C. Regulation 2014-03).\n\nThe accounting policies for the establishment and presentation of the statutory accounts have been applied in accordance with the principle of prudence and with the following basic assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 Going concern;\n- \u25a0 Consistency  of  accounting  methods  from  one  accounting period to another;\n- \u25a0 Separation of each accounting periods.\n\nThe  method  used  for  the  valuation  of  recorded  items  is  the historical cost method.\n\nOnly material information is disclosed.\n\n## 2. Non-current assets\n\n## A. Intangible assets\n\nInternally generated  intangible  assets  primarily  include  the development costs of information management systems. They are capitalized only if they generate probable future economic benefits and  whether  there  is  available  appropriate  resources  (technical, financial and others) to complete the development and use or sell the intangible asset. Internal and external costs corresponding to detailed  application  design,  programming,  the  performance  of tests  and  the  drafting  of  technical  documentation  intended  for internal or external use are capitalized.\n\nSignificant upgrade and improvement costs are added to the initial cost of assets if they specifically meet the capitalization criteria.\n\nOther  intangible  assets  include  separately  acquired  intangible assets such as software, licenses and intellectual property rights and are measured at acquisition cost.\n\nIntangible  assets  are  amortized  according  to  the  straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.\n\n## B. Tangible assets\n\nLand,  buildings  and  equipment  are  recognized  at  historical  cost. Interim interest expense is not included in the cost.\n\nWhere components of a tangible asset have different useful lives, they  are  accounted  separately  and  depreciated  over  their  own useful lives.\n\nDepreciation  is  computed  according  to  the  straight-line  method over their estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 buildings: 10 to 30 years;\n- \u25a0 equipment: 5 to 20 years.\n\nLand is not depreciated.\n\n## C. Impairment of intangible and tangible assets\n\nThe Company assesses at each closing date whether there is any indication of impairment loss of intangible and tangible assets. If such indications exist, an impairment test is performed to assess whether  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  exceeds  its  present value, which is defined as the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\n\nIn  assessing  value  in  use,  the  estimated  future  cash  flows  are discounted  to  their  present  value  as  this  would  be  done  for  an investment decision.\n\nWhen the present amount of an asset is lower than its net carrying amount,  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized  in  the  income statement. When the present value exceeds the carrying amount, the  previously  recognized  impairment  is  reversed  to  the  income statement.\n\n## D. Equity investments\n\nEquity  investments  are  recognized  at  their  initial  amount  on  the entry date, with the exception of those subject to a revaluation as provided by Law 76-1232 of December 29, 1976. Acquisition costs that are not representative of market value are expensed.\n\nWhen the carrying amount, determined using the criteria normally adopted  for  the  measurement  of  equity  investments  (market multiples  method  based  on  the  Air  Liquide  Group  market valuation,  estimated  cash  flow  approach,  and  net  asset  value remeasured  at  fair  value),  is  lower  than  the  book  value,  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.\n\n## E. Treasury shares\n\nWhen  the  Company  purchases  its  own  shares,  they  are recognized  at  cost  as  treasury  shares  in  other  long-term investment securities. The gains or losses on disposals of treasury shares contribute to the net profit for the year.\n\nHowever, shares allocated for the purpose of implementing plans for free grants of shares are reclassified to a 'Short-term financial investments - Company treasury shares' caption at the balance sheet value on the date of allotment.\n\nA provision is recorded over the rights vesting period to cover the future charge of employees  and  members  of  Executive Management of the Company relating to the remittance of current shares  when  the  performance  criteria  can  be  determined  with reliability. Conversely, the amount corresponding to the maximum performance level is presented in off-balance sheet commitments.\n\nWhen the purchase cost of shares is higher than their valuation based  on  the  average  share  price  during  the  last  month  of  the fiscal year, treasury shares earmarked for cancellation or allocated for the purpose of implementing plans for free grants of shares are not impaired.\n\n## 3. Inventories and work-in-progress\n\nRaw  materials,  supplies  and  goods  are  primarily  measured  at weighted average cost.\n\nAn  impairment  loss  is  recognized  for  inventories  and  work-inprogress when the estimated realizable amount is lower than cost.\n\n## 4. Trade receivables and other operating assets\n\nTrade  receivables  and  other  operating  assets  are  measured  at historical cost.\n\nAn impairment loss for receivables is recognized when it becomes probable  that  the  amount  due  will  not  be  collected  and  the  loss can be reasonably estimated.",

        "page_content": "## 5. Foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.\n\nAt  year-end,  the  difference  arising  from  the  translation  of receivables and payables denominated in a foreign currency, are recognized  in  suspense  accounts  in  assets  and  liabilities ('Unrealized foreign currency gains or losses').\n\nWhere applicable, unrealized foreign exchange losses associated with  non-hedged  transactions  are  subject  to  a  contingency provision.\n\n## 6. Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when:\n\n- \u25a0 the  Company  has  a  present  obligation  as  a  result  of  a  past event or an ongoing one;\n- \u25a0 it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation;\n- \u25a0 a  reliable  estimate  can  be  made  of  the  amount  of  the obligation.\n\n## 7. Financial instruments\n\nSince  January  1,  2017,  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  has  applied  the  ANC regulation no. 2015-05 of July 2, 2015 related to financial forward and hedging instruments.\n\nIn accordance with its risk management policy, L'Air Liquide S.A. enters into forward currency purchases or sales in order to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with transactions carried out in foreign currencies.\n\nBy  symmetry,  the  foreign  exchange  gains  or  losses  on  forward currency purchases or sales is presented at the same time and in the same income statement caption as the hedged item.\n\nLikewise, the unrealized gain from the hedging is presented within the unrealized foreign currency gains or losses statement caption, to  offset  the  exchange  differentials  related  to  the  revaluation  of underlying  receivables  and  debts.  When  the  forward  currency purchases or sales, hedge future transactions not yet recorded on the balance sheet, the fair value of these instruments represents an off balance sheet commitment.\n\nWhere  applicable,  when  the  financial  instruments  used  do  not constitute  hedging  transactions  ('isolated  open  position'),  the losses resulting from their year-end market value are provided for in  the  income  statement.  In  accordance  with  the  principle  of prudence,  unrealized  gains  are  not  recognized  in  the  income statement.\n\n## 8. Post-employment benefits\n\nThe  Company  applies ANC  recommendation  2013-02  related  to the  recognition  and  measurement  of  retirement  benefits  and similar obligations.\n\nThe Company provides its employees with various pension plans, termination benefits, jubilees (awards based on years of service) and  other  post-employment  benefits  for  both  active  employees and retirees. These benefits are covered in two ways:\n\n- \u25a0 by so-called defined contribution plans;\n- \u25a0 by so-called defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Company grants both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\n\nDefined contribution plans are plans under which the employer's sole obligation is to pay regular contributions. The employer does not grant any guarantee on the future level of benefits paid to the employee  or  retiree  ('means-based  obligation').  The  annual pension expense is equal to the contribution paid during the fiscal year which relieves the employer from any further obligation.\n\n## Statutory accounts on the parent company\n\nDefined benefit plans are those by which the employer guarantees the  future  level  of  benefits  defined  in  the  agreement,  most  often depending on the employee's salary and seniority ('result-based obligation'). Defined benefit plans can be:\n\n- \u25a0 either  financed  by  contributions  to  a  fund  specialized  in managing the contributions paid;\n- \u25a0 or managed internally.\n\nIn  the  case  of  defined  benefit  plans,  retirement  and  similar obligations are measured by independent actuaries, according to the projected unit credit method. The actuarial calculations mainly take  into  account  the  following  assumptions:  salary  increases, employee  turnover,  retirement  date,  mortality,  inflation  and appropriate discount rates.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  exceeding  the  greater  of  10%  of  the obligations or 10% of the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of  the  reporting  period  are  amortized over the expected average working lives of the plan participants.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  option  offered  by  ANC  recommendation 2013 -02, the Company  maintained  its  previous  practices: obligations related to retirement termination payments and jubilees are  provided  whereas  other  retirement  obligations  related  to defined  benefit  plans  are  not  provided  but  are  disclosed  in  the notes.\n\n## 9. Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.\n\nRevenue  associated  with  delivery  of  services  is  booked  when delivery is completed.\n\n## 10. Tax consolidation\n\nL'Air  Liquide  S.A.  has  set  up  a  tax  consolidation  group  with  the French  subsidiaries  in  which  it  holds  a  direct  or  indirect  interest exceeding 95%, as defined by article 223-A of the French General Tax Code.\n\nEach  company  calculates  its  tax  provision  as  if  it  was  taxed separately.  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.,  as  head  of  the  tax  consolidation group, recognizes as an expense the tax corresponding to its own profits and recognizes in a balance sheet current tax account the impact of restatements and eliminations when determining taxable profit as a whole and the tax deferrals of subsidiaries with losses. It is booked in exceptional income and expenses according to the Opinion 2005-G of the Emergency Committee of the C.N.C.\n\n## 11. Research and Development expenditures\n\nDevelopment costs shall be recognized as assets if and only if the Company can demonstrate all of the following:\n\n- \u25a0 the  project  is  clearly  identified  and  the  related  costs  are individualized and reliably monitored;\n- \u25a0 the  technical  and  industrial  feasibility  of  the  project  is demonstrated;\n- \u25a0 there is a clear intention to complete the project and use or sell the products arising from it;\n- \u25a0 it  is  probable  that  the  project  will  generate  future  economic benefits for the Company.\n\nWhen these conditions are not satisfied, the work carried out does not  systematically  result  in  the  completion  of  an  intangible  asset that will be available for use or sale, development costs generated are recognized as an expense when incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

On October 23, 2020, the Conseil d'\u00c9tat decided to refer a question to the Court of Justice of the  European Union (CJEU). L' Air Liquide S.A., being a party to this case, sent a statement to the CJEU and took part to the hearing at the Court on 8 September, 2021. Since the public rapporteur issued an unfavourable opinion on October 14, 2021, a 56.8 million euros provision was recorded and a new statement was sent to CJEU. The Company is awaiting the decision from the CJEU.\n\nAt the 2021 year-end:\n\n- (d) 'Other long-term investment securities' includes 7,050 shares held under the liquidity contract in an amount of 1.1 million euros; .\n- (e) 'Other  long-term  investments'  mainly  includes  the  receivable  linked  to  the  refund  claim  on  the  equalization  charge  paid  for  the  years  2000  to  2004  for 9.5 million euros and the interest on arrears for 6.6 million euros.\n\n## 11.

There is therefore no isolated open position whose change in fair value would have a direct impact on the income statement.\n\n## 16. Retirement and similar plans\n\n## A. Group retirement benefit guarantee agreement\n\nIn France, Air Liquide grants additional benefits to retirees (3,370 retirees  as  of  December  31,  2021).  These  benefits  provide  a supplemental retirement income based on final pay, which is paid in addition to other normal retirement benefits. This plan is closed to  employees  under  the  age  45,  or  with  less  than  20  years  of service  as  of  January  1,  1996.  These  plans  are  unfunded.  The annual  amount  paid  with  regards  to  additional  benefits  cannot exceed  originally  12%  of  total  payroll  or,  in  some  case,  12%  of pre-tax profits of companies involved. This 12% threshold will be proportionately  reduced  by  comparing  the  number  of  plan beneficiaries  for  the  year  to  the  number  of  plan  beneficiaries  for the previous year. The additional benefit granted by Air Liquide is indexed  to  the  pension  revaluation  rates  of  normal  and supplemental retirement benefits up to a certain annuity threshold without any indexation beyond. This additional benefit was funded subsequently  to  the  article  50  of  the  law  of  January  20,  2014 securing the future and fairness of pensions plans.\n\nIn  October  2020,  the  Company  reviewed  the  billing  terms  of  the Group  retirement  benefit  guarantee  agreement  granted  to  its subsidiaries, regarding employee pension payments.\n\nThe  contributions  amounted  to  21.8  million  euros  in  2021 (20.1  million  euros  in  2020)  after  reinvoicing  subsidiaries. Excluding  the  impact  of  timelines,  and  until  the  plan  ends,  the actuarial  value  of  obligations  vis-\u00e0-vis  retirees  and  those  eligible as of December 31, 2021 amounts to 549.4 million euros.\n\nBased on the assumptions used for the valuation of the retirement obligations, an estimated 283.0 million euros will be recharged to the  subsidiaries  of  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  as  and  when  benefits  are paid to the retirees.\n\n## B. Externally funded plan\n\nL'Air  Liquide  S.A.  grants  to  employees  not  covered  by  the preceding plan (1,065 employees as of December 31, 2021) and with  at  least  one  half-year  of  service  benefit  from  an  externally funded  defined  contribution  plan.  Contributions  to  this  plan  are jointly  paid  by  the  employer  and  employee.  For  2021,  employer contributions  amounted  to  8.1  million  euros  (6.9  million  euros  in 2020).\n\n## C. Retirement termination payments and jubilees\n\nThe corresponding obligations are provided for in the amount of 28.8 million euros (net of tax) and 1.0 million euros, respectively.\n\n## D. Calculation of actuarial assumptions and methods\n\nThe  calculations  with  respect  to  the  Group's  retirement  benefit guarantee  agreement,  retirement  termination  payments  and jubilees  are  performed  by  independent  actuaries  using  the projected unit credit method.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  exceeding  the  greater  of  10%  of  the obligations  related  to  retirement  termination  payments  and unrecognized past service costs are amortized over the expected average working lives of the plan participants. As of December 31, 2021, the amounts stand at 15.8 million euros (20.8 million euros in 2020).\n\nThe  actuarial  assumptions  (turnover,  mortality,  retirement  age, salary  increase)  vary  according  to  demographic  and  economic conditions.\n\nThe  discount  rates  used  to  determine  the  present  value  of obligations  are  based  on  Government  bonds  or  High-quality Corporate bonds, with the same duration as the obligations at the valuation date (1 % as of December 31, 2021).\n\n## Statutory accounts on the parent company\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred taxes arise from timing differences between the tax regime and the accounting treatment of income and expenses. Depending on the nature of the timing differences, these deferred taxes will increase or decrease the future tax expense and are not recorded as per the French Chart of Accounts.\n\nDeferred taxes as of December 31, 2021 are estimated as follows:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                    | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Deferred tax assets (decrease in future tax expense)      | 2.7                 | 21.2                |\n| Deferred tax liabilities (increase in future tax expense) | -                   | -                   |\n\nThe deferred taxes were calculated taking into account the 3.3% social security contribution on earnings i.e. a general rate of 25.83% in 2022 and 28.41% in 2021.",

This  Statutory  Auditors'  report  includes  information  required  by European  regulation  and  French  law,  such  as  information  about  the  appointment  of  the  Statutory  Auditors  or  verification  of  the Management Report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of L' Air Liquide,\n\n## OPINION\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by  your Annual  General  Meeting,  we  have  audited  the  accompanying  Financial Statements of L'Air Liquide for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the Financial Statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## BASIS FOR OPINION\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de Commissaire aux comptes) for  the  period  from  January  1 st ,  2021  to  the  date  of  our  report,  and  specifically  we  did  not  provide  any  prohibited  non -audit  services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Financial Statements for this period have been prepared and audited under special circumstances. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the health emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties regarding their future  prospects.  Some  of  these  measures,  such  as  travel  restrictions  and  remote  working,  have  also  had  an  impact  on  companies' internal organization and on the performance of audits.\n\nIt  is  in  this  complex,  evolving  context  that,  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Articles  L.  823 -9  and  R.  823 -7  of  the  French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the Financial Statements.\n\n## Equity investments measurement\n\n## Identified risk\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2021,  the  net  book  value  of  the  equity investments  amounts  to  12,432.5  million  euros  and  represents 86,8%  of  the  total  balance  sheet.  Equity  investments  are recognized at their initial consideration, excluding acquisition costs and after considering legal reevaluation if any.\n\nAs disclosed in note '2.D. Accounting policies - Equity investments' to  the  statutory  Financial  Statements,  when  the  carrying  amount (determined  applying  the  market  multiples  method  based  on  the Group market capitalization or the estimated cash flows method or the  method of net asset value re-measured at fair value) is lower than  the  net  book  value  of  the  equity  investment,  an  impairment loss is recognized for the difference\n\nThe selection of the method used to determine the carrying amount requires significant Management judgement.\n\nDue to the significant equity investments balance and the impact of the  method  retained  to  determine  the  carrying  amount,  we  have considered  that  the  measurement  of  the  equity  investments  as  a key audit matter.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nOur procedures consisted in:\n\n- \u25a0 considering, based on information provided by Management,  the  valuation  methods  applied  by  the Company;\n- \u25a0 analyzing assumptions used to determine the re-measured net asset;\n- \u25a0 assessing  the  methodology  and  the  results  of  the  tests performed based on the Group market capitalization;\n- \u25a0 assessing the information included in notes '2.D. Accounting  policies  -  Equity  investments',  '10.  Financial assets' and '11. Impairment, allowances and provisions' to the statutory Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Previously, ERNST & YOUNG Audit, was statutory auditor of L'Air Liquide from 1983 to 2009.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the Financial Statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of Financial Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing,  as  applicable,  matters  related  to  going  concern  and  using  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  unless  it  is  expected  to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement  when  it  exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these Financial Statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823 -10 -1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  Statutory  Auditor  exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25a0 identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u25a0 obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u25a0 evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the Financial Statements;\n- \u25a0 assesses the appropriateness  of  Management's  use  of  the  going  concern  basis  of  accounting  and,  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material  uncertainty  exists,  there  is  a  requirement  to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the  Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- \u25a0 evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  Financial  Statements  and  assesses  whether  these  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## REPORT TO THE AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE\n\nWe submit to the Audit and Accounts Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also  provide  the Audit  and Accounts  Committee  with  the  declaration  provided  for  in Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  No.  537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 822 -10 to L. 822 -14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de Commissaire aux comptes). Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Accounts Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine et Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 4, 2022 The Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nFran\u00e7oise Garnier\n\nS\u00e9verine Scheer\n\nJeanne Boillet\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Guillaume Postel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Group  has  recently  reinforced  its  commitment  to  sustainable development  with  the  announcement  of  ambitious  objectives  on  March  23,  2021.  This  ambition  is  structured  around  three  pillars ( A batement, C are, T rust ACT ):\n\n## \u25a0 Act for a low-carbon society by abatement of CO2 emissions.\n\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, and to address the urgency of climate change and energy transition, Air Liquide has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with two major intermediate milestones:\n\n- -around 2025, to start reducing its CO2 emissions in absolute value;\n- -by 2035, a -33% reduction in its Scopes 1 and 2 CO2 emissions vs. 2020 (1) .\n\nThe objective of reducing carbon intensity by -30% (2) by 2025 compared with 2015 has been maintained.\n\n## \u25a0 Act for health, by caring for patients.\n\nThe Group wishes to go even further and increase its  social  commitment  by  improving  the  quality  of  life  of  patients  with  chronic conditions in mature economies and facilitating access to medical oxygen in low- and intermediate-income countries.\n\n- \u25a0 Act as a trusted partner , by engaging with employees and building a best-in-class governance.\n- The Group is committed to providing 100% of employees with access to common basis of care coverage and promoting inclusion and diversity with the aim of increasing the percentage of women among managers and professionals to 35% by 2025.\n\nIn  terms  of  corporate  governance,  the  Group,  supported  by  a  diversified  and  independent  Board  of  Directors,  will  continue  to implement best practices regarding ethics, responsible dialog and close relations with all shareholders.\n\n| ACT FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE           | ACT FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE                                                                                                                                                   | 2021               |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| ACT FOR a low-carbon society           | \u00e8 by 2035, a -33% reduction in its Scopes 1 and 2 CO2  emissions vs. 2020                                                                                                      | <+1%               |\n| ACT FOR health                         | \u00e8 by  2025  a -30% reduction in carbon intensity compared  to 2015                                                                                                             | -24% 38%           |\n|                                        | \u00e8 \u00e8 improve the quality of life of patients with chronic  diseases living at home in mature economies facilitate access to medical oxygen in low- and middle- income countries | 1,032,000  persons |\n| ACT AS A TRUSTED PARTNER,              | \u00e8 35% women managers and professionals by 2025                                                                                                                                 | 31%                |\n| with and on behalf of our stakeholders | \u00e8 100% of our employees to have common basis of care  coverage, including death and disability insurance,  healthcare and maternity leave, by 2025                             | 34%                |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The most serious risks are identified so that they can be addressed as a priority by implementing preventive, mitigating or remedial measures (page 96).\n\nThe Extra-financial Performance Declaration (EFPD), as defined in article L. 22-10-36 paragraph 1 of the French Commercial Code and published in Chapter 5 , sets out the main gross extra-financial risks for the Group and the associated mitigating policies. Some of these risks fall within the requirements of the Prospectus III Regulation and are included in the Risk Factors and Management Measures section of Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nJust like the Annual Financial Report, the Environmental and Societal reporting is reviewed each year by an independent verifier. Audits by independent verifiers conducted in 2021 covered 21% of the workforce and 22% of the Group's environmental footprint (3) .\n\nFor further information, the Group's website has a section dedicated to Sustainable Development.\n\nVisit https://www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/act-sustainable-future.",

Some of these risks also relate to criteria in  the Prospectus  III  regulation,  and  as  such  are  presented  in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document;\n- \u25a0 the  policies  and  procedures  implemented  to  prevent  and mitigate these risks (Chapter 5);\n- \u25a0 the  results  of  these  policies  and  key  performance  indicators (Chapter 5).\n\nIn the Extra-financial Performance Declaration, the main risks and stakes were identified by the Sustainable Development Department  in  partnership  with  the  Legal,  Financial,  Human Resources and Risks departments. Some of them appear in the Group's overall risks map and have been reviewed by the Board of Directors.\n\nMoreover,  in  identifying  these  risks  and  stakes, Air  Liquide  also takes into account a dual materiality perspective:\n\n- \u25a0 their  internal  impact,  i.e.  on  the  Group's  performance  and development;\n- \u25a0 their external impact taking into account the assessment of its stakeholders.\n\nIn  order  to  integrate  the  main  risks  and  opportunities  into  the Group's strategy, according to the importance given to them by the various stakeholders, Air Liquide updated the materiality matrix of its  sustainable  development  stakes  in  2020.  The  results  of  this process are presented in this chapter (page 359 and 360).\n\nIt is structured around corporate, environmental and social stakes.\n\nThrough  its  business,  commitment  and  environmental  and  social  actions,  Air  Liquide  contributes  to  reaching  certain  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) introduced by the UN to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and guarantee prosperity for all by 2030. To illustrate this contribution, initiatives by the Group - described in the EFPD - are associated with the relevant SDGs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE PROTECTS LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT\n\nMany industrial and medical gas applications protect the environment on the sites of Group's customers, and life at the homes of Group's patients. These applications accounted for over 40% of Group revenue in 2021.",

Health and safety risks\n\nHealth  and  Safety  risks  form  part  of  the  Group's  industrial  risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document, page  78),  which  are  associated  with  the  various  products, industrial processes and distribution methods in use. Air Liquide's various business lines involve more specific risks associated with products and processes, and how they are operated.\n\n## 1.1.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nSafety  is  an  integral  part  of  Air  Liquide's  operational  excellence and  culture.  The  Group  is  committed  to  effectively  and  in  all circumstances reducing the exposure of its employees, customers,  subcontractors,  suppliers  and  local  communities  to occupational  and  industrial  risks.  Commitment  to  safety  is  total, visible and accompanied by unshakable vigilance.\n\nPrevention,  protection,  early  detection  and  rapid  reaction  are  at the heart of the Group's concerns. This commitment is reiterated in  the  General  Statement  of  Air  Liquide's  Principles  of  Action. These Principles are shared with all entities and are available on the Group's website (https://www.airliquide.com/sustainabledevelopment/ethics/groups-principles-action).\n\nEvery  subsidiary  is  committed  to  achieving  the  'zero  accidents' ambition,  as  well  as  the  objective  of  continuously  improving  its safety performance.\n\n## The safety of individuals\n\nSafety  is  a  collective  commitment  and  the  responsibility  of  each individual.  Being  aware  of  dangers  and  risks,  applying  the  rules and taking care of others - all this contributes to reducing the risk of accidents and strengthening the Group's safety culture. Safety leadership  training  and  on-the-job  training  courses  are  regularly organized.  Air  Liquide's  managers  encourage  safety  efforts, demonstrate this commitment on site and reward best practices.\n\nEach  employee  and  contractor  must  be  aware  of  safety  rules, follow  them  and  intervene  each  time  there  is  a  risk  of  unsafe behavior or conditions.\n\nThe  Group  has  drawn  up Life-Saving  Rules . Given  their importance,  non-compliance  with  any  of  these  rules  by  anyone working for Air Liquide can lead to a warning, or even penalties up to and including suspension.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\nAir Liquide uses contractors within the course of its business and pays particular attention to the following:\n\n- \u25a0 assessing  the  level  of  maturity  and  performance  of  safety measures before any sales commitment is made;\n- \u25a0 including safety clauses in the contracts;\n- \u25a0 a  work  structure  with  shared,  comprehensible  and  detailed safety instructions;\n- \u25a0 communicating Air  Liquide's  safety  values  and  standards,  as well as the regulations in force that must be followed;\n- \u25a0 being as demanding and stringent with contractors as we are with Group employees;\n- \u25a0 supervising contractors' safety in the execution of services;\n- \u25a0 safety  reviews  once  the  work  is  complete  and  sharing feedback.\n\n## Road safety\n\nThe  Group's  goal  is  to  permanently  reduce  the  frequency  and severity of road accidents.\n\nIt uses the following means to achieve these goals:\n\n- \u25a0 ensuring  that  the  Group's  safety  rules  are  applied  by  all subsidiaries and service providers;\n- \u25a0 replacing the fleet with safer vehicles;\n- \u25a0 improving the safety of drivers and third parties by introducing the necessary behavioral changes through the implementation of digital alert and support technologies;\n- \u25a0 systematically  incorporating  feedback  from  the  most  serious events,  and  sharing  best  practices  with  all  of  the  Group's subsidiaries and partners;\n- \u25a0 monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of measures implemented by subsidiaries by means of dedicated audits.\n\nAccording to the region, context, current legislation and practices, all or some of the following measures are applied:\n\n- \u25a0 the  installation  of  onboard  technologies  such  as  cameras, which can detect driver  fatigue  and  distractions,  help  change driving  habits  where  necessary,  and  provide  visibility  of  the vehicle's surroundings;\n- \u25a0 increased dialog on road safety both internally as well as with service  providers  and  other  organizations  specialized  in  this subject, both locally and on an international scale. Air Liquide regularly  holds  transport  safety  discussion  and  knowledgebuilding events with its partners;\n- \u25a0 the  organization  of  special  events  to  recognize  road  safety performance and promote the sharing of best practices among subsidiaries;\n- \u25a0 initiatives  which lead to a change in behavior to implement a dynamic culture  of  road  safety  among Air  Liquide  employees and employees of the Group's contractors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  draws  on  Air  Liquide's Industrial Management System (IMS) and requires:\n\n- \u25a0 the identification of specific industrial risks for each business;\n- \u25a0 knowledge of scenarios and their potential consequences;\n- \u25a0 the  implementation  of  appropriate  preventive  and  protective safety measures for each of these risks;\n- \u25a0 the  monitoring  and  analysis  of  risks  relating to new technologies and events arising within the profession;\n- \u25a0 feedback to facilitate learning, awareness-raising, the promotion of a safety culture and to improve prevention.\n\nSince its launch 16 years ago, the IMS has significantly changed and improved the way in which industrial activities are managed. Thanks  to  employees'  commitment  to  safety,  environmental protection  and  reliability,  this  system  helps  us  strive  towards operational  excellence.  Its  implementation  is  regularly  assessed by specific IMS internal audits.\n\nAs  the  Group's  businesses  grow,  so  do  the  demands  of  its customers and their commitment to corporate social responsibility, bringing with them new challenges and opportunities. Building on the experience acquired, a project was therefore launched in 2018 to  adapt  the  IMS.  While  maintaining  the  strong  fundamentals established  since  2005,  the  protocol  was  simplified,  roles  and responsibilities  made  clearer  and  governance  strengthened, making the IMS easier to apply to daily operations and therefore even more efficient.\n\nNew tools, some of which are digital, have been made available to the operating entities. The roll-out to all of the Group's businesses began in 2020 and will continue until late 2022.\n\n## 1.1.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  3  'Good  health and well-being' and 8 'Decent work and economic growth'.\n\nThe year was once again marked by the covid-19 pandemic. As business resumed and people returned to the workplace after the partial  lockdown  in  2020  in  some  regions,  the  lost-time  accident frequency rate for Air Liquide employees increased slightly to 1.1 at the end of 2021, compared with 0.9 at the end of 2020. Despite this deterioration from the previous year, safety performance was still better than in 2019, when the lost-time accident frequency rate for Air Liquide employees was 1.2. It is therefore vital to continue with  awareness  campaigns  and  preventive  action  to  improve safety  and  significantly  reduce  the  lost-time  accident  frequency rate over the long term.\n\nIn  2021,  there  were  four  contractors  fatalities  at  the  Group's industrial sites.\n\nThe Group has made - and will continue to make - every effort to analyze all accidents and draw lessons from them to thus prevent them from recurring.\n\nLOST-TIME ACCIDENT FREQUENCY RATE AMONG AIR LIQUIDE EMPLOYEES (a) (b)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Number of lost-time accidents with at least one lost day per million hours worked by Group employees.\n- (b) Including Airgas since 2017.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  was partly  due  to  the  lockdown  in  many  parts  of  the  world  in  2020, which temporarily reduced road traffic and had a positive impact on  the  Group's  road  safety  statistics.  Nevertheless,  the  accident frequency rate (number of serious road accidents with injury per million kilometers) in 2021 was still below that of 2019.\n\nIn 2021, there were no road accident fatalities among Air Liquide employees  or  subcontractors.  By  contrast,  several  accidents involving an Air Liquide vehicle, some of which could have been avoided, unfortunately resulted in the death of a third party.\n\nAn  analysis  of  road  accidents  in  recent  years  has  revealed  a number of recurring  causes,  such  as  fatigue  or  distraction  while driving.  For  this  reason,  Air  Liquide  has  launched  some  key initiatives to support changes in driver behavior and promote the use of digital  driver-assistance  technologies,  which  will  gradually lead  to  improvements  in  road  transport  safety.  Despite  the covid-19 pandemic, those initiatives are still being rolled out.\n\n## 1.2.   HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT\n\n## 1.2.1.  Human Resources management related risks\n\nHuman  Resources  management  related  risks  are  part  of  the Group's  business  related  risks  (described  in  Chapter  2  of  this Universal Registration Document, page 81). Working arrangements in an international group like Air Liquide need to be able  to  adapt  to  a  constantly  changing  world  so  that  employees can  operate  in  a  safe,  high-quality  working  environment  and contribute to the Group's sustainable growth.\n\nThe long-term performance of Air Liquide is driven, in particular, by the quality of its employees, their skills and their commitment.\n\nIn its businesses, the Group is therefore exposed to the risk of not being able to:\n\n- \u25a0 attract and maintain the required skills at the right time and in the  right  place,  in  particular  in  emerging  countries  where  the Group  is  expanding  its  activities,  or  in  regions  where  the employment market is strained;\n- \u25a0 develop these skills, in particular with the digitization of certain businesses.\n\nIn  addition  to  risks  relating  to  skills  management,  psycho-social risks may also affect the health and level of commitment of Group employees, in particular in the recent context where working from home has been rapidly implemented.\n\nLastly,  although  all  Air  Liquide  employees  have  social  security coverage  that  complies  with  local  regulations,  there  are  still disparities between  countries  that  could  potentially create inequitable situations within the Group.  Furthermore,  local standards  may  not,  in  some  cases,  be  enough  to  provide adequate and fair social protection for employees.\n\n## 1.2.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nThe  Group  is  committed  to  identify,  attract  and  develop  the necessary  scientific,  technical  and  digital  skills  required  for  its growth, the efficient working of its operations and innovation. The Human Resources policy defines the main rules, together with the roles and  responsibilities of the different parties in their implementation, with respect to, among others:\n\n- \u25a0 acquisition and sustainability of the necessary skills. Training is provided under the Air Liquide University brand. It is part of a structured  program  and  is  managed  by  a  specific  learning management system (LMS: Learning Management System);\n- \u25a0 supporting employees in their personal development throughout  their  career,  particularly  with  a  centralized  career and  skills management  tool  (TMS:  Talent  Management System)  and  the  communication  of  career  advancement opportunities (TAS: Talent Acquisition System);\n- \u25a0 changes  in  working  methods  within  the  Company.  The organization of work must therefore not only meet the demands and expectations of today's employees and the Company, but also  those  of  tomorrow,  while  being  based  on  the  Group's fundamentals.  The  result  of  a  co-creation  bringing  together more than 700 employees, the Group thus deployed in 2020 its new BeActEngage model,  which  allows  its  employees  to develop in a safe, ethical and engaging environment to deliver sustainable performance;\n- \u25a0 measuring  and  recognizing  performance  and  contributions  of all  employees.  In  addition  to  employee  remuneration  and loyalty policies (regular capital increases reserved for employees),  specific  provisions  aimed  at  promoting  and sustaining  certain  skills,  such  as  inventor  and  entrepreneur recognition programs, and the technical expertise development scheme  (Technical  Community  Leaders)  in  a  wide  range  of fields such as industrial operations, industrial safety and, more recently, digital and IT since 2019.\n\nThe  Group  ensures  the  building  of  a  performance-focused, attractive  and  collaborative  professional  environment  while  also safeguarding  the  health  and  well-being  of  employees  in  the workplace.\n\nThe growth in working from home has increased the use of digital tools to ensure business continuity. Within the context of changes to the Group's organizational models, which were accelerated by the  covid-19  pandemic, Air  Liquide  launched  a  global  project  in 2020 called 'Next Normal' to support this shift in working methods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

First  shared  with  managers,  the  guide helps  the  entities  to  set  up  new  working  methods  based  on  the initial global experience. Working groups were then organized with employees in the entities to validate the commitments.\n\nFocus groups have been set up aiming at promoting the work-life balance of employees to strengthen their occupational well-being. This approach meets employees' expectations on this subject.\n\nThese practices were incorporated into principles that were jointly developed  with  European  social  partners.  In  2019,  the  Group partnered with the European Works Council to develop the 'Care and Perform' initiative, whose purpose is to prevent psychosocial risks. This led to the creation of a charter based on principles of action linked to improvements in work scheduling, workloads and work-life  balance.  The  content  of  this  charter  facilitated  the conclusion of company agreements with social partners in order to offer new services to employees.\n\n## 1.2.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 'Good health and well-being' and 8 'Decent work and economic growth'.\n\nAs part of the sustainability objectives announced in March 2021, Air  Liquide's  aim  is  to  ACT  to  build  trust  by  engaging  with employees.  The  Group  has  therefore  committed  to  offering  a common basis of care coverage to all employees by 2025.\n\nThis common basis of care coverage guarantees:\n\n- \u25a0 an  insurance  with  a  compensation  equivalent  to  one  year's salary in the event of death;\n- \u25a0 healthcare that includes inpatient and outpatient care;\n- \u25a0 a minimum of 14 weeks paid maternity leave.\n\nFrom May to September 2021, entities were grouped by country so  that  gaps  in  their  current  coverage  could  be  assessed  and  a plan devised to phase in upgrades by 2025.\n\nIn  2021,  the  percentage  of  employees  benefiting  from  this common basis of care coverage is 34%.\n\nA  special  team  was  set  up  within  the  Human  Resources department  to  oversee  the  plan's  roll-out  and  measure  progress within the Group on an annual basis.\n\nAir Liquide University has reinforced its offer of online learning ('elearning') used by a growing number of users (more than 62,000 in  2021)  in  a  wide  variety  of  fields  (ethics,  industrial  safety, competition law, digital safety, management, etc.).\n\nIn  2021, amidst the pandemic crisis, the digital transformation of many  business  lines  and  increased  training  for  employees,  the University has once again launched two virtual campuses open to the entire Group, which revolve around four themes: Management &  Leadership,  Sales  &  Marketing,  Operational  Excellence, Innovation,  Climate  &  Energy  Transition  and  HR  professionals. This has resulted in 6,401 employees logged in to over 240 online sessions:  webinars,  virtual  classes,  online  lessons  and  learning paths. These events have, firstly, promoted interactions within the Group with participants from 69 countries and, secondly, revealed employees' creative and teaching abilities: most sessions were led by Company executives and a challenge for creating tutorials was held.\n\nIn  2019,  the  Group  launched  a  commitment  and  measuring monitoring  program,  MyVoice. This  program  aims  to  assess  and improve  the  experience  and  well-being  of  employees  within  the Group. It is based on a simple concept: listen, understand and act. Employee feedback is collected each year throughout the Group to  better  understand  their  expectations,  identify  and  implement appropriate actions and thus significantly improve their commitment. This level of attention to the employee experience is a key factor in attracting, retaining and developing employees. The response rate for the 2021 commitment survey was 83%.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  committed  to  meaningful  social  dialog  in  all  of  its subsidiaries.  This  comes  in  different  forms  according  to  local regulations.  In  2021,  82%  of  Group  employees  had  access  to  a representation, dialog or consultation structure.\n\nThe  performance  review  meeting  is  a  key  stage  in  employee development, as it facilitates a discussion between the employee and  their  manager  on  performance  and  development,  the assessment  and  setting  objectives  for  the  year  ahead.  In  2021, 83% of Group employees had a performance review meeting with their immediate supervisor.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over recent months, a crisis unit has met every week under the authority of the Group's Human Resources Director, producing various protocols for use by all entities, some of which are shown here by way of illustration:\n\n- \u25a0 covid-19: Recommendations and Business Continuity Plan;\n- \u25a0 procedure for handling employees who test positive within a critical production entity;\n- \u25a0 Human Resources - How to respond when an employee tests positive for covid-19 ?\n\nTo facilitate  the  purchase  of  personal  protection  masks  and  other  products  required  for  entities'  business  activities,  a  number  of teams have been assigned the task of specifying requirements and then procuring resources. These ad-hoc structures, with the support of the Group's Procurement Department, have provided a response to subsidiaries' needs.\n\nManagers and executives have worked closely with teams via regular online team meetings (face to face where possible or, failing that,  virtually)  and  discussions  with  employee  representatives. Air  Liquide  has  also  introduced  measures  such  as  listening  and support phone hotlines, giving employees an opportunity to share their feelings and prevent exhaustion and disengagement during lockdown.\n\nConsistent Group-wide human resources policies and principles have been introduced during the pandemic. However, Air Liquide rules  do  not  replace  the  legal  obligations  and  measures  in  force  in  each  country.  In  addition,  the  Group  has  not  applied  for government assistance in France (partial unemployment, payment terms, etc.).\n\nLastly,  throughout  the  year,  teams  in  the  Group's  Healthcare  business  line  continued  to  make  every  effort  to  supply  life-saving medical gases and make available the equipment needed to maintain continuity of supply.\n\n## 1.3.   DISCRIMINATION\n\n## 1.3.1.  Risks associated with discrimination\n\nDiversity  is  a  priority  of Air  Liquide's  Human  Resources  strategy and  policy  and  the  Group  considers  it  a  source  of  strength, creativity  and  performance.  It  is  a  fundamental  element  of  the organization,  in  terms  of  both  businesses  and  employees,  and drives the Group's long-term performance.\n\nThe discrimination risk is part of the Environment and Society risks (described  in  Chapter  2  of  this  Universal  Registration  Document on page 86).\n\nAir Liquide carries out activities with high technological content in a  large  number  of  countries  with  different  cultures.  The  Group's objective  in  this  regard  is  to  have  teams  comprising  employees who represent the environment in which they operate. Each entity is  therefore  responsible for implementing action plans specific to its  own  environment  and  legal  framework,  which  may  include many forms of diversity (skin color, disability, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, etc.).\n\nDiscrimination-related issues, particularly concerning  gender diversity  (gender  disparities,  particularly  in  technical  or  expert professions),  disability  and  age  could  affect  employees  of  the Group or of its partners.\n\n## 1.3.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nThe  objective  at  a  Group  level  is  to  increase  diversity  among managerial staff to better recognize the various cultures that make up  Air  Liquide  and  to  improve  gender  equality.  In  this  respect, quantified  gender  equality  targets  have  been  set  for  the  Group. The  local  entities  took  an  inventory  of  the  current  situation  to define an objective at the level of the clusters and thus contribute to the overall objective.\n\nWithin the Human Resources organization, a team leads diversity projects. The Group's roadmap is based on three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 deploy  diversity  objectives  at  all  entities  and  implement corresponding action plans;\n- \u25a0 improve  all  of  the  Group's  Human  Resources  processes  to reduce any bias and avoid all forms of discrimination;\n- \u25a0 promote an inclusive culture to leverage the diversity of teams.\n\nEach  hub  and  business  then  implements  its  own  roadmap  and diversity  actions  with  consideration  of  its  own  situation.  In  this context,  they  analyze  processes  and  practices,  identify  potential biases  and  implement  corrective  measures  ('nudges')  to  limit these biases. Thus, during the regular reviews of talents with high potential,  the  diversity  of  profiles  is  taken  into  account,  with  the aim  of  continuing  to  increase  diversity  in  the  Group's  key positions. This also serves as a way to promote the many cultures that make up the Group, and to strengthen gender equality.\n\nThrough its diversity policy, Air  Liquide  is  therefore  committed  to combating all forms of discrimination.\n\n## 1.3.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group aim to contribute to the UN Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDG)  5  'Gender  equality'  and 10 'Reduced inequalities'.\n\nIn 2021, Air Liquide employed 66,436 staff in 75 countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  objectives  are  in  line  with  the  results  obtained over the past ten years, which have seen the share of female 'Managers and Professionals' within the Group increase from 26% to 31%;\n- \u25a0 25% of executive positions (senior executives) held by women by 2025.\n\nThe  ambitious  gender  diversity  objectives  set  for  the  'Managers and  Professionals'  and  'senior  executives'  population,  and  for maintaining  the  gender  diversity  goal  among  the  Group's  'high potentials,'  are  also  intended  to  form  a  talent  pool  to  ensure balanced  gender  representation  on  the  Executive  Committee  by promoting  female  talents  to  higher  levels  of  management. Moreover, in view of the new obligations laid down by the \"Rixain\" Law of December 24, 2021, the Group is also aligning its gender equality  objectives  with  regard  to  the  Executive  Committee  with those of the Law, i.e. 30% of women by March 1, 2026.\n\nIn  2021,  women  represented  46%  of  employees  considered  as high  performers,  this  level  has  been  increasing  regularly  for  a number  of  years  and  must  be  maintained.  The  Executive Committee includes five women among its fifteen members. Three of these were appointed in 2019, having previously held executive positions within the Group. Six women are currently members of the Board of Directors of L'Air Liquide S.A., out of a total of eleven members appointed by the General Meeting.\n\nMore  generally,  and  taking  the  highest  level  of  responsibilities across the Group into account, women hold 24% of all positions defined as 'senior executives,' over and above the goals set by the  Board  of  Directors  for  2021.  This  latter  percentage  has increased from 19% to 24% over the last three years.\n\nAmong  the  10%  of  positions  with  the  greatest  level  of responsibility  within  the  Company,  29%  of  them  are  held  by women; these women have an average age of 51.6 years and a median  age  of  51.3  years,  i.e.  2.9  years  and  3.7  years  less respectively  than  the  average  age  (54.5  years)  and  median  age (55 years) for men. This difference is due to the policy to promote women  to  the  highest  levels  of  responsibility  earlier  on  in  their careers, and therefore eliminate career development discrepancies that occur in the absence of proactive measures in this area.\n\nFinally, the promotion of an inclusive culture also contributes to a sustainable  approach  to  diversity.  Numerous  initiatives  are deployed  within  the  Group  to  this  end:  events,  learning opportunities,  mentoring,  networks  and  communities  for  different interest groups such as women's careers. One recent example is the  creation  in  2021  of  a  movement  for  inclusion  which  is  a development  opportunity  for  committed  employees.  For  seven months, 220 of these 'Inclusion & Diversity enthusiasts' designed and  carried  out  experiments  across  the  Group  using  innovative methods to promote inclusion in the work environment. These new approaches  are  disseminated  throughout  the  organization  in  a spirit of continuous improvement.\n\n| 2025 Objectives                                                       | 2025 Objectives   | 2021 Results                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 35% women among Group managers and professionals.                     | 31%               | women among Group managers  and professionals.                     |\n| 25% women at the highest level of responsibility (senior executives). | 24%               | women at the highest level of responsibility  (senior executives). |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Professional  Equality  Index  and  five related indicators must also be made available to the Social and Economic Committee and transmitted to the Labor administration.\n\nIn 2021, the Group's 31 companies with at least 50 employees in France  were  audited.  Their  average  Gender  Equality  Index  is 86.5/100,  maintaining  performance  at  a  high  level  compared  to 2020  and  2019.  The  company  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  published  its fourth annual Professional Equality Index, which reached 97/100.\n\nOutside  of  France,  the  Group  initiated  a  common  process  to assess the gender pay gap by creating an internal index based on the  French  index  but  tailored  to Air  Liquide's  global  presence.  It was deployed for the first time in 2019 for entities with more than 400 employees. The 2020 index, calculated in 2021, was 82/100 based on 61% coverage of the Group's employees.\n\nThis index is calculated on the basis of four criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 differences  in  remuneration,  calculated  for  job  position categories;\n- \u25a0 differences in salary raise percentages;\n- \u25a0 salary raises during maternity leave;\n- \u25a0 gender diversity among the 10 highest remunerations.\n\nThe  calculation  method  evolved  in  2020  to  provide  more granularity  by  taking  into  account  the  job  position  category (according  to  international  standards  such  as  the  Hay  method). The  subsidiaries  are  progressively  identifying  job  positions according to these standards to allow for a better comparison at the Group level and thus increase staff coverage.\n\n## Age\n\n## DISTRIBUTION OF EMPLOYEES BY AGE BRACKET IN 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group  is  committed  to  fostering  better  qualifications  and training  programs  for  young  people  to  facilitate  their  integration into the workplace.\n\nInternship  and  apprenticeship  contracts  are  encouraged  by  the Group.  In  France,  542  young  people  have  benefited  from  workstudy contracts and 478 from an internship, combining theoretical learning at their university or school and a practical internship at Air Liquide.\n\nSeniors  will  represent  an  increasing  share  of  Air  Liquide employees  in  the  coming  years.  Their  contribution  to  mentoring programs  (notably  the  Technical  Community  Leaders  program), and training programs aimed at younger generations will be further promoted.\n\nVarious  initiatives  have  been  introduced  within  the  Group  to ensure  the  support  and  engagement  of  employees  nearing retirement age. For example, in France:\n\n- \u25a0 24 people became skills sponsors following the pilot launched in France in 2018;\n- \u25a0 'Youth-employment  contracts'  were  continued.  They  include initiatives promoting the hiring and retention of older employees.\n\nInternational  exchange  programs  are  in  place  to  attract  and develop young talents: ALLEX programs for executives and EVE for  technicians  (those  programs  include  more  than  550  people since they were first created).\n\n## 2025 Objectives\n\n33%\n\n22% (a)\n\nyoung graduates among managers and professional recruitments.\n\n## 2021 Results\n\nyoung graduates among managers and professional recruitments.\n\n- (a) Indicator calculated annually.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  slogan  carries  a strong  conviction. The  inclusion  of  disabilities  is  fully  in  line  with the policy to promote diversity within Air Liquide.\n\nThis  desire  is  not  new,  it  has  been  embodied  since  2007  in successive agreements in France which have advanced the policy of welcoming,  maintaining  and  promoting  the  professional development of people with disabilities. Air Liquide is committed to finding  solutions  to  integrate  disabled  people  in  the  workplace. The  following  adjustments  are  planned  to  accommodate  for disabilities in the workplace:\n\n- \u25a0 ergonomic  studies  and  adaptation  of  the  workstation  with regard to the capacities of the person;\n- \u25a0 specific equipment and tools;\n- \u25a0 adaptation of methods of access to work premises and specific training services;\n- \u25a0 transportation and moving assistance.\n\nAir  Liquide  makes  teams  aware  of  the  inclusion  of  disabilities  in order  to  facilitate  the  reception  and  professional  integration  of workers with disabilities in the Company. The French subsidiaries have awareness-raising plans in order to strengthen the level of information  for  all  players  and  fight  against  any  prejudices  that may persist. They participate in particular in DuoDay, a day where they  welcome  a  person  with  a  disability  paired  with  a  volunteer professional.\n\n## 2. Environmental stakes\n\n## 2.1.   CLIMATE (GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS)\n\n## 2.1.1.  Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nAir Liquide acknowledges the importance and urgency of climate issues. The Group intends to play an active role in achieving the targets set out in the Paris Agreement, which defines a global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C compared with the pre-industrial level, and by continuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C. In this regard, the Group has made a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This long-term objective is supported by two major intermediate milestones: the start of reduction of absolute CO2 emissions around 2025, followed by a -33% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2035 compared with a market-based (1) 2020 baseline. Moreover, the Group has maintained the objective set in 2018 to reduce its carbon intensity (2) by -30% by 2025 compared with 2015.\n\nWithin  a  scope  covering  around  5,500  employees  based  in France,  a  fifth  Disability  agreement  for  a  period  of  three  years (2020-2022)  was  signed  at  the  end  of  2019.  The  aim  of  this agreement is to continue with measures already implemented in favor of people with disabilities and thus further improve the direct employment rate to reach 4.2% in 2022 vs. 3.3% in 2018. In 2020, the rate was 4.35% (the rate for 2021 is still being determined).\n\nMore broadly  in  Europe,  other  concrete  actions  are  also  carried out  to  better  respond  to  ideas  in  the  field  and  accelerate  the recruitment  dynamic:  ambassador campaign, working group with managers, European 'Time to Act' hackathon in November 2021.\n\n## Nationality\n\nThere  are  35  different  nationalities  among  Air  Liquide's  senior managers.  The  Group's  Board  of  Directors  comprises  five nationalities. In terms of total employees, more than 140 different nationalities are employed by the Group.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF EMPLOYEES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Climate risk (greenhouse gas emissions)\n\nClimate risk (greenhouse  gas  emissions)  is  part  of  the Environment  and  Society  risks  (described  in  Chapter  2  of  this Universal Registration Document on page 86).\n\nAlmost  85%  of  Air  Liquide's  large  production  units  are  Air Separation  Units,  which  do  not  use  any  combustion  processes and consume almost exclusively electrical energy. Electricity used by  the  Group  to  power  these  units  generates  CO2  emissions  at electricity  suppliers,  and  are  classified  as  indirect  or  Scope  2 emissions.\n\nThe  Group's  two  other  main  energy  consuming  activities  are hydrogen production and co-generation. These account for nearly 15%  of  large  production  units  and  use  combustion  processes emitting CO \u2082 , known as direct emissions - Scope 1.\n\nAir  Liquide's  business  model  is  based  on  the  outsourcing  of  the industrial  gases  needs  of  its  customers  who  often  emit  large quantities  of  greenhouse  gases,  in  particular  in  the  metals, chemicals and refining industries. This outsourcing is justified by Air  Liquide's  expertise  which  allows  them to optimize the energy consumption  of  production  tools  and  favor  low-carbon  energy procurement. However, it leads to the transfer of a portion of the customer's greenhouse gas emissions to the Group.\n\nIn the interests of defining and developing mitigation measures for this  risk, Air  Liquide  has worked upstream to define scenarios to assess the impact of this risk on its activities.\n\n## SCENARIOS FOR AIR LIQUIDE'S CLIMATE STRATEGY\n\nIn order to develop and manage the achievement of its Climate Objectives, Air Liquide draws on scenarios which allows it to:\n\n- \u25a0 plan its activities and assets in a variety of prospective scenarios to guarantee the Group's resilience going forward and feed its strategy;\n- \u25a0 develop an economic growth strategy which incorporates a reduction in the Group's emissions in line with trajectories that are compatible with the Paris Agreement;\n- \u25a0 analyze the possible impact of public greenhouse gas emission reduction policies on the Group, as well as any dependence of the Group's carbon trajectory on these policies, in particular those aimed at making the energy sector and end markets carbonfree;\n- \u25a0 manage the Group's carbon trajectory by monitoring, notably, the impact of new investments made on the carbon footprint.\n- As the Group's activities  are  global  and  cover  a  wide-range  of  sectors, Air  Liquide  relies  on  various  sources  to  develop  these analyses. The main sources on which the Group's analyses rely include work by the Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) based on the findings of climate science and that of the International Energy Agency relating to Air Liquide's scenarios.\n\n## CLIMATE PROTECTION INITIATIVES\n\nPreparation of the Science Based Targets commitment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  July  2019,  the  Group  joined  the  Science  Based  Targets  (SBT)  initiative,  a certification  created  by  a  coalition  of  stakeholders  committed  to  environmental issues.\n\nThe Science Based Targets initiative provides companies with a methodology for setting  a  GHG  emissions  reduction  objective  based  on  climate  science  and  in line with a well below 2\u00b0C scenario or a 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nHowever as of today, there is no sectoral approach specific either to the chemicals sector in general or to Air Liquide's activities, which is different in that it serves a wide variety of sectors of the economy. Air Liquide is continuing its discussions with the SBT initiative and other stakeholders so it can continue to contribute to the development of methodologies for the chemical and industrial gases sector, and enhance the value of its climate protection actions, both in terms of its own emissions and the resulting carbon benefits to its customers. In November 2021 the Group submitted an application to SBT for the validation of its Climate Objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Policy and procedures\n\nTo reinforce the Climate Objectives announced in November 2018 which  set  the  framework  under  which  the  Group  takes  active measures for the climate in its operations, with its customers and ecosystems by offering low -carbon solutions, Air Liquide announced new sustainable development objectives on March 23, 2021. In line with the Paris Agreement, and to face the urgency of taking  climate  change  and  energy  transition  into  account, Air Liquide has shown its commitment by setting itself the ambition of achieving carbon  neutrality by 2050, with two major intermediate milestones:\n\n- \u25a0 the start of reduction of absolute CO2 emissions around 2025;\n- \u25a0 a -33% reduction in Scopes 1 and 2 CO2 emissions (3) by 2035, compared with a 'market-base' (4) 2020 baseline.\n\nThe  objective  of  reducing  carbon  intensity  by  -30%  by  2025 relative to 2015 (5) emissions has been maintained.\n\nThe monitoring and achievement of these objectives rely on:\n\n- \u25a0 the internal greenhouse gas emissions procedure, which sets out  the  monitoring  of  current  greenhouse  gas  emission regulatory obligations with which the Group must comply; the methodology for calculating Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, as well as the reporting scope and frequency;\n- \u25a0 a review of investment decisions, taking climate factors - and in  particular  a  CO2  price  -  into  consideration,  along  with  an analysis of the opportunities and risks associated with climate transition.  For  all  its  projects,  for  all  geographies,  even  these without  a  current  price  for  CO2,  Air  Liquide  includes  in  its investment  decision  process  a  carbon  price  of  50  euros  per tonne,  the  local  current  price  and  a  high  value  of  at  least 100 euros per tonne, chosen in function of the geography and context;\n- \u25a0 the assumption of the introduction, in the regions in which the Group  operates,  of  public  policies  aimed  at  stepping  up  the transition toward a low-carbon economy that are in line with a 'well below 2\u00b0C' trajectory.\n\n## 2.1.4.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7 'Affordable and clean  energy,'  9  'Industry,  innovation  and  infrastructure,'  11  'Sustainable  cities  and  communities,'  13  'Climate  action,'  and  17 'Partnerships for the goals'.\n\nIn 2021, Air Liquide's reduction of absolute CO2-equivalent emissions and carbon intensity performance is represented below:\n\n## Reduce our absolute CO 2 -equivalent emissions (a) by 33% by 2035, based on 2020 emissions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2035 Objective -33%\n\n- (a) All absolute emissions figures in Million Tonnes of CO2-equivalent Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, in a \"market-based\" methodology, (see definition of the Scopes in paragraph 2.1.1 of Extra-financial Performance Declaration, page 329, and methodology for calculating the Scopes in paragraph 2.3.4 of the Annual Reporting section of chapter 5, pages 386 and 387).\n- (b) 2020 baseline restated to include 2020 emissions from new units acquired from customers, in particular the ones from the new units acquired from Sasol on June 24, 2021.\n- (c) 2021 emissions restated to include in the 2021 emissions figures the emissions from newly acquired units for a full 12-month period, in order to provide a figure comparable to the restated 2020 baseline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, given the ambitious decarbonization plan of the Group, including for the Sasol project, this does not compromise the -30% intensity reduction objective to reach a carbon intensity of 5.1 (market-based methodology) by 2025 vs. 2015 baseline.\n\nIn  March 2021, Air Liquide stepped up its climate ambition following on from the one announced in 2018 that was based on a -30% reduction in carbon intensity by 2025 (relative to 2015). That strategy, defined in 2018, involved identifying ways to decarbonize assets to meet quantitative objectives.\n\nDue to several factors (takeover of Sasol's air separation units in South Africa in mid-2021 and a change in the method for calculating indirect emissions related to purchases of electricity and steam), the objectives set under the 2018 strategy are no longer appropriate for meeting the new goal to reduce CO2 emissions in absolute terms while still meeting the targeted -30% reduction in carbon intensity by 2025 compared to 2015. Therefore, those objectives are no longer presented as in previous years.\n\nHowever, the drivers identified for decarbonizing the Group's assets are still relevant and are presented below. The Group continues to measure, monitor and report on the performance of related indicators as well as new indicators.\n\nAir Liquide is committed to a low-carbon society and applies these drivers to its assets across its ecosystems, for and on behalf of its customers.",

A  life  cycle  analysis highlighted the fact that the environmental cost relating to the CO \u2082 emissions associated with this hydrogen production is largely offset  by  the  benefit  relating  to  the  elimination  of  acid  rain  and  the  decrease  in  respiratory  diseases.

This assessment made it possible to calculate the impacts of the different desulfurization processes.\n\nThe Group relies on this approach to:\n\n- \u25a0 assess and take account of environmental impacts when designing technologies, products and offers;\n- \u25a0 maintain and enrich its stakeholder interactions by proposing sustainable solutions to customers and suppliers;\n- \u25a0 improve  the  efficiency  of  its  processes,  rethink  the  production  chain  and  make  the  best  long-term  strategic  choices  for  its investments.\n\n## Climate and Energy Transition Training\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn April 2021, Air Liquide University launched 'Climate & Energy Transition OnBoarding.'  The  objective  is  to  share  the  Group's  vision  and  impart  knowledge and  behaviors  that  will  ensure  resilience  and  safeguard  growth  opportunities associated with climate and energy transition. On-boarding topics cover climate, customers and technology. Since the program's launch, more than 1,403 employees have participated in at least one session.\n\n## Working together to achieve Climate Objectives\n\nSince  the  announcement  of  its  Climate  Objectives  at  the  end  of 2018,  Air  Liquide  set  up  a  dedicated  in-house  organizational structure.  The  announcement  of  these  objectives  and  the associated  action  plan  have  proven  to  be  factors  that  drive engagement among Group employees and were further boosted by the announcement of new objectives in March 2021.\n\n## Climate Champions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPresent  within  each  cluster  (group  of  countries), Climate  Champions  are  responsible  for  managing the  Group's  CO2  emissions  reduction  objectives. The  Climate  Champions  are  the  Sustainable Development  Department's  point  of  contact  in  the clusters (group of countries).\n\nThey coordinate the development of a roadmap that defines all the operational  measures  required  to  achieve  the  objectives.  Their role  includes  monitoring  KPIs,  rolling  out  projects  and  reporting progress.\n\n## Healthcare ESG Champions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntroduced in July 2021, Healthcare ESG (Environmental Social Governance) Champions are present  within  the  Group's  various  Healthcare entities.\n\nAt entities in mature  markets,  they  are  responsible for implementing and monitoring projects to improve the quality of life at  home  of  patients  with  chronic  conditions,  through  specific measures  such  as  the  development  of  initiatives  in  partnership with patient associations, professionals and healthcare institutions, and the introduction of customized care pathways.\n\nIn lowto moderate-income countries, Healthcare ESG Champions are responsible for projects associated with facilitating access to medical oxygen.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Climate (physical impact on operations)\n\nThis risk is part of the Environment and Society risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document on page 86).\n\nAir  Liquide  operates  in  certain  regions  of  the  world  exposed  to changes (in amplitude or frequency) in exceptional meteorological phenomena due to climate change. These phenomena can slow down  or  interrupt  the  Group's  operations  or  make  them  more expensive.  Its  suppliers  and  customers  are  also  confronted  with this same issue.\n\nThese can be broken down into:\n\n- \u25a0 acute risks triggered by events such as natural disasters, the frequency  and  severity  of  which  are  increasing:  storms, hurricanes, flooding, etc. These risks may relate to Air Liquide sites located near the coast for example, or in regions affected by hurricanes (the Gulf Coast, South Asia, etc.);\n- \u25a0 chronic  risks  related  to  more  long-term  changes  in  climate models and rising temperatures: rising sea levels, chronic heat waves in  certain  regions,  changes  in  rainfall  patterns  and  an increase  in  their  variability,  the  disappearance  of  certain resources, etc.\n\n## 2.2.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nPhysical  risks  (water  availability,  frequency  of  extreme  events, etc.)  are  appraised  during  the  review  of  investment  requests,  in the same way as financial criteria, to ensure that the associated risk  management  measures  are  adapted,  for  example  in  the design of equipment.\n\nIn addition, Group operations which are regularly exposed to the acute  risks  described  above  have  risk  management  systems  in place aimed at adopting suitable preventive operational measures and  at  managing  these  crises  by,  first  and  foremost,  protecting individuals  and  the  production  facilities  in  close  cooperation  with customers. These systems are regularly updated and improved.\n\nChronic risks are taken into account, in particular in the design of production units, in the same way and to the same extent as their energy efficiency and carbon footprint.\n\nThese risks, like the other climate risks described in this section, are  taken  into  account  in  the  preparation  of  the  Financial Statements (paragraph 'Use of estimates and assumptions' of the accounting  principles  and  Note  32  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements (Chapter 4), page 235 and 287 respectively).\n\n## 2.2.3. Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9 'Industry, innovation and infrastructure,' 12 'Responsible consumption and production' and  13  'Take  urgent  action  to  combat  climate  change  and  its impacts.'\n\nThe  Group  brought  together  a  group  of  internal  experts  who,  in partnership with external stakeholders, carried out an analysis of risks triggered by climate change based on the work of the IPCC. As part of this work, the first  pilot  projects  were  launched  at  the Group's  sites  to  improve  the  understanding  of  risk  analysis  and management tools.\n\n## 2.3.   WATER MANAGEMENT\n\n## 2.3.1.  Water management risk\n\nThe  Group  depends  on  water  for  its  activities.  Its  water consumption is related to the loss of water by evaporation in the process  of  cooling  rotating machines,  particularly for the production of air gases, or its use as a raw material for products such as hydrogen.\n\nAir  Liquide  pays  particular  attention  to  water  management, especially in areas of water stress. The main water management risk for Air Liquide's activities is the possible lack of availability of water  which  could  result  in  a  slowdown  or  shutdown  of  a production unit. Moreover, Air Liquide integrates the risks for other stakeholders in its water management. The management of water in  its  activities  can  have  two  main  types of impact on people (1) related to the withdrawal and use of water on the sites where the Group operates, or (2) related to the quality of water returned to ecosystems after use, as set out in Chapter 2, Section 4.1.2 of the Vigilance Plan (page 111).\n\n## 2.3.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nTo manage the risks associated with water withdrawal and use as well  as  the  quality  of  the  water  returned  to  ecosystems,  a  water management policy was published in the BlueBook in 2021 and will be rolled out within the Group in 2022.\n\nThis policy identifies the impact of Air Liquide's activities on water availability  and  quality.  The  policy  defines  the  principles  of  risk management based on a specific assessment of the situation at each  site.  Finally,  it  describes  the  actions  to  be  implemented  to ensure appropriate water management.\n\n## WATER MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\n\nThe Group's objectives in terms of water management were defined for the first time in 2021. They include:\n\n- \u25a0 implementing a documented water management plan by 2025 aimed at reducing water withdrawal and use risks for  water-intensive  operations  in  areas  of  high  water stress;\n- \u25a0 defining and implementing a Group-wide standard for all operations  that  goes  beyond  existing  local  processes and  procedures  and  guarantees  that  the  quality  of discharged  water  will  meet  or  exceed  applicable  local criteria.\n\nAir  Liquide  has  a  network  of  water  experts  across  all  regions. Their  role  is  to  act  as  dedicated  contact  points  for  all  questions relating  to  water  and  its  use  and  to  verify  data  (withdrawal, restitution, quality). In 2021, the Group rolled out a new reporting tool  to  improve the flows and accuracy of data. Finally, following the work of a dedicated working group, Air Liquide will strengthen the  steering  process  for  the  management  of  water  on  sites,  the monitoring of use and the quality of water returned to ecosystems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  6  'Clean  water and sanitation' and 14 'Life below water.'\n\nFor several years, Air Liquide has been implementing initiatives to improve data collection and better guide water management on its production  sites  to  reduce  water  consumption,  particularly  in water-stressed areas.\n\nIn  2021,  Air  Liquide  consumed  82  million  m\u00b3  of  water,  a  10% reduction compared with 2020.\n\nAir Liquide withdrew 950 million m\u00b3 of water from various sources. 87%  came  from  customers,  6%  came  from  freshwater  sources such  as  rivers  and  lakes,  2%  from  municipal  supply  and  the remaining 5% from various other sources.\n\n## WATER USE IN THE GROUP PROCESSES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                               |   2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 | 2021      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Annual water withdrawal  (estimate in millions of m 3 )  (a)  |      0 |    394 |    270 |    257 | 950 (b) * |\n| Annual water consumption  (estimate in millions of m 3 )  (c) |     81 |     86 |     94 |     90 | 82 *      |\n\n- (a) Gross  withdrawal.  The  methodology  used  has  been  in  place  since  2017  and  the  annual  water  withdrawal  was  calculated  for  the  first  time  for  the  2018 Registration Document.\n- (b) In  2021,  a  new  reporting  tool  was  implemented and new collection criteria introduced; the increase in reported water quantities for both withdrawals and discharges compared with previous years results from the inclusion of more Open Cooling Circuits, enabled by more granular reporting.\n- (c) Net water consumption, calculated as the difference between the water withdrawn and the water returned to the source.\n\n*\n\nIndicator verified by the independent verifier.\n\nIn  2021,  the  introduction  of  an  enhanced  reporting,  enabled  by implementation  of  a  new  reporting  tool,  has  made  it  possible  to increase  the  scope  of  measurement  to  include  more  water withdrawal points at customer sites. This water is used in facilities with open cooling circuits in which the water withdrawn is returned to  customers.  Consequently,  though  the  reported  quantities  of\n\nwater withdrawn and returned to the source show an increase, the net water consumption, which is now more accurate as a result of improved actions, shows a -9% decrease compared with previous year. These continuous improvements are reflective of the Group's continued stewardship in water management.\n\nWith  regard  to  Air  Separation  Units,  there  are  several  types  of cooling systems:\n\n- \u25a0 54% of these units have semi-open water circuits, where some of the water evaporates during cooling;\n- \u25a0 38%  of  these  units  have  open  circuits.  The  water  passes through the plant to cool it, and all the water taken is returned. Both  types  of  units  require  continuous  water  top-ups  for cooling;\n- \u25a0 finally,  the  other  units  have  closed  systems,  which  do  not extract  water  from  their  surrounding  environment.  These consume no water after the initial filling.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The resulting  analysis  and  recommendations  were  presented  to  the Executive Committee.\n\nAs water is a limited resource and not equally available across all regions, Air Liquide has assessed the risks associated with water consumption at its  sites  by  referring  to  the  'Aqueduct  3.0  Water Risk Atlas' map of the World Resource Institute (WRI) published in August  2019.  This  assessment  takes  into  account  the  specific data for each site according to its location in terms of a watershed, groundwater and an administrative boundary.\n\nTo  carry  out  this  assessment,  the  Group  used  the  'business  as usual'  scenario  (SSP2  RCP8.5  of  the  GIEC).  Each  site  is  thus identified  as  belonging  to  an  area  of  water  stress  or  not  (area defined according to the intensity of water conflict). This mapping also includes new units.\n\nIn 2021, according to the mapping of the Group's sites and based on the WRI map, 1% of these were located in areas considered arid (6) zones. With regard to sites located in areas of high water stress (7) ,  as  indicated  on  the  map  in  page  343,  an  analysis  is currently under way and will be completed in 2022. It will then be possible to prioritize actions in the most  water-intensive operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water treatment\n\nAir Liquide has been a reference in water treatment for 35 years, providing  its  customers  with  efficient  and  easy-to-implement solutions to face environmental challenges. The Group continues to support its customers to meet more stringent regulations, and to fight water stress and scarcity with cost-effective solutions.\n\nAir Liquide's 'Essential Small Molecules' (mainly O2, O3 and CO2) play  a  fundamental  role  in  drinking  water  and  wastewater treatment  processes.  These  gases  are  key  to  balance  mineral levels in desalination water plants, or to eliminate pollutants from surface drinking water. For industrial players seeking technologies to treat and recycle water, these molecules help boost the removal of  organic  pollution  from  wastewater  and  to  avoid  corrosion  or clogging in cooling systems.\n\nThe  Group  continues  to  innovate  in  water  treatment  to  help respond to the world's growing environmental needs.\n\nFor example,  during  Belgium's  floods  in  2021,  municipal wastewater  treatment  plants  were  unable  to  process  the  vast amount  of  wastewater  that  flowed  into  the  Demer  and  Dommel rivers  causing  deoxygenation  of  downstream  water.  Air  Liquide provided  its  expertise  to  the  Flemish  authorities  by  injecting oxygen into the rivers to restore balance, and has since developed a system that can be operational within two hours of flooding.",

BIODIVERSITY\n\nBiodiversity  refers  to  living  species  of  all  kinds,  including terrestrial,  marine  and  other  aquatic  ecosystems,  and  also  the ecosystems to which they belong. It includes diversity within and between species, the diversity of ecosystems, and the interactions between living organisms.\n\n## 2.4.1.  Risk associated with biodiversity\n\nThere  are  two  ways  in  which  companies  can  interact  with biodiversity: in terms of impact and in terms of dependency. The approach  to  the  issue  of  biodiversity  must  therefore  cover  the Company's  entire  value  chain,  from  resource  management through to product life cycle analysis.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  mindful  of  its  impact  on  biodiversity,  which encompasses  both  the  diversity  of  living  things  and  the  links between  species  themselves.  At  a  time  when  the  balance  of natural  environments  is  threatened,  it  is  important  to  preserve biodiversity - not only because of the many services it provides to human society, but also for its own intrinsic value.\n\nTo explore this subject in greater depth, Air Liquide has launched an overall in-depth review of its product supply chain's impact on biodiversity.\n\n- \u25a0 The  direct  impacts  are  fairly  limited:  the  Group's  production units  are  generally  at  sites  located  in  industrial  zones,  and usually  occupy  a  minor  area  of  the  industrial  site.  For  this reason,  the  Group's  impact  in  terms  of  land  artificialization  is limited  and,  where  necessary,  is  the  subject  of  particular attention. The Group's main impact on biodiversity is due to:\n- -its energy  consumption  (electricity,  natural  gas),  the production and distribution of which may have an impact; its CO2 emissions due to the established link between climate change and loss of biodiversity;\n- -its water consumption in certain regions;\n- -and certain atmospheric or solid discharges.\n- \u25a0 These risks are covered in paragraphs 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of this chapter.  Moreover,  the  Group  has  a  positive  impact  on biodiversity  through  some  of  its  products  such  as  hydrogen used for fuel desulfurization, thus reducing emissions of sulfur compounds.\n- \u25a0 The  Group's  operations  are  rarely  directly  dependent  on ecosystem services; this dependence is mainly related to two activities, biomethane and Seppic's activities.\n\n## 2.4.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nThe  Group  currently  addresses  the  issue  of  biodiversity  through gas,  liquid and  solid  discharge  management  policies  and procedures; through its water management policy; and through its commitment  to  carbon  neutrality  and  a  reduction  in  greenhouse gas  emissions.  These  policies  will  be  reviewed  if  necessary following the work currently underway. Moreover, Biomethane and Seppic's activities have been identified for some time as having a more  direct  link  to  biodiversity  and  these  business  lines  have therefore introduced their own policies in this respect.\n\n## Biomethane business\n\nWaste treatment is an essential factor in terms of biodiversity  in many  sectors  of  economic  activities.  Through  its  biomethane activities,  Air  Liquide  facilitates  the  creation  of  organic  waste recovery  and  transformation  channels.  In  addition  to  energy\n\nproduction, methanization contributes to the processing of waste and  the  production  of  organic  fertilizer,  which  is  a  substitute  for fossil-based fertilizer. This versatility leads to several environmental  externalities  on  the  climate,  air,  soil  and  water quality which have both short- and long-term impacts on local and global biodiversity.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  working  on  a  dedicated  sustainability  charter  to provide  a  standardized  framework  for  the  development  of  new biomethane-related  projects  and  a  better  management  of  their impact in a quest for continuous improvement.\n\n## Seppic\n\nSpecial  attention  is  paid  to  the  value  chain  of  Seppic,  an Air Liquide  subsidiary  which  has  been  manufacturing  and marketing  specialty  ingredients  for  more  than  75  years.  As Seppic's  biodiversity  challenges  mainly  relate  to  procurement, Seppic ensures that supplies comply with the Group's responsible procurement policy. More  specifically, Seppic adheres to biodiversity  regulations  for  the  countries  in  which  it  accesses genetic  resources  and  their  derivatives. Also  to  the  principles  of the  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity  and  the  Nagoya  Protocol for access to genetic resources and the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization. Seppic constantly monitors developments in associated regulatory tools and the status of the plant and marine species it uses with regard to CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) and UICN (International Union for the  Conservation  of  Nature)  lists  of  threatened  and  endangered species.  An  internal  validation  process  is  established  with  a steering  committee  to  ensure  that  the  use  of  raw  materials complies with the Nagoya Protocol and applicable national laws. In  addition,  as  palm  oil  and  its  by-products  represent  half  of Seppic's natural origin inputs by volume. Since 2010, Seppic has been  a  member  of  the  Roundtable  for  Sustainable  Palm  Oil (RSPO). The objective of RSPO is to transform the palm industry into  a  sustainable  industry,  and  has  an  RSPO  coordinator  who manages  the  action  plan  to  achieve  sustainable  palm  oil  goals. The  cultivation  of  palm  does  offer  higher  yields  than  with  other plants  used  for  oil  production.  However  the  growing  demand  for palm oil, in particular in the agrifood and bioenergy sectors, poses a threat to virgin forests.\n\n## 2.4.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  14  'Life  below water' and 15 'Life on land'.\n\n## Actions undertaken by the Group\n\nAfter analyzing  the  materiality  matrix  conducted  in  2020, Air Liquide stepped up its analysis of what could be done on the issue  of  biodiversity.  Specifically,  the  Group  launched  a  project with  the  company  I  Care  &  Consult  (ICC)  to  assess  all  its dependencies  and  the  pressure  it  puts  on  biodiversity.  A preliminary  diagnosis  was  established  to  identify  the  type  of dependencies on ecosystems and pressure on biodiversity.\n\nThe  initial  results  of  this  study  have  led  to  a  mapping  of Air Liquide's assets in key biodiversity areas and to structuring the Group's approach to biodiversity around five key themes: (a) land degradation;  (b)  climate  change;  (c)  overexploitation  of  natural resources; (d) pollution; and (e) invasive alien species.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This review found that  13%  of Air  Liquide  sites  were  located  within  a  50-km radius  of  at  least  nine  KBAs  (mainly  in  Europe  due  to  the  large number  of  KBAs  recognized  by  regulations)  and  for  which heightened attention must be paid in regard to any pressure that may  be  put  on  biodiversity.  Air  Liquide  intends  to  continue  this review  in  2022  to  identify  more  precisely  its  impacts  and dependencies and pinpoint the priority issues for the roll out of its biodiversity strategy.\n\nIn addition to global measures taken in response to biodiversity issues, local measures are also taken at various levels within the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Actions undertaken by the Biomethane business\n\nWaste treatment is an essential factor in terms of biodiversity  in many  business  sectors.  Air  Liquide's  biomethane  business contributes to better management of certain waste by substituting alternative practices. For example, the methanization of livestock effluents  or  communities'  organic  waste  helps  prevent  certain greenhouse gas emissions generated by their  decomposition,  at the edge of fields or in landfill, thus contributing to the protection of biodiversity as part of a circular economy approach.\n\n## Actions undertaken by the Seppic subsidiary\n\nIn  2021,  Seppic continued the work with I Care & Consult (ICC) started  in  2020  to  more  precisely  identify  its  impacts  and dependencies  with  regard  to  biodiversity.  By  characterizing  raw material  impacts,  manufacturing processes and its products' end of life, Seppic identified its main biodiversity challenges and honed in  on  the  areas  requiring  work. The  next  step  will  be  to  develop strategic solutions in response to these issues and implement an appropriate plan of action.",

In  2021,  98%  of  Seppic's palm  oil  inputs  were  Mass  Balance  certified  and  the  rest  were covered  by  the  Book  &  Claim  certificates  of  small,  independent producers, meaning all of Seppic's sourced palm oil was certified. Since 2019, Seppic has been producing annual traceability reports for its  procurement with the help of Transitions, followed by ASD (Action  for  Sustainable  Derivatives).  Progress  continues  to  be made in this regard. In 2021 Seppic conducted - for the second time  -  an  assessment  of  its  main  palm  oil  suppliers  using  the Sustainable  Palm  Index  (SPI)  methodology  developed  by Action for Sustainable Derivatives (ASD). Seppic's own palm oil strategy was  assessed  using  SPI  methodology  and  Seppic  obtained  a score of 91/100, illustrating significant progress it has made with regard to sustainable palm oil.\n\n## Actions undertaken by the Air Liquide Foundation\n\nIn 2021,  the  Air  Liquide  Foundation  continued  to  support biodiversity preservation through scientific research projects on air quality and local development projects in the environmental sector. The Air Liquide Foundation has, for a number of years, supported professional  integration  and  school  dropout  support  projects  via agricultural  projects.  In  particular  this  year,  the  Foundation  has supported  the  charity  Veni  Verdi  with  its  'From  roof  to  plate' project,  which  is  based  on  shared,  educational  and  unifying agriculture  and  economic  activities  at  a  high  school  in  the  19 th arrondissement  of  Paris  that  belongs  to  a  priority  education\n\nnetwork  and  has  a  SEGPA1  class  (a  General  and  Vocational Adapted  Learning  Section).  The  aim  of  this  project  includes: inviting young people to take part in a project, raising awareness of  ecology  and  biodiversity  issues  among  a  maximum  of  high school  children,  teaching  best  practices  and  providing  an opportunity to discover environmental professions.\n\n## Actions undertaken by Group employees\n\nClimate  Ambassadors  -  volunteer  employees  wishing  to  act  to ensure  greater  sustainability  within  Air  Liquide  -  have  also organized local biodiversity initiatives:\n\n- \u25a0 In  2021,  Air  Liquide  Advanced  Technologies  employees  in France  organized  a  waste  collection session at their Sassenage  site.  A  report  was  sent  to  employees  with  an awareness-raising  message  regarding  decomposition  times and the environmental footprint of the waste collected.\n- \u25a0 In its efforts to achieve a more sustainable planet, Air Liquide Far  Eastern  (ALFE)  organized  a  sustainable  development month  in  Taiwan.  In  October  2021,  ALFE  proposed  various activities covering subjects relating to the Group's sustainable development objectives such as the environmental footprint of digital solutions, plastics and food, as well as best practices to help limit this impact. The event concluded with a volunteering day  which  brought  together  more  than  150  employees  to collect waste on beaches in the three regions.\n\n## NATURAL RESOURCES PROTECTION IN MADAGASCAR\n\nThe  Seppic  Lons  (Serdex)  site,  which  specializes  in  the  botanical  extraction  of  high-purity  cosmetic  and  pharmaceutical  active ingredients, works closely with pickers in Madagascar to help them safeguard local natural resources. Serdex has been a member of the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) since 2008, and is committed to the continuous improvement of its organizational structure and the management of its supply chains to take account of the impact of the collection of wild plants on biodiversity and social and environmental  stakes. At  the  last  membership  audit  in  2020,  96.5%  of  the  obligations  relating  to  UEBT  membership  had  been fulfilled. Of the UEBT membership conditions, Serdex has given priority to the Centella asiatica supply chain with a view to improving its ethical practices.\n\n## 2.5.   EUROPEAN TAXONOMY\n\n## 2.5.1.  Taxonomy regulation\n\nt The European Union (EU) Taxonomy regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852  published  on  June  18,  2020)  defined,  on  a  scientific basis,  a  list  of  economic  activities  and  the  technical  criteria  that allows  said  activities  to  qualify  as  environmentally  sustainable. These  technical  screening  criteria  are  defined  by  the  European Commission  (EC)  in  wo  delegated  acts  published  on  April  21, 2021 and July 6, 2021.\n\nThe list  of  activities  was  established  by  focusing  on  nine  macrosectors  that  generated  more  than  93%  of  the  EU's  direct greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 (OECD).\n\nThe first two delegated acts relate to economic activities that may make a significant  contribution  to  climate  change  mitigation  and climate change adaptation objectives (four others are planned for 2022 and should enter into force 12 months later).\n\nThe  Taxonomy  regulation  has  created  a  classification  system which should serve as a common language for investors to identify the projects and conditions that will enable the chosen economic activities to have a significant positive impact on the climate and environment. As  such,  the  regulation  is  a  tool  aimed  at  helping investors  and  listed  companies,  financial  institutions  and  EU project sponsors to direct their investments toward environmentally  sustainable  activities  as  part  of  the  transition aimed at making the EU climate neutral by 2050.\n\nThe activities listed in the taxonomy regulation are referred to as 'eligible'. While these activities are the major contributors to direct GHG emissions, they also have the potential to be improved from a carbon footprint perspective. As such, the eligibility percentage of an organization, by itself, is not a measure of its sustainability impact.\n\nThe statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community  (NACE)  is  the  standard  used  to  classify  economic activities which are divided into three categories in the Taxonomy regulation:\n\n- \u25a0 activities for which technical criteria refer to performance levels which  comply  with  climate  neutrality  and  limiting  temperature increase  to  1.5  degrees  Celsius  at  a  global  level  (i.e.  in  line with a net zero carbon economy by 2050);\n- \u25a0 transitional  activities  for  which  there  are  no  low-carbon alternatives  for  the  moment  and  for  which  greenhouse  gas emission  levels  are  in  line  with  the  best  performance  in  the sector or industry;\n- \u25a0 enabling activities which improve carbon efficiency or facilitate a significant decrease in emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\nIn 2021, Air Liquide identified 17 activities eligible for the climate change  mitigation  objective  out  of  90  activities  listed  in  the delegated  act,  of  which  hydrogen  production  was  the  most significant. They are presented in the tables below (pages 348 to 350).  Concerning  the  activities  contributing  to  the  objective  of climate change adaptation, the only activity identified as eligible at Air Liquide is the residential care activity.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021,  all  of  Air  Liquide's  consolidated subsidiaries had declared their activities eligible for EU Taxonomy. Turnover eligible  for  Taxonomy  (for  the  two  objectives  described above)  totaled  2.4  billion  euros  (equivalent  to  10.5%  of  total consolidated revenue).\n\nTurnover from activities not covered by Taxonomy, referred to as 'non-eligible' totaled 20.9 billion euros (89.5% of total consolidated  revenue),  and  notably  include  the  production  of oxygen,  medical  gases  and  home  healthcare.  Indeed,  the activities  derived  from  production  of  air  gases,  including  the activities mentioned above, generate almost no direct greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## 2.5.2.  Methodology for the calculation of key performance indicators (KPI)\n\n- \u25a0 Turnover:  the  first  Taxonomy  KPI  is  calculated  by  eligible activity  and  by  facility,  based  on  external  revenue  (i.e. excluding  intra-group  sales)  as  determined  and  published  in the  Financial  Statements  under  'Revenue'  line  in  the  income statement.  If  revenue  by  facility  is  not  available,  the  entities apply  a  ratio  based  on  volumes  delivered  by  each  facility.  If production  is  placed  in  inventories  or  considered  WIP,  the above-mentioned  ratio  takes  into  account  the  change  in inventory  volumes  for  raw  material  and  supplies,  when  this change  is  significant.  Revenue  corresponds  to  revenue  from contracts with customers as defined under IFRS 15.\n- \u25a0 Capital  expenditure  (CapEx):  the  second  Taxonomy  KPI includes  acquisitions  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible assets related to eligible activities completed during the period under consideration, before impairment, depreciation  and  amortization,  and  any  revaluation.  It  also covers  acquisitions  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible  assets  related  to  eligible  activities  stemming  from business  combinations  that  result  in  the  acquisition  of  a company  or  business  consolidated  in  the  Group's  financial statements. It is calculated based on the internal management of  investments.  Investment  decisions  involving  amounts  in excess  of  three  million  euros  are  monitored  individually  and Taxonomy  eligibility  characteristics  are  presented  to  the Resources  and  Investment  Committee.  Capital  expenditure related  to  these  investment  decisions  is  monitored  on  a  perproject  basis.  Capital  expenditure  of  less  than  three  million euros  is  monitored  by  production  site  or,  when  several production units are involved, calculated using a ratio based on the turnover KPI.\n\nThe  lines  in  the  Financial  Statements  that  correspond  to  the CapEx KPI are included in Note 12 - 'Other intangible assets,' on  the  line  'Total  gross  intangible  assets'  of  the  columns 'Acquisitions' and 'Acquisitions related to business combinations';  and  in  Note  13  -  'Property,  plant  and equipment'  of  the  'Total  property,  plant  and  equipment'  line under the 'Acquisitions' and 'Acquisitions related to business combinations' columns.\n\n- \u25a0 Operating  expenses,  or  OpEx:  the  third  EU  Taxonomy  key performance  indicator  is  calculated  based  on  direct  noncapitalized  expenses  for  research  and  development,  building renovation,  short  term  leases,  maintenance  and  repairs,  as well  as  all  other  direct  expenses  relating  to  the  daily maintenance of property, plant and equipment assets that are necessary  to  ensure  the  continuous  and  efficient  running  of these assets.\n\nThese  include  direct  expenses  relating  the  nature  of  the following  costs,  that  are  necessary  for  the  production  of products  included  in  the  revenue  KPI:  Purchase  of  industrial gases, Purchase  of natural gas/naphtha, Purchase  of electricity,  Personnel  costs,  Personnel  not  employed  by  the Company,  Subcontracted  maintenance  and  installation  and Rental and leasing of real estate. The OpEx KPI is calculated directly or indirectly, by allocating expenses on the basis of the turnover KPI.\n\nThe delegated act relating to article 8 of Taxonomy regulation states that companies active in sectors that are not included in the  EU  Taxonomy  regulation,  such  as  for  air  gases  for  the Group,  may  also  publish  their  expenses  for  the  purchase  of products from other eligible activities.\n\nIncome  statement  lines  relating  to  the  OpEx  KPI  are 'Purchases,' 'Personnel expenses' and 'Other expenses'.\n\nIndividual improvement measures are analyzed on a case-by-case basis in order to consider them CapEx or OpEx eligible KPI.\n\nAll  hydrogen  production  sites  with  a  capacity  of  at  least  1,500 Nm 3 /h were considered in the reporting of the three KPIs.\n\nIn accordance with the Consolidated Financial Statements, figures relating to the three KPIs are provided in millions of euros, and the conversion  of  foreign  currencies  is  carried  out  according  to  the same methodology and using the same exchange rates as those used to prepare financial information.\n\nThe  Group  has  defined  its  methodology  on  the  basis  of information available in January 2022. In particular, the methodology  does  not  take  into  account  any  recommendations published  by  the  European  Commission  or  other  competent authorities after February 1, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thus,  2021  turnover  eligible  for  Taxonomy represented just 2,422.8 million euros, or 10.4% of total revenue (based on the definition of turnover set out in the EU's Taxonomy Regulation),  reflecting  the  fact  that  the  majority  of  Air  Liquide's revenue  is  generated  from  activities  with  almost  no  direct greenhouse gas emissions within the Group's scope.\n\nEligible CapEx represented 428.6 million euros: this corresponded to  capital  expenditure  incurred  during  the  2021  fiscal  year  on eligible activities but covering decisions taken during the 2021 and previous fiscal years. Relative to capital expenditure in 2021 this represented 11.9%.\n\nEligible OpEx represented 1,137.1 million euros, i.e. 11.6% of the Group's  operating  expenses  (reference  to  financial  KPI  in  the denominator).\n\n(8)\n\nThe tables presented above correspond to the activities listed for the  objective  of  climate  change  mitigation.  Concerning  the activities contributing to the objective of climate change adaptation, the only activity identified as eligible at Air Liquide is the  residential  care  activity  whose  three  KPIs  -  turnover,  CapEx and  OpEx  -  amount  respectively  to  28.0,  20.5  and  13.5  million euros as of December 31, 2021.\n\nAir Liquide's eligible activities in 2021 were mainly those relating to hydrogen-related activities (8) . Revenue from activities relating to hydrogen represented 87% of eligible turnover, with 85% from the production of hydrogen at plants operated by Large Industries and the remainder mainly from the manufacture of equipment for the production and use of hydrogen by the Engineering & Construction business line, and the construction and operation of facilities for the storage of hydrogen.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Ethical risk and combating corruption\n\nIn  all  geographical  areas  in  which  it  operates,  the  Group  faces risks of non-compliance with ethics and anticorruption provisions. These risks are part of the Regulatory and Legal risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document, page 88).\n\n## 3.1.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nIntegrity  and  transparency  are  the  cornerstones  of  the  Group's ethical  approach.  They  govern  the  behaviors  and  actions  of  all employees. These principles are reflected in a program based on a  dedicated  structure,  codes  and  procedures,  training  tools  and, finally, whistleblowing and control systems.\n\n## A dedicated structure\n\nA dedicated structure has been set up to support the management of the Ethics program:\n\n- \u25a0 an  Ethics and Compliance Committee, comprised of Air  Liquide's  various  global  functions  (Human  Resources, Legal, Group Control and Compliance, Sustainable Development,  etc.)  and  Operation  representatives,  validates the  program's  guidelines  and  priority  actions  and  may,  if necessary,  recommend  penalties  in  the  event  of  serious deviations;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  Control  and  Compliance  Department,  which  is responsible  for  Ethics,  reports  directly  to  one  of  the  Group's Executive Vice Presidents;\n- \u25a0 the  Ethics  Officer  is  responsible  for  providing  advice  and assistance  to  entities  in  the  implementation  of  the  Ethics program  and  in  the  handling  of  fraud  and  deviations.  This Officer also suggests improvements to the Ethics program by integrating  strategic  challenges,  best  practices,  regulatory developments  and  annual  action  plans.  He/she  relies  on  a network  of  over  50  ethics  correspondents  present  in  each  of the Group's geographic regions and business lines.\n\nbuilds treatment plants that are able to reduce the CO2 emissions of various industries, including:\n\n- \u25a0 carbon  capture  plants  which  capture  and  purify  CO2  from offgas  and  flue  gas  from  industrial  processes  (refining, concrete, steel, etc.) to supply flow compatible with sequestration;\n- \u25a0 plants capable of  converting  residues  (used  cooking  oil,  fats, etc.)  into  synthetic  fuels  to  replace  fossil  fuels  in  motors,  and plants  capable  of  transforming  sugar  waste  into  substitute chemicals for fossil-based chemicals.\n\n## Codes and procedures\n\nRules  on  ethics  and  conduct,  which  are  shared  and  actively circulated  among  all  Group  employees  through  the  BlueBook  in particular,  are  set  out  within  each  subsidiary's  Code  of  Conduct. These  rules  are  implemented  as  operational  procedures  or policies at either the Group or local level.\n\n## The Code of Conduct, the ethics guide for employees\n\nThe Code of Conduct was updated in 2021 and will be rolled out across  all  Group  subsidiaries  in  2022.  This  Code  embodies  Air Liquide's  ethical  commitment,  in  particular  with  regard  to  the protection  of  employees,  business  practices  and  respect  for  the environment and human rights.\n\nThe Code of Conduct is available on the Group's website: https:// www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ethics. An online training  module  exists  on  the  employee  Code  of  Conduct  which sets out the Group's ethics approach and presents each subject through case scenarios. This module is mandatory and must be taken  by  all  employees  (including  part-time  staff)  each  year.  On this  basis,  individual  employee  compliance  with  the  Code  of Conduct is required.\n\n## Compliance with laws and regulations\n\nCodes  and  procedures  have  been  established  to  ensure compliance with laws and regulations relating in particular to the fight  against  corruption,  competition  law,  the  duty  of  vigilance, personal data protection and import and export control obligations.\n\nWith  regard  to  competition  law,  Behavior  Codes  have  been established, especially in Europe, the United States and Asia. For some  of  the  Group's  activities,  Healthcare  in  particular,  specific Codes of Conduct on competition law have also been developed.\n\nAudits  are  jointly  conducted  on  a  regular  basis  by  the  Group's internal audit departments and an external law firm. They conduct tests  and  interviews  to  identify  and  correct  risk  practices  or  any deviations  observed. Awareness-raising  meetings  on  compliance with  competition  law  are  also  held.  Finally,  an  online  training program  has  been  launched  covering  competition  law-related practices and international principles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  the  updated Code of Conduct, the principles of integrity and transparency are defined  and  illustrated  in  a  specific  chapter.  This  chapter specifically outlines the laws governing the fight against corruption and  influence  peddling,  covers  relations  with  intermediaries  and the types of payment requiring particular attention.\n\nMoreover,  the  Group  has  a  Supplier  Code  of  Conduct,  which includes a chapter on the prevention of corruption.\n\nAn online training module ensures sufficient awareness is raised regarding the prevention of corruption. It is primarily intended for those  teams  which  are  most  exposed  to  corruption-related  risks (sales, procurement, administrative management, and so on) and managers. These employees must complete this training module every  year.  It  is  supplemented  by  in-person  training  every  three years.  Air  Liquide  operates  a  corruption-prevention  program  in which  Executive  Management  and  management  are  closely involved. This program relies in particular on:\n\n- \u25a0 the mapping of corruption risks;\n- \u25a0 the Code of Conduct;\n- \u25a0 a  complete  set  of  training  and  awareness-raising  actions  for those exposed to corruption risks;\n- \u25a0 a third-party assessment mechanism, a whistleblowing system and accounting controls.\n\nThis  program  is  regularly  updated  to  take  into  account  new regulatory  and  legal  requirements  under  the  coordination  of  the Group's  Ethics  Officer,  who  relies  on  a  network  of  ethics correspondents and the support of the Operational Departments in the hubs and businesses; it is regularly audited.\n\n## 3.1.3.  Performance\n\nThe  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee  ensures  that  the  ethics program is correctly implemented by monitoring action plans and reviewing  indicators  such  as  employee  participation  rates  in classroom  training  and  online  training  courses.  By  way  of illustration,  98%  of  Group  employees  have  taken  the  Code  of Conduct online training module.\n\nIt  also  analyses  the  corruption  and  report  types  received  via  the whistleblowing  system  and  the  results  of  internal  audits  or  other internal  investigations,  providing  guidelines  for  changes  to  the ethics program.\n\n## The whistleblowing system\n\nSince 2015, the Group has operated a whistleblowing system at all  its  entities  (Ethicall  for  all  Group  companies  excluding Airgas, and  EthicsPoint  for  Airgas  and  its  subsidiaries),  whereby employees and external workers can anonymously send an alert to an independent external service provider.\n\nThis alert can relate to:\n\n- \u25a0 conduct or situations that breach the Group's health and safety commitments;\n- \u25a0 serious human rights violations;\n- \u25a0 conduct  or  situations  that  breach  the  Group's  environmental commitments;\n- \u25a0 deviations from the Code of Conduct of their entity.\n\nRegular  communication  (via  posters,  the  intranet,  e-learning reminders, management  communications)  ensures  that  all employees  are  familiar  with  the  whistleblowing  system  and  can easily file an alert in their own language by telephone or through the provider's dedicated website. The Group guarantees that any whistleblower  who  reports  something  in  good  faith  will  not  be penalized  and  no  retaliatory  measures  will  be  taken,  a  principle which is reiterated in the Code of Conduct.\n\nAll alerts are handled confidentially and within a reasonable period of  time,  usually  less  than  two  months.  Alerts  are  handled  by internal  teams  in  accordance  with  their  nature  and  geographical origin.  Processing  managers  can  utilize  external  resources  if necessary.  The  most  severe  cases  are  reviewed  by  an  Ethics Committee for the relevant hub or general business area, or where necessary by the Group's Ethics and Compliance Committee. This system complements other means of reporting incidents within the entities  (immediate  supervisor,  Human  Resources  Department, Legal  Department,  etc.).  It  enables  alerts  to  be  handled  quickly and  in  a  structured  way,  minimizing  their  potential  impact  on individuals and the organization.\n\nThe  whistleblowing  system  is  overseen  by  the  Group  Ethics Officer,  who  ensures it  is  compliant  in  its  implementation,  and  in particular  that  it  is  properly  disseminated  throughout  the  Group, alerts are handled appropriately, and whistleblowers are protected. He or she reports the key indicators and lessons learned from this system to the Group's Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\nIn 2021, 192 reports were produced by the whistleblowing system, including:\n\n- \u25a0 discrimination and bullying: 97 cases;\n- \u25a0 health, safety, and environmental violations: 17 cases;\n- \u25a0 fraud: 42 cases;\n- \u25a0 other: 36 cases.\n\n37% of alerts were found to be justified following an investigation and led to sanctions and corrective measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk of tax evasion\n\nTax risks are part of the financial risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document on page 82).\n\nIn addition to the tax charter and its history of citizenship in fiscal matters,  Air  Liquide  is  strongly  aware  of  the  consequences  of decisions that could lead to accusations of tax evasion.\n\nIt should be noted that Air Liquide's industrial gas businesses are essentially  very  local  in  nature.  Consequently,  Air  Liquide generates profit and pays its taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the case of transactions between different countries, the  Air  Liquide  legal  entities  in  question  comply  fully  with  the applicable transfer pricing regulations.\n\n## 3.2.2.  Policy and procedures: the Tax Charter\n\nAir  Liquide  has  defined  the  following  principles  which  govern  its tax policy, in line with article L. 22-10-36 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nA  large  part  of  the  tax  charter  relates  to  the  fight  against  tax evasion:\n\n- \u25a0 Group entities must respect the laws and regulations in force, as  well  as  the  international  standards  that  affect  it  such  as those of the OECD, in particular on transfer pricing;\n\n## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\n- \u25a0 Group  entities  ensure  that  tax  returns  and  payments  are completed in compliance with local regulations. They complete the required tax returns according to the jurisdictions in which the Group operates;\n- \u25a0 the Group is committed to acting with integrity in all tax-related matters. It aims to operate in a transparent manner and build constructive, long-term relationships with the tax authorities in the countries in which it operates;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  manages  tax  issues  by  not  using  structures  that have  no  economic  or  commercial  substance,  particularly  in low-tax countries;\n- \u25a0 its tax strategy complies with the Code of Conduct.\n\n## 3.2.3.  Performance\n\nAs far as tax is concerned, Air Liquide focuses on complying with laws  and  regulations.  Changes  to  laws  and  regulations  are followed  and  monitored  by  its  Tax  Department  and  its  local Finance Departments.\n\nWithin  this  governance  framework,  the  Group's  tax  affairs  are managed by a team of qualified, dedicated tax experts, who work closely with management and respect the Group's values.\n\nL'Air Liquide S.A., on its own behalf and on behalf of its integrated French  subsidiaries,  was  the  first  company  to  sign  the  'Fiscal Partnership'  with  the  French  tax  authorities.  By  signing  this partnership in March 2019, L'Air Liquide S.A. and its subsidiaries have  entered  a  trust-based,  transparent  relationship  with  the French  tax  authorities.  This  commitment  continues  without interruption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Respect of Human Rights and commitment to sustainable development\n\nAt Air Liquide, Human Rights management is factored into various different risks which relate in general to human activity within the Group and its ecosystems.\n\nAir  Liquide  relies  upon  the  various  principles  of  the  Global Compact in meeting its commitments in terms of:\n\n- \u25a0 Human  Rights  (see  Vigilance  Plan  in  Chapter  2  of  this Universal Registration Document, page 96);\n\nThe International Bill of Human Rights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE SHARES THE PRINCIPLES LAID DOWN IN\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 Labor law (see main EFPD risks relating to discrimination and Human Resources management pages 325 and 323);\n- \u25a0 Environment  (see  main  EFPD  risks  relating  to  climate, page 328);\n- \u25a0 Anti-corruption (see main EFPD anti-corruption risk, page 351).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe International Labour Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\n\nThe OECD Guidelines for Multinational EnterprisesThe United Nations Global Compact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide subscribes to the highest standards for the conduct of its  business  and  its  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  signs each  year  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact,  the  founding principles  of  which  concern  human  rights,  international  labor standards, the environment and the fight against corruption. This letter of commitment  may  be  viewed  on  the  site  https:// www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/human-rights and Global Compact website.\n\nAir Liquide respects and promotes human rights in its operations around  the  world.  The  Group  strongly  believes  that  all  persons should  be  treated  with  respect  and  dignity  and  that  companies should  play  a  role  in  protecting  these  fundamental  rights.  Air Liquide shares the principles laid down in the International Bill of Human  Rights,  the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO) Declaration  on  Fundamental  Principles  and  Rights  at  Work,  the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) as well as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These promote an ethical and responsible approach by  companies  in  their  activities  and  professional  relations,  in particular in terms  of  human  rights,  by  encouraging  the implementation of due diligence procedures. The commitments of Air  Liquide  and  its  employees  to  protect  human  rights  are  also described in the Code of Conduct which was updated in 2021 and will  be  rolled  out  in  all  entities  in  2022.  The  Code  of  Conduct  is available  on  the  Group's  website:  https://www.airliquide.com/ sustainable-development/ethics.\n\nMoreover,  Air  Liquide  is  a  signatory  of  the  Responsible  Care Charter \u00ae of  the  International  Council  of  Chemical  Associations (ICCA),  which  aims  to  improve  the  chemical  industry's  overall performance on health, safety and environmental protection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnder the UN Global Compact, companies are invited to make a voluntary public commitment to ten universal principles related to human  rights, international labor standards, environmental protection and the fight against corruption. Air Liquide undertakes to respect these 10 principles by signing a COP every year on the Global Compact website and by publishing a letter of commitment signed by its Chairman and CEO.\n\nThe  ten  principles  of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  are derived  from:  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  the International  Labor  Organization's  Declaration  on  Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and  Development,  and  the  United  Nations  Convention  against Corruption.\n\n<!-- image -->",

SASB CROSS-REFERENCE TABLE\n\nThe Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is a non-profit organization created in 2011, producing sustainable development reporting standards by industry sector. The SASB takes five elements into account when establishing its standards: environment, social capital, human capital, innovation and business model, and leadership and governance.\n\nThe SASB has not yet developed a standard for the industrial gases industry. Consequently, the cross-reference table below contains references to information in Air Liquide's Universal Registration Document that meets SASB standards for the chemical industry.\n\nSASB\n\n| Topic                                                | Accounting metrics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | References in the Universal Registration  Document 2021                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Greenhouse gas  emissions                            | Gross global Scope 1 emissions, percentage covered  under emissions-limiting regulations                                                                                                                                                                 | Chapter 5, EFPD -

APPROACH\n\nA  sustainable  future  implies  working  with  all  stakeholders  and sharing responsibilities openly, fairly, and responsibly. Air Liquide is committed  to  further  improving  its  relationship  with  its stakeholders through transparency and  a  continuous  and responsible dialog.\n\nStakeholder  priorities  are  constantly  evolving:  for  example,  the Group  carries  out  formal  materiality  assessments  on  a  regular basis  to  identify  and  prioritize  issues  that  are  most  important  to stakeholders.\n\nThus,  in  2020,  the  Group  conducted  a  consultation  of  its stakeholders on Sustainable Development issues. The purpose of this matrix is to integrate the main risks and opportunities into the Group's strategy according to the importance attached to them by various stakeholders.\n\n21  issues  covering  environmental,  social,  societal,  economic, Human  Rights  and  governance  aspects  were  consequently submitted  for  consideration  by  the  Group's  stakeholders.  Nearly 1,400  responses  were  received,  compiled  and  analyzed  to produce  this  materiality  matrix  of  Air  Liquide's  sustainable development issues.\n\n## 1.2. METHODOLOGY\n\nAll Group stakeholders were interviewed during this consultation in most  of  the  geographical  regions  in  which  the  Group  operates: customers,  patient  associations,  suppliers,  investors,  journalists, NGOs, employee representatives, students and future generations, innovation partners, focus groups of employees and individual shareholders.\n\nThese stakeholders represented two categories of profiles:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group's internal stakeholders with a strategic insight into topics;\n- \u25a0 internal and external stakeholders with operational knowledge of these topics.\n\nThe project was conducted over four months (from October 2020 to  January  2021)  by  a  project  team  comprising  members  of  the Group's  Sustainable  Development  Department  and  a  Steering Committee  formed  of  representatives  from  operational  and functional  departments. A specialized firm was also appointed to support the internal teams for this project and carry out the various consultations.\n\nStakeholders were interviewed using two consultation methods:\n\n- \u25a0 individual qualitative  interviews providing  a  more  detailed insight  and  comments  on  the  various  issues  and  assigned rating;\n\n- \u25a0 online questionnaires to assess  the importance and effectiveness  of  each  issue,  sent  to  a  wider  audience (e.g. employees).\n\nThese consultations were supplemented by analyses concerning extra-financial rating agencies, press reviews, studies of reporting standards  such  as  TCFD  or  SASB,  and  the  contribution  of  a foresight  consultant  to  improve  the  way  in  which  the  Group's various issues and areas of action were presented and defined.\n\nThe results were then consolidated by giving equal weight to each stakeholder's assessments.\n\n## 1.3. RESULTS\n\nThe matrix shown below highlighted the following elements:\n\n- \u25a0 The 21 sustainable development issues are considered to be important  by  stakeholders.  No  question  received  an  average score of less than 2 on a scale of 1 to 4.\n- \u25a0 14 issues were assessed as major, with a wide consensus of support.  Stakeholders  recognize  Air  Liquide's  commitment  in these areas and their integration into Group strategy.\n\nIssues such as health and safety at work, ethics, quality of service to  customers  and  climate  change  action  were  rated  as  very important  by  stakeholders,  who  also  recognize  the  Group's achievements in these areas.\n\nThe issue relating to protection of the habitats and biodiversity is the  only  one  where  the  various  stakeholders  have  significantly differing views. The Group has already identified the importance of this issue by addressing the biodiversity risk in the Extra-financial Performance Declaration published in this Chapter (page 344) and by carrying out several actions, also described in the EFPD.\n\nCompared  to  the  analysis  carried  out  previously,  the  materiality matrix  showed  the  emergence  in  2020  of  social  issues  or challenges  that  are  largely  taken  into  account  in  the  Group's strategy:\n\n- \u25a0 adaptation to  climate  change  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions (page 328);\n- \u25a0 diversity and inclusion (page 363);\n- \u25a0 well-being and quality of life at work (page 362);\n- \u25a0 remuneration and social protection (page 362);\n- \u25a0 management  of  external  crises  (geopolitical  or  health  crises, etc.) (page 88);\n- \u25a0 responsible finance and investment (page 40).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nAir Liquide brings together  66,436  people  of  more  than 140  nationalities,  in  75  countries,  who  form  multicultural  teams with a host of skills.\n\nThe Group strives to promote diversity, encourage innovation and employee  engagement,  meet  customers'  expectations  and guarantee Air Liquide's long-term performance.\n\nIn an environment undergoing profound transformation, Air Liquide has  developed  a  Human  Resources  strategy  to  identify,  attract, maintain and develop competent employees from all walks of life. This strategy is based on the following three priorities:\n\n- \u25a0 encouraging employee engagement;\n- \u25a0 developing an agile and collaborative structure;\n- \u25a0 anticipating the future of work.\n\n## GROUP HEADCOUNT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n30,000\n\nprogram.  Employee  engagement  is  one  of  Human  Resources' priorities.  Air  Liquide  has  launched  a  commitment  monitoring measurement  program,  MyVoice.  It  aims  to  improve  employee experience and well-being. It is based on a simple concept: listen, understand and act. Following the launch of the initiative in Asia Pacific  in  2019,  feedback  is  gathered  annually  from  employees across the entire Group to obtain a better understanding of their expectations and to identify and introduce appropriate measures and, as a result, significantly increase their engagement.\n\nA short survey covering some 20 topics is sent to each employee with  room  to  leave  comments  if  desired.  The  questions  cover areas  such  as  safety,  work-life  balance,  career  development, inclusiveness,  independence,  career  development  and  trust  in management. Answers are completely anonymous and confidential  to  ensure  that  employees  are  free  to  express  their thoughts.  Results  are  collected  in  real  time,  aggregated  and analyzed by means of a shared system for the entire Group. Each manager has access to the results from his or her team - provided that  the  thresholds  needed  to  guarantee  confidentiality  are respected.\n\nSince  its  launch,  this  program  has  confirmed  Air  Liquide's strengths which contribute to employee commitment and identified opportunities, particularly in the context of the health crisis (worklife balance,  collaboration)  in  order  to  provide  appropriate responses as soon as possible. Targeted actions are launched at different  levels  in  the  organization:  with  managers  and  their employees to improve team dynamics, at the level of the entities by management teams, and at the Group level.\n\n## 2.2.2.  Mobility of skills development\n\nAir  Liquide  is  continuously  looking  to  recruit  diverse  profiles  to build multi-disciplined and complementary teams.\n\nThe Group's diversity is characterized by the fact that there is no 'standard  career  path.'  On  the  contrary,  each  employee  adapts their career path according to their individual goals and the career opportunities offered by the Group. Internal mobility and technical expertise are two major factors in career development.\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n2014\n\n2013\n\n2012\n\n2021\n\n## 2.2.   EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\n## 2.2.1.  Employees' voices\n\nThere is a direct link between employee engagement and Group customer's  satisfaction,  which  is  at  the  heart  of  the  Company\n\n## THE TECHNICAL COMMUNITY LEADERS\n\nThe  Technical  Community  Leaders  (TCL)  program  enables  talent  in  their  technical  domain  to  access  career  paths  that  offer recognition,  satisfaction  and  influence.  More  than  4,200  experts  have  been  recognized,  playing  a  key  role  in  sharing  expertise, knowledge and technical excellence.\n\nThis community of the Group's technology experts contributes to the transfer of technical know-how that Air Liquide will need in the future.\n\nIn 2021, this program of identification and development of our technical talents (TCL) appointed 105 new international experts. The year  also  saw  the  creation  of  a  new  technical  area  called  'Hydrogen  Mobility.'  Meanwhile,  the  Group  reviewed  the  definitions  of expertise  for  three  other  technical  areas  (Health,  Engineering  &  Construction,  and  Innovation  and  Development)  to  line  up  the necessary expertise and respond to market developments. The TCL is therefore a key driver of innovation and a major contributor to ensure the Group's long-term reliability and safety.\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee performance and remuneration\n\nThe  performance  review  meeting  is  a  key  stage  in  employee development, as it facilitates a discussion between the employee and  their  manager  on  performance  and  development,  the assessment  and  setting  objectives  for  the  year  ahead.  In  2021, 83% of Group employees had a performance review meeting with their immediate supervisor.\n\nThe  comprehensive  remuneration  of  Group  employees  is  based on three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 the position held;\n- \u25a0 the degree of responsibility;\n- \u25a0 performance.\n\nIn  addition,  the  state  of  the  local  market,  pay  equity  and  current legislation  are  taken  into  account.  It  is  generally  made  up  of  a basic salary plus additional compensation and benefits items.\n\nThe  variable  part  of  remuneration  is  devised  locally  for  certain categories  of  employees  to  reward  performance.  In  general,  it depends on parameters such as the Group's earnings, the entity's earnings  and  individual  performance,  which  is  measured  in quantitative  and  qualitative  terms.  By  rewarding  collective  and individual  performance,  Air  Liquide  encourages  everyone  to collaborate and contribute to overall earnings.\n\nMost of the managers and professionals have variable pay, which includes sustainable development objectives.\n\nRemuneration  may  also  include  benefits  such  as  death  and disability insurance, health insurance, profit sharing (1) or solutions to help balance work and family life, which vary by country.\n\nIn  2021,  60%  of  the  Group's  employees  received  an  individual variable portion as part of their remuneration.\n\n15% of managers' variable remuneration is linked to sustainable development criteria, such as safety, customer satisfaction, energy efficiency and equality.\n\nFinally, the top 370 Group executives have a significant portion of their variable remuneration mandatorily linked to these criteria, for example safety and Corporate Sustainability Program targets for their entity.\n\nDespite  the  covid-19  crisis,  the  Group  has  maintained  its remuneration policy commitments.\n\n## 2.2.4.  Well-being at work\n\nThe  official  definition  of  well-being  in  the  workplace  provided  by the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  considers  this  to  be  'a dynamic  state  of  mind  characterized  by  reasonable  harmony between  a  person's  abilities,  needs  and  expectations,  and environmental demands  and  opportunities.' Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 is specifically focused on health and well-being.\n\nThe Group ensures that it builds a performance-focused, attractive and  collaborative  work  environment  while  also  safeguarding  the health and well-being of Group employees in their workplace.\n\nThese practices were incorporated into principles that were jointly developed  with  European  social  partners.  In  2019,  the  Group partnered with the European Works Council to develop the 'Care and Perform' initiative, whose purpose is to prevent psychosocial risks. This led to the creation of a charter based on principles of action linked to improvements in work scheduling, workloads and work-life  balance.  The  content  of  this  charter  facilitated  the conclusion of company agreements with social partners in order to offer  new  services  to  employees. In several European countries, agreements  on  the  right  to  disconnect  and  work  remotely  have been concluded to meet specific needs and support the transition toward new working conditions.\n\nMore  generally,  within  the  context  of  changes  to  the  Group's organizational  models,  which  were  accelerated  by  the  covid-19 pandemic,  Air  Liquide  launched  a  global  project  in  2020  called 'Next Normal' to support this shift in working methods.\n\nWith this project, the entities can provide their employees with:\n\n- \u25a0 a new framework including team management;\n- \u25a0 a supervised remote working policy;\n- \u25a0 reorganization of workspaces;\n- \u25a0 careful  consideration  of  interactions  with  customers  and patients.\n\nAs part of the sustainability objectives announced in March 2021, Air  Liquide's  aim  is  to  ACT  to  build  trust  by  engaging  with employees.  The  Group  has  therefore  committed  to  offering  a common basis of care coverage to all employees by 2025.\n\nThis common basis of care coverage guarantees:\n\n- \u25a0 an  insurance  with  a  compensation  equivalent  to  one  year's salary in the event of death;\n- \u25a0 healthcare that includes inpatient and outpatient care;\n- \u25a0 a minimum of 14 weeks paid maternity leave.\n\nFrom May to September 2021, entities were grouped by country so  that  gaps  in  their  current  coverage  could  be  assessed  and  a plan devised to phase in upgrades by 2025.\n\nIn  2021,  the  percentage  of  employees  benefiting  from  this common basis of care coverage is 34%.\n\nA  special  team  was  set  up  within  the  Human  Resources department  to  oversee  the  plan's  roll-out  and  measure  progress within the Group on an annual basis.\n\n## 2.2.5.  Legal working hours\n\nEach  Group  entity  defines,  in  agreement  with  representative bodies and in line with local regulations, legal working hours which encourage engagement and performance.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  regulations,  the  European  'Care  &  Perform' principles and rules are also designed to organize work in a way that  respects  the  autonomy,  flexibility  and  private  life  of  each employee.\n\nTo  facilitate  the  deployment  of  the  'Next  Normal'  project, Air Liquide developed a reference guide in 2021. First shared with managers,  the  guide  helps  the  entities  to  set  up  new  working methods  based  on  the  initial  global  experience.  Working  groups were then organized with employees in the entities to validate the commitments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nIn France, the general framework of legal working hours is defined in agreements with the labor unions.\n\nMeanwhile,  the  industrial  businesses,  as  well  as  those  in Healthcare,  include  on-call  systems  that  are  regularly  discussed and are subject to agreements with the labor unions.\n\n## 2.2.6.  Renewing social dialog\n\nAir  Liquide  is  committed  to  meaningful  social  dialog  in  all  of  its subsidiaries.  This  may  take  different  forms  according  to  local regulations.  In  2021,  82%  of  Group  employees  had  access  to  a representation, dialog or consultation structure.\n\nIn  Europe,  the  European  Works  Council  has  29  employee representatives  from  12  countries.  It  was  renewed  in  2021  for  a term  of  four  years.  In  2021,  two  plenary  meetings  under  the chairmanship  of  a  member  of  the  Executive  Committee,  one exceptional plenary meeting to elect the new presiding officers of the European Works Council as well as four other meetings of the presiding officers of the Committee were held. The main themes addressed during the information and consultation meetings are: safety,  including  an  update  on  the  health  crisis,  news  on  the Group's  activities,  especially  in  Europe,  financial  results,  energy impacts,  digital  roadmap  in  the  industry,  the  well-being  and psychological  health  of  employees,  update  on  the  purchasing function in the different countries where Air Liquide operates. For security reasons, some meetings were held remotely or in hybrid mode.\n\nIn  France,  the  Group  has  been  working  to  strengthen  social dialogue  through  an  approach  based  on  debate  and  project development within the framework of a collaborative initiative. Two social seminars were held to promote working together (employee representatives, trade unions and management/Human Resources) to work together on a new aim.\n\nFinancial years 2020 and 2021 were largely devoted to managing the pandemic crisis together with employee representatives. They were characterized by continuous and strengthened social dialog with bodies such as the Social and Economic Council (CSE), the Group  Committee,  the  European  Committee  and  the  Health, Safety and Working Conditions Commission (CSSCT).\n\nFor instance, a new framework for work organization was defined based on a vision of what it will be in the future. This vision, which is  related  to  the  'Next  Normal'  project,  was  the  framework  for remote working agreements at Group companies in France. As a result  of  a  series  of  agreements  or  measures,  more  employees are able to spend more time working from home with no disruption to working relationships.\n\n## 2.3.   AN AGILE AND COLLABORATIVE STRUCTURE\n\nThe second focus of the Human Resources strategy consists of building an agile and collaborative structure capable of addressing the  challenges  of  a  continuously  changing  world.  This  requires facilitating cross-divisional exchanges within our teams to ensure sustainable performance.\n\n## 2.3.1.  Inclusion and diversity\n\nDiversity  is  a  priority  of Air  Liquide's  Human  Resources  strategy and  policy  and  the  Group  considers  it  a  source  of  strength, creativity  and  performance.  It  is  a  fundamental  element  of  the organization,  in  terms  of  both  businesses  and  employees,  and drives the Group's long-term performance.\n\nThe  objective  at  a  Group  level  is  to  increase  diversity  among managerial staff to better recognize the various cultures that make up  Air  Liquide  and  to  improve  gender  equality.  In  this  respect, quantified  gender  equality  targets  have  been  set  for  the  Group. The  local  entities  took  an  inventory  of  the  current  situation  to define an objective at the level of the clusters and thus contribute to the overall objective.\n\nWithin the Human Resources organization, a team leads diversity projects. The roadmap is based on three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 deploy  diversity  objectives  at  in  all  entities  and  implement corresponding action plans;\n- \u25a0 improve  all  of  the  Group's  Human  Resources  processes  to reduce any bias and avoid all forms of discrimination;\n- \u25a0 promote an inclusive culture to leverage teams' diversity.\n\nEach  hub  and  business  then  implements  its  own  roadmap  and diversity  actions  with  consideration  of  its  own  situation.  In  this context,  they  analyze  processes  and  practices,  identify  potential biases  and  implement  corrective  measures  ('nudges')  to  limit these biases. Thus, during the regular reviews of talents with high potential,  the  diversity  of  profiles  is  taken  into  account,  with  the aim  of  continuing  to  increase  diversity  in  the  Group's  key positions. This also serves as a way to promote the many cultures that make up the Group, and to strengthen gender equality.\n\nAt  an  entity  level,  the  Group's  objective  is  to  have  teams comprising  employees  who  represent  the  environment  in  which they operate. Each entity is therefore responsible for implementing action plans specific to its own environment and legal framework, which  may  include  many  forms  of  diversity  (skin  color,  ethnic origin,  religion,  sexual  orientation,  etc.).  Through  its  diversity policy,  Air  Liquide  is  strongly  committed  to  fighting  any  form  of discrimination.\n\n## 2.3.2.  Gender\n\nThe  Group  has  set  a  number  of  ambitious  gender  equality objectives, aimed at reaching a rate of:\n\n- \u25a0 35%  women  at  the  'Managers  and  Professionals'  level,  by 2025.  These  objectives  are  in  line  with  the  results  obtained over the past ten years, which have seen the share of female 'Managers and Professionals' within the Group increase from 26% to 31%;\n- \u25a0 25% of executive positions (senior executives) held by women by 2025.\n\n## PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN AMONG MANAGERS AND PROFESSIONALS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Including Airgas since 2017.\n- (b) Including Airgas since 2016.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nThe  ambitious  gender  diversity  objectives  set  for  the  'Managers and  Professionals'  and  'senior  executives'  population,  and  for maintaining the gender diversity goal among 'high potentials', are also  intended  to  form  a  talent  pool  to  ensure  balanced  gender representation on the Executive Committee by promoting female talents to higher levels of management. Moreover, in view of the new obligations  laid  down  by  the  \"Rixain\"  Law  of  December  24, 2021, the Group is also aligning its gender equality objectives with regard to the Executive Committee with those of the Law, i.e. 30% of women by March 1, 2026.\n\nIn  2021,  women  represented  46%  of  employees  considered  as high  performers,  this  level  has  been  increasing  regularly  for  a number  of  years  and  must  be  maintained.  The  Executive Committee includes five women among its fifteen members. Three of these were appointed in 2019, having previously held executive positions within the Group. Six women are currently members of the Board of Directors of L'Air Liquide S.A., out of a total of eleven members appointed by the General Meeting.\n\nMore  generally,  and  taking  the  highest  level  of  responsibilities across the Group into account, women hold 24% of all positions defined as 'senior executives,' over and above the goals set by the  Board  of  Directors  for  2021.  This  latter  percentage  has increased from 19% to 24% over the last three years.\n\nAmong  the  10%  of  positions  with  the  greatest  level  of responsibility  within  the  Company (2) ,  29%  of  them  are  held  by women; these women have an average age of 51.6 years and a median  age  of  51.3  years,  i.e.  2.9  years  and  3.7  years  less respectively  than  the  average  age  (54.5  years)  and  median  age (55 years) for men. This difference is due to the policy to promote women  to  the  highest  levels  of  responsibility  earlier  on  in  their careers, and therefore eliminate career development discrepancies that occur in the absence of proactive measures in this area.\n\nFinally, the promotion of an inclusive culture also contributes to a sustainable  approach  to  diversity.  Numerous  initiatives  are deployed  within  the  Group  to  this  end:  events,  learning opportunities,  mentoring,  networks  and  communities  for  different interest groups such as women's careers. One recent example is the  creation  in  2021  of  a  movement  for  inclusion  which  is  a development  opportunity  for  committed  employees.  For  seven months, 220 of these 'Inclusion & Diversity enthusiasts' designed and  carried  out  experiments  across  the  Group  using  innovative methods to promote inclusion in the work environment. These new approaches  are  disseminated  throughout  the  organization  in  a spirit of continuous improvement.\n\n## Gender and equal pay\n\nIn France, the law of September 5, 2018, known as the 'Loi avenir professionnel,' requires companies with more than 50 employees to  implement  an  annual  mechanism  for  assessing  gender  pay gaps, the result of which is a public social score for the Company (out  of  100  points).  The  Professional  Equality  Index  and  five related indicators must also be made available to the Social and Economic Committee and transmitted to the Labor administration.\n\n(2)\n\nIn 2021, the Group's 31 companies with at least 50 employees in France  were  audited.  Their  average  Gender  Equality  Index  is 86.5/100,  maintaining  performance  at  a  high  level  compared  to 2020  and  2019.  The  company  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  published  its fourth annual Professional Equality Index, which reached 97/100.\n\nOutside  of  France,  the  Group  initiated  a  common  process  to assess the gender pay gap by creating an internal index based on the  French  index  but  tailored  to Air  Liquide's  global  presence.  It was deployed for the first time in 2019 for entities with more than 400 employees. The 2020 index, calculated in 2021, was 82/100 based on 61% coverage of the Group's employees.\n\nThis index is calculated on the basis of four criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 differences  in  remuneration,  calculated  for  job  position categories;\n- \u25a0 differences in salary raise percentages;\n- \u25a0 salary raises during maternity leave;\n- \u25a0 gender diversity among the 10 highest remunerations.\n\nThe  calculation  method  evolved  in  2020  to  provide  more granularity  by  taking  into  account  the  job  position  category (according  to  international  standards  such  as  the  Hay  method). The  subsidiaries  are  progressively  identifying  job  positions according to these standards to allow for a better comparison at the Group level and thus increase staff coverage.\n\n## 2.3.3.  Age\n\n## DISTRIBUTION OF EMPLOYEES BY AGE BRACKET IN 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group  is  committed  to  fostering  better  qualifications  and training  programs  for  young  people  to  facilitate  their  integration into the workplace.\n\nInternship  and  apprenticeship  contracts  are  encouraged.  In France,  542  young  people  have  benefited  from  work-study contracts  and  478 from  an  internship,  combining  theoretical learning at their university or school and a practical internship at Air Liquide.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Their  contribution  to  mentoring programs  (notably  the  Technical  Community  Leaders  program), and training programs aimed at younger generations will be further promoted.\n\nVarious  initiatives  have  been  introduced  within  the  Group  to ensure  the  support  and  engagement  of  employees  nearing retirement age. For example, in France:\n\n- \u25a0 24 people became skills sponsors following the pilot launched in France in 2018;\n- \u25a0 'Youth-employment  contracts'  were  continued.  They  include initiatives promoting the hiring and retention of older employees.\n\nThe  Group  has  international  exchange  programs  to  attract  and develop  young  talents:  the  ALLEX  program  for  engineers  and managers and the EVE program for vocational employees (more than 550 people since they were set up).\n\n## 2.3.4.  Nationality\n\nThere  are  35  different  nationalities  among  Air  Liquide's  senior managers.  The  Group's  Board  of  Directors  comprises  five nationalities. In terms of total employees, more than 140 different nationalities are employed by the Group.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF EMPLOYEES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.5.  Disability\n\nLaunched  in  2017  at  the  European  level,  the  HandivAirsity initiative  aims  to  encourage  diversity  by  integrating  people  with disabilities into teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Our  differences  make  our  performance'  This  slogan  carries  a strong  conviction. The  inclusion  of  disabilities  is  fully  in  line  with the policy to promote diversity within Air Liquide.\n\nThis  desire  is  not  new,  it  has  been  embodied  since  2007  in successive agreements in France which have advanced the policy of welcoming,  maintaining  and  promoting  the  professional development of people with disabilities. Air Liquide is committed to finding  solutions  to  keep  disabled  people  in  the  workplace.  The following adjustments are planned to compensate for disabilities in the workplace:\n\n- \u25a0 ergonomic  studies  and  adaptation  of  the  workstation  with regard to the capacities of the person;\n- \u25a0 specific equipment and tools;\n- \u25a0 adaptation of methods of access to work premises and specific training services;\n- \u25a0 transportation and moving assistance.\n\nAir  Liquide  makes  teams  aware  of  the  inclusion  of  disabilities  in order  to  facilitate  the  reception  and  professional  integration  of workers with disabilities in the Company. The French subsidiaries have awareness-raising plans in order to strengthen the level of information  for  all  players  and  fight  against  any  prejudices  that may persist. They participate in particular in DuoDay, a day where they  welcome  a  person  with  a  disability  paired  with  a  volunteer professional.\n\nWithin  a  scope  covering  around  5,500  employees  based  in France,  a  fifth  Disability  agreement  for  a  period  of  three  years (2020-2022)  was  signed  at  the  end  of  2019.  The  aim  of  this agreement is to continue with measures already implemented in favor of people with disabilities and thus further improve the direct employment rate to reach 4.2% in 2022 vs. 3.3% in 2018. In 2020, the rate was 4.35% (the rate for 2021 is still being determined).\n\nMore broadly  in  Europe,  other  concrete  actions  are  also  carried out  to  better  respond  to  ideas  in  the  field  and  accelerate  the recruitment  dynamic:  ambassador campaign, working group with managers, European 'Time to Act' hackathon in November 2021.\n\n## 2.3.6.  Network organization\n\nAir  Liquide  has  a  decentralized  organizational  structure  which relies  on  its  hubs  and  clusters  (groups  of  countries  or  entities). This  network  structure  on  a  global  scale  is  more  agile,  fosters initiative and strengthens proximity with customers.\n\nA  collaborative  work  platform  called  'Kite'  has  been  launched throughout the Group. Kite is changing every year to offer its users new services. The Group therefore provides employees with the opportunity  to  create  and  access  Google+  communities  through the Kite collaborative platform. These communities rally employees  on  subjects:  expertise,  tools,  events,  procedures, shared  interests,  etc.  They  transform  working  methods  by fostering flexibility, efficiency, diversity and collective intelligence.\n\nThis  network  structure  and  collaborative  platform  have  made  it possible,  during  this  pandemic  crisis,  to  maintain  an  efficient working structure and connections between employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

ANTICIPATING THE \"FUTURE OF WORK\"\n\nThe  'Future  of  Work'  cornerstone  focuses  on  identifying  the business  lines  and  skills  of  the  future.  To  do  so,  the  Human Resources teams must understand and anticipate trends that are likely to transform our business.\n\n## 2.4.1.  Business lines and skills\n\nThe aim is to implement an efficient action plan to help employees evolve at the same pace as their business line. To support each employee  in  this  new  technological  environment,  Air  Liquide University has developed:\n\n- \u25a0 a Business Academy, which was set up to strengthen key skills in the Group's business lines. Over 2,600 employees have had the opportunity to develop, thanks to the academy. In 2021, for the purpose of continuity of training, the majority sessions were held virtually and the process of the translation of the modules into  a  dozen  languages  was  initiated.  More  than  30%  of  the training sessions were conducted in the local language;\n- \u25a0 a 'digital passport', which consists of several self-assessment questionnaires  on  digital  culture  in  general,  but  also  on knowledge of Kite (the Group's collaborative work platform);\n- \u25a0 Data Summits (Data Strategy, Digital Marketing, Cybersecurity, etc.) have been made available to employees in order to move forward with the development of digital skill;\n- \u25a0 data  challenges  have  also  been  held.  These  competitions make  it  possible  to  share  data  skills  quickly  while  creating value.\n\n## 2.4.2.  Career-long training and development\n\nAir Liquide takes special care to develop its employees' skills and expertise. Several  ways  of  learning  are  provided.  Career development  can  take  place  throughout  careers  and  every individual must take a proactive approach.\n\nIn 2021, the percentage of Group employees who had at least one training  session  during  the  year  was  74%.  Despite  the  health crisis,  the  percentage  of  Group  employees  has  increased  from 65% to 74% in the last two years.\n\nThe online training offering is upgraded year by year and covers many topics such as safety, ethics, Human Resources processes, management, and, more recently, digital technology.\n\nA new  online  self-learning package  (#ILoveLearning)  was deployed in 2019 as part of a pilot by Air Liquide University. Since then, over 25,729 employees have used this self-service training.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF TRAINING TOPICS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough  its  programs  and  structure,  the  University,  which celebrated  its  10 th anniversary  in  2019,  supports  the  Group's strategic  initiatives  and  promotes  the  Air  Liquide  culture.  Today, the  University  is  present  at  a  Group  level  and  globally  promotes new ways of learning, in both traditional and non-traditional ways. As  such,  the  Company's  various  businesses  and  functions  can access tools to design their own programs.\n\nModern teaching methods, for adults, are coupled with formal and informal  skills,  online  training,  lessons,  support,  mentoring,  codevelopment, etc. The programs are as practical and relevant as possible,  and  use  role  play,  mock  exercises,  workshops,  case studies, guided discussions and various feedback mechanisms.\n\nIn  2021, amidst the pandemic crisis, the digital transformation of many  business  lines  and  increased  training  for  employees,  the University has once again launched two virtual campuses open to the entire Group, which revolve around four themes: Management &  Leadership,  Sales  &  Marketing,  Operational  Excellence, Innovation,  Climate  &  Energy  Transition  and  HR  professionals. This has resulted in 6,401 employees logged in to over 240 online sessions:  webinars,  virtual  classes,  online  lessons  and  learning paths. These events have, firstly, promoted interactions within the Group  thanks  to  participants  from  69  countries  and,  secondly, revealed employees' creative and teaching abilities: most sessions were  led  by  Company  executives  and  a  challenge  for  creating tutorials was held.\n\nAmong  the  University's  programs,  those  on  management  and leadership  cover  all  modern  management  situations,  thereby promoting the use of a shared language at a Group level. These programs help managers understand the increasingly volatile and complex  world  around  them  and  provide  the  Group  with  the relevant expertise to maintain its leadership position over the long term.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Shareholders: a long-term relationship\n\n## More than 64% of shareholders have\n\n## owned their shares for more than 10 years\n\nShareholders  have  been  contributing  to  and  supporting  the Group's growth since its creation. During the 2016 acquisition of Airgas,  they  once  again  confirmed  their  commitment  to  the Group's  growth  through  large-scale  involvement  in  the  capital increase  in  cash  with  preferential  subscription  rights.  Today,  it  is thanks  to  their  loyal  support  that  Air  Liquide  can  continue  to change  and  grow.  Air  Liquide's  long-term  profitable  growth strategy  and  its  commitment  to  its  Shareholders  are  therefore closely  linked.  By  promoting  individual  share  ownership,  through\n\nvarious  measures  in  place  and  by  offering  Shareholders  the expertise of its dedicated department, Air Liquide fosters a close relationship based on dialog with its Shareholders on a daily basis which focuses on the following key principles:\n\n- \u25a0 promoting long-term share investment;\n- \u25a0 encouraging shareholder loyalty through registered shares and the establishment of loyalty bonus policy;\n- \u25a0 promoting dialog and meetings, whether face-to-face or digital;\n- \u25a0 recognizing and promoting the Shareholder's key role.\n\n## DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL (AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021)\n\n|                                        | 2012   | 2013   | 2014   | 2015   | 2016        | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Individual shareholders                | 37%    | 36%    | 37%    | 36%    | 33%         | 32%    | 32%    | 32%    | 3   3% | 33%    |\n| French institutional investors         | 19%    | 19%    | 17%    | 18%    | 20 %  \u207d \u00aa \u207e | 19%    | 18%    | 17%    | 16%    | 15%    |\n| Non-French institutional investors     | 45%    | 45%    | 46%    | 46%    | 47 %  \u207d \u00aa \u207e | 49%    | 50%    | 51%    | 51%    | 52%    |\n| Treasury shares                        | > 0 %  | > 0 %  | > 0 %  | > 0 %  | > 0 %       | > 0 %  | > 0 %  | > 0 %  | > 0 %  | > 0 %  |\n| Registered capital                     | 36%    | 36%    | 35%    | 36%    | 33%         | 34%    | 35%    | 34%    | 34%    | 34%    |\n| Capital eligible for the loyalty bonus | 29%    | 30%    | 30%    | 30%    | 26%         | 25%    | 26%    | 28%    | 28%    | 28%    |\n\n(a) In 2016, the proportion of institutional investors in the Group's capital increased due to their over-subscription to the capital increase.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  regularly  rewarded  for  the  quality  of  its  financial communication  and  its  transparency,  particularly  for  subjects related  to  corporate  social  responsibility  (CSR).  In  2021,  the Group  received  the  bronze  trophy  for  the  best  Shareholder services in the CAC 40 awarded by Le Revenu. The Group was also  awarded  the  Golden  Palm  for  Young  Shareholders  by  the EDHEC  Business  School  and  the  Federation  of  Individual Investors  and  Investment  Clubs  (F2iC).  For  its  shareholder democracy  policy,  the  Group  received  three  awards:  it  received the  Grand  Prize  for  shareholder  democracy  awarded  by  the Institute  of  Responsible  Capitalism,  the  prize  for  shareholder democracy  awarded  at  the  Boursorama  Investor  Awards  and finally  the  second prize for shareholder democracy, transparency of information and quality of communication at the 2021 Corporate Governance Grand Prizes awarded by AGEFI.\n\nThe Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is directly involved in General  Meetings,  events  with  Shareholders  and  Shareholders' Communication Committee (SCC).\n\n## 3.1.   A STEADY LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE AND AN ATTRACTIVE REMUNERATION POLICY\n\nSince  its  initial  public  offering  in  1913,  Air  Liquide  has  always shown a profit and shared the fruits of its growth by rewarding its Shareholders'  trust  through  a  remuneration  and  loyalty  policy based  on  regular  dividend  distribution,  allocation  of  free  shares, and  a  loyalty  bonus  program.  As  a  result,  more  than  50%  of earnings  over  the  last  10  years  have  been  distributed  to Shareholders.\n\n## 3.2.   CUSTOMIZED SERVICES\n\nThe Shareholder Services Department, with more than 40  employees  and  experts,  is  dedicated  to  Air  Liquide's Shareholders.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  at  the  disposal  of  all  its  Shareholders,  whether institutional or individual, 'bearer' or 'registered' shareholders, to inform  them  and  support  them.  In  addition  to  its  steady performance  and  remuneration  policy,  Air  Liquide  promotes  the registration  of  shares  in  order  to  enhance  the  value  of  the investment in shares and build long-term Shareholder loyalty.\n\nIn  2017,  the  Shareholder  Services  Department  launched  its 'Shareholder  Journey'  approach  to  continue  strengthening  the quality  of  service  to  Shareholders.  This  global  approach  of listening  closely  to  Shareholders  and  their  expectations  aims  to make  administrative  formalities  more  fluid  by  offering  more personalized  services,  ensuring  better  and  wider  circulation  of strategy and financial information, for example with live broadcasts of events for Group Shareholders. The latest digital tools are also at the heart of this initiative, as they provide a formidable lever for multiplication and personalization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Registered Shareholder services\n\nRegistered  shares  eligible for a loyalty bonus:  to  thank shareholders for their loyalty, they are eligible for a loyalty bonus after  holding  their  shares  in  registered  form  for  two  full  calendar years. They receive a +10% increase in the amount of dividends paid  and  +10%  more  free  shares  distributed  during  free  share attributions.  Shareholders  automatically  benefit  from  the  loyalty bonus and do not have to take any steps in this regard: the only requirement is that they hold their shares in registered form on the day  the  dividend  is  paid  or  on  the  day  the  free  shares  are attributed.\n\n## DIFFERENT SHAREHOLDING OPTIONS\n\n## 'Direct registered' shares\n\nThe  Shareholder  holds  a  securities  account  directly  with  Air  Liquide  without  using  a  financial  institution.  His  or  her  shares  are registered in his or her name in the Air Liquide register and are eligible for the loyalty bonus. As a reminder, it is impossible to open a PEA ( Plan d'\u00c9pargne en Actions ) or to convert shares from a PEA to 'direct registered' shares. The Shareholder's contact person is the Shareholder Services team.\n\n## 'Intermediary registered' shares\n\nThe shareholder holds a securities account or a PEA with his or her financial institution. He or she may ask his or her financial institution to convert his or her 'bearer' shares to 'administered registered' shares. 'Administered registered' shares are eligible for the loyalty bonus and are registered in his or her name in the Air Liquide register. The Shareholder's contact person remains his or her financial institution.\n\n## 'Bearer' shares\n\nThe shareholder holds a securities account or a PEA with his or her financial institution. The shares are held in 'bearer form' and the Shareholder's contact is his or her financial institution.\n\n## 3.2.2.  Innovation for the benefit of Shareholders\n\nIn 2020, Air Liquide set up a 100% digital securities account: from the  https://www.airliquide.com/  website,  in  a  few  minutes,  an individual  can  open  a  direct  registered  share  account  with Air Liquide by  supplying  digital supporting  documentation. Opening a securities account online has met with great success and  in  two  years  has  become  the  preferred  way  to  open  a securities account with Air Liquide ('direct registered').\n\nInformation  documents  and  media  for  Shareholders  such  as  the Annual  Report,  the  Shareholders'  Guide,  the  Shareholders' newsletter Interactions ,  the  Webzine Stock  &  Share and  the Invitation to General Meeting are drawn up with a particular focus on  education.  Comic  strips,  available  only  in  French,  have  been produced  for  young  Shareholders  (under  18  years  of  age)  and their legal representatives; they provide a better understanding of the  role  of  Shareholders  and  an  introduction  to  the  Group. Air Liquide also publishes, in the month after the event, a report on its  General  Meeting  available  at  https://www.airliquide.com/.  In addition, more frequent e-mails on major strategic events, such as the  announcement  of  the  Sustainable  Development  Objectives, have also made it possible  to  reach  our  individual  Shareholders more directly  and  maintain  the  connection  with  them. A  monthly newsletter covers topics of importance to Shareholders, whether it be Shareholder education or topics related to the Group's activity (hydrogen, bio-methane, space, etc.).\n\nAn FAQ  has  been  online since 2020 on the https:// www.airliquide.com/  website,  under  the  Shareholders  section;  it covers  key  topics  for  Shareholders  and  presents  the  most frequently asked questions with short and practical answers.\n\nShareholders who hold shares with Air Liquide ('direct registered Shareholders') have access to a secure online Shareholder Portal that allows them to place stock market orders online and to view the  transactions  carried  out  on  their  securities  account.  This Shareholder Portal was redesigned in 2021 and now offers a more intuitive  experience  and  new  functionalities.  It  also  offers  one  of the  lowest  brokerage  rates  on  the  market:  0.1%  excluding  VAT and with no minimum transaction.\n\nAir  Liquide manages a Shareholders' Communication Committee (SCC). The SCC is comprised of 12 Shareholders and is regularly consulted  on  subjects  relating  to  Shareholder  communication,  in addition to the three annual plenary meetings with the Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer. A  committee  member  is  part  of  the Air Liquide Foundation's Project Selection Committee.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  the  only  CAC  40  non-banking  company  which manages  internally  all  aspects  of  its  shares  on  behalf  of  its 117,000  direct  registered  shareholders:  account  administrationholding, record keeping and centralization of the General Meeting. It does not charge custodial or management fees. Broker fees are among  the  lowest  on  the  market  at  0.1%  excluding  VAT  for transactions  made  online  in  the  shareholders'  section  of  the company's website and paid for by bank card or direct debit. For transactions settled by other forms of payment in the shareholders' section  or  for  stock  market  orders  placed  by  another  means  of communication (e.g. telephone call or online request), broker fees are  0.18%.  In  addition,  there  is  no  minimum  purchase  or  sale amount for broker fees to apply.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\n## 3.2.3.  The General Meeting, the expression of Shareholder democracy\n\nEach  year,  all  Air  Liquide  Shareholders  who  hold  at  least  one share  are  invited  to  the  General  Meeting.  They  receive  all  the documentation relating to their vote more than one month before the  General  Meeting,  either  by  mail  or  by  email  in  the  case  of Shareholders who have opted for this means of communication. In accordance  with  the  principle  of  Shareholder  equality  to  which Air Liquide is very committed, each share entitles its owner to one vote. Air  Liquide  endeavors to make all this material available in English  to  its  non-French  Shareholders  in  similar  timeframes. Air Liquide centralizes its General Meeting by collecting the votes of its Shareholders directly and offers voting by Internet.\n\nIn  2021,  due  to  the  prolonged  health  crisis,  the  Assembly  was again  held  behind  closed  doors.  The  specific  mechanism  put  in place  in  2020  for  the  first  closed-door  Meeting  was  extended\n\n(introduction  of  a  system  allowing  written  questions  to  be  put  to the Chairman via the Internet, live broadcasting of the Meeting on demand).  In  2021,  Shareholders  could  record  their  questions (simple audio or video) before the Meeting and submit them to the Company  or  join  the  Meeting  by  teleconference  and  ask  their questions live. During the time usually devoted to the debate with the  audience (1) ,  the  Chairman  answered  the  most  frequently asked  questions  before  the  Meeting  as  well  as  those  submitted live (1) .  The  aim  of  this  system  was  to  maintain  the  Shareholder dialogue to which the Group is particularly committed.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  already  working,  and  will  continue  to  work,  with banks and specialized service providers of all kinds to identify and introduce reliable, secure solutions to enable all Shareholders to participate  in  the  General  Meeting,  both  at  the  physical  place  of meeting  and  remotely,  before  and  during  the  Meeting,  in accordance with legal rules.\n\n## THE SHAREHOLDER DEPARTMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\n\nIn line with the Group's objective to contribute to a more sustainable world, Air Liquide now encourages its shareholders to receive their documents electronically (account documents, General Meeting voting documents, the Shareholders' newsletter, etc.). If they wish, Shareholders may request that these various documents be sent by post. In addition, for mailings requiring film wrapping, the Shareholder Department uses a biosourced film, produced using a raw material that complies with France's NF T51-800 standard.\n\n## 3.3.   RECOGNIZING AND PROMOTING THE SHAREHOLDER'S KEY ROLE\n\nAir Liquide is committed to defending individual Shareholding and promoting investment in shares, a real challenge for society with a strong increase in the number of individual Shareholders observed since  the  health  crisis  of  2020.  The  Group  has  supported initiatives  such  as  those  of  the ANSA  (Association  nationale  des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions), the Observatoire des Actionnaires d'Avenir\n\nand the F2iC (the French Federation of Individual  Investors  and Investment Clubs), which contributed to the creation of the 'PEA Jeunes', a young person's personal equity plan under the PACTE act.\n\n## 3.4.   2021 STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL SHAREHOLDER RETURN\n\nIn  2021,  Air  Liquide's  shares  rose  +14.20%  (vs.  a  +28.85% increase for the CAC 40).Taken over a two-year period, including 2020 which was the pandemic year, the stock market performance of  Air  Liquide's  shares  was  up  +21.49%  (vs  +19.65%  for  the CAC 40).\n\nThere  have  been  30  free  share  attributions  since  1962,  i.e.  an average of one free share award every two years.\n\nAs of, December 31, 2021, the overall financial performance of the Air Liquide share, i.e. the rate of return on invested capital, or Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (2) , amounts to:\n\n## END OF 2021 DATA\n\n| TSR                           | 5 years   | 10 years   | 20 years   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|------------|------------|\n| Air Liquide registered shares | +14.83%   | +12.32%    | +11.43%    |\n| Air Liquide bearer shares     | +14.50%   | +11.85%    | +10.86%    |\n| CAC 40 reinvested dividends   | +11.06%   | +11.99%    | +5.50%     |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Individual Shareholders\n\nIndividual Shareholders have been contributing to and supporting the  Group's  growth  since  its  creation.  Shareholders'  trust  and loyalty  are  key  to Air  Liquide's  growth.  For  more  than  a  century, the Group has been dedicated to involving them in its growth and has  fostered  a  long-term  relationship  based  on  transparency, dialog and proximity.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  more  than  half  a  million  individual shareholders held 33% of the Group's capital; this represented the highest percentage among companies on the CAC 40.\n\nVery committed to individual shareholding, the Group launched a 100%  digital  communication  campaign  on  this  theme  in  spring 2021. A collection of seven visuals highlighting key themes in Air Liquide's development strategy (innovation, sustainable\n\ndevelopment, hydrogen, etc.) were posted on Facebook, Instagram,  LinkedIn  and  Twitter  until  the  end  of  June.  The objective  was  to  increase  knowledge  and  awareness  among 30-44 year olds, and almost 2 million of them were reached by this campaign. A new website, https:// deveniractionnaire.airliquide.com, only in French, was  also developed as part of this digital campaign to present Air Liquide's share performance, explain the Group's strategy and attract new Shareholders to open a share account with Air Liquide. In order to show the regularity and performance level of the Air Liquide share, a  simulator  allows  the  visitor  to  select  the  duration  and  amount and to compare the performance of the Air Liquide share and the Livret A (France most popular savings account). This simulator is now  integrated  into  the  www.airliquide.com  website  and  aims  to attract new individual Shareholders.\n\n## MEETING WITH SHAREHOLDERS\n\nThe  General  Meeting: in  voting  terms,  attendance  at  the  2021  General  Meeting  was  in  line  with  previous  years,  with  nearly 105,000 shareholders casting their votes remotely. Despite being held behind closed doors, the General Meeting was viewed by over 40,000 people either live or in playback mode - an all-time record.\n\nThe dates for the next Air Liquide Combined General Meeting are May 4, 2022 and  May 3, 2023.\n\n'Post-General Meeting' conferences: every year, following the General Meeting, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer visits several towns and cities in France to present the Group's results, strategy and outlook to shareholders. Given the pandemic crisis of 2021, these meetings had to be canceled. Likewise, the regional shareholder meetings attended by the Director of the Shareholder Department and associated teams also had to be canceled. In 2022, Air Liquide hopes to be able to organize these face-to-face meetings again, taking into account the health context.\n\nInvestor Day: Air Liquide took part in the 2021 edition which consisted of a week of digital meetings and a one-day event held on Tuesday,  November  23,  2021  at  Palais  Brongniart,  when  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  had  the  pleasure  of  talking directly  with  shareholders  during  a  presentation  about  the  Group's  strategy  and  outlook.  A  total  of  11,500  people  followed  the Air Liquide events live online, and more than 3,000 attended proceedings at Palais Brongniart on November 23. A large number of Air Liquide shareholders visited the Group's stand for a face-to-face chat after so many months of remote communication.\n\n## 3.5.2.  Institutional investors\n\nThe Investor Relations team met with more than 1,300 investors in 2021  during  7  roadshows,  36  conferences  and  many  individual meetings.

Serving customers and patients\n\nIn an increasingly dynamic and competitive environment, Air Liquide focuses its attention on its customers and their satisfaction  in  order  to  provide  them  with  long-term  growth.  To  strengthen  this  priority,  the  Group  Customer Department is supervised by a member of the Executive Committee.\n\n## COVID-19: AIR LIQUIDE'S TEAMS ARE MOBILIZED\n\nCovid-19:  Air  Liquide's  committed  teams  are  working  on  the  front  line  to  ensure  continuity  of  service  to  customers, caregivers and patients.\n\nThe onset of the pandemic saw Air Liquide teams around the world facing unprecedented constraints in how they operate. They demonstrated an exceptional level of commitment commensurate with the challenges they faced. Their motivation and dedication, supported by the collaborative digital tools adopted by the Group, have enabled them to deliver a high level of service, which was confirmed  by  the  above-average  satisfaction  scores  obtained  during  this  difficult  period.  Customers  have  sent  many  messages praising the responsiveness of Air Liquide's teams:\n\n- \u25a0 fast installation of equipment;\n- \u25a0 stable level of industrial and medical gas supply, and provision of additional volumes;\n- \u25a0 reorganization of support functions and customer service centers to support remote work.\n\nThe Health teams in particular quickly organized themselves to cope with the increase in requirements for medical oxygen, provide equipment  such  as  respirators  for  hospitals,  ensure  stabilized  patients  can  return  home  and  guarantee  chronic  patients  are continually monitored at home, and more specifically:\n\n- \u25a0 increased medical oxygen capacity worldwide to meet demand, with capacity in the most affected regions increased by a factor of  five,  sometimes  six  or  even  ten,  and  additional  volumes  imported  into  countries  experiencing  medical  oxygen  shortages, especially low- and middle-income countries;\n- \u25a0 home monitoring of patients with chronic illnesses during the lockdown either remotely via video or home visits in the case of the highest-risk patients, with strict application of health guidelines;\n- \u25a0 support  for  the  return  home  of  covid-19  patients  receiving  oxygen  therapy  or  suffering  from  other  conditions,  reducing  the burden on hospitals.\n\n## 4.1.   COMMITMENT TO INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS\n\nAir  Liquide  meets  the  needs  of  over  two  million  industrial customers  worldwide.  These  customers  come  from  sectors  as diverse as steel, agri-food, chemicals, water and waste management, electronics, crafts, etc. The Group's objective is to support  its  customers  by  providing  them  with  services  and solutions  that  are  both  innovative  and  reliable.  This  is  possible thanks to in-depth knowledge of each of their businesses.\n\nTo  assist  us  in  working  with  and  supporting  customers  and meeting their specific needs, the industrial structure is organized into three different activities:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Large industries\n\nThis  business  line  supplies  gas  and  energy  solutions  to  around 500  customers  in  the  metals,  chemicals,  refining  and  energy industries, which are essential to their own industrial production, to improve process efficiency and make  their plants more environmentally friendly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Industrial Merchant\n\nThe  Industrial  Merchant  business  line  serves  over  two  million customers  representing  a  very  diverse  range  of  sectors  and requirements:\n\n- \u25a0 Materials and Energy;\n- \u25a0 Automotive & Manufacturing;\n- \u25a0 Food & Pharmaceuticals;\n- \u25a0 Technology & Research;\n- \u25a0 Craftsmen & Retail.\n\nIt  offers  them  comprehensive  solutions  for  implementing  and optimizing industrial processes. Around 95% of the customer base in this sector is small customers who favor simplicity, flexibility and quality of service.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Electronics\n\nThis business area supports its customers in the semiconductor, flat  panel  and  photovoltaic  markets,  drawing  on  its  expertise, worldwide infrastructure and strategic partnerships with manufacturers.  The  products  and  services  it  offers  respond  to growing  consumer  demand  for  improved  mobility,  connectivity, processing power and energy savings.\n\nThe Group's organization allows each entity and industrial activity to respond to the specific expectations of local customers within its geographical  region,  thereby  building  a  close  relationship  with each  customer.  Customers  demand  flexibility,  responsiveness, service, availability and a genuine long-term partnership.\n\nIn addition, some international customers require fully coordinated global  management  services.  An  organization  dedicated  to strategic key accounts helps support them and meet their specific needs. This program relies on a team of Key Account Managers whose  mission  is  to  develop  in-depth  knowledge  of  those customers  so  that  they  can  better  respond  to  their  needs  and adopt a strategic alignment with their growth priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\n## 4.2.1. Home healthcare\n\nAs  a  leader  in  home  healthcare  in  Europe, Air  Liquide  provides care  in  the  home  for  people  with  chronic  diseases.  The  Group provides  respiratory  and  perfusion  assistance  solutions  (e.g.  for diabetes  or  Parkinson's).  Thanks  to  its  expert  multidisciplined teams, Air Liquide aims to increase patients' autonomy and quality of life,  improve their treatment compliance and lower their risk of relapse or rehospitalization.\n\nThe  Home  Healthcare  business  is  one  of  the  responses  to  the shift  to  outpatient  care  and  sits  at  the  heart  of  the  healthcare system between the patient, hospital or other healthcare facilities, doctors, nurses, health insurance organizations, pharmacists and others. It supplies the services, products  and/or  medical equipment  necessary  to  start  treatment  at  the  patient's  home, following the medical prescription, and trains the patients and their families  in  the  proper  use  of  devices. Air  Liquide  has  three  key leverages; its close human proximity to patients at home for over 30  years,  its  technical  knowledge  of  medical  devices  (whether connected or not), and its innovative strength, particularly in digital solutions. The Group therefore makes a major contribution to the continuum  of  care  by  ensuring  follow-up  care  for  patients  with chronic conditions. This business demands high-quality service on a  daily  basis  and  is  focused  on  the  long  term,  with  caregivers dedicated to improving the patient's quality of life.\n\n## 4.2.2.  Hospital businesses\n\nAir Liquide is one of the world leaders in medical gas production and distribution for hospitals and related services.\n\nThe  teams  work  alongside  healthcare  professionals  to  develop solutions  that  allow  them  to  take  care  of  their  patients,  often  at critical moments. Whether in emergency rooms, operating rooms, or intensive care units, Air Liquide's medical gases and associated services  make  it  possible  to  provide  care,  alleviate  pain, administer anesthetics and improve respiratory functions.\n\nAir Liquide offers services such as 'Total Gas Management' (TGM), which remains permanently at the hospital in order to optimize the supply of medical gases and monitor the different  supply  parameters  so  that  the  hospital  can  maintain efficiency. Air Liquide supports the transformation of hospital care and the development of outpatient care with a significant presence in the urban medical sector and other care centers that serve as an alternative to hospitals.\n\n## 4.2.3.  Diversification of care settings\n\nAir Liquide is interested in new alternative care locations between the home and the hospital, because it makes it possible to offer a continuity of care to patients, especially severe ones. The Group is already operating in this field through its local entities in Germany, for example, with the therapy apartments model, and in Italy with nursing care for patients with chronic conditions.\n\nAir Liquide's solutions are also dispensed by certain specialists in doctors'  practices  or  at  new  care  settings  outside  the  hospital. Healthcare professionals such as ambulance attendants, retirement  homes,  general  practitioners,  dermatologists  and dentists are local practitioners who play an essential role in caring for  patients  at  various  stages  in  their  continuum  of  care.  In response  to  changing  care  settings  and  healthcare  coordination issues,  Air  Liquide  provides  an  offering  tailored  to  their  specific needs, particularly in terms of mobility and responsiveness.\n\n## 4.2.4.  Societal initiatives in healthcare\n\nOn March 23, 2021, as part of its new sustainable development objectives,  the  Group  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  supporting patients, as defined in the 'Care for patients' pillar of its 'ACT for a sustainable  future'  objectives.  In  the  process,  the  Group  is demonstrating how it is shaping the transformation of healthcare worldwide,  both  through  the  contribution  of  its  healthcare businesses and its collaboration with the healthcare ecosystem.\n\nWorking alongside patients, healthcare professionals and hospitals, Air Liquide's healthcare teams strive to improve support for  patients  and  make  the  healthcare  system  efficient  and beneficial for everyone. As a key player in the healthcare sector, Air Liquide offers solutions in a wide range of care settings, from hospitals  and  at-home  care  to  community  healthcare  practices, long-term care facilities, and emergency services. Since the onset of the covid-19 global pandemic, the Group's healthcare business line has contributed to a positive impact on society.\n\nAs an expert in the supply of medical gases and related services, as well as in home healthcare services, Air Liquide has set itself two main goals:\n\n- a) improve the quality of life of patients living at home with chronic diseases in mature economies;\n- b) improve access to medical oxygen in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n## a) Improving the quality of life of patients living at home with chronic diseases in mature economies\n\nThe contribution of Air Liquide's home healthcare activities to the Group's CSR strategy will be based on its strong expertise in the care  and  monitoring  of  patients  living  at  home  with  chronic diseases. Air Liquide is committed to improving patients' quality of life by  raising  awareness  of  the  disease,  supporting  and empowering patients, helping them identify the outcomes that are most  important  to  them,  and  tailoring  our  healthcare  services  to their personal situation and lifestyle.\n\nThe Group is pursuing two sets of concrete measures to improve the care and benefits that matter most to patients:\n\n- \u25a0 develop  initiatives  in  partnership  with  patient  associations, healthcare professionals and institutions;\n- \u25a0 establish personalized care pathways.\n\nTo  take  these  measures  further,  the  Group  has  set  up  a  strong global  organizational  structure  in  19  countries  (mainly  in  Europe but also in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions). It consists of a multidisciplinary  task  force  mandated  with  building  a  strategic vision, supporting the roll-out and monitoring of action taken using appropriate monitoring indicators, and coordinating an international  champions  network  in  the  countries  who  are responsible  for  rolling  out  the  measures  locally  and  reporting  on them.\n\n## Developing initiatives in partnership with patient associations, healthcare professionals and institutions\n\nAir Liquide's healthcare teams work with patient communities on a daily  basis  to  increase  awareness  of  illnesses  and  treatments, share knowledge with patients and caregivers, promote self-care, and ultimately improve patients' autonomy and quality of life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Geographically, most initiatives in 2021 were rolled out in Europe.\n\n- \u25a0 In  Germany,  VitalAire  is  developing  a  clinical  study  on  the closed-loop system (the combination of an insulin pump and a continuous  glucose  monitor)  for  type  1  diabetes  patients  in partnership  with  the  Hanover-based  Auf  der  Bult  center  of excellence, which specializes in childhood diabetes. The main purpose is to improve the quality of life of children with type 1 diabetes.  The  combination  of  technology  and  service  helps maintain  glucose  at  acceptable  levels  and  provides  better control over diabetes. It also reduces the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and improves user satisfaction.\n- \u25a0 In  Brazil,  Air  Liquide  Healthcare  is  working  on  an  initiative aimed at increasing awareness of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  and  its  treatments  and  improving  the  quality  of  life  of ALS patients through greater patient knowledge and caregiver training. The initiative is being conducted in collaboration with the  Paulo  Gontijo  Institute  and  the  Associa\u00e7\u00e3o  Pr\u00f3-Cura  da ELA. Digital tools such as videos, articles and webinars have been  made  available  to  patients  and  caregivers.  This educational  material  gives  patients  and  caregivers  a  better understanding of the condition and its treatment, especially the therapeutic  use  of  mechanical  ventilation.  Ultimately  patients are more autonomous in managing their treatment.\n\n## Establishing personalized care plan pathways\n\nPersonalized  care  pathways  mean  that  healthcare  services  are defined based on 'what really matters' to patients, their health and their lifestyle, and  on  expected  clinical  and  quality-of-life outcomes.\n\nPersonalized  care  pathways  are  the  foundation  of  service excellence, with services tailored to the patient's needs and better patient benefits at the best cost for all.\n\n| Key indicator                                                                                     | As of December 31, 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Percentage of patients with personalized care pathways (treatment adherence & outcome-based care) | 38%                       |\n| Number of patients with personalized care pathways (treatment adherence & outcome-based care)     | 671,000                   |\n\n## The Group have developed two different levels of personalization:\n\n- \u25a0 Treatment adherence: the first level of personalization involves measuring  the  patient's  treatment  adherence,  collecting  and analyzing patient data through the connected medical devices used  by  the  patient,  and  then  tailoring  the  services  to  the patient's  needs.  This  level  of  personalized  health  services  is well developed in countries such as France and Spain for sleep apnea, and the goal is to extend this level of personalization to various  target  countries  and  to  the  different  diseases  and therapies covered by the healthcare businesses.\n- \u25a0 Patient  benefit-oriented  care:  this  corresponds  to  a  second level  of  personalization  and  is  designed  to  improve  the patient's  clinical  and  quality-of-life  outcomes.  Understanding the  individual  characteristics  (behavior  and  lifestyles,  social environment) of each patient allows to tailor healthcare service to  their  profile  and  define  it  based  on  expected  clinical  and quality-of-life outcomes.\n\nAir Liquide has started implementing this value-based healthcare model in countries such as Spain and France, focusing on patients with sleep apnea and/or receiving ventilation treatment. Our goal is  to  steadily  develop  this  level  of  personalization  in  other countries and for other therapies.\n\n## SLEEP APNEA TREATMENT\n\nHealthcare  services  designed  for  sleep  apnea  in  France,  with  special  care  for  the  first  100  days  of  treatment  (key  to  patient adherence), are an example of an adherence-based model. Using mainly remote monitoring technology, Air Liquide collects patient compliance  data  and  react  quickly  to  the  various  alerts,  which  allows  to  tailor  the  patient's  care.  The  Group's  pathology-trained teams use the most appropriate channel to interact with the patient (home visits, telephone calls, text messages, etc.) and provide them with support tailored to their needs and in keeping with expected clinical and quality-of-life outcomes. Benefits for the patient are better adaptation to therapy, greater treatment adherence, and better sleep quality, all of which leads to improved quality of life.\n\n## PIMA, IN SPAIN\n\nPIMA, an outcome-based care model, was the first personalized program developed by Air Liquide's Home Healthcare teams for sleep apnea patients in Spain. Thanks to the introduction of care pathways tailored to each patient's profile, appropriate support at different  stages  of  the  patient's  journey,  and  ongoing  outcome  measurement,  patients  have  more  autonomy  in  managing  their treatment, greater adherence to their therapy, and better sleep and quality of life. This program, which is based on the principles of 'value in healthcare,' was recognized in 2020 by the Value-Based Healthcare Center Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Acute  phases  can  be treated simply with antibiotics and oxygen therapy.\n\nImproving access to medical oxygen can be an important way to have  a  positive  impact  on  populations  of  the  African  continent, especially children.\n\n| Key indicator                                                                               | As of December 31, 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Cumulative population facilitated with access to oxygen in low- and middle-income countries | 1,032,000                 |\n\nOn this issue, in 2021 the Group's teams launched several initiatives, either on their own or in partnership with international organizations involved in development aid and sharing the same ambition of addressing healthcare issues in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nAccess Oxygen is an 'inclusive' healthcare offer supported by Air Liquide's Development Aid team that provides a reliable, affordable and sustainable oxygen therapy solution to rural and peri-urban populations in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n## ACCESS OXYGEN IN SENEGAL\n\nIn  partnership  with  an  international  development  organization  since  2016, Access  Oxygen  rolled  out  an  initiative  in  Senegal  to facilitate access to oxygen and help reduce pneumonia-related child mortality.\n\nUnder the program, Access Oxygen has equipped 64 rural health facilities in three of the country's districts (Popenguine, Medina Yoro Foulah and Kolda). The Access Oxygen program has also responded to the covid-19 pandemic in Senegal.\n\n## PARTNERSHIP WITH UNJANI CLINICS IN SOUTH AFRICA\n\nUnjani Clinics is a private network of more than 90 primary care clinics aimed at improving access to healthcare for middle-class South Africans in rural and peri-urban areas. It also plays an important role in South Africa's transformation program to empower young black women.\n\nThe  idea  behind  this  three-year  partnership  with  Unjani  Clinics  is  to  use  the  Unjani  network  to  promote  and  expand  access  to comprehensive and sustainable oxygen therapy.\n\nVitalAire, Air Liquide's local home healthcare subsidiary, provides training and helps increase the skills of medical personnel working with oxygen therapy and related equipment.\n\nIt is estimated that around half a million people in peri-urban and rural communities could benefit from this partnership.\n\n## 4.3.   FROM LISTENING TO ACTION\n\nSince  2017,  the  Group  has  been  directed  toward  a  customercentric transformation, boosted  by  a  customer  experience management tool called 'Voice of Customer' (VoC). This solution provides all entities with the ability to regularly poll (through digital channels)  an  unlimited  number  of  customers,  analyze  their comments  in  real  time,  identify  dissatisfied  customers,  contact them again and take the necessary steps to address the reasons for their dissatisfaction. Thanks to the broad sharing of customer comments  at  every  level  of  the  Group,  appropriate  action  plans have  been  identified  and  put  in  place  to  improve  the  customer experience.\n\nThis VoC platform was launched in March 2017 and has already been  deployed  in  over  60  countries.  Feedback  from  tens  of thousands  of  customers  has  been  collected  and  analyzed, highlighting each subsidiary's priorities. Furthermore, in 2018 the Group  decided  to  launch  transactional  surveys  to  measure satisfaction at key stages of the customer experience (offer, order, delivery,  invoicing,  technical  service).  This  new  approach  means that  customer  comments  can  be  collected  and  analyzed  in  real time.  All  this  information  allows  the  local  teams  to  identify problems  and  to  fix  them  quickly  by  continuously  streamlining processes  and  flows  to  provide  the  highest  quality  of  customer experience.",

It measures how likely customers are to recommend the Group by asking a simple question:\n\n## 'On  a  scale  of  0  to  10,  how  likely  are  you  to  recommend Air Liquide as a supplier?'\n\nThis  indicator  is  tracked  in  all  the  business  units  and  in  most geographies, giving the Group a common indicator to measure the satisfaction of its customers, better respond to their expectations and improve overall performance.\n\nEach campaign is followed by an in-depth analysis of responses. Following this analysis, action plans are produced to improve the customer experience.\n\nThe  scores  given  by  customers  are  accompanied  by  comments and improvement suggestions.

Suppliers and sustainable procurement\n\nAir Liquide strives to build long-lasting and balanced relationships with  its  suppliers,  in  an  environment  of  mutual  trust.  The  Group attaches great importance to its suppliers' ability to offer long-term partnerships  and  ensure  a  high  level  of  safety,  reliability, competitiveness  and  innovation,  while  guaranteeing  that  ethics and sustainable development are also taken into account. These principles are set out in the following documents:\n\n- \u25a0 the Procurement  Code  of  Conduct ,  translated  into  several languages, which applies to all Group employees engaged in Procurement activities;\n- \u25a0 the Sustainable Procurement policy , updated in 2019, which lays  out  the  guidelines  to  be  applied  by  the  procurement departments  to  integrate  ethical,  social  and  environmental aspects  into  their  procurement  processes,  and  defines  the prevention approach for related supplier risks;\n- \u25a0 a CSR  commitment  clause (covering  compliance  with  the Supplier's  Code  of  Conduct,  safety,  and  the  environment)  is included  in  the  contract  templates  used  by  the  Procurement teams and signed by suppliers;\n- \u25a0 the Supplier Code of Conduct is  publicly  accessible  on  the Air Liquide website https://www.airliquide.com/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-procurement. It is available in 14 languages and is designed to promote and ensure all our suppliers  respect  practices  relating  to  Human  Rights,  ethics, environmental protection and safety.\n\n## 5.1.   SUPPLIER MAPPING\n\nAs part of its monitoring process, the Group maps its critical CSR suppliers according to four main criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide current spend with the supplier;\n- \u25a0 the risk relating to the nature of the supplier's activity;\n- \u25a0 the risk relating to the country where the supplier carries out its main activities; and\n- \u25a0 the supplier's dependency on Air Liquide.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  has  identified  1,007  suppliers  as  being  the most exposed to a sustainability risk.\n\nIn  2021,  249  suppliers  were  assessed,  i.e.  83%  of  the  suppliers invited to the assessment campaign. Moreover, 105 non-compliant or  suppliers  or  needing  improvement  have  prepared  corrective action plans.\n\n## 5.2.   SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT TRAINING AND AWARENESS\n\nSeveral  measures  have  been  implemented  to  raise  awareness and train buyers in the Group's Sustainable Procurement process, thus strengthening  its deployment  within  the  organization. Sustainable Procurement training modules have been developed. They are aimed at Group's entire Purchasing population and for critical suppliers, and serve to:\n\n- \u25a0 show  the  consistency  between  the  Sustainable  Procurement approach and the Group's strategy;\n- \u25a0 explain  the  challenges  of  the  Sustainable  Procurement approach and position it as a source of value creation;\n- \u25a0 present various tools to facilitate the roll-out of this approach.\n\nIn  2021,  Air  Liquide  held  training  courses  in  Chinese,  English, French  and  Russian  for  buyers  and  suppliers.  Training  courses are organized by topic and geographical region. Some cover the onboarding  of  new  suppliers,  the  implementation  of  corrective action plans, the internal assessment questionnaire, and socially inclusive  procurement.  In  total,  around  282  buyers  and  some 100 suppliers were trained in 2021.\n\n## Sustainable procurement for all\n\nSince 2018, Air Liquide has organized four annual editions of the 'STPA Business Meeting' bringing together Air Liquide key players and companies in the disability sector to promote socially inclusive procurement.  In  2021,  the  'STPA  Business  Meeting,'  co-hosted with  the  Handeco  association,  was  held  in  digital  format  via presentations and speed-meetings in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. 180 Air Liquide employees and 10 suppliers from the disability sector participated.\n\nIn  addition,  and  for  the  first  time  this  year,  a  European  Inclusive Procurement Forum brought together nearly 200 Group participants. During this Forum, examples of actions implemented in  Germany,  Spain  and  Switzerland  were  shared  to  increase awareness of and relations with the disability sector.\n\nAir  Liquide was also present at the HandiHA digital trade fair for the third consecutive year. This event provides the opportunity for meetings between contractors and companies to promote socially inclusive procurement. This year, the Group Procurement Director took part in a roundtable.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Civil society: actions of the Air Liquide Foundation\n\nEstablished in 2008, the Air Liquide Foundation supports medical and  environmental  research  projects  as  well  as  programs  for workplace  integration  through  technical  jobs,  targeted  at  young people in particular. The Foundation is supported in this mission by  the  expertise  and  geographic  presence  of  the  Air  Liquide\n\nGroup.  The  aim  of  the  Foundation  is  to  use  its  experience, flexibility and  upstream  involvement  in  related  projects  to complement public-sector initiatives.\n\n## COVID-19: AN EXCEPTIONAL COMMITMENT\n\n## The Foundation takes unprecedented action in response to the pandemic\n\nIn March 2020, in response to the health and social crisis, the Air Liquide Foundation launched its 'covid-19 Initiative,' whereby it made an exceptional additional allocation of more than two million euros available over two years. Its objective is twofold:\n\n- \u25a0 to support scientific research projects on respiratory damage caused by the Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus, a health issue close to the heart of the Foundation's longstanding work;\n- \u25a0 to provide greater assistance to partner associations working in the field with groups who are most affected by the disease and the impact of lockdown. Its supported projects supply health kits, food supplies and protective equipment, and also play a role in maintaining social connections with the most disadvantaged and combating school dropout.\n\nIn 2021, the Foundation continued its efforts to deepen its understanding of the illness and help those who are most vulnerable. For example,  in  2020,  the  Committee  and  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  45  covid-19  projects  worldwide,  comprising  11  research projects and 34 social projects.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  year,  the  Foundation  met  researchers'  expectations  by  holding  a  one-day  seminar  on  'gaining  a  better understanding of the covid-19 virus.' The event brought together 6 of the 11 supported research groups to discuss 3 topics:\n\n- \u25a0 gaining a better understanding of how the virus affects the lungs and how it is transmitted;\n- \u25a0 identifying predictive biomarkers in disease progression;\n- \u25a0 understanding the long-term effects of the disease (long covid) and identifying treatment options.\n\nThe seminar showed how much progress had been made in this research - which will also benefit other respiratory diseases - as well as how much work remained to be done on this new disease. The event was a huge success with the invited teams, opening the door to future cooperation between them. The researchers also had the opportunity to discuss new needs, which the Foundation will endeavor to address in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, the Foundation approved 39 projects in 12 countries:\n\n- \u25a0 6 scientific research and education projects on air quality and respiratory diseases;\n- \u25a0 33 'Acting within local communities' projects in fields including occupational  integration,  education  and  training,  access  to care,  disability, social  welfare,  and  covid-19  emergency assistance.\n\nSince  its  creation  in  2008,  the  Air  Liquide  Foundation  has supported over 470 projects in 52 countries.\n\nRequests for project support can be submitted directly online to a dedicated  website,  available  in  French  or  English.

The project consists in developing a new air quality indicator, Oxidative Potential, which is the true reflection of air quality's impact on  human  health  (unlike  the  current  indicator  which  measures  particulate  mass  but  does  not  take  into account the chemical speciation of the particulates).\n\nIn 2021 the Foundation supported a new environmental research project: the Free University of Brussels' TAPIR project, which will provide satellite mapping (qualitative and quantitative) of ammonia (NH3) pollution in the atmosphere.\n\n- \u25a0 medical research on chronic or rare respiratory diseases;\n- \u25a0 environmental research on air composition, especially atmospheric chemistry, given the importance of better understanding the environments we inhabit.\n\n<!-- image -->",

THE FOUNDATION AND EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\nFrom its inception, the Air Liquide Foundation has always sought to involve the Group's employees in its work. This is still one of its distinctive  characteristics  today. As  such,  it  gives  employees  the opportunity  to  express  their  social  and  human  commitment  and become stakeholders in the Foundation's work.\n\nGroup  employees  are  encouraged  to  recommend  projects  for organizations close to their hearts.\n\nFurthermore,  all  projects  are  assessed  and  monitored  by  the Foundation with the support of employees.\n\nScientific  projects  are  assessed  and  monitored  by  medical experts, researchers at the Research Center or physicians. Local development projects are supported by employees who work near these projects. The Foundation thereby provides employees with the opportunity to take part in community work.\n\nThe  role  of  an  employee  responsible  for  project  monitoring  is broken down into three steps:\n\n- \u25a0 making contact and project feasibility study;\n- \u25a0 follow-up and support;\n- \u25a0 final assessment.\n\n## SHAREHOLDERS AND THE AIR LIQUIDE FOUNDATION\n\nAir  Liquide  shareholders  also  contribute  to  the  Foundation's  missions.  A  shareholder  on  the  Shareholders'  Communication Committee (SCC) is an automatic member of the Project Selection Committee. The representation of shareholders in this way is a special feature of the Air Liquide Foundation. Their presence is important: the shareholder provides an external perspective, while being familiar with the Group. The other members of the Selection Committee are Group employees, representing the diversity of the Group's business interests.\n\nIn November 2021, a fundraising campaign was organized for the first time for direct registered shareholders to help finance three groups of projects:\n\n- \u25a0 a long-covid medical research project;\n- \u25a0 Gaelle Uzu's 'Predict'Air' environmental research project, by means of additional funding;\n- \u25a0 two professional integration projects: 'Apprentis Solidaires,' run by French non-profit association AFEV in Metz, and a digital integration project run by the Simplon Foundation in the Paris region.\n\nThe purpose of the campaign is to raise additional funds for those causes. Donor shareholders will be kept informed of how their donation is being used.\n\nThe Foundation will also put donor shareholders directly in touch with the projects they are supporting.\n\nThe Foundation wants to further involve employees in implementing  local  development  projects  through  skills-based sponsorship.  Organizations  supported  by  the  Foundation  will  be able to benefit from employees' professional skills. With regard to professional  integration,  the  Foundation's  partnership  with  local Air Liquide teams also means that young people without a network of  contacts  have  the  opportunity  to  visit  sites,  learn  more  about technical  professions,  take  up  internship  offers  or  talk  to  sector professionals.\n\nCurrently, hundreds of employees are involved in the Foundation's actions.\n\nFor  example,  under  the  partnership  with  the  Sport  dans  la  Ville non-profit association, employees from Air Liquide Sant\u00e9 France, Air  Liquide  Advanced  Technologies  and  ORKYN'  have  hosted young people for site visits and eighth-grade work experience, as well as participated in job search workshops to help students draft their resume and cover letter.\n\n<!-- image -->",

LOCAL CORPORATE PHILANTHROPY INITIATIVES\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Air  Liquide  Foundation's  initiatives,  subsidiaries  are  also  directly  involved  with  communities  throughout  the  world, supporting  local  corporate  philanthropy  initiatives.  In  addition  to  financial  support,  these  actions  are  successfully  conducted  with  the enthusiastic involvement of employees.\n\n## SOLIDARITY CHALLENGE\n\nIn June 2021, employees at Alizent (the subsidiary tasked with developing IT systems) in Europe, Asia and North America took part in a solidarity challenge to strengthen team cohesion and encourage them to be more physically active. Specifically they focused on an environmental project with international scope. A total of 98 employees participated, raising 10,000 euros.\n\nThe teams chose the scientific project supported by the Air Liquide Foundation called Ice Memory, a global program to preserve the memory of glaciers threatened by global warming. Its goal is to build a collection of glacial ice cores, which are true archives of the air's composition, and analyze them for changes and how these might impact the climate.\n\n## CORPORATE VOLUNTEER PROGRAM\n\nAir  Liquide  Brazil  created  a  corporate  volunteer  program  through  its  corporate  social  responsibility  committee  to  encourage employees to get involved in social initiatives held exclusively online during the pandemic.\n\nIn partnership with the Franco-Brazilian charity Arca de Noe - which works for education and professional training projects in the Vila Prudente favela in S\u00e3o Paulo - 21 Air Liquide Brazil employees talked about their career paths and gave advice on how best to integrate into the job market.\n\nTheir videos, which lasted between three and five minutes each, were shown and discussed during class with the aim of inspiring and building confidence among young students.\n\n## SOUTH AFRICA\n\nIn South Africa, employees got together to provide gifts, clothing and toys for children at the Janelle House shelter in Evander, an area just outside Secunda. Janelle House is a facility for children who were abandoned at an early age and they are allowed to stay there until they turn 18. After spending a day with the children, the employees gave a monetary donation to Janelle House so it could expand the living space and purchase other necessary equipment.\n\n## 7. Relations with the public sphere\n\nAir  Liquide  is  actively  involved  in  discussions,  consultations  and public  authority  work,  as  well  as  with  professional  associations, think tanks and NGOs in the Group's areas of expertise.\n\nAir  Liquide  has  produced  a  Public Affairs  Charter  governing  the Group's  interactions  with  public  authorities  at  the  national, regional/European and international level in order to stay ahead of risks  related  to  regulatory  changes,  identify  opportunities  for growth, and involve Air Liquide in the public debate on sectors in which the Group has a legitimate interest.\n\nThis policy specifies that the Group will work with stakeholders in a constructive and transparent manner, following ethical rules and respecting political neutrality. All action is conducted in accordance with guidelines on interest representation.\n\nAccordingly,  Air  Liquide  is  listed  (voluntarily  since  2011)  in  the 'Transparency  Register'  of  European  institutions,  in  the  French 'Interest Representatives' register, created in 2017 and managed by  the  High  Authority  of  Transparency  in  Public  Life  (Haute Autorit\u00e9 pour la Transparence de la Vie Publique - HATVP), and in the  Lobbying  Disclosure  Act  database  of  the  U.S.  House  of Representatives.\n\nWorking within the European and International Affairs Department, the  team,  in  conjunction  with  the  various  geographical  operating entities  and  the  Group's  Business  Lines,  covers  the  following sectors: energy/hydrogen transition, circular economy, innovation, technologies, digital and health.\n\n- \u25a0 the energy transition and the environment by contributing to the development  of  energy  efficiency  and  alternative  energies (hydrogen,  biogas,  solar  and  wind  power,  etc.),  and  their applications,  especially  in  terms  of  industrial  decarbonization and  mobility;  the  energy  and  carbon  markets,  specifically regulatory changes in Europe and the development of regional markets in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa;\n- \u25a0 public  health  issues,  especially  access  to  care  during  a pandemic  (supply of medical oxygen, manufacture of respirators,  etc.,  during  the  covid-19  crisis),  home  care  for patients  with  chronic  diseases,  and  ad  hoc  initiatives  to  help deliver equipment and medical oxygen to some of Air Liquide's host countries in conjunction with authorities in France and the recipient countries;\n- \u25a0 opportunities  and  risks  related  to  the  digitalization  of  the economy, and geopolitical risks related to cybersecurity;\n- \u25a0 the defense of Air Liquide's shareholding model;\n- \u25a0 the  contribution  of  technologies,  particularly  to  space  and space exploration in Europe, quantum technology, electronics and semiconductors, among others;\n- \u25a0 environmental and societal reporting challenges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The task of these managers is to monitor public  initiatives  liable  to  impact  the  Group,  and  to  arrange interactions  with  local  and/or  regional  authorities  to  defend  Air Liquide's interests or promote our climate and healthcare system solutions. This network allows the Group to work on defining joint positions on cross-sectional challenges such as energy transition, the  circular  economy,  health  and  innovation,  and  to  share information on changes in societal challenges in different parts of the world.\n\nIt should  also  be  noted  that  the  Group  maintains  a  good relationship  with  its  respective  local  tax  authorities  and  is committed to paying taxes in all its countries of operation.\n\nAir  Liquide's  Public  Affairs  policy  also  aims  to  establish  and develop constructive and sustainable relationships, in Air Liquide's various sectors of operation, with:\n\n- \u25a0 public authorities;\n- \u25a0 professional  bodies  which  represent  the  Group's  industry sectors;\n- \u25a0 other actors such as NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and think tanks.\n\nThese  interactions  can  take  place  either  directly  or  through professional  bodies  such  as  the  World  Hydrogen  Council,  the European  Industrial  Gases  Association  (EIGA),  the  European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT) and France Hydrog\u00e8ne.\n\nIn December 2021, Air Liquide published on its website its Public Affairs  Charter.  It  can  be  viewed  at:  https://www.airliquide.com/ sustainable-development/engagement-public-stakeholders.\n\nPublic projects or events in which the Group participated in 2021 include:\n\n- \u25a0 In France:\n- -The launch of France's National Hydrogen Council (CNH). On  January  11,  2021  Barbara  Pompili,  Minister  for  the Ecological  Transition,  Bruno  Le  Maire,  Minister  of  the Economy,  Finance  and  the  Recovery,  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique  Vidal, Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, and Agn\u00e8s  Pannier-Runacher,  Minister  Delegate  for  Industry, announced  the  establishment  of  a  National  Hydrogen Council (CNH), to come under the umbrella of the National Industry  Council,  to  ensure  France's  national  hydrogen strategy is implemented effectively. Beno\u00eet Potier, Air  Liquide's  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  was appointed  co-chairman  of  the  CNH  and  has  played  an active  role  in  the  Council's  development.  The  role  of  the CNH  is  to  structure  discussions  between  the  French government  and  stakeholders  in  the  national  strategy  for renewable,  low-carbon  hydrogen  development.  Meetings are  held  on  a  regular  basis  so  that  members  can  closely monitor how the strategy is being implemented. In this way, the  CNH  is  helping  to  develop  a  competitive  renewable, low-carbon hydrogen sector in France.\n- \u25a0 In Europe:\n- -the  European  Commission's  public  consultations  prior  to publishing its legislative proposals on Energy (the July and December Fit for 55% packages);\n- -the Commission's consultation on data and digital services in healthcare;\n- -the  European  Commission's  contribution  to  the  European Clean Hydrogen Alliance;\n- -the  Commission's  new  expert  group  on  policies  and programs relating to the EU  space,  defense  and aeronautics industry;\n- -calls  for  tenders  issued  by  France's  Innovation  Fund  and major projects of common European interest;\n- -the  hydrogen  task  force  within  Medef  International  for  the purpose of developing and guiding how France's ecosystem can contribute to hydrogen programs internationally.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this context of recovery of activity, and a return to the field after a year 2020 in partial containment for some regions, the lost time injury frequency rate for Air Liquide employees increased slightly to 1.1 at the end of 2021, compared to 0.9 at the end of 2020. Despite this deterioration compared to last year, the safety performance remains better than that of 2019, when the lost-time accident frequency rate for Air Liquide employees was 1.2. It is therefore necessary to continue awareness and prevention actions in order to improve safety and significantly and sustainably reduce this lost time accident frequency rate.\n\nIn 2021, the Group recorded the death of four subcontractors on industrial sites.\n\nThe Group has made and will continue to make every effort to analyze all accidents that have occurred in order to learn from them and thus prevent them from happening again.",

These plants 'without chimneys' do not use any combustion processes. They are particularly  environmentally friendly, as they emit no CO2, sulfur oxide (SOx), or nitrogen oxide (NOx). They use electricity almost exclusively: worldwide they use around 4,800 MW equivalent at any  given moment. The electricity purchased from our energy suppliers and consumed by the Air  Separation Units is the source of indirect emissions (Scope 2). The cooling systems of these  units require back-up water.                             |\n| Hydrogen  and carbon  monoxide units  (HyCO)         | 54                             | Large hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units also produce steam for some customers.  The raw material used is primarily natural gas and a quantity of water required for the reaction  that produces hydrogen. Carbon monoxide is an essential raw material in the chemical industry  for producing plastics. The desulfurization of hydrocarbons to produce fuels with reduced sulfur  content is one of the main applications of hydrogen. These units emit CO2 and nitrogen oxides  (NOx),  but  virtually  no  sulfur  oxides  (SOx).  They  also  consume  electricity  and  their  cooling  circuits require back-up water.                                      |\n| Cogeneration units                                   | 19                             | Cogeneration  units  produce  steam  and  electricity  simultaneously.  They  consume  natural  gas  and  water,  mostly  converted  into  steam  and  supplied  to  customers.  The  steam  can  be  condensed  at  these  customers'  facilities  and  then  reused  in  the  cogeneration  unit.  In  most  cases, the electricity produced is supplied to the local electricity distribution network, which in  some  countries  can  be  used  to  power  the  Group's  other  units.  Combustion  of  natural  gas  produces  CO2  and  leads  to  low  nitrogen  oxide  (NOx)  emissions,  but  virtually  no  sulfur  oxide  (SOx) emissions.                         |\n| Acetylene units                                      | 55                             | These units produce acetylene, a gas primarily used in metal welding and cutting. 50 of these  units produce this gas through the decomposition of a solid (calcium carbide) using water. Two  units fill cylinders with this gas, which is supplied by another industrial company. This process  produces  lime,  at  least  90%  of  which  tends  to  be  recycled  in  industrial  and  agricultural  applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Nitrous oxide units                                  | 10                             | Nitrous  oxide  is  used  primarily  as  an  anesthetic  gas  in  the  healthcare  sector  and  as  a  sweetening agent in the food industry. It is produced from ammonium nitrate in solid form or as a  water-based solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Carbon dioxide  liquefaction and  purification units | 92                             | These units liquefy and purify carbon dioxide, which has many industrial applications, especially  in the food industry, where it is used to deep-freeze foods or produce carbonated beverages. Carbon dioxide is most often a by-product of chemical units operated by other manufacturers. In  certain cases, it is found naturally in underground deposits. In other cases, it comes from the Group's hydrogen and carbon monoxide units. It is purified and  liquefied  in  Air  Liquide  units  consuming  electricity  and  cooling  water.

The  Energy  category significantly increase in 2021 due to the significant variation in upstream emission factors (Well-to-Tank factors from the UK government database) as well as the inclusion in the reporting scope of assets acquired during the year (in particular the assets acquired from Sasol).\n\n## 2.3.3.  Reporting of emissions avoided\n\n|                                                                                    |   2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Emissions avoided due to the optimization of our assets  (in millions of tonnes)   |    4.6 |    4.6 |    4.6 |    3.6 |    3.3 |\n| Emissions avoided to improve our customers' energy footprint  (millions of tonnes) |   11.5 |   11   |   12.2 |   11.2 |   11.8 |\n| TOTAL AVOIDED EMISSIONS  (millions of tonnes) \u207d \u1d43 \u207e                                |   16.1 |   15.6 |   16.8 |   14.8 |   15.1 |\n\nEmissions avoided through the optimization of our assets decreased slightly by 0.3 Mt CO2. This reduction is explained by a decrease in asset load factors and thus a loss of efficiency, combined with a decrease in network emission billings.\n\nEmissions reductions enabled by the Group to its customers increased by 0.6 Mt CO2. This increased is explained by a recovery in steel production in Europe and America in 2021, leading to a increase in the supply of oxygen for oxycombustion processes.\n\nBased on other methodological approaches that consider the reduction of black carbon emissions through the use of ultra-low sulfur fuels, and by attributing these avoided emissions to the hydrogen used for desulfurization in refineries, Air Liquide's avoided emissions amount to 79.3 Mt CO2 (see Reporting methodology page 397).\n\n## 2.3.4.  Scopes calculation methodology\n\n## Scope 1\n\nThe majority of Air Liquide's Scope 1 emissions are from its hydrogen production and cogeneration units. Scope 1 emissions are the difference in carbon content between the natural gas consumed by these units and the carbon content of their products. Air Liquide also records direct emissions from the combustion of fuel in its truck fleet, as well as gas losses from its CO2 and nitrous oxide production units.",

In 2021 the Group improved the way it accounts for indirect emissions from electricity and steam purchases by moving from a 'location-based' approach based on the average emissions intensity of the national grid to a much more precise and specific approach known as the 'market-based' method, linked directly to supply contracts. In the absence of contractual information, when all or part of a site's electricity supply comes from the grid, a residual emission factor is used, in accordance with best practices. In the absence of reliable data on the residual mix, the grid emission factor is used, the latter accounting for approximately 40% of emissions. By using this method, the Group is adopting the Scope 2 emissions accounting method recommended by the GHG Protocol. The Group's electricity procurement initiatives, particularly those to voluntarily procure renewable electricity, are now directly reflected in the reported Scope 2 emissions figures.\n\n## Scope 3\n\n| Categories                                    | Scope                                                                                   | Methodology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 - Purchased goods  and services             | Products purchased from  a third party  corresponding to  operating expenses            | Spend-based methodology Emissions are estimated from the volumes of purchased products (\u20ac) multiplied by  emission factors provided by the ADEME and CEDA databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| 2 - Capital goods                             | Products purchased from  a third party  corresponding to  investment expenses           | Spend-based methodology The volumes of purchased products (\u20ac) are multiplied by emission factors provided  by the ADEME and CEDA databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| 3 - Energy (not  included in Scope 1  or 2)   | Purchases of energy,  steam and fuel                                                    | Average-based methodology The volumes purchased (GJ) are multiplied by upstream emission factors (Well-to- Tank)  supplied  on  a  per-country  and  per-fuel  type  basis  by  UK  Government  and  World Data Bank databases.                                                                                                                                                            |\n| 4 - Upstream  transportation                  | Upstream land, air, sea  transport and other  miscellaneous costs                       | Spend-based methodology Emissions  are  estimated  on  the  basis  of  contracted  transport  and  distribution  services  (\u20ac)  multiplied  by  emission  factors  provided  by  the  ADEME  and  CEDA  databases.                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| 5 - Waste                                     | Not reported                                                                            | Emissions  in  this  category  have  been  estimated  using  an  average-based  methodology and account for less than 1% of Scope 3.

Consequently, though the reported quantities of water withdrawn and returned to the source show an increase, the net water consumption, which is now more accurate as a result of improved actions, shows a -9% decrease compared with previous year.

WASTE AND BY-PRODUCTS\n\nAir Liquide wishes to be part of a process of continuous improvement of its environmental footprint regarding waste. To this end, in 2019, the  reporting  of  waste  and  by-products  changed  to  provide  a  more  comprehensive  view  of  the  types  of  waste  generated  and  their management.\n\nThis approach focuses on the three main hazardous waste groups at each site, allowing a better appreciation of the main environmental impacts associated with waste in each location. This new approach is to be refined in the coming years, in order to provide a view that will allow this environmental footprint to be managed more effectively within the Group.\n\n| Main hazardous waste   | % of sites which mentioned it as one of their  three main hazardous waste categories *   | Treatment mode   | Volume concerned *   |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Oils                   | 63.2%                                                                                    | Recycling        | 72.1%                |\n| Paints and solvents    | 8.2%                                                                                     | Incineration     | 89%                  |\n| Batteries              | 72%                                                                                      | Recycling        | 76.9%                |\n\nFor non-hazardous waste, the main waste groups are metal, paper, wood and plastics. More than half of the Group's sites provide a selective collection of this waste. More than 98% of metal is recycled at all sites.\n\n|                                                                                                                | 2017   | 2018   | 2019          | 2020         | 2021     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------|--------------|----------|\n| Non-hazardous waste and by-products                                                                            |        |        |               |              |          |\n| Annual quantity of lime produced (extracted by dry equivalent)  by the acetylene production units  (in tonnes) | 25,000 | 25,380 | 31,247        | 27,966       | 31,281   |\n| % recycled                                                                                                     | >90%   | >90%   | >90%          | >90%         | >90%     |\n| Metal waste  (in tonnes) \u207d \u00aa \u207e                                                                                 | 61,513 | 61,680 | 20,632  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e | 6,861  \u207d \u1d9c \u207e | 11,755 * |\n| % recycled                                                                                                     | >99%   | >99%   | >99%          | >99%         | >99%     |\n| TOTAL NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE AND BY-PRODUCTS  (estimate in tonnes)                                                | 86,513 | 87,060 | 51,879        | 34,827       | 43,036   |\n\n- (b) Decrease in 2019 following the end of the Airgas unused cylinder cleaning process.\n- (c) Decrease in 2020 following the divestment of a plant and an economic situation which has caused delays in the disposal of metal waste.\n\n<!-- image -->",

SPECIFIC INDICATORS FOR THE HOME HEALTHCARE BUSINESS LINKED TO THE ISSUE OF SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE BONDS\n\nIn 2012, Air Liquide issued its first SRI (1) labeled bond under its Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) program, for a total amount of 500 million euros. This bond was mostly placed with investors having SRI management mandates and permitted the Group to diversify its financing sources. After numerous public authorities and supranational issuers, Air Liquide became the first company in the world to issue bonds meeting the criteria of SRI investors. Obtaining a rating from the extra-financial rating agency Vigeo for the Home Healthcare business led to this issue being given an SRI label. This assessment is based on social, environmental and governance criteria for the Home Healthcare business, which covers over 1.8 million patients worldwide. In the course of this SRI bond issue, Air Liquide made a commitment to publishing indicators specific to the Home Healthcare business relating to the environment, safety and employee diversity throughout the life of these bonds, i.e., nine years.\n\n| Number of  patients treated                                                        | 2011      | 2012      | 2013      | 2014      | 2015      | 2016      | 2017      | 2018      | 2019 2020           | 2021      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|\n| Total number of  patients treated by  the Air Liquide Home  Healthcare Divisions   | 700,000   | 1,000,000 | 1,100,000 | 1,200,000 | 1,300,000 | 1,400,000 | 1,560,000 | 1,630,000 | 1,700,000 1,780,000 | 1,833,400 |\n| Group employees                                                                    |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |                     |           |\n| Home Healthcare  employees  \u207d \u00aa \u207e                                                  | 5,494     | 7,303     | 7,748     | 8,183     | 9,112     | 9,492     | 10,015    | 10,143    | 10,425 10,919       | 11,169    |\n| Safety                                                                             |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |                     |           |\n| Number of lost-time  accidents of at least  one day among  employees               | 28  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e | 42  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e | 77  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e | 62  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e | 79  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e | 63  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e | 66  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e | 63  \u207d \u1d48 \u207e | 65  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e 32  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e | 45        |\n| Number of accidents  of subcontractors  and temporary  workers  \u207d \u1d9c \u207e              | 7  \u207d \u1d48 \u207e  | 10  \u207d \u1d48 \u207e | 13  \u207d \u1d48 \u207e | 9  \u207d \u1d48 \u207e  | 16  \u207d \u1d48 \u207e | 21  \u207d \u1d48 \u207e | 8  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e  | 16  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e | 20  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e 14  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e | 14        |\n| Gender mix                                                                         |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |                     |           |\n| % of women among  managers and  professionals                                      | 55%       | 55%       | 56%       | 58%       | 58%       | 57%       | 58%       | 56%       | 55%  54%            | 54 %      |\n| % of women among  managers and  professionals hired  during the year               | 62%       | 40%       | 70%       | 56%       | 58%       | 62%       | 59%       | 60%       | 58%  57%            | 56 %      |\n| Training                                                                           |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |                     |           |\n| Average number of  days of training per  employee, per year                        | 2.1       | 1.6       | 2.0       | 2.0       | 1.6       | 2.1       | 1.9       | 2.1       | 2.1 1.5             | 2.2       |\n| Kilometers driven  and CO2 emissions  related to  transportation                   |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |           |                     |           |\n| Kilometers driven  per patient  monitored per year                                 |           | 155       | 147       | 124       | 123       | 131       | 118       | 111       | 110 97              | 80        |\n| CO2 emissions  related to  transportation per  patient (kgCO \u2082 / patient) per year |           | 39        | 35        | 29        | 30        | 29        | 23        | 21        | 20 17               | 16        |\n\n- (a) Employees under contract excluding temporary workers.\n- (b) No fatal work accidents.\n- (c) Personnel working under a contract with Air Liquide, on an Air Liquide site, or on a customer site, or as a driver of a delivery vehicle.\n- (d) One fatal accident (road accident).\n- (e) Or 11.3 hours per year based on the counting of hours (basis: 1 day = 7.5 hours).\n\nAs this bond matured in October 2021, the indicators show solid improvement in nine years in the number of patients treated by the Air Liquide  Home  Healthcare  division  (+162%),  and  Home  Healthcare  employees  (+103%).

SPECIFIC INDICATORS  LINKED TO THE ISSUE OF GREEN BONDS\n\nIn line with the sustainable development objectives presented on March 23, 2021, Air Liquide has developed a responsible, sustainable financing  framework  to  support  the  financing  and  refinancing  of  eligible  projects  and  assets  that  will  have  a  clear  benefit  for  the environment and society.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, in May 2021 the Group successfully completed its first green bond issue, raising 500 million euros to finance and refinance several sustainable development projects, most notably in hydrogen, biogas and oxygen, with the aim of reducing its carbon emissions. The transaction builds on the first SRI-labeled bond issued in 2012.\n\nSpecific  indicators  for  the  sustainable  development  projects  financed  by  this  green  bond  issue  will  be  published  in  an  allocation  and impact report that will be available on the Air Liquide website no later than May 2022. The report will be published annually until all funds from the green bond issue have been allocated, and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit will validate that the allocation is aligned with the Group's responsible and sustainable financing framework.\n\n## 4.

GHG EMISSION QUOTA SYSTEMS\n\nAir  Liquide  is  present  in  a  number  of  regions  that  have implemented or are in the process of implementing quota systems for  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  These  regulatory  developments are being followed by the Air Liquide teams to make sure that the Group's  activities  comply  with  the  obligations  associated  with these quota systems.\n\n## 5.1.1.  In Europe\n\nIn  the  European  Union,  the  European  ETS  (Emission  Trading Scheme)  directive  established  a  system  of  greenhouse  gas emission  quotas  in  2005,  in  accordance  with  the  Kyoto  Protocol and  the  European  Union's  climate  change  objectives.  After  an initial phase from 2005 to 2007 and a second phase from 2008 to 2012, a third phase, covering the period from 2013 to 2020, has made it possible to expand the scope of industrial facilities subject to  the  ETS. The  ETS has entered its fourth phase, covering the period  2021-2030,  which  carries  an  increase  in  the  reduction factor.  The  overall  quantity  of  allowances  will  decrease  at  an increased  annual  rate,  resulting  in  an  overall  reduction  in emissions  from  the  sectors  under  the  EU  ETS  of  61%  by  2030 compared to 2005\n\nFor  Air  Liquide,  in  2019,  this  directive  affected  all  of  its cogeneration  sites  in  Germany,  France  and  the  Netherlands,  as well  as  all  of  the  Group's  large  hydrogen  production  sites  in Europe. With regard to hydrogen production units, a portion of the CO2  emission  quotas  is  allocated  for  free  according  to  a benchmark established for the top-performing European facilities. Air Liquide acquires the remaining CO2 quotas for the market or its customers  in  order  to  cover  the  hydrogen  production  site emissions not covered by the free allocations and for all emissions from cogeneration sites. Apart from the scope of the phase three of ETS, the new installation (SMR-X) will increase the portfolio of Air Liquide for the fourth phase, which started in 2021 and will end in 2030.\n\n## 5.1.2.  In China\n\nFrom  2013,  the  Chinese  government  had  launched  pilot  ETS programs  in  seven  provinces/cities  (Guangdong,  Hubei,  Beijing, Tianjin,  Shanghai,  Chongqing  and  Shenzhen).  Four  Air  Liquide entities participated in the program. A national carbon market was launched on July 16, 2021. At this stage, it only covers one sector, electricity.  However,  the  2,162  companies  it  comprises  produce around  4.5  billion  tonnes  of  carbon  emissions  per  year.  In  2022 the market will also include the steel and cement industry. Other industries  (such  as  the  chemical  industry)  are  expected  to  be included in the national system over the next five years. For now, there  is  no  absolute  cap  in  the  Chinese  carbon  market.  China allocates  all  companies  their  emission  quotas.  The  allocation  is based  on  a  national  comparative  analysis  with  each  emitter allocated quotas equal to their verified emissions. This approach means  that China is not yet a cap-and-trade system. Nevertheless,  companies  that  succeed  in  reducing  the  carbon intensity  of  their  production  can  generate  a  surplus  of  tradeable quotas. At the end of 2021, the average price of CO2 was 43 RMB/ ton (6 euros per tonne), and since the start of the market in July, 179 million tonnes have been traded.\n\n## 5.1.3.  In Canada\n\nThe federal pricing system has two parts: a regulatory charge on fossil  fuels  like  gasoline  and  natural  gas,  known  as  the  fuel charge, and a performance-based system for industries, known as the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS).\n\nThe  Government  of  Canada  has  confirmed  that  the  carbon pollution pricing systems in Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and  Labrador,  the  Northwest  Territories,  and  British  Columbia continue to meet the federal benchmark stringency requirements, and  as  of  2021,  New  Brunswick  has  a  carbon  pollution  pricing system  that  also  meets  the  benchmark  requirements.  As  of January 1, 2022, Ontario's provincial output-based pricing system will apply alongside the federal fuel charge.\n\nAir Liquide Canada is a market participant in the Quebec cap-andtrade  system,  a  voluntary  participant  in  the  Ontario  provincial OBPS and a mandatory participant in the Alberta provincial OBPS.\n\n## 5.1.4.  In Kazakhstan\n\nThe  national  quota  allocation  plan  for  2021  came  into  effect  on January 13, 2021. The allocation plan for 2022-2025 should come into effect on January 1, 2022. It provides for a gradual reduction in allocated quotas relative to 2021 of 10% in 2022 and up to 25% in  2025.  Applications  for  the  current  year's  quotas  must  be submitted  no  later  than April,  1 st .  The  emissions  trading  system (ETS) applies to all direct emitters of more 20,000 tCO2/year.\n\n## 5.1.5.  Synthesis\n\nOther  regions,  such  as  South  Korea  and  California  have  also implemented  a  national  emission  quota  exchange  system.  In 2018, a CO2 taxation system was put in place in Singapore.\n\n|                                        | 2021                  | 2021                  |                       |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| System (in thousands of tonnes of CO \u2082 | Allowances  Allocated | Allowances  Purchased | Allowances  Purchased |\n| California CaT                         | 1,071                 | 230                   | \u207d \u00aa \u207e                 |\n| EU ETS  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e                          | 2,487                 | 2,492                 |                       |\n| Kazakhstan ETS                         | 156                   | -                     | \u207d \u00aa \u207e                 |\n| Korea ETS                              | 237                   | 18                    | \u207d \u00aa \u207e                 |\n| China ETS  \u207d \u1d9c \u207e                       | 1,586                 | 5                     | \u207d \u00aa \u207e                 |\n| Canada ETS                             | 586                   | -                     |                       |\n\n- (a) Estimates pending validation by local authorities.\n- (b) Taking into account the joint ventures for which the Group's partners are responsible for purchasing the allocations.\n- (c) On Scopes 1 and 2.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Annual reporting\n\n## 5.2.   MARKET AUTHORIZATION REGULATIONS\n\nThe distribution of substances, products and articles is part of the product  stewardship  approach  developed  by  the  chemical industry.\n\nIn terms of market authorizations, Air Liquide is mainly affected by four regulations: chemical substances (REACH), biocidal products (BPR), plant protection products (PPP) and fluorinated gases (Fgas).\n\n## 5.2.1.  European REACH regulation Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006\n\nREACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of CHemicals)  is  a  European  Union  regulation  that  governs  the registration,  notification,  restriction  and  authorisation  of  chemical substances  produced  in  or  imported  into  the  European  Union. Air  Liquide  also  ensures  that  the  raw  materials  used  and  placed on the market comply with the REACH regulation.\n\n## REACH registration of chemical substances\n\nAny chemical substance imported into or manufactured in Europe in  excess  of  one  ton  per  year  must  be  registered  with  the European  Chemicals  Agency,  ECHA.  Each  manufacturer  or importer must have its own registration.\n\nThe  European  REACH  regulation  came  into  effect  in  2007,  and the registration procedures for existing substances manufactured or imported in excess of one ton per year were scheduled to run until May 31, 2018. After this date, the obligations relating to the maintenance  and  updating  of  files  continue  in  the  event  of production or import in a higher tonnage band, during the review of  registration  files  by  the  authorities,  during  administrative updates  and  when  new  information  on  risks  to  humans  or  the environment comes to light.\n\nThe  same  obligations  will  apply  to  all  new  substances  from  the first ton produced or imported into Europe.\n\nAir Liquide's main products, such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, CO2, helium and rare gases, are exempt from registration under REACH.\n\nAir  Liquide is lead registrant for several substances, in particular specialty  gases  for  the  Electronics  business  (NF3,  CF4,  C4F8, SiF4...).  Air  Liquide  is  ordinary  registrant  for  several  other substances: carbon monoxide, acetylene, methanol, lime, nitrous oxide, ultra-pure fuels have been registered under this regulation by each subsidiary concerned.\n\nIn  addition,  Seppic,  manufacturers  of  specialty  ingredients  for health and beauty, is subject to REACH regulations for some of its substances.  Seppic  has  anticipated  the  implementation  of  the European REACH regulation and ensures continued compliance with  the  regulation.  In  parallel  with  the  European  dossiers submitted within the framework of the REACH regulation, Seppic also ensures compliance with similar regulations outside Europe.\n\nIn  2021,  Group  sales  subject  to  registration  under  REACH represent less than 3% of Group revenue.\n\n## Restriction under REACH of the use of chemical substances\n\nAir Liquide is mainly impacted by restrictions relating to the use of solvents used to distribute acetylene. The solvent DMF is subject to  a  restriction  under  a  European  regulation  of  November  2021 that requires occupational exposure  during  cylinder filling operations  to  be  monitored.  NMP,  a  potential  substitute,  is  also subject to restricted use as of May 2020.\n\n## Authorization under REACH: transitional authorization of chemical substances\n\nTransitional  authorizations  before  permanent  cessation  of  use  in Europe  apply  to  SVHC  (Substances  of  Very  High  Concern) substances included in the candidate list for authorization.\n\nAir Liquide does not distribute substances subject to authorization. These SVHCs are essentially contained in articles distributed for the commissioning or production of gases.\n\n## Notification under REACH of articles manufactured, imported or distributed\n\nNotification  to  the  European  Chemicals  Agency  of  any  SVHCs, listed  in  the  candidate  list,  is  mandatory  when  the  product concentration  is  greater  than  0.1%  by  weight  and  if  the  total imported or produced exceeds one ton per year.\n\nSuch SVHCs are contained in the articles for gas commissioning or gas production.\n\nIn  the  case  of  complex  items,  composed  of  several  elementary items, the 1% threshold applies to the most elementary part and not to the complex whole.\n\nThe presence of such SVHC must also be communicated during any  distribution  of  these  articles  to  professionals  or  industry. Communication  to  individuals  is  only  applicable  if  a  consumer explicitly requests it.\n\n## Notification in the SCIP database of items placed on the market\n\nThe  WFD  (Waste  Framework  Directive)  requires  distributors  of articles containing SVHCs, as defined by REACH, above 0.1% by weight,  to  fill  out  a  database  called  SCIP,  where  the  article  is described and the location of the SVHC substance is designated. There is no threshold limit as for REACH notifications.\n\nAir  Liquide  as  a  supplier  of  articles  and  equipment,  medical  or non-medical (e.g. freezing tunnels) is concerned.\n\nThis  SCIP  database  will  be  used  at  the  end  of  the  article's  life when it is dismantled by waste treatment or recycling centers as part of the circular economy.\n\nAir Liquide now requires its equipment suppliers to inform it of the presence and precise location of  all  elementary  parts  containing SVHCs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Biocide Regulation (BPR-2012) and Plant Protection Products Regulation (PPP-2009)\n\nThese  old  regulations  (2012  BPR  and  2009  PPP),  applicable throughout Europe, are often accompanied by national decrees on phytosanitary  products.  Gases  such  as  CO2  are  often  used  in pesticides or disinfectants, replacing chemicals that are banned in Europe.\n\nThese two regulations require an approval of the substance at the European level, prior to the application for national authorization.\n\nSince 2016, Air Liquide has been involved in PPP renewal files for the approval of carbon dioxide (CO2) used as an insecticide and ethylene  (C2H4)  diluted  in  nitrogen  used  as  an  artificial  ripening agent for fruits and tubers. The renewals are now due in 2022 and 2023 respectively following a delay in the file review process due to a government backlog.\n\nAfter approval, the internal distribution channels, or supply chain, will  have to be reviewed because the sources of these BPR and PPP products require sourcing exclusively from the sources that have either been referenced in the approval file or given technical equivalence when the file was submitted.\n\nUnder  BPR,  the  review  of  the  Ozone  approval  file  is  still  in progress. Once approved, the appropriate requests for authorization  both  for  the  use  in  industrial  facilities  and  for  the marketing  of  its  precursor,  oxygen,  will  then  be  submitted.  This concerns applications for water purification, container disinfection and industrial water treatment.\n\nThe  BPR  and  PPP  regulations  also  impose  additional  labelin obligations. g\n\n## 5.2.3.  Regulation F-GAS (2014) Regulation (EU) No. 517/2014\n\nThis European regulation only applies to fluorinated gases placed on the market within the Union. It  imposes  marketing  quotas  on HFC  (hydrofluorocarbon)-type  gases  because  of  their  very  high global  warming  potential.  The  other  gases  concerned  by  this regulation are monitored and are therefore subject to a reporting obligation.\n\nAir Liquide mainly markets this type of gas for the electronics and medical sectors. Fluorinated gases used in the electronics sector are destroyed before discharge into the atmosphere and therefore their use is exempted from the quota system.\n\n## 6. Reporting methodology\n\n## 6.1.   PROTOCOL AND DEFINITIONS\n\nIn the absence of a relevant and recognized protocol for industrial gas operations, Air Liquide has created its own protocol to define its reporting methods  for  Human  Resources,  safety  and environmental  indicators.  This  protocol  includes  all  of  the definitions,  measurement  procedures  and  collection  methods  for this information. In line with the Group's commitment to continuous improvement,  Air  Liquide  is  gradually  completing  this  work  to adjust  its  Sustainable  Development  indicators  protocol  to  reflect changes in the Group.\n\nThis  protocol  is  based  on  the  general  principles  defined  by  the Group  with  regard  to  scope,  responsibilities,  controls  and  limits, and  establishes  definitions,  departmental  responsibilities,  tools and  data-tracing  methods  for  each  indicator.  This  document  is regularly updated.\n\n## 5.2.4.  Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals\n\nThe Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of  Chemicals,  better  known  as  GHS,  was  created  by  the  United Nations.  This  system  sets  out  the  classification  of  chemical products according to the types of danger that they represent and provides standardized hazard information, including labeling.\n\nThis  labeling  must  provide  key  information  concerning  health, safety  and  environmental  protection  to  everyone  who  handles  a hazardous product or who could be exposed to one.\n\nIn the countries in which GHS is implemented in local regulations, Air  Liquide subsidiaries have implemented the principles of GHS in terms of product compliance  in  accordance  with  the requirements set out in local regulations.\n\n## 5.2.5.  Notification to Poisons Centers (Regulation 1272/2008/EC, Annex VIII)\n\nThe  notification  to  the  national  emergency  services  (Poison Centers) of  the  composition  and  numbers  of  any  mixture  placed on the market is mandatory from January 1, 2021 in Europe for products intended for consumer or trade use, and from January 1, 2024 for those intended for industrial use.\n\nThis  process  requires  obtaining  a  unique  identification  number (UFI code) at the European level, which must also be indicated on the labels of bottles and products. Transit through a depot center also requires a UFI code in the country concerned.\n\n## 5.2.6.  Seveso Directive 3\n\nThis  European  directive  concerns  the  prevention  of  major industrial  risks.  It  applies  to  any  facility  where  certain  hazardous substances are present above certain quantities. These  facilities are  classified  into  two  categories  according  to  the  quantity  of substances  present:  Seveso  3  'upper  tier'  and  'lower  tier.'  In Europe,  88  'lower  tier'  and  27  'upper  tier'  Air  Liquide  sites  are concerned, mainly because of oxygen storage.\n\nSeveso  regulations  apply  mainly  in  Europe,  but  if  the  Seveso 'upper tier' criteria were to be applied worldwide, 80 other Group sites would be covered.\n\nMoreover,  this  protocol  takes  into  account  all  the  Group's formalized procedures  in  the  framework  of  the  Industrial Management  System  (IMS)  and  the  global  protocol  for  Group Policies,  Codes  and  Procedures  called  the  BlueBook.  This reporting protocol makes it possible to cover the information listed in articles L. 22-10-36 and R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code,  except  for  the  fight  against  food  waste,  food  insecurity, respect  for  animal  welfare  and  commitments  to  responsible,  fair and sustainable food. Due to its industrial activity, these subjects are not considered a priority by Air Liquide.\n\nIn  2021,  following  the  publication  of  enhanced  sustainable development  objectives,  new  indicators  were  developed  for monitoring  the  corresponding  action  plans  and  the  degree  to which the objectives are achieved.",

        "page_content": "## Annual reporting\n\n## 6.2.   SCOPE AND CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nHuman Resources and environmental indicators are consolidated worldwide  for  all  companies  integrated  within  the  financial consolidation scope. Entities accounted for by the equity method are excluded from the reporting scope.\n\nSafety indicators are consolidated worldwide for all companies in which  Air  Liquide  has  operational  control  or  is  responsible  for safety management.\n\nApart from these general rules, there are some specific ones:\n\n- \u25a0 information on the impact of transportation (kilometers traveled, CO2 emitted) is calculated based on data collected in the main countries where the Group is established;\n- \u25a0 information on avoided kilometers and avoided CO2 emissions through  on-site Air  Separation  Units  and  efficiency  measures pertains  to  fully  consolidated  subsidiaries  within  the  financial consolidation scope;\n- \u25a0 environmental  and  energy  indicators  for  the  main  types  of production units operated by the Group cover about 99% of the Group's Gas & Services revenue and 98% of the Group's total revenue;\n- \u25a0 for environmental  and  energy  indicators,  production  units  are included in the reporting system from the effective date of their industrial commissioning;\n- \u25a0 electricity consumption and the indirect CO2 emissions related to it are only taken into account when Air Liquide pays for this energy.  Energy  consumption  of  on-site  units  and  water consumption specific to the sale of treated water (which is not part  of  the  Group's  core  business)  are  excluded  from  the consolidation  scope  of  the  data.  When  the  Group  has cogeneration units in a country where ASUs are available, the indirect  emissions  from  the  electricity  of  these  units  are adjusted to take into account self-consumption;\n- \u25a0 the segmentation between advanced economies and developing economies, used for direct and indirect greenhouse gas  emissions,  is  the  same  as  that  used  by  the  Finance Department;\n- \u25a0 the 2020 base used to monitor the targeted -33% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2035 has been restated following significant changes  in  the  scope  regarding  industrial  gas  manufacturing units;\n- \u25a0 the avoided CO2 emissions reported on the climate benefit of using hydrogen to desulfurize fuels due to lower black carbon emissions are calculated using methodologies widely used by the  industries  reporting  these  climate  benefits,  and  via extrapolations to Group data.\n\n## 6.3.   DATA COLLECTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe  Human Resources,  safety  and  environmental  indicators  are produced by several data collection systems in the Group, each under the responsibility of a specific department:\n\n- \u25a0 Human Resources indicators, included in the Group's general accounting consolidation tool, fall under the responsibility of the Human Resources Department;\n- \u25a0 the energy consumption and CO2 emissions indicators for the main  Air  Separation  Units  and  cogeneration,  hydrogen  and carbon  monoxide  units  are  tracked  by  the  Large  Industries business line using a dedicated Intranet tool;\n- \u25a0 as a complement, environmental and safety reporting is carried out  by  the  Safety  and  Industrial  System  Department  using  a dedicated Intranet tool, and includes:\n- -for all entities, the Group's accident reporting data,\n- -for  the  units  of  the  Large  Industries  business  line,  other environmental  indicators  (atmospheric  emissions,  water consumption, discharge to water, etc.),\n- -for  the  smaller  units  (acetylene,  nitrous  oxide,  and  carbon dioxide  units  and  Hygiene  and  Specialty  Ingredients businesses),  the  Engineering  &  Construction  business units,  the  Research  and  Development  sites  and  the Technical  Centers,  all  indicators  (energy,  atmospheric emissions, water consumption, discharge to water, etc.);\n- \u25a0 indicators  on  Industrial  Merchant  transportation  are  the responsibility of this business line;\n- \u25a0 indicators  on  transportation  for  Medical  Gases  and  Home Healthcare  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Healthcare  business line;\n- \u25a0 among the subjects  covered  by  the  French  'Grenelle  2'  law, soil  pollution  and  the  consideration  of  noise  pollution  are  not relevant for the Industrial Gas business, given the size of the Group's  sites  and  the  noise  levels  generated.  They  are therefore not mentioned in this report.\n\n## 6.4.   CONTROLS\n\nEach department in charge of collecting data is responsible for the indicators  provided.  Control  occurs  at  the  time  of  consolidation (review of changes, inter-entity comparisons).\n\nSafety and energy indicators are tracked monthly. Where the data reported are inconsistent or missing, an estimated value may be used by default.\n\n## 6.5.   METHODOLOGICAL LIMITS\n\nThe methodologies used for certain Human Resources, safety and environmental indicators can have certain limits due to:\n\n- \u25a0 the  absence  of  nationally  or  internationally recognized definitions,  in  particular  for  indicators  on  managers  and professionals and social performance indicators;\n- \u25a0 the  representativeness  of  the  measurements  taken  and required  estimates. This  is  particularly  the  case  for  indicators regarding avoided  CO2  emissions,  water  consumption, kilometers avoided per on-site unit, and training.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent verifier's report\n\n## REPORT BY ONE OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS, APPOINTED AS AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY, ON THE NON-FINANCIAL INFORMATION STATEMENT INCLUDED IN THE MANAGEMENT REPORT\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditor's report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021\n\nTo the L'Air Liquide Annual General Meeting,\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditor of AIR LIQUIDE SA (hereinafter the 'entity'), appointed as an independent third party and accredited by  Cofrac  (Cofrac  Inspection Accreditation  n\u00b03-1060,  whose  scope  is  available  at www.cofrac.fr),  we  conducted  our  work  in  order  to provide a report expressing a limited assurance conclusion on the historical information (observed and extrapolated) of the consolidated non-financial  information  statement  (hereinafter  respectively  the  \"Information\"  and  the  \"Statement\"),  prepared  in  accordance  with  the Entity's  procedures (hereinafter the 'Guidelines'), for year ended on the 31st of December 2021, included in the management report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of articles L. 225 102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures performed, as described in the \u00ab Nature and scope of our work \u00bb section, and the elements that we have collected, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated non-financial information statement is not compliant with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, are not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Preparation of the non-financial performance statement\n\nThe absence of a generally accepted and commonly used framework or established practices on which to evaluate and measure the Information  permits  the  use  of  different,  but  acceptable,  measurement  techniques  that  may  affect  comparability  between  entities  and through time.\n\nConsequently,  the  Information  needs  to  be  read  and  understood  with  reference  to  the  Guidelines,  significant  elements  of  which  are available upon request from the entity's headquarters.\n\n## Inherent Limitations in Preparing the Information\n\nThe Information may be subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific and economic knowledge and due to the quality of the external data used. Certain Information are sensitive to the methodological choices, assumptions and/or estimates used to prepare the Information presented in the Statement.\n\n## The entity's responsibility\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for:\n\n- \u25a0 selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Information;\n- \u25a0 the preparation of the Statement in accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions,  including  a  presentation  of  the  business model, a description of the principal non -financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented considering those risks and the outcomes of those policies, including key performance indicators and if applicable the information required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (green taxonomy);\n- \u25a0 designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been prepared in accordance with the entity's Guidelines as mentioned above.\n\n## Responsibility of the Statutory Auditor, appointed as an independent third party\n\nOn the basis of our work, our responsibility is to provide a report expressing a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- \u25a0 the compliance of the Statement with the provisions of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u25a0 the fairness of the information provided in accordance with article R. 225 -105 I, 3 and II of the French Commercial Code, i.e., the outcomes,  including  key  performance  indicators,  and  the  measures  implemented  considering  the  principal  risks  (hereinafter  the 'Information').\n\nAs we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Information as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to comment on:\n\n- \u25a0 the entity's  compliance  with  other  applicable  legal  and  regulatory  provisions  (in  particular  the  information  required  by Article  8  of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (green taxonomy), the French duty of care law and anti-corruption and tax evasion legislation);\n- \u25a0 the fairness of the information required by Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (green taxonomy);\n- \u25a0 the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and  procedures  to  ensure  the  compliance  with  the  ethical  requirements,  French  professional  guidance  and  applicable  legal  and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Means and resources\n\nOur work was carried out by a team of 10 people between September 2021 and March 2022 and took a total of about 20 weeks.\n\nWe were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted about 15  interviews  with  people  responsible  for  preparing  the  Statement,  representing  among  others  Sustainable  Development,  Human Resources,  Safety  and  Industrial  Systems,  Environment,  Industrial  Merchant,  Large  Industries,  Ethics,  Tax,  Risks  and  Procurement departments.\n\n## Nature and scope of our work\n\nWe planned and performed our work considering the risk of material misstatement of the Information.\n\nWe consider that the procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and allowed us to provide a limited level of assurance conclusion:\n\n- \u25a0 we  obtained  an  understanding  of  all  the  consolidated  entities'  activities,  the  description  of  the  social  and  environmental  risks associated with their activities;\n- \u25a0 we assessed the suitability of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, objectivity and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices, where appropriate;\n- \u25a0 we verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in article L. 225 -102 -1 III, as well as information regarding compliance with human rights and anti-corruption and tax evasion legislation;\n- \u25a0 we verified that the Statement presents information set out in article L. 225 -105 -1 II where relevant to the principal risks and includes an explanation for the absence of the information required under article L. 225-102-1 III, 2;\n- \u25a0 we verified  that  the  Statement  presents  the  business  model  and  the  principal  risks  associated  with  all  the  consolidated  entities' activities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with their business relationships and products or services, as well as their policies, measures and the outcomes, including key performance indicators related to the principal risks;\n- \u25a0 we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:\n- -assessed  the  process  used  to  identify  and  confirm  the  principal  risks  and  the  consistency  of  the  outcomes  and  the  key performance indicators used with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented, and\n- -corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important presented in the appendix.  For  some  risks,  fight  against  corruption,  fight  against  tax  evasion,  procurement,  our  work  was  performed  at  the consolidation entity level; for the other risks, our work was performed at consolidation entity level and on a selection of entities : Caojing  SMR  1  &  2  (HYCO),  Zhangjiagang  Shagang  ALZJGIG  (ASU),  Rozenburg  Heracles  &  HYCO  (HYCO),  Himeji-SOKK (ASU),  Jurong  Island  (ASU),  Sasol  T17  (ASU),  Yanbu  1&2  (HYCO)  Oberhausen  (ASU),  SIO  St  Priest  (Lavera/Port  J\u00e9rome) (HYCO), Pernis (COGEN);\n- \u25a0 we verified that the Statement covers the scope of consolidation, i.e., all the companies included in the scope of consolidation in accordance with article L. 233-16, within the limitations set out in the Statement;\n- \u25a0 we asked what internal control and risk management procedures the entity has put in place and assessed the data collection process implemented by the entity to ensure the completeness and fairness of the Information;\n- \u25a0 for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important presented in the appendix, we implemented:\n- -analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of the data collected and the consistency of any changes in those data\n- -substantive  tests,  using  sampling  techniques,  in  order  to  verify  the  proper  application  of  the  definitions  and  procedures  and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. These works were performed at consolidation entity level and on a selection of entities:  Caojing  SMR 1 & 2 (HYCO), Zhangjiagang Shagang ALZJGIG (ASU), Rozenburg Heracles & HYCO (HYCO), HimejiSOKK (ASU), Jurong Island (ASU), Sasol T17 (ASU), Yanbu 1&2 (HYCO) Oberhausen (ASU), SIO St Priest (Lavera/Port J\u00e9rome) (HYCO), Pernis (COGEN) and covers between 21% and 22% of the consolidated data selected for these tests;\n- \u25a0 we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nThe  procedures  performed  in  a  limited  assurance  engagement  are  less  extensive  than  those  required  for  a  reasonable  assurance engagement performed in accordance with the professional guidance of the French Institute of Statutory Auditors ('CNCC'); a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine, March 4, 2022\n\nOne of the Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nSylvain Lambert\n\nSustainable Development Partner/Director\n\nS\u00e9verine Scheer\n\nPartner\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Board of Directors' report on the resolutions presented to the Combined General Meeting - May 4, 2022\n\n## Resolutions within the authority of the Ordinary General Meeting\n\nWe ask you, after having reviewed:\n\n- \u25a0 the Reports of the Board of Directors;\n- \u25a0 the  Company's  Financial  Statements,  income  statement, balance sheet and notes thereto;\n- \u25a0 the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements;\n- \u25a0 the Reports of the Statutory Auditors,\n\nto approve  the  Company's  Financial  Statements  and  the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 as presented, as well as the transactions set out in these Financial Statements or mentioned in these reports.\n\nYour  Company's  net  profit  allows  the  Board  to  propose  the payment of a dividend of 2.90 euros for each share entitled to a dividend,  it  being  specified  that  in  the  event  of  a  change  in  the number  of  shares  entitled  to  a  dividend  compared  to  the 475,291,037 shares making up the share capital as of December 31,  2021,  the  overall  dividend  amount  would  be  adjusted accordingly and the amount appropriated to the retained earnings account  would  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  dividends effectively paid.\n\nThe proposed dividend is 2.90 euros per share, representing an increase  of  +5.5%  compared  to  2020.  Moreover,  a  free  shares attribution, on the basis of one free share for every 10 shares held, as  well  as  the  application  of  a  loyalty  bonus,  are  planned  for June 2022.\n\nThe ex-dividend date will be set for May 16, 2022. The dividend payment date will be set for May 18, 2022.\n\nIn  accordance with article 117 quater of the French General Tax Code,  it  is  specified  that  ordinary  and  loyalty  dividends  paid  to individuals  with  their  tax  residence  in  France  are  fully  subject  to the single flat-rate  withholding  tax  of  12.8%.  Nonetheless,  at  the\n\nexpress, irrevocable and global request of the Shareholder, these dividends may be subject to the progressive income tax rate and shall  therefore  be  eligible  for  the  40%  allowance  referred  to  in section 2\u00b0 of paragraph 3 of article 158 of the French General Tax Code, which is  applicable  under  certain  conditions.  In  all  cases, these ordinary and loyalty dividends shall also be subject to social contributions at a rate of 17.2%.\n\nIn addition, Shareholders who have held their shares in registered form  for  at  least  two  years  as  of  December  31,  2021,  and  who retain such shares in registered form up to the dividend payment date,  shall  be  entitled,  for  such  shares  (i.e.  a  total  number  of 134,993,503 shares at December 31, 2021), to a loyalty dividend of  10%  compared  with  the  dividend  paid  to  the  other  shares, i.e. an additional dividend of 0.29 euros per share.\n\nThe  difference  between  the  loyalty  dividend  calculated  on  the number of shares known to exist at December 31, 2021, and the loyalty  dividend  actually  paid  will  be  allocated  to  the  retained earnings account.\n\nWe also ask you to take due note of distributable earnings for the fiscal  year.  Such  amount  includes  profits  for  fiscal  year  2021 of 950,909,897  euros  plus  available  retained  earnings  at December  31,  2021,  of  4,818,951,419  euros,  i.e.  a  total  of 5,769,861,316 euros.\n\nWe  propose  to  appropriate  the  distributable  earnings  for  fiscal year 2021, i.e. 5,769,861,316 euros, as follows:\n\n| Legal reserve                             | 896,672 euros       |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Retained earnings                         | 4,351,472,521 euros |\n| Dividend (including the loyalty dividend) | 1,417,492,123 euros |\n\n## Distribution\n\nIn accordance with French law, we wish to remind you that the distributions made in respect of the last three fiscal years were as follows:\n\n|                   | Total amount  distributed  \u207d \u1d43 \u207e (in euros)   | Number of shares  concerned  \u207d \u1d47 \u207e   | Dividend distributed eligible in its entirety for the  40% deduction referred to in article 158-3-2\u00b0  of the French General Tax Code  \u207d \u1d9c \u207e (in euros)   |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fiscal year 2018  |                                               |                                      |                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Ordinary dividend | 1,137,972,100                                 | 429,423,434                          | 2.65                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Loyalty dividend  | 33,416,412                                    | 128,524,663                          | 0.26                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Fiscal year 2019  |                                               |                                      |                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Ordinary dividend | 1,277,384,888                                 | 473,105,514                          | 2.70                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Loyalty dividend  | 36,221,817                                    | 134,154,877                          | 0.27                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Fiscal year 2020  |                                               |                                      |                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Ordinary dividend | 1,302,566,991                                 | 473,660,724                          | 2.75                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Loyalty dividend  | 35,573,380                                    | 131,753,261                          | 0.27                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n- (a) Theoretical values calculated based on the number of shares as of December 31 for each fiscal year.\n- (b) Number of shares expressed historically as of December 31 for each fiscal year.\n\nThe amounts effectively paid after adjustment were as follows:\n\n- - fiscal year 2018 - ordinary dividend: 1,131,698,657 euros for 427,056,097 shares; loyalty dividend: 32,497,215 euros for 124,989,290 shares;\n- - fiscal year 2019 - ordinary dividend: 1,273,544,632 euros for 471,683,197 shares; loyalty dividend: 36,437,830 euros for 134,954,926 shares;\n- - fiscal year 2020 - ordinary dividend: 1,298,589,273 euros for 472,214,281 shares; loyalty dividend: 37,480,931 euros for 138,818,263 shares.\n\nThe adjustment especially arises from the change in the number of treasury shares, from the final determination of the loyalty dividend taking into account\n\nshares sold between January 1 and the ex-dividend date, from the exercise of options over this same period and the capital increase reserved for employees.\n\n- (c) Applicable, under certain conditions, when the progressive income tax rate is applied.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Information on the completion of the Company's share buy-back program (pursuant to article L. 225-211 of the French Commercial Code)\n\nThe  Combined  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2021  authorized  the Board,  for  a  period  of  18  months,  in  accordance  with  articles L. 22-10-62  et  seq.  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  and  the directly  applicable  provisions  of  EC  Regulation  No.  596/2014  of April 16, 2014, to allow the Company to repurchase its own shares in order to:\n\n- \u25a0 cancel them;\n- \u25a0 tender  them  following  the  exercise  of  rights  attached  to marketable  securities  conferring  entitlement  to  Company shares by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n- \u25a0 implement (i) any share purchase option plans or (ii) plans for free  share  attributions,  or  (iii)  any  employee  share  ownership transactions  reserved  for  members  of  a  Company  Savings Plan,  performed  through  the  transfer  of  shares  acquired previously by the Company, or providing for a free share grant in respect of a contribution in shares by the Company and/or to replace the discount, or (iv) allocation of shares to employees and/or  Executive  Officers  of  the  Company  and  affiliated companies,  in  accordance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  in force;\n- \u25a0 maintain an active market in the Company's shares pursuant to a market liquidity contract in accordance with an Ethics Charter recognized  by  the  French  financial  market  authority  (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers).\n\nThe maximum purchase price was set at 200 euros per share, and the maximum number of shares that can be bought back was set at 10% of the total number of shares making up the share capital as  of  December  31,  2020,  namely  47,366,072  shares  for  a maximum total amount of 9,473,214,400.00 euros, subject to the legal limits.\n\nThese  shares  could  be  purchased  at  any  time,  excluding  the periods for takeover bids on the Company's share capital, on one or more occasions and by all available means, either on or off a stock  exchange,  over-the-counter,  including  the  purchase  of blocks  of  shares,  or  through  the  use  of  derivative  financial instruments, and, if applicable, by all third parties acting on behalf of the Company, under the conditions stipulated in the provisions of  the  final  paragraph  of  article  L.  225-206  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\nPursuant  to  this  authorization  and  the  previous  delegation authorized by the Combined General Meeting of, May 5, 2020,\n\n- \u25a0 pursuant  to  the  liquidity  contract,  the  following  movements occurred:\n- -690,016  shares  were  purchased  for  a  total  price  of 98,011,170  euros,  or  an  average  purchase  price  of 142.04 euros;\n- -693,966  shares  were  sold  for  a  total  price  of  98,739,764 euros, or an average purchase price of 142.28 euros.\n- \u25a0 on  February  9,  2021,  under  the  share  buy-back  program, 310,000  shares  were  bought  back  for  a  total  amount  of 40,544,838.00 euros, i.e. an average price of 130.79 euros per share, representing 0.07% of the share capital as of December 31, 2020.\n\nNo other shares were bought before the end of fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe total cost of the buy-backs was thus limited to 40,544,838.00 euros.\n\nThe total amount of the transaction fees (exclusive of taxes) was 0.2 million euros.\n\n- \u25a0 In addition, during the fiscal year, the Company proceeded to the  tender  of  treasury  shares  to  beneficiaries  of  performance share plans as follows:\n- -270,532 shares vested under the 2017 performance share plan ('World' Plan);\n- -168,678 shares vested under the 2018 performance share plan ('France' Plan);\n- -50  shares  granted  following  one  death  under  the  2020 performance share plan ('France' Plan).\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company directly owned 984,570 shares  at  an  average  purchase  price  of  117.28  euros,  i.e.  a balance  sheet  value  of  115,467,902  euros.  These  shares,  each with a par value of 5.50 euros, represent 0.21% of the Company's share capital.\n\nThe 984,570 treasury shares, are fully assigned for implementation of any performance share plans.\n\nUnder the liquidity contract, as of December 31, 2021, a total of 7,050  shares  were  on  the  balance  sheet  for  a  net  value  of 1,066,454 euros.\n\n## B. Draft resolution\n\nAs the authorization granted by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 4, 2021 was partially used, the Board proposes to replace it with a new authorization to allow the Company to repurchase its own shares in order to:\n\n- \u25a0 cancel them, subject to the adoption of the eighteenth resolution;\n- \u25a0 tender  them  following  the  exercise  of  rights  attached  to marketable  securities  conferring  entitlement  to  Company shares by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n- \u25a0 implement (i) any share purchase option plans or (ii) plans for free  share  attributions,  or  (iii)  any  employee  share  ownership transactions  reserved  for  members  of  a  Company  Savings Plan,  performed  under  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in articles L. 3331-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code through the transfer  of  shares  bought  back  previously  by  the  Company under this resolution, or providing for free share attributions in respect of a contribution in shares by the Company and/or to replace the discount, or (iv) share grants to employees and/or Executive Officers of the Company or affiliated companies;\n- \u25a0 maintain an active market in the Company's shares pursuant to a  liquidity  contract  in  accordance  with  the  market  practice recognized  by  the  French  financial  market  authority  (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers).\n\nThe buy-back by the Company of its own shares is also intended to enable the implementation of any market practice permitted by the  French  financial  market  authority  and,  more  generally,  the achievement of any other transaction which would comply with the regulations  currently  in  force.  In  this  case,  the  Company  would inform its Shareholders by means of a press release.\n\nThe maximum purchase price will be set at 250 euros (excluding acquisition  costs)  per  share  with  a  par  value  of  5.50  euros  per share,  and  the  maximum  number  of  shares  that  can  be  bought back will be set at 10% of the total number of shares making up the share capital as of December 31, 2021, or 47,529,103 shares with  a  par  value  of  5.50  euros,  for  a  maximum  total  amount  of 11,882,275,750 euros, subject to the legal limits.",

        "page_content": "## Board of Directors' report on the resolutions presented to the Combined General Meeting - May 4, 2022\n\nAs in previous years, the resolution stipulates that the authorization  does  not  apply  during  takeover  bid  periods.  These shares may thus be purchased at any time, excluding the periods for takeover bids on the Company's share capital, on one or more occasions  and  by  all  available  means,  either  on  or  off  a  stock exchange,  over-the-counter,  including  the  purchase  of  blocks  of shares, or through the use of derivative financial instruments, and, if applicable, by all third parties acting on behalf of the Company, under  the  conditions  stipulated  in  the  provisions  of  the  final paragraph of article L. 225-206 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nShares bought back may be commuted, assigned or transferred in any  manner  on  or  off  a  stock  exchange  or  over-the-counter, including  the  sale  of  blocks  of  shares,  in  accordance  with  the applicable regulations.\n\nAs own shares do not confer entitlement to a dividend, the amount of the unpaid dividends will be allocated to retained earnings.\n\nThis  authorization  shall  be  granted  for  a  period  of  18  months starting from the date of this General Meeting. It shall be valid as of the date of the Board of Directors meeting called to decide on the  implementation  of  the  share  buy-back  program  and,  at  the latest,  as  of  November  4,  2022.  It  supersedes  the  authorization granted  by  the  Ordinary  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2021,  in  its fourth resolution with respect to its non-utilized portion.\n\n## Renewal of the term of office of two Directors and appointment of one Director\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  currently  comprises  thirteen  members: eleven  members  appointed  by  the  General  Meeting,  including 5  foreign  nationals  and  6  women  (i.e.  55%),  and  2  Directors representing  the  employees.  The  percentage  of  independent Directors is 91%.\n\nThe  terms  of  office  of  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier,  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon, Ms Sin Leng Low and Ms Annette Winkler will expire at the end of this General Meeting.\n\nMs Sin Leng Low's term of office could in theory be renewed one last time since Ms Sin Leng Low will not have quite reached the statutory age limit as of the date of the General Meeting. However, the Board took note of Ms Sin Leng Low's wish not to have her term  of  office  renewed.  Ms  Sin  Leng  Low  was  very  warmly thanked for her contribution to the work of the Board of Directors, of which she has been a member since 2014, and her participation in  the  work  of  the Audit  and Accounts  Committee,  of  which  she has been a member since 2015.\n\nRegarding  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  who  will  have  a  total  of  twelve years of office on the Board of Directors at the conclusion of the General Meeting, the Board took note of his wish not to have his term of office renewal proposed to the General Meeting. Mr JeanPaul Agon was warmly thanked for his contribution to the work of the Board of Directors, which he has supported since 2010, for his exceptional commitment as a Lead Director and Chairman of the Appointments and Governance Committee, and for his participation in the work of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nPursuant to the 5 th resolution, Shareholders are invited to renew, for  a  period  of  four  years,  the  term  of  office  of  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier. Mr Beno\u00eet Potier joined the Group in 1981. He became Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  in  2006  after  having  served  as Chairman of the Management Board from 2001.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  November  30,  2021  based  on  a unanimous resolution following the Appointments and Governance Committee's recommendations, announced its intention to adopt a new  mode  of  governance  by  separating  the  functions  of  the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  from  those  of  the  Chief Executive  Officer,  to  appoint  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  as  Chief Executive Officer, replacing Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in this role, who has led  the  Group  for  20  years,  and  to  renew  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier's position  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  subject  to  the renewal of his term of office as Director by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022. In addition, the functions of the Lead Director would be  maintained.  The  terms  of  this  new  governance  which  would take  effect  on  June  1,  2022  are  described  in  the  Chapter  3, section  2.2  pages  129  to  132  of  the  Universal  Registration Document.\n\nThe Board of Directors considers that the announced governance structure  will  provide  the  Group  in  the  context  of  the  succession with  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier's  unparalleled  experience  following  his 20 years at the Company's helm, his commitment to promoting the Group's culture and values, his governance expertise founded on transparency and close ties with the Company's Shareholders.\n\nThe Board of Directors has already expressed its warmest thanks to  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  for  the  fundamental  transformation  of  the Group which has more than doubled in size under his leadership, whilst  its  capitalization  has  increased  fivefold.  In  addition  to  Air Liquide's international expansion, the Board highlights its position at  the  forefront  of  the  markets  of  the  future  -  healthcare,  digital and, more recently, energy transition, with hydrogen in particular placing  the  Company  in  a  very  favorable  position  to  face  the challenges  of  the  coming  decades.  (The  individual  information sheet of  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  is  provided  page  155  of  the  Universal Registration Document).\n\nShareholders  are  invited  to,  in  the  6 th resolution,  appoint Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  as  Company  Director.  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow joined  the  Air  Liquide  Group  in  1993.  After  a  wide-ranging, international  career,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  has  the  benefit  of  his extensive experience of the Group, combining strategic vision and knowledge  of  its  business  lines.  A  member  of  the  Executive Committee  as  Executive  Vice  President,  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  is notably in charge of Europe Industries, Healthcare in Europe and Africa  Middle  East  &  India  hubs.  The  Global  Healthcare  activity, the  Innovation  &  Technologies,  Digital  and  IT  functions  are  also under  his  supervision  as  well  as  Customer  orientation  strategy. (The  individual  information  sheet  of  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  is provided page 168 of the Universal Registration Document).\n\nOn  the  recommendation  of  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee  which  estimated  that  the  skills,  depth  of  experience and personal qualities of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow made him the best candidate  to  succeed  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier,  the  Board  of  Directors having deemed Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's qualities to be well aligned with the Group's performance and development strategy, decided in principle to appoint him as Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors  in  fact  considers  it  essential  for  the  Chief  Executive Officer to participate as Director in the discussions and resolutions of  the  Board  in  charge  of  outlining  the  Company's  strategic orientations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Ms Annette  Winkler has  been  an  independent  Director  since  2014,  Chair  of  the Environment  and  Society  Committee  and  member  of  the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee.  Ms  Annette  Winkler will  continue to provide the Board of Directors with the benefit of her  experience  as  Senior  Manager  of  a  division  of  a  large industrial  group  with  an  international  reach  in  the  automotive sector.\n\nThe  Board  is  assured  that  Ms  Annette  Winkler  has  sufficient availability  to  attentively  participate  in  the  work  of  the  Board  of Directors. In 2021, Ms Annette Winkler attendance rate at Board and Committees meetings was 100%. (The individual information sheet of Ms Annette Winkler is provided page 159 of the Universal Registration Document.)\n\nThe Board of Directors has indicated that it considers Ms Annette Winkler to be independent, and Mr Beno\u00eet Potier and Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow to be non independents .\n\nFurthermore  and  for  the  Shareholders'  information,  Mr  Philippe Dubrulle's term of office as Director representing the employees is due  to  expire  at  the  end  of  this  General  Meeting.  The  Group Committee in France, during its plenary meeting of December 16, 2021, renewed Mr Philippe Dubrulle as Director representing the employees  for  a  term  of  4  years  expiring  at  the  close  of  the General Meeting called to approve the 2025 Financial Statements.\n\nAt the end of this General Meeting, the Board of Directors would therefore  comprise  12  members:  10  members  appointed  by  the General  Meeting,  most  of  whom  are  independent  (i.e.  80% Independent  Directors),  including  5  women  (i.e.  50%)  and 4 foreign nationals, and 2 Directors representing the employees.\n\nRenewal of the term of office as a Principal Statutory Auditor of PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit, appointment of KPMG S.A. as a Principal Statutory Auditor and acknowledgement of the expiration of the terms of office as Deputy Statutory Auditors of Auditex company and Mr Jean-Christophe Georghiou\n\nThe  terms  of  office of Ernst & Young  et  Autres  and PricewaterhouseCoopers  Audit  as  the  Company's  Statutory Auditors,  and  the  terms  of  their  respective  Deputy  Statutory Auditors,  Auditex  company  and  Mr  Jean-Christophe  Georghiou, will expire at the end of this General Meeting.\n\nThe renewal of the term of office as a Principal Statutory Auditor of PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit, appointed by the General Meeting on  May  12,  2016,  is  submitted  to  Shareholders  for  approval. Shareholders are invited, on the recommendation of the Audit and Accounts  Committee,  based  on  its  positive  assessment  of  the work  done  by  PricewaterhouseCoopers  during  its  first  term  of office  (particularly  in  terms  of  its  good  understanding  of  the challenges faced by Air Liquide and the way in which it operates), to  renew  this  term  of  office,  within  the  framework  of  the 8 th resolution, for a period of six fiscal years.\n\nGiven the length of Ernst & Young et Autres' term of office as a Principal  Statutory  Auditor  of  the  Company  (since  1983)  and  in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 of April  16,  2014,  the  renewal  of  its  term  of  office  will  not  be proposed to the General Meeting. In order to appoint a Principal Statutory Auditor to replace Ernst & Young et Autres, a selection process  was  implemented,  which  was  guided  and  monitored  by the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\nAs part of this process, a selection timetable, including a call for tenders  in  2020,  was  approved  by  the  Audit  and  Accounts Committee in November 2019, in order to ensure compliance with the cooling-off period of one year (corresponding to the 2021 fiscal year)  applicable  to  the  selected  firm,  pursuant  to  article  5  of Regulation  (EU)  No  537/2014  of  April  16,  2014  and  article L. 822-11  of  the  French  Commercial  Code.  At  the  end  of  the tender process, the Audit and Accounts Committee approved the report  on  the  conclusions  of  the  Statutory  Auditors  selection procedure  submitted  to  it  by  Executive  Management  and,  after examining  the  documents  and  presentations  of  each  firm concerned  and  holding  Q&A  sessions,  made  a  recommendation including  two  candidates  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  stating  its reasoned  preference  for  KPMG  S.A.,  particularly  in  view  of  the appropriate geographical coverage proposed by KPMG S.A. and its  good understanding of the needs, challenges and activities of Air  Liquide.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  Committee  was  not influenced  by  any  third  party  and  was  not  subject  to  any contractual  clause  that  restricted  its  decision  in  formulating  this recommendation.\n\nOn the basis of this justified recommendation from the Audit and Accounts  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  of November  2020,  without  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer  participating  in  the  vote  (pursuant  to  the  regulations), decided  to  approve  in  principle  the  reasoned  preference  of  the Audit  and  Accounts  Committee  and  to  propose  to  the  General Meeting  of  2022  the  appointment  of  KPMG  S.A.  as  a  Statutory Auditor  of  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.,  replacing  Ernst  &  Young  et Autres. The  Board  of  Directors  confirmed  this  decision  on  February  15, 2022  (without  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer participating in the vote), on the basis of the final recommendation of  the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee  issued  with  regard  in particular of this company's most recent inspection report.\n\nThus,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Audit  and  Accounts Committee, the Board of Directors proposes, within the framework of the 9 th resolution, the appointment of KPMG S.A. as a Principal Statutory Auditor for a period of six fiscal years.\n\nIt should  also  be  noted  that,  since  Law  No.  2016-1691  of December 9, 2016, it is no longer obligatory to appoint a Deputy Statutory Auditor unless the Principal Statutory Auditor is a natural person  or  a  single-member  company.  Accordingly,  pursuant  to article  L.  823-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  it  is  proposed that, in the  10 th resolution,  Shareholders  acknowledge  the expiration of the terms of office of Auditex company and Mr JeanChristophe Georghiou as Deputy Statutory Auditors and that they will not be replaced.",

It  is  specified  that  no exceptional remuneration has been paid or awarded in 2021.\n\nThe components of remuneration are described in the Report on Corporate Governance included in Chapter 3 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document and are summarized in the 2022 Invitation to the Annual General Meeting. They were paid or awarded  in  line  with  the  remuneration  policy  approved  by  the General Meeting on May 4, 2021.\n\n## Approval of information relating to the remuneration of corporate officers stated in article L. 22-10-9-I of the French Commercial Code\n\nPursuant to article L. 22-10-34-I of the French Commercial Code, Shareholders  are  invited  to  approve  the  13 th resolution  on information  relating  to  the  remuneration  of  the  Company's corporate officers (the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Directors)  listed  in  article  L.  22-10-9-I  of  the  French  Commercial Code.\n\nAs  was  the  case  in  the  previous  year,  the  information  provided notably  includes  total  remuneration  and  other  benefits  paid  in 2021 or awarded to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in respect of the 2021 fiscal year and elements which establish the link between  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer's remuneration  and  the  Company's  performance,  as  well  as communication  of  remuneration  ratios,  both  on  the  legal  scope and  on  an  expanded  scope.  This  information  also  includes  the new formula for the breakdown of Directors' remuneration for the 2021 fiscal year, established in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, within the overall package of 1.3 million euros per fiscal year, which has not changed since 2020.\n\nThis  information  is  described  in  the  Report  on  Corporate Governance  included  in  Chapter  3  of  the  2021  Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Approval of the remuneration policy applicable to corporate officers\n\nPursuant to article L. 22-10-8-II of the French Commercial Code, Shareholders  are  invited  to  approve  the  remuneration  policy applicable to corporate officers.\n\nThe elements of this policy, including the remuneration policy for Executive Officers and non-executive Officers, their application to each Company Officer and the policy applicable to Directors, are described in the Corporate Governance Report in Chapter 3 of the 2021  Universal  Registration  Document,  in  the  section  entitled 'Remuneration  policy  applicable  to  corporate  officers'  and summarized in the 2022 Invitation to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThis year, the policy applicable to Company Officers forms part of the changes to the Group's governance announced  on December  1,  2021,  in  the  context  of  the  succession  of Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier  in  Executive  Management.  At  its  meeting  of November 30, 2021, the Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee,  announced  its  intention  of  separating  the  roles  of Chairman of the Board of Directors  and  Chief  Executive  Officer, renewing  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier's  term  of  office  as  Chairman  of  the Board  of  Directors  and  appointing  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  as Chief Executive Officer at the end of the Annual General Meeting of May 4, 2022, with effect from June 1, 2022.\n\nThe  approval  of  the  remuneration  policy  is  the  subject  of  the 14 th resolution  for  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier,  due  to  his  term  of  office  as Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  from  January  1,  2022  to May 31, 2022, the 15 th resolution for Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow due to his  term  of  office  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  as  of  June  1,  2022, the 16 th resolution for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier due to his term of office as Chairman of the Board in a separate governance structure as of June  1,  2022,  and  the  17 th resolution  for  the  Directors  of  the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This authorization has not been used.\n\nAs  in  2020,  in  order  to  provide  Shareholders  with  the  right  to express an opinion on such a capital increase during periods of takeover  bids,  it  is  proposed  that  this  delegation  of  authority  be suspended during periods of takeover bids.\n\nThe aim of the 19 th resolution is to renew this authorization up to a maximum of 300 million euros.\n\n## Grant of share subscription or purchase options and performance shares\n\nThe Group has established performance share plans with the aim of  further  involving  employees  in  its  performance,  beyond  profitsharing and participation. The Board of Directors has not awarded stock  options  since  2019,  but  has  not  ruled  out  using  this remuneration  instrument,  according  to  the  conditions  described above, if changes in circumstances justify doing so.\n\nIn  order  to  pursue  this  attribution  policy,  it  is  proposed  that  you renew the existing authorizations.\n\nAs in the past, the performance conditions apply to all options and performance  shares  awarded  to  any  beneficiary  and  are calculated over three years. They are set at the beginning of the year at the February meeting of the Board of Directors, in order to comply with a reference period of three full years.\n\nThe  criteria  used  include  ROCE  (Return  on  Capital  Employed), which is relevant in very capital intensive industry, and TSR (Total Shareholder Return), which enables the Company's performance to be aligned with the regular returns expected  by  its Shareholders.  In  addition,  since  the  2020  performance  share\n\nplans,  the  performance  conditions  have  included  a  performance condition linked to the Group's Climate Objectives. For the 2022 plans, this criterion will be  aligned  with  the  sustainable development goals published in March 2021 (ACT).\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that,  since  2018,  the  award  of  long-term incentives (LTIs) to the Executive Officer has been subject to the principle  of  prorating.  In  practice,  if  the  officer  leaves  for  any reason  other  than  resignation  or  removal  from  office  for  serious cause (situations which will result in the loss of the LTI), the overall allocation  rate  (when  the  performance  conditions  have  been applied)  will  be  reduced  on  a  prorated  basis,  according  to  the number  of  months  of  the  officer's  actual  presence  at  the  Group during the period of assessment of the performance criteria.\n\nIn addition, under the principle applied since 2016, the attribution of  performance  shares  to  the  Executive  Officer  is  assessed according to IFRS.\n\nLastly,  the  proposed  resolutions  set  sub-limits  for  Executive Officers, it being specified that the Board of Directors sets annual limits that are substantially lower than these sub-limits. Attributions to Executive Officers are also accompanied by strict shareholding obligations.\n\nThe 20 th resolution is intended to renew, for a period of 38 months, the authorization granted by the 2019 Annual General Meeting to the Board of Directors to grant options to subscribe or purchase shares  of  the  Company  for  the  benefit  of  employees  and Executive Officers. The draft resolution maintains the total number of  options  that  may  be  granted  at  2%  of  share  capital  over  38 months,  and  sets  the  limit  of  shares  that  can  be  awarded  to Executive Officers at the same time at 0.2% of the share capital.\n\nThe 21 st resolution is intended to renew, for a period of 38 months, the authorization granted by the 2019 Annual General Meeting to the  Board  of  Directors  to  grant  performance  shares  of  the Company for the benefit of employees and Executive Officers. The draft resolution maintains the total number of shares that can be awarded at 0.5% of the share capital over 38 months, and sets the limit  on  the  number  of  shares  that  can  be  awarded  to  Executive Officers at 0.1% of the share capital at the same time.\n\n## Capital increase reserved for employees with cancellation of Shareholder preferential subscription rights\n\nIn  accordance  with  legal  provisions,  these  draft  resolutions  are submitted  again  to  the  vote  at  the  General  Meeting.  The  two resolutions proposed to the General Meeting are identical to those approved on May 4, 2021.\n\nThe previous employee share ownership operation took place in November 2021, in accordance with the authorization granted by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021. The share subscription price was set at 113.23 euros (120.31 euros for the United States) per share. 22.420 employees (and retired employees) in 74 countries representing  33.81%  of  eligible  employees  subscribed  to  this operation.",

The delegation shall be valid for a period of 18 months starting from the date of this General Meeting.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  shall  be  competent  to  determine,  within those  categories,  the  identity  of  the  beneficiaries  of  these  share capital increases.\n\nThe total amount of share capital increases likely to be performed in  accordance  with  these  two  resolutions  may  not  exceed  a maximum nominal amount of 22 million  euros,  corresponding  to the  issue  of  a  maximum  of  4  million  shares.  Furthermore,  the maximum nominal amount of share capital increases likely to be performed on the basis of these two resolutions shall be deducted from the overall limit stipulated in paragraph  2  of  the 15 th resolution  of  the  Extraordinary  General  Meeting  of  May  4, 2021. In the event that they are used, the proposed resolutions will automatically  result  in  the  cancellation  of  the  Shareholders' preferential  subscription  rights  in  favor  of  the  above-mentioned beneficiaries.\n\nThe subscription price of the shares that would be issued pursuant to these two resolutions may not exceed the average, determined in accordance with article L. 3332-19 of the French Labor Code, of the opening trading prices for the Company's share during the 20 stock  market  trading  days  preceding  the  date  of  the  decision setting  the  opening  date  for  the  subscription  to  a  share  capital increase made on the basis of the 22 nd resolution, or be more than 20% lower than such average, bearing in mind that the General Meeting will officially authorize the Board of Directors, if deemed appropriate,  to  reduce  or  cancel  the  aforementioned  discount, within  the  legal,  regulatory  and  tax  limits  under  the  applicable\n\nforeign  law.  In  accordance  with  article  L.  3332-21  of  the  French Labor Code, the Board of Directors may provide for the attribution, on  a  bonus  basis,  to  the  beneficiaries  referred  to  in  the 22 nd resolution, of shares to be issued or already issued or other marketable  securities  granting  access  to  the  Company's  share capital  to  be  issued  or  already  issued,  in  respect  of  (i)  the contribution that could be paid in accordance with the regulations governing  Company  or  Group  Saving  Plans,  and/or  (ii)  where appropriate, the discount.\n\nShould  the  beneficiaries  referred  to  in  the  22 nd resolution  not subscribe  to  the  entire  share  capital  increase  within  the  allotted deadlines, the share capital increase would only be performed for the  amount  of  the  shares  subscribed,  and  the  non-subscribed shares may be offered again to the beneficiaries concerned within the scope of a subsequent share capital increase.\n\nFinally,  the  Shareholders  shall  grant  full  powers  to  the  Board  of Directors,  with  the  option  of  sub-delegation  under  the  conditions determined by law, to set,  within  the  limits  described  above,  the various terms and conditions governing the implementation of the two proposed resolutions.\n\n## Proposed amendment to the articles of association relating to the time limit for the acquisition of the Company's shares by the Directors\n\nUnder the ethical rules applicable to Directors resulting from the AFEP/MEDEF Code, each Director must personally own shares of the Company.\n\nThe  Company's  articles  of  association  currently  state  that  each Director  must own at least 500 registered shares. If the Director does  not  own  shares  on  the  date  of  his  appointment,  or  if  he ceases  to  own  them  during  his  term  of  office,  the  Director  is deemed  to  have  resigned  with  immediate  effect  if  he  has  not rectified the situation within three months.\n\nIn order to align the time limit for this transaction with the time limit stipulated  in  law  (rectification  within  six  months)  and  to  facilitate compliance  by  Directors  with  the  requirement  to  own  Company shares,  it  is  proposed  in  the  24 th resolution  that  article  11 (Composition of the Board of Directors) in the Company's articles of association be amended.\n\n## Proposed amendment to the articles of association to provide for written consultation of the Board of Directors under the conditions established in the regulations\n\nIt is proposed  to  the  General  Meeting,  pursuant  to  article L. 225-37,  paragraph  3,  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  as amended by Law no. 2019-744 of July 19, 2019, that an option be introduced into the articles of association allowing members of the Board  of Directors to take certain decisions by written consultation, i.e. without holding a Board meeting.\n\nArticle  14  of  the  Company's  articles  of  association,  'Board  of Directors'  meetings  and  deliberations,'  would  consequently  be amended.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, in an emergency situation, as part of the provisional governance measures which may be implemented by the Board pursuant to which the Chairman of the Board of Directors might, for a limited period  of  time,  also  have  to  assume  the  role  of  Chief  Executive Officer, the age limit for the Chairman of the Board (70 or 72 years old  in  exceptional  circumstances),  would  also  apply  to  the Chairman assuming the functions of Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## Proposed amendment to the articles of association concerning the appointment of Deputy Statutory Auditors\n\nPursuant  to  article  L.  823-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code, amended  by  Law  no.  2016-1691  of  December  9,  2016,  it  is  no longer  mandatory  to  appoint  a  Deputy  Statutory  Auditor  if  the Principal  Statutory  Auditor  is  a  legal  entity  (excluding  singlemember companies).\n\nSince  the  terms  of  office  of  Auditex  company  and  Mr  JeanChristophe Georghiou as Deputy Statutory Auditors will expire at the end of this General Meeting (10 th resolution), it is proposed to Shareholders  to  decide  the  removal  of  the  reference  to  Deputy Statutory Auditors from the articles of association and, consequently, to approve the amendment of article 17 (Audit of the Company) therein.\n\n## Proposed amendments to the articles of association in order to harmonize the articles of association with various legal and regulatory provisions\n\nThe 28 th resolution is intended to amend the Company's articles of association  in  order  to  bring  them  into  compliance  with  various legal and regulatory provisions.\n\nTherefore,  it  is  proposed  that  you  approve  the  updating  of  the following articles within the Company's articles of association:\n\n- \u25a0 article 8 (Rights and obligations governing shares), following a recodification  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  that  grouped provisions  applicable  to  listed  companies  into  a  specific chapter (implementing Ordinance no. 2020-1142 of September 16, 2020, and Decree no. 2020-1742 of December 29, 2020);\n- \u25a0 article 18 (General Meetings), in order to update the reference to article 1316-4 of the French Civil Code, which was repealed by Ordinance no. 2016-131 of February 10, 2016;\n- \u25a0 article  23  (Disputes),  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Law no. 2019-222 of March 23, 2019, relating to the creation of a judicial court from the merging of tribunaux de grande instance (first instance courts) and tribunaux d'instance (local courts).\n\nThese amendments do not entail any fundamental changes to the articles concerned.",

loyalty dividend: 37,480,931 euros for 138,818,263 shares.\n\nThe adjustment especially arises from the change in the number of treasury shares, from the final determination of the loyalty dividend taking into account shares sold between January 1 and the ex-dividend date, from the exercise of options over this same period and the capital increase reserved for employees.\n\n- (c) Applicable, under certain conditions, when the progressive income tax rate is applied.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the articles of association, a loyalty dividend  of  10%,  i.e.  0.29  euros  per  share  with  a  par  value  of 5.50  euros,  shall  be  granted  to  shares  which  have  been  held  in registered form since December 31, 2019, and which remain held in this form continuously until May 18, 2022, the dividend payment date.\n\nIn  accordance with article 117 quater of the French General Tax Code,  it  is  specified  that  ordinary  and  loyalty  dividends  paid  to individuals  with  their  tax  residence  in  France  are  fully  subject  to the single flat-rate  withholding  tax  of  12.8%.  Nonetheless,  at  the express, irrevocable and global request of the Shareholder, these dividends may be subject to the progressive income tax rate and shall  therefore  be  eligible  for  the  40%  allowance  referred  to  in section 2\u00b0 of paragraph 3 of article 158 of the French General Tax Code, which is  applicable  under  certain  conditions.  In  all  cases, these ordinary and loyalty dividends shall also be subject to social contributions at a rate of 17.2%.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  the  loyalty  dividend  for  the  134,993,503 shares which have been held in registered form since December 31, 2019, and which remained held in this form continuously until December 31, 2021, amounts to 39,148,116 euros.\n\nThe  total  loyalty  dividend  corresponding  to  these  134,993,503 shares that cease to be held in registered form between January 1,  2022  and  May  18,  2022  dividend  payment  date,  shall  be deducted from the aforementioned amount.",

Subject  to  the approval of the 18 th resolution, treasury shares may also be canceled to offset, in the long term, the dilutive impact resulting from capital increases relating to employee share ownership transactions.\n\nThe Board also intends to maintain the liquidity contract in place, in accordance with the French financial market authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers) regulations.\n\nAs in previous years, the resolution stipulates that the authorization does not apply during takeover bid periods.\n\n## Fourth Resolution\n\n## (Authorization granted to the Board of Directors for a period of 18 months to allow the Company to trade in its own shares)\n\nThe  Shareholders,  deliberating  according  to  the  quorum  and majority  required  for  Ordinary  General  Meetings,  after  having reviewed the Report of the Board of Directors, in accordance with articles L. 22-10-62 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and the  directly  applicable  provisions  of  European  Commission Regulation No. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014, authorize the Board of Directors  to  allow  the  Company  to  repurchase  its  own  shares  in order to:\n\n- \u25a0 cancel them, subject to the adoption of the eighteen resolution;\n- \u25a0 tender  them  following  the  exercise  of  rights  attached  to marketable  securities  conferring  entitlement  to  Company shares by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n- \u25a0 implement (i) any share purchase option plans or (ii) plans for free  share  attributions,  or  (iii)  any  employee  share  ownership transactions  reserved  for  members  of  a  Company  Savings Plan,  performed  under  the  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in articles L. 3331-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code through the transfer  of  shares  bought  back  previously  by  the  Company under this resolution, or providing for free share attributions in respect of a contribution in shares by the Company and/or to replace the discount, or (iv) share grants to employees and/or Executive Officers of the Company or affiliated companies;\n- \u25a0 maintain an active market in the Company's shares pursuant to a  liquidity  contract  in  accordance  with  the  market  practice recognized  by  the  French  financial  market  authority  (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers).\n\nThe  buy-back  by  the  Company  of  its  own  shares  shall  be  also intended  to  enable  the  implementation  of  any  market  practice permitted  by  the  French  financial  market  authority  and,  more generally,  the  achievement  of  any  other  transaction  which  would comply  with  the  regulations  in  force.  In  this  case,  the  Company would inform its Shareholders by means of a press release.\n\nThe Shareholders set the maximum purchase price at 250 euros (excluding  acquisition  costs)  per  share  with  a  par  value  of 5.50  euros  and  the  maximum  number  of  shares  that  can  be bought back at 10% of the total number of shares comprising the share capital at December 31, 2021, i.e. 47,529,103 shares with a par  value  of  5.50  euros,  for  a  maximum  total  amount  of 11,882,275,750 euros, subject to the legal limits.\n\nThese  shares  may  be  purchased  at  any  time,  excluding  the periods for takeover bids on the Company's share capital, on one or more occasions and by all available means, either on or off a stock  exchange,  over-the-counter,  including  the  purchase  of blocks  of  shares,  or  through  the  use  of  derivative  financial instruments, and, if applicable, by all third parties acting on behalf of the Company, under the conditions stipulated in the provisions of  the  final  paragraph  of  article  L.  225-206  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\nShares bought back may be commuted, assigned or transferred in any  manner  on  or  off  a  stock  exchange  or  over-the-counter, including  the  sale  of  blocks  of  shares,  in  accordance  with  the applicable regulations.\n\nAs own shares do not confer entitlement to a dividend, the amount of the unpaid dividends will be allocated to retained earnings.\n\nThis  authorization  is  granted  for  a  period  of  18  months  starting from the date of this General Meeting. It shall be valid as of the date  of  the  Board  of  Directors  meeting  called  to  decide  on  the implementation of the share buy-back program and, at the latest, as of November 4, 2022. With effect from this date, it supersedes the authorization granted by the fourth resolution of the Ordinary General Meeting of May 4, 2021, with respect to the non-utilized portion of such authorization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The percentage of independent Directors is 91%.\n\nThe terms of office of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Ms Sin Leng Low and Ms Annette Winkler will expire at the end of this General Meeting.\n\nMs Sin Leng Low's term of office could in theory be renewed one last time since Ms Sin Leng Low will not have quite reached the statutory age limit as of the date of the General Meeting. However, the Board took note of Ms Sin Leng Low's wish not to have her term of office renewed. Ms Sin Leng Low was very warmly thanked for her contribution to the work of the Board of Directors, of which she has been a member since 2014, and her participation in the work of the Audit and Accounts Committee, of which she has been a member since 2015.\n\nRegarding Mr Jean-Paul Agon who will have a total of twelve years of office on the Board of Directors at the conclusion of the General Meeting, the Board took note of his wish not to have his term of office renewal proposed to the General Meeting. Mr Jean-Paul Agon was warmly  thanked  for  his  contribution  to  the  work  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  which  he  has  supported  since  2010,  for  his  exceptional commitment as a Lead Director and Chairman of the Appointments and Governance Committee, and for his participation in the work of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nPursuant to the 5 th resolution , Shareholders are invited to renew, for a period of four years, the term of office of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier . Mr Beno\u00eet Potier joined the Group in 1981. He became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2006 after having served as Chairman of the Management Board from 2001.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  November  30,  2021  based  on  a  unanimous  resolution  following  the  Appointments  and  Governance Committee's recommendations, announced its intention to adopt a new mode of governance by separating the functions of the Chairman of the Board of Directors from those of the Chief Executive Officer, to appoint Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as Chief Executive Officer, replacing Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in this role, who has led the Group for 20 years, and to renew Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's position as Chairman of the Board of Directors subject to the renewal of his term of office as Director by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022. In addition, the functions of the Lead Director would be maintained. The terms of this new governance which would take effect on June 1, 2022 are described in the Chapter 3, section 2.2 pages 129 to 132 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Board of Directors considers that the announced governance structure will provide the Group in the context of the succession with Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's  unparalleled  experience  following  his  20  years  at  the  Company's  helm,  his  commitment  to  promoting  the  Group's culture and values, his governance expertise founded on transparency and close ties with the Company's Shareholders.\n\nThe Board of Directors has already expressed its warmest thanks to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier for the fundamental transformation of the Group which has more than doubled in size under his leadership, whilst its capitalization  has  increased  fivefold.  In  addition  to Air  Liquide's international  expansion,  the  Board  highlights  its  position  at  the  forefront  of  the  markets  of  the  future  -  healthcare,  digital  and,  more recently, energy transition, with hydrogen in particular - placing the Company in a very favorable position to face the challenges of the coming decades. (The individual information sheet of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is provided page 155 of the Universal Registration Document).\n\nShareholders are invited to, in the 6 th resolution , appoint Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as Company Director . Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow joined the Air Liquide Group in 1993. After a wide-ranging, international career, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow has the benefit of his extensive experience of the  Group, combining strategic vision and knowledge of its business lines. A member of the Executive Committee as Executive Vice President, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow is notably in charge of Europe Industries, Healthcare in Europe and Africa Middle East & India hubs. The Global Healthcare activity, the Innovation & Technologies, Digital and IT functions are also under his supervision as well as Customer orientation  strategy.  (The  individual  information  sheet  of  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  is  provided  page  168  of  the  Universal  Registration Document).\n\nOn  the  recommendation  of  the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee  which  estimated  that  the  skills,  depth  of  experience  and personal  qualities  of  Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  made  him  the  best  candidate  to  succeed  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier,  the  Board  of  Directors  having deemed Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's qualities to be well aligned with the Group's performance and development strategy, decided in principle to appoint him as Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors in fact considers it essential for the Chief Executive Officer to participate as Director in the discussions and resolutions of the Board in charge of outlining the Company's strategic orientations.",

Ms Annette Winkler has been  an  independent  Director  since  2014,  Chair  of  the  Environment  and  Society  Committee  and  member  of  the Appointments  and Governance Committee. Ms Annette Winkler will continue to provide the Board of Directors with the benefit of her experience as Senior Manager of a division of a large industrial group with an international reach in the automotive sector.\n\nThe Board is assured that Ms Annette Winkler has sufficient availability to attentively participate in the work of the Board of Directors. In 2021,  Ms  Annette  Winkler  attendance  rate  at  Board  and  Committees  meetings  was  100%.  (The  individual  information  sheet  of Ms Annette Winkler is provided page 159 of the Universal Registration Document.)\n\nThe Board of Directors has indicated that it considers Ms Annette Winkler to be independent, and Mr Beno\u00eet Potier and Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow to be non independents .\n\nFurthermore and for the Shareholders' information, Mr Philippe Dubrulle's term of office as Director representing the employees is due to expire at the end of this General Meeting. The Group Committee in France, during its plenary meeting of December 16, 2021, renewed Mr Philippe Dubrulle as Director representing the employees for a term of 4 years expiring at the close of the General Meeting called to approve the 2025 Financial Statements.\n\nAt the end of this General Meeting, the Board of Directors would therefore comprise 12 members: 10 members appointed by the General Meeting, most of whom are independent (i.e. 80% Independent Directors), including 5 women (i.e. 50%) and 4 foreign nationals, and 2 Directors representing the employees.\n\n## Fifth Resolution\n\n## (Renewal of the term of office as a Director of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier)\n\nThe  Shareholders,  deliberating  according  to  the  quorum  and majority  required  for  Ordinary  General  Meetings,  after  having reviewed the Report of the Board of Directors, decide to renew the term of office of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as a Director for a period of four years, which will expire at the end of the 2026 General Meeting, held to approve the Financial Statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.\n\n## Sixth Resolution\n\n## (Appointment of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as Company Director)\n\nThe  Shareholders,  deliberating  according  to  the  quorum  and majority  required  for  Ordinary  General  Meetings,  after  having reviewed the Report of the Board of Directors, decide to appoint Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as a Director for a term of four years, which will expire at the end of the 2026 General Meeting held to approve the Financial Statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.\n\n## Seventh Resolution\n\n## (Renewal of the term of office as a Director of Ms Annette Winkler)\n\nThe  Shareholders,  deliberating  according  to  the  quorum  and majority  required  for  Ordinary  General  Meetings,  after  having reviewed the Report of the Board of Directors, decide to renew the term of office of Ms Annette Winkler as a Director for a period of four  years,  which  will  expire  at  the  end  of  the  2026  General Meeting,  held  to  approve  the  Financial  Statements  for  the  fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Shareholders are invited , on the recommendation of the Audit and Accounts Committee, based on its positive assessment of the work done by PricewaterhouseCoopers during its first term of office (particularly in terms of its good understanding of the challenges faced by Air Liquide and the way in which it operates), to renew this term of office , within the framework of the 8 th resolution , for a period of six fiscal years.\n\nGiven  the  length  of  Ernst  &  Young  et  Autres'  term  of  office  as  a  Principal  Statutory  Auditor  of  the  Company  (since  1983)  and  in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 of April 16, 2014, the renewal of its term of office will not be proposed to the  General  Meeting.  In  order  to  appoint  a  Principal  Statutory Auditor  to  replace  Ernst  &  Young  et Autres,  a  selection  process  was implemented, which was guided and monitored by the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\nAs part of this process, a selection timetable, including a call for tenders in 2020, was approved by the Audit and Accounts Committee in November 2019, in order to ensure compliance with the cooling-off period of one year, corresponding to the 2021 fiscal year, applicable to the selected firm, pursuant to article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 of April 16, 2014 and article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code. At the end of the tender process, the Audit and Accounts Committee approved the report on the conclusions of the Statutory Auditors selection procedure submitted to it by Executive Management and, after examining the documents and presentations of each firm  concerned  and  holding  Q&A  sessions,  made  a  recommendation  including  two  candidates  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  stating  its reasoned preference for KPMG S.A., particularly in view of the appropriate geographical coverage proposed by KPMG S.A. and its good understanding of the needs, challenges and activities of Air Liquide. It should be noted that the Committee was not influenced by any third party and was not subject to any contractual clause that restricted its decision in formulating this recommendation.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  this  justified  recommendation  from  the  Audit  and  Accounts  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  of November 2020, without the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer participating in the vote (pursuant to the regulations), decided to approve in principle the reasoned preference of the Audit and Accounts Committee and to propose to the General Meeting of 2022 the appointment  of  KPMG  S.A.  as  a  Statutory Auditor  of  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.,  replacing  Ernst  &  Young  et Autres.  The  Board  of  Directors confirmed this decision on February 15, 2022, (without the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer participating in the vote), on the basis of the final recommendation of the Audit and Accounts Committee issued with regard in particular of this firm's most recent inspection report.\n\nThus, on the recommendation of the Audit and Accounts Committee, the Board of Directors proposes, within the framework of the 9 th resolution , the appointment of KPMG S.A. as a Principal Statutory Auditor for a period of six fiscal years.\n\nIt  should also be noted that, since Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016, it is no longer obligatory to appoint a Deputy Statutory Auditor unless the Principal Statutory Auditor is a natural person or a single-member company. Accordingly, pursuant to article L. 823-1 of the French Commercial Code, it is proposed that, in the 10 th resolution , Shareholders acknowledge the expiration of the terms of office of Auditex company and Mr Jean-Christophe Georghiou as Deputy Statutory Auditors and that they will not be replaced.\n\n## Eighth Resolution\n\n## Renewal of the term of office as a Principal Statutory Auditor of PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nThe  Shareholders,  deliberating  according  to  the  quorum  and majority  required  for  Ordinary  General  Meetings,  decide,  on  the proposal  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  to  renew  for  a  period  of  six fiscal  years  the  term  of  office  as  a  Principal  Statutory Auditor  of PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit,  having  its  head  office  at  63,  rue de Villiers, 92200 Neuilly-sur-Seine, which will expire at the end of the  Ordinary  General  Meeting  held  to  approve  the  Financial Statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2027.\n\nThe Statutory Auditor has informed the Company in advance that it would accept the renewal of its term of office.\n\n## Ninth Resolution\n\n## (Appointment of KPMG S.A. as a Principal Statutory Auditor)\n\nThe  Shareholders,  deliberating  according  to  the  quorum  and majority  required  for  Ordinary  General  Meetings,  decide,  on  the proposal  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  to  appoint  as  a  Principal Statutory Auditor, replacing Ernst & Young et Autres, KPMG S.A., having  its  head  office  at  Tour  Eqho,  2,  avenue  Gambetta, 92066 Paris  La  D\u00e9fense  Cedex. This  six-year  term  of  office  will expire  at  the  end  of  the  Ordinary  General  Meeting  convened  to approve  the  Financial  Statements  for  the  fiscal  year  ending December 31, 2027.\n\nThe Statutory Auditor has informed the Company in advance that it would accept this appointment.",

It  supersedes  the authorization  granted  by  the  Extraordinary  General  Meeting  of May 4, 2021, in its fourteenth resolution with respect to the nonutilized portion of such authorization.\n\nFull  powers  are  granted  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  with  the possibility  of  sub-delegation  under  the  conditions  set  by  law,  to implement  this  authorization,  deduct  the  difference  between  the carrying amount of the shares canceled and their nominal amount from  all  reserve  and  additional  paid-in  capital  accounts  and  to carry out the necessary formalities to implement the reduction in capital  which  shall  be  decided  in  accordance  with  this  resolution and amend the articles of association accordingly.\n\n## Resolution 19 Share capital increase through capitalization of additional paid-in capital, reserves, profits or any other amounts\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Combined General Meeting of May 5, 2020 authorized the Board of Directors, for a period of 26 months, to increase the share capital, on one or more occasions, through the incorporation of additional paid-in capital, reserves, profits or other amounts, including with a view to free shares attributions for Shareholders. This authorization has not been used.\n\nAs in 2020, in order to provide Shareholders with the right to express an opinion on such a capital increase during periods of takeover bids, it is proposed that this delegation of authority be suspended during periods of takeover bids.\n\nThe aim of the 19 th resolution is to renew this authorization up to a maximum of 300 million euros.\n\n## Nineteenth Resolution\n\n(Delegation of authority granted to the Board of Directors for a period of 26 months in order to increase the share capital through the incorporation of additional paid-in capital, reserves, profits or any other amounts, for a maximum amount of 300 million euros)\n\nThe  Shareholders,  deliberating  according  to  the  quorum  and majority  required  for  Ordinary  General  Meetings,  after  having reviewed  the  Report  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  pursuant  to articles  L.  225-129-2,  L.  225-130  and  L.  22-10-50  of  the  French Commercial Code:\n\n- \u25a0 delegate  to  the  Board  of  Directors,  with  the  option  of  subdelegation,  the  authority  necessary  to  increase  the  share capital on one or more occasions, according to the terms and conditions  and  at  the  time  it  shall  determine,  through  the capitalization  of  additional  paid-in  capital,  reserves,  profits  or any other amounts that may be capitalized, the capitalization of which  will  be  possible  under  the  law  and  the  articles  of association, as a free share attribution to Shareholders and/or an increase in the par value of the existing shares;\n- \u25a0 the delegation thereby granted to the Board of Directors is valid for a period of 26 months starting from the date of this General Meeting,  it  being  specified,  however,  that  the  Board  of Directors will not be authorized to make use of it during periods of takeover bids on the Company's share capital;",

The  Board  of  Directors  has  not  awarded  stock  options  since  2019,  but  has  not  ruled  out  using  this  remuneration instrument, according to the conditions described above, if changes in circumstances justify doing so.\n\nIn order to pursue this attribution policy, it is proposed that you renew the existing authorizations.\n\nAs in the past, the performance conditions apply to all options and performance shares awarded to any beneficiary and are calculated over three years. They are set at the beginning of the year at the February meeting of the Board of Directors, in order to comply with a reference period of three full years.\n\nThe  criteria  used  include  ROCE  (Return  on  Capital  Employed),  which  is  relevant  in  very  capital  intensive  industry,  and  TSR  (Total Shareholder Return), which enables the Company's performance to be aligned with the regular returns expected by its Shareholders. In addition,  since  the  2020  performance  share  plans,  the  performance  conditions  have  included  a  performance  condition  linked  to  the Group's  Climate  Objectives.  For  the  2022  plans,  this  criterion  will  be  aligned  with  the  sustainable  development  goals  published  in March 2021 (ACT).\n\nIt should be noted that, since 2018, the award of long-term incentives (LTIs) to the Executive Officer has been subject to the principle of prorating. In practice, if the officer leaves for any reason other than resignation or removal from office for serious cause (situations which will result in the loss of the LTI), the overall allocation rate (when the performance conditions have been applied) will be reduced on a prorated basis, according to the number of months of the officer's actual presence at the Group during the period of assessment of the performance criteria.\n\nIn addition, under the principle applied since 2016, the attribution of performance shares to the Executive Officer is assessed according to IFRS.\n\nLastly, the proposed resolutions set sub-limits for Executive Officers, it being specified that the Board of Directors sets annual limits that are substantially lower than these sub-limits. Attributions to Executive Officers are also accompanied by strict shareholding obligations.\n\nThe 20 th resolution is intended to renew, for a period of 38 months, the authorization granted by the 2019 General Meeting to the Board of Directors to grant options to subscribe or purchase shares of the Company for the benefit of employees and Executive Officers. The draft resolution maintains the total number of options allowed at 2% of the share capital over 38 months, and sets the limit on the number of shares that can be awarded to Executive Officers at the same time at 0.2% of the share capital.\n\nThe 21 st resolution is intended to renew, for a period of 38 months, the authorization granted by the 2019 General Meeting to the Board of  Directors  to  grant performance shares of  the  Company  for  the  benefit  of  employees  and  Executive  Officers. The  draft  resolution maintains the total number of shares that can be attributed at 0.5% of the share capital over 38 months, and sets the limit on the number of shares that can be awarded to Executive Officers at 0.1% of the capital at the same time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It shall entail an express waiver  by  the  Shareholders  of  their  preferential  subscription right to the shares that shall be issued as and when the options are  exercised  in  favor  of  the  share  subscription  option beneficiaries;\n- \u25a0 decide that the Board of Directors, within the limits provided for by law and this resolution, shall set the conditions under which the options will be granted, as well as the list of beneficiaries and  the  number  of  options  offered,  and  shall  determine  the subscription or purchase price of the shares, which may not be lower  than  the  average  of  the  opening  trading  prices  for  the 20 trading  days  prior  to  the  date  when  the  option  is  granted, rounded  down  to  the  nearest  euro,  nor  for  share  purchase options, the average purchase price of the Company's treasury shares, rounded down to the nearest euro. This price may not be modified unless the Company were to carry out one of the financial or securities transactions provided for by law. In such a case, the Board of Directors would, according to regulatory conditions, adjust the number and price of the shares covered by  the  options  granted,  to  take  account  of  the  impact  of  the transaction;  it  may  also,  in  such  a  case,  if  it  deemed  this\n\n- necessary,  temporarily  suspend  the  right  to  exercise  the options during the aforementioned transaction;\n- \u25a0 grant full powers to the Board of Directors, with the option of sub-delegation  under  the  conditions  set  by  law,  to,  where applicable,  deduct  the  share  capital  increase  costs  from  the amount of additional paid-in capital relating to such increases, complete or have completed all actions and formalities in order to  record  the  share  capital  increase(s)  resulting  from  the exercise of share subscription options, and amend the articles of association accordingly.\n\nThis authorization supersedes the authorization granted by virtue of the thirteenth resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of May 7, 2019, for its unused portion.\n\n## Twenty-first Resolution\n\n(Authorization granted to the Board of Directors for a period of 38 months to grant existing or new shares to employees and Executive Officers of the Group, or some of such employees and Executive Officers, resulting in the waiver by Shareholders of their preferential subscription rights to the shares to be issued)\n\nThe  Shareholders,  deliberating  according  to  the  quorum  and majority required for Extraordinary General Meetings, after having reviewed the Report of the Board of Directors and the Statutory Auditors' Special Report:\n\n- \u25a0 authorize  the  Board  of  Directors,  within  the  scope  of  articles L. 225-197-1  et  seq.,  L.  22-10-59  and  L.  22-10-60  of  the French  Commercial  Code,  to  proceed,  on  one  or  more occasions, to free share attribution of existing or new shares to beneficiaries, whom  it  will determine  from  among  the employees  and  Executive  Officers  of  the  Company  and  the entities affiliated with  the  Company,  pursuant  to  article L. 225-197-2 of the aforementioned Code, under the following conditions;\n- \u25a0 decide  that  the  existing  or  new  shares  that  are  granted pursuant  to  this  authorization  may  not  represent  more  than 0.5% of  the  share  capital  on  the  date  of  the  decision  by  the Board  of  Directors  to  grant  them,  bearing  in  mind  that  the shares granted to Executive Officers of the Company pursuant to this authorization may not represent more than 0.1% of the share  capital  on  the  date  of  the  decision  by  the  Board  of Directors  to  grant  them;  the  total  numbers  of  shares  thus determined  do  not  take  into  account  any  adjustments  that could  be  made  in  the  event  of  a  transaction  involving  the Company's share capital;\n- \u25a0 decide  that  the  maximum  par  value  amount  of  share  capital increases performed on the basis of this authorization shall be deducted from the overall limit stipulated in paragraph 2 of the fifteenth  resolution  of  the  Extraordinary  General  Meeting  of May 4, 2021 (or any resolution which would replace it at a later date);\n- \u25a0 decide that the grant of such shares to their beneficiaries shall become definitive either:\n- -at  the  end  of  a  minimum  vesting  period  of  two  years,  it being specified that the beneficiaries shall then be required to hold such shares for a minimum period of two years as from their final grant date, or:",

The total nominal amount of share capital increases likely to be performed under this resolution is 22 million euros, corresponding to the issue of a maximum of 4 million shares, or 0.84% of the share capital as at December 31, 2021. This amount shall be deducted from the maximum nominal amount of 470 million euros, i.e. around 18% of the share capital, as stipulated in the 15 th resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of May 4, 2021 relating to the overall limit for share capital increases likely to be performed with delegation to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe 22 nd resolution outlines the conditions of share capital increases reserved for members of a Company or Group Savings Plan; it is accompanied in the 23 rd resolution by a similar provision for Group employees and corporate officers based abroad who cannot benefit from the shareholding mechanism which will be established pursuant to the 22 nd resolution.\n\nThese two delegations will be valid for a period of 26 months for the 22 nd resolution and for a period of 18 months for the 23 th resolution. They shall result in the waiver by Shareholders of their preferential subscription rights in favor of the beneficiaries.\n\nThe previous employee share ownership operation took place in November 2021, in accordance with the authorization granted by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021. The share subscription price was set at 113.23 euros (120.31 euros for the United States) per share. 22,420 employees (and retired employees) in 74 countries representing 33.81% of eligible employees subscribed to this operation.\n\nThe Group wishes to continue increasing the involvement of employees in its development. These employee share ownership offers contribute significantly to increasing employee motivation and a sense of belonging to the Group.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the share capital held by employees and former employees of the Group is estimated at 2.73% of which 1.93% corresponds  to  shares  subscribed  by  employees  during  capital  increases  reserved  for  employees  or  held  through  dedicated  mutual funds.\n\n- -provide  for  the  possibility  to  provisionally  suspend  the rights to the attribution under the conditions provided for by law and the applicable regulations,\n- -register  the  free  shares  attributed  in  a  registered account  in  the  name  of  the  holder,  mentioning,  where applicable, the holding period and the duration of such period, and to waive the holding period for the shares in any  circumstance  in  which  this  resolution  or  the applicable  regulations  make  it  possible  to  waive  such holding period,\n- -provide  for  the  possibility,  if  it  deems  it  necessary,  to adjust the number of free shares attributed in order to preserve the rights  of  the  beneficiaries  in  the  event  of any transactions on the Company's share capital during the  vesting  period,  as  referred  to  article  L.  225-181, paragraph  2,  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  under conditions which it shall determine,\n- -in  the  event of the issuance of new shares, to deduct, where applicable, from the reserves, profits or additional paid-in  capital  as  it  chooses,  the  amounts  required  to pay  for  such  shares,  to  record  the  completion  of  the share capital increases carried out under this authorization,  to  amend  the  articles  of  association accordingly  and,  in  general,  to  carry  out  all  necessary acts and formalities.\n\nThis authorization is granted for a period of 38 months as from the date hereof and supersedes the authorization granted by virtue of the fourteenth resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of May 7, 2019, for its unused portion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, in an emergency situation, as part of the provisional governance measures which may be implemented by the Board pursuant to which the Chairman of the Board of Directors might, for a limited period of time, also have to assume the role of Chief Executive Officer, the age limit for the Chairman of the Board (70 or 72 years old in exceptional circumstances), would also apply to the Chairman assuming the functions of Chief Executive Officer.",

It  may  also  be  increased  by  exercising the  rights  attached  to  marketable  securities  granting  access  to share capital, under the conditions stipulated by law.\n\nIn  accordance  with  prevailing  legal  provisions,  unless  otherwise decided  by  the  General  Meeting,  the  shareholders  have,  in proportion  to  the  amount  of  shares  they  own,  a  preferential subscription right to the shares issued in cash in order to increase share capital.\n\nThe  share  capital  may  also  be  reduced  under  the  conditions stipulated  by  law,  in  particular,  by  reducing  the  par  value  of  the shares,  or  by  reimbursing  or  redeeming  shares  on  the  stock exchange  and  by  canceling  shares,  or  by  exchanging  existing shares for new shares, in an equivalent or lesser number, with or without the same par value, and with or without a cash balance to be paid or received. The General Meeting may always compel the shareholders  to  sell  or  purchase  existing  shares  to  permit  the exchange of existing shares for new shares, with or without a cash balance  to  be  paid  or  received,  even  if  such  reduction  is  not  a result of losses.\n\n## Article 6: Shares\n\nIf  the  new  shares  are  not  fully  paid  up  upon  issuance,  calls  for payment  shall  be  performed,  on  dates  set  by  the  Board  of Directors,  by  means  of  announcements  posted  one  month  in advance in one of the Paris official legal publications chosen for the legal publication of the Company's deeds.\n\nShares not fully  paid  up  shall  be  held  as  registered  shares  until they are fully paid up.\n\nEach payment on any subscribed shares will be registered in an account opened in the name of the subscriber.\n\nAll late payments shall automatically bear interest, for the benefit of the Company, as of the due date, without any formal notice or legal  action,  at  the  legal  interest  rate,  subject  to  any  personal action  that  the  Company  may  take  against  any  defaulting shareholder and the compulsory execution measures provided by law.\n\n## Article 7: Type of shares\n\nPaid-up  shares  are  registered  as  registered  shares  or  bearer shares depending on the choice of the shareholder.\n\nThe  provisions  of  the  aforementioned  paragraph  also  apply  to other securities of any nature issued by the Company.\n\n## Article 8: Rights and obligations governing shares\n\nShareholders  shall  not  be  liable  above  the  amount  of  their subscription.\n\nShare ownership automatically binds shareholders to the articles of association and the decisions of the General Meetings.\n\nSubject to legal and regulatory restrictions, voting rights attached to the shares are proportionate to the capital quota they represent and each share confers the right to one vote. In accordance with the option provided for in paragraph 3 of article L. 225-123 of the French  Commercial  Code,  double  voting  rights  will  not  be conferred  to  paid-up  shares  and  for  which  a  nominative registration  for  at  least  two  years  in  the  name  of  the  same shareholder can be proved.\n\nAny  share  grants  entitlement,  during  the  Company's  term,  as  in the event of liquidation, to the payment of an identical net amount for any distribution or redemption.\n\nShares  are  freely  transferable  under  the  conditions  provided  by law.\n\n## Article 9: Identification of shareholders\n\nThe  Company  may  avail  itself  at  any  time  of  the  legal  and statutory  provisions  in  force  permitting  the  identification  of  the owners of shares conferring immediately or in the future the right to vote in General Meetings, as well as the number of shares they own.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  legal  obligations  to  notify  the  Company,  any person,  acting  alone  or  jointly,  coming  in  direct  or  indirect possession of a fraction of the Company's capital or voting rights equal to or greater than 2%, or a multiple of 2% of capital or voting rights (including above the 5% threshold), is required to inform the Company within fifteen days as of the date on which the threshold is  exceeded  and,  as  the  case  may  be,  independently  of  the effective transfer date of share ownership. The person shall state the number  of  shares  and  marketable  securities  granting entitlement  to  capital  that  he  or  she  owns  on  the  date  of notification. Any decrease below the 2% threshold or a multiple of 2% of capital or voting rights shall be notified in the same manner.\n\nTo  determine  share  capital  and  voting  rights  thresholds,  the crossing of which must be declared under the previous paragraph, assimilation  rules  set  out  in  article  L.  233-9  of  the  French Commercial Code are applied.\n\nIn  the  event  of  a  failure  to  meet  this  additional  notification obligation,  one  or  several  shareholders,  owning  a  fraction  of  the Company's capital or voting rights amounting to at least 2%, may, at  a  General  Meeting,  request  that  the  shares  exceeding  the fraction  which  should  have  been  reported,  be  stripped  of  their voting rights for any General Meeting held until the end of a twoyear period following the date on which the notice is rectified. The request is recorded in the Minutes of the General Meeting.",

However, the bare-owner shall be entitled to attend all General  Meetings.  He  or  she  may  also  represent  the  beneficial owner at General Meetings.\n\n## Section III\n\n## MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY\n\n## Article 11: Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Company is managed by a Board of Directors, comprising a minimum  of  three  members  and  a  maximum  of  14  members (unless  temporarily  waived  in  the  event  of  a  merger),  physical persons or legal entities.\n\nThe  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  are  appointed  by  the Ordinary General Meeting for a term of four years expiring at the close  of  the  General  Meeting  held  to  approve  the  Financial Statements  for  the  previous  year  and  which  is  held  in  the  year during which the mandate expires. As an exception to this rule, the members of the first Board of Directors who exercised functions as members  of  the  Supervisory  Board  in  the  Company  under  its former  mode  of  administration  shall  be  appointed  for  a  period equal to the remaining term of their mandate as members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors may be re-elected.\n\nEach  Director  must  own  at  least  500  registered  shares  in  the Company during the term of his functions.  If,  on  the  date  of  his appointment,  a  Director  does  not  own  the  required  number  of shares  or  if,  during  his  term,  he  ceases  to  own  them,  he  is deemed  to  have  resigned  with  immediate  effect  if  he  has  not rectified the situation within a period of three months.\n\nIn  the  event  of  a  vacancy  of  one  or  more  seats  due  to  death  or resignation,  the  Board  of  Directors  may,  between  two  General Meetings, make temporary appointments. Provisional appointments made by the Board of Directors are subject to the approval of the next Ordinary General Meeting. If the number of Directors  falls  below  the  legal  minimum,  the  remaining  Directors must immediately convene an Ordinary General Meeting in order to make up the numbers of the Board.\n\nNo individual over the age of 70 shall be appointed as a member of the Board of Directors if his appointment increases the number of  the  members of the Board of Directors who have passed this age  to  over  one  third.  If  during  their  term,  the  number  of  the members of the Board of Directors who have passed 70 years of age  exceeds  one  third  of  the  Board's  members,  the  oldest member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  who  has  not  carried  out management  functions  in  the  Company  is  deemed  to  have resigned at the end of the Annual General Meeting held following the occurrence of this event.\n\nDuring  the  Company's  term,  Directors  are  appointed  and  their mandates renewed under the conditions provided by law.\n\nThey may be dismissed by the Ordinary General Meeting at any time.\n\n## General information\n\nThe heirs, creditors, trustees or successors of a shareholder may not,  on  any  grounds  whatsoever,  call  for  the  affixing  of  seals  on the  Company's  assets  and  securities,  request  the  distribution thereof, or interfere in any manner whatsoever in its administration.\n\nIn order to exercise their rights, they must consult the Company's records and decisions of the General Meetings.\n\n## Director(s) representing employees\n\nIn  accordance  with  statutory  requirements,  if  the  number  of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial Code, is less than or equal to eight, the Group Committee in France shall proceed to appoint a Director representing employees.\n\nIf the number of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article  L.  225-27-1-II  of  the  French  Commercial Code, is more than eight, and provided this criterion is still fulfilled on the date of the appointment, a second Director representing  employees  shall  be  appointed  by  the  European Works Council.\n\nIf the number of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article  L.  225-27-1-II  of  the  French  Commercial Code, was originally more than eight members but becomes less than  or  equal  to  eight  members,  the  Director  appointed  by  the European  Works  Council  shall  remain  in  office  until  his  term  of office expires.\n\nAs an exception to the foregoing, the Director representing employees appointed by virtue of this clause is not required to hold at least 500 registered shares during his term of office.\n\nThe Director representing employees shall be appointed for a fouryear  term  expiring  at  the  close  of  the  General  Meeting  called  to approve the Financial Statements for the previous year and which is held in the year in which his term of office expires. The tenure of the Director representing employees may be renewed.\n\nThe  tenure  of  the  Director  representing  employees  shall  be terminated  in  accordance  with  statutory  requirements  and  the provisions  contained  in  this  clause,  particularly  in  the  event  of termination  of  said  Director's  employment  contract;  if  the  criteria for the application of article L. 225-27-1 of the Commercial Code are no longer met, the tenure of the Director(s) representing  employees  shall  expire  at  the  end  of  the  meeting during  which  the  Board  of  Directors  observes  that  the  Company has been released from this obligation.\n\nIn the event that the seat of a Director representing employees is vacant for any reason whatsoever, the vacant seat shall be filled under  the  conditions  set  forth  in  article  L.  225-34  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  provisions  of  the  second  paragraph  of  article L. 225-29 of the French Commercial Code, it is stipulated, if need be, that any failure to appoint a Director representing employees by  the  body  designated  herein,  in  accordance  with  the  law  and with this clause, shall not invalidate the resolutions of the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It determines his remuneration and sets his  term  of  office  which  may  not  exceed  his  term  of  office  as Director. The Chairman may be re-elected.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  performs  the  duties entrusted  to  him  by  law.  He  chairs  the  Board  of  Directors, organizes and manages its work and reports on such work to the General Meeting. He ensures that the Company's bodies operate properly and, in particular, that the Directors are able to fulfill their assignments.\n\nThe  Board  may  also  appoint  from  among  its  members  one  or more  Vice  Chairmen,  whose  term  of  office  shall  be  determined within  the  limit  of  their  term  as  Director  and  whose  role  it  is, subject  to  the  legal  provisions  applicable  in  the  event  of  the temporary impediment or death of the Chairman, to convene and chair  Board  meetings  or  chair  General  Meetings  in  accordance with these articles of association when the Chairman is impeded.\n\nNo Director who does not also assume the role of Chief Executive Officer may be appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors after the age of 70 (or 72 if the Board decides at its discretion to derogate  from  this  limit  in  exceptional  circumstances).  If,  during the  term  of  office,  this  age  limit  is  reached,  the  Chairman's mandate shall terminate at the close of the General Meeting held to approve the Financial Statements for the year during which he has reached the age limit.\n\nIf the Chairman of the Board of Directors also assumes the role of Chief Executive Officer, the applicable age limit is that applicable to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Chairman and each Vice Chairman may be dismissed by the Board of Directors at any time. They may also be re-elected.\n\nThe  Board  may  appoint  a  secretary  who  need  not  be  a shareholder or one of its members.\n\n## Article 13: General Management\n\n## Management organization\n\nIn accordance with the law, the Company's General Management is assumed either by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or by any other physical person, Director or not, appointed by the Board of Directors and who assumes the role of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe  choice  between  either  of  the  two  General  Management organizations described above is made by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors makes its decision relating to the choice of General Management organization under the quorum and majority conditions stipulated in article 14 of these articles of association. The shareholders and third parties are informed of the Board of Directors' decision  under  the  conditions  stipulated  by  the regulations in force.\n\nWhen  the  Company's  General  Management  is  assumed  by  the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors must appoint,  among  its  members  considered  as  independent  by  the Board of Directors, a Lead  Director. The  conditions of appointment,  the  tasks  and  powers  of  the  Lead  Director  (in particular, if applicable, the power to ask to convene a meeting of the  Board  of  Directors),  are  set  out  in  the  Board  of  Directors' internal regulations.\n\nThe choice made by the Board of Directors remains valid until it decides otherwise.\n\nThe Board of Directors will review, as necessary, the choice made each time the mandate of the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer comes up for renewal.\n\n## Chief Executive Officer\n\nIf  the  Company's  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  assumed  by  the Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  following  provisions relating to the Chief Executive Officer are applicable.\n\nThe Board of Directors sets the term of office and determines the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nNo individual over the age limit set by law may be appointed as Chief Executive Officer. If, during the term of office, this age limit is reached, the Chief Executive Officer's mandate shall terminate at the  close  of  the  General  Meeting  held  to  approve  the  Financial Statements for the year during which he has reached the age limit set by law.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer may be dismissed at any time by the Board of Directors. The discharge of a Chief Executive Officer who does not assume the role of Chairman may give rise to damages if decided without reasonable cause.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer may always be re-elected.\n\n## Powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances on behalf of the Company within the limit of  the  Company's  corporate  purpose,  the  articles  of  association, and  subject  to  the  powers  expressly  granted  by  law  to  General Meetings and the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for defining the decisions of the  Chief  Executive  Officer  that  require  its  prior  approval.  The Board of Directors' prior approval should be sought particularly for external  acquisitions  or  sales  of  interests  or  assets,  and  for investment commitments, in each case under the conditions and exceeding the amounts corresponding to an efficient operation of the Company as set by the Board of Directors. It should also be sought  for financing operations of any  amount  likely  to substantially  alter  the  Company's  financial  structure  and  for  any decision  likely  to  substantially  alter  the  Company's  strategic orientations determined by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Senior Executive Vice-Presidents\n\nOn  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  proposal,  whether  he  be Chairman of the Board of Directors or any other person, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more physical persons as Senior Executive Vice-Presidents to assist the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe maximum number of Senior Executive Vice Presidents is set at three.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Board  of Directors determines the scope and term of the powers granted to the Senior Executive Vice Presidents and sets their remuneration.\n\nThe Senior Executive Vice Presidents have the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer vis-\u00e0-vis third parties.",

In the absence of a Vice Chairman, the minimum of one third of members of the Board  of  Directors  or  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  depending  on the  case,  shall  have  the  authority  to  call  the  Board  and  set  the meeting's agenda.\n\nNotices may be made by all means, including verbally.\n\nThe presence of one half of the members of the Board of Directors is required for the validity of the Board's decisions.\n\nDecisions  are  made  by  a  simple  majority  of  the  votes  of  the members  present  or  represented.

The Board determines the composition and powers of the Committees which conduct their activities under its responsibility.\n\nIssues  related  to  the  performance,  remuneration  and,  where appropriate, the renewal of the term of office of the Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer,  or  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  shall  be decided by the Board of Directors as and when required, and at least once a year, after analysis by the Committee(s) of the Board of Directors that deal with appointment and remuneration issues.\n\n## Article 16: Remuneration\n\nThe Ordinary General Meeting may allocate to the members of the Board  of  Directors,  as  remuneration  for  their  activity,  a  fixed annual  amount.  The  Board  of  Directors  is  free  to  distribute  the overall  sum  thus  allocated  among  its  members.  It  may  also allocate  a  greater  amount  to  the  Directors  who  are  members  of Committees  set  up  within  the  Board  than  that  allocated  to  the other Directors.\n\nThe  Board  may  allocate  exceptional  sums  to  remunerate assignments or mandates entrusted to the members of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It  may  also authorize the submission to the Company of the proxy or absentee ballot forms  by  teletransmission  (including  electronically)  in accordance with prevailing regulatory and legal provisions.\n\nThe  electronic  signature  can,  when  used,  take  the  form  of  a process that satisfies the conditions defined in the first sentence of section 2 of article 1316-4 of the French Civil Code.\n\nThe  General  Meeting,  duly  constituted,  represents  all  of  the shareholders.\n\nOrdinary  and  Extraordinary  General  Meetings,  and  where necessary,  Special  General  Meetings  are  convened,  meet  and deliberate under the conditions provided by law and these articles of association.\n\nMeetings  take  place  at  the  Head  Office  or  at  any  other  place designated by the author of the notice, even outside of the Head Office or the Head Office's department.\n\n## Section VI\n\n## INVENTORY - RESERVES - DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITS\n\n## Article 20: Fiscal year\n\nThe fiscal year begins on January 1 and ends on December 31.\n\n## Article 21: Inventory, distribution of profits\n\nThe Company's net proceeds, established in the annual inventory, after deducting overheads  and  other  costs,  including all amortization,  depreciation  and  provisions,  constitute  the  net profits.\n\nFrom these profits, less, as the case may be, previous losses, a deduction of at least 5% is first of all made to create the reserve required by law. This deduction ceases to be mandatory when the reserve amounts to 10% of the share capital. It is resumed if this reserve is ever used.\n\nThe distributable profits are made up of the annual net profits, less previous  losses,  as  well  as  the  sums  to  be  placed  on  reserve pursuant to law, plus the profit carried forward.\n\nFrom these profits, a deduction is made of the amount necessary to pay the shareholders, as a first dividend, 5% of the sums paidup on their shares, and not amortized, and 5% of the sums from premiums  on  shares  issued  in  cash,  and  appearing  in  a  'share premium'  account,  without  it  being  possible,  if  the  profits  of  a given  year  do  not  permit  this  payment,  for  the  shareholders  to claim such amounts from the profits of subsequent years.\n\nThe General Meeting may decide to earmark any portion  of  the available surplus of said profits it wishes for the creation of general or special  providence  or  reserve  funds,  under  any  name whatsoever or even simply as an amount carried forward.\n\nThe balance constitutes a surplus fund which is intended for the distribution  of  the  second  dividend  as  well  as  the  amount provisionally assessed as necessary to pay a 10% increase to the registered shares satisfying the following conditions.\n\nGeneral  Meetings  are  chaired  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors or,  in  his  absence,  by  the  Vice  Chairman  or  the  oldest Vice Chairman of the Board, if one or more Vice Chairmen have been appointed, or otherwise by a Director specifically appointed for this purpose by the Board.\n\nIn the event of impediment of the Vice Chairman or Vice Chairmen when Vice Chairmen have been appointed or if the Board has not appointed  a  Director,  the  shareholders  shall  themselves  appoint the Chairman.\n\nThe two members of the General Meeting with the highest number of votes and having accepted the position act as ballot inspectors for  the  General  Meeting.  The  officers  of  the  Meeting  appoint  a secretary who need not be a shareholder.\n\nIn the event that the Meeting is convened by a Statutory Auditor or by a judicial representative, the General Meeting is chaired by the author of the notice.\n\nUpon  the  decision  of  the  Board  of  Directors  published  in  the Notice  of  Meeting  or  notice  of  convocation  to  rely  on  means  of telecommunication, the shareholders who take part in the General Meeting by videoconference or using telecommunications means permitting  their  identification  in  accordance  with  the  conditions provided  by  prevailing  law,  shall  be  considered  as  present  for calculating the quorum and voting majority.\n\n## Article 19: Powers of Shareholders' Meetings\n\nOrdinary  and  Extraordinary  General  Meetings,  and  where necessary,  Special  General  Meetings  allow  shareholders  to exercise  the  powers  defined  by  law  and  these  articles  of association.",

They appoint and determine the powers of one or more liquidators.\n\nThe liquidators  may,  pursuant  to  a  decision  of  the  shareholders, transfer to another company or sell to a company or to any other entity or person, all or part of the assets, rights and obligations of the dissolved Company.\n\n## Section VIII\n\n## DISPUTES\n\n## Article 23: Disputes\n\nAll  disputes  which  may  arise  during  the  Company's  term  or liquidation, either between the shareholders and the Company or among the shareholders themselves, regarding Company affairs, are settled in accordance with law and submitted to the jurisdiction of the competent Paris courts.\n\n## General information\n\nThe new shares created in this manner will be comparable in all respects  to  the  existing  shares  from  which  they  are  issued,  for calculating the entitlement to the higher dividends and the higher attributions.\n\nThe  increases  defined  in  each  of  the  two  preceding  paragraphs may  be  modified  or  eliminated  by  simple  decision  during  the Extraordinary  General  Meeting,  according  to  the  procedures  it determines.\n\nPursuant to law, the number of shares eligible for these increases shall not for any given shareholder exceed 0.5% of the Company's share capital.\n\nThe General Meeting held to approve the Financial Statements for the year shall have the possibility of granting to each shareholder, for  all  or  part  of  the  dividend  or  interim  dividends,  an  option  for payment  of  the  dividend  or  interim  dividends  in  either  cash  or shares.\n\nThe  duly constituted General Meeting retains the same prerogatives during the liquidation as during the Company's term. In  particular,  it  has  the  power  to  approve  the  accounts  of  the liquidation and to grant a discharge thereof.\n\nAfter  the  Company's  commitments  have  been  settled,  the  net proceeds  from  the  liquidation  are  used  first  to  fully  redeem  the shares, and the surplus is then distributed equally among them.\n\nFor this  purpose,  in  the  event  of  disputes,  all  shareholders  shall elect  domicile  in  Paris,  and  all  summonses  and  notices  are  duly served at this domicile.\n\nFailing  election  of  domicile,  summonses  and  notices  are  validly served at the Office of Public Prosecution of the French Republic at the High Court of Paris.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Technical glossary\n\n## Advanced materials\n\nReplaces  the  ALOHA  range  and  the  advanced  precursors  and includes ALOHA and Voltaix.\n\n## Alternative energy\n\nEnergy  that  represents  an  alternative  to  traditional  energies, produced  by  transformation  of  natural  gas  or  coal  using gasification and/or gas cleaning techniques.\n\n## ASU\n\nAir Separation Unit.\n\n## Biogas\n\nRenewable  energy  that  is  produced  during  the  methanization  of biomass (treatment  of  household  waste,  industrial  or  agricultural waste,  sewage  sludge),  then  transformed  using  Air  Liquide purification and liquefaction technologies.\n\n## Bio-GNV\n\nClean fuel, produced from biogas.\n\n## Carrier gases\n\nCarrier  gases  (nitrogen,  oxygen,  hydrogen,  etc.)  are  used  to transport  and  dilute  process  gases  or  to  protect  semiconductors from minute dust particles.\n\n## Cogen\n\nCogeneration  is  the  simultaneous  production  of  electricity  and steam.  It  is  an  environmentally  virtuous  process  as  it  avoids energy  loss  by  harnessing  the  heat  emitted  during  electricity production to produce steam.\n\n## Cold technologies\n\nAll cryogenic-related technologies used, primarily, in the production of air gases.\n\n## Cryogenics\n\nVery low temperatures, necessary to the liquifaction of air gases, hydrogen and helium. Concerns temperatures below -150 degrees Celsius.\n\n## Fab\n\nProduction facility in the electronics sector.\n\n## Fellow\n\nThe second highest international level of expertise (among four) in the Air  Liquide Technical  Career  Ladder.  Fellows  are  recognized as  worldwide  authorities  within  their  given  field  of  expertise. Fellows  are  consultants  of  the  top  management  in  long-term company strategy.\n\n## Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n\n- \u25a0 The release of GHGs into the atmosphere. GHGs are the six gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol;\n- \u25a0 Direct  GHG  emissions:  emissions  from  sources  owned  or controlled  by  the  reporting  company.  These  emissions  are reported in 'Scope 1';\n- \u25a0 Indirect GHG emissions: emissions that are a consequence of the  reporting  company's  activities,  but  which  come  from sources  owned  or  controlled  by  another  company.  Indirect emissions  induced  by  the  production  of  electricity  and  steam purchased by the Group are reported in Scope 2, while other relevant indirect emissions are reported in Scope 3;\n- \u25a0 Avoided  GHG  emissions:  emission  reductions  achieved  by activities, products or services that emit less GHG than would have been emitted in a reference scenario.\n\n## Glossary\n\n## Hot technologies\n\nAll  heat-producing  technologies,  such  as  combustion  processes. For  Air  Liquide,  hot  technologies  comprise  steam  reforming  of methane  to  produce  hydrogen  and  carbon  monoxide  and cogeneration units.\n\n## HyCO unit\n\nUnit  that  simultaneously  produces  hydrogen  (H2)  and  carbon monoxide (CO).\n\n## NACE\n\nThe Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community, or NACE, refers to the classification of economic activities in force in the European Union (EU).\n\n## On-site\n\nOn-site  installations  consist  of  gas  production  units  installed directly  on  Industrial  Merchant  or  Electronic  customer  premises, thanks to which truck deliveries can be avoided.\n\n## Orders in hand\n\nThey represent the contractual value of all Group and third-party engineering and construction contracts managed  by  the Engineering  &  Construction  entities,  excluding  projects  under warranty, from the signature date.\n\n## Orders intake\n\nThey represent the sum of all Group and third-party engineering contracts which entered into force during the period.\n\n## Renewable energy\n\nForms of energy whose production does not lead to a decline in resources  on  a  human  scale,  e.g.  solar,  wind,  geothermal  and hydroelectric energies.\n\n## Syngas\n\nSyngas, or synthesis gas, is a gas mixture consisting primarily of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and in some cases carbon dioxide.\n\n## Substrate\n\nMaterial on or in which components of a micro-electronic system or circuit are manufactured.\n\n## Take-or-Pay\n\nContracts  used  in  Large  Industries  integrating  fixed  minimum payments below minimum volume thresholds.\n\n## Traditional energy\n\nAs  opposed  to  renewable  energies,  energy  whose  production exhausts  resources  by  consuming  them  more  quickly  than  they are  created.  It  is  directly  produced  from  fossil  fuels:  coal,  oil, natural gas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",
