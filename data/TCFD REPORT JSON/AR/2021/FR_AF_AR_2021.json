        "page_content": "## MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\n2021 proved to be another challenging year for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and its airlines. Your Group demonstrated its resilience and solidity, and was able to maintain a steady course. Although the Covid-19 pandemic continued to seriously impact our activity, widescale vaccine roll-outs and the gradual reopening of borders in numerous countries saw customers gradually return to flying on board our aircraft. Our customers' appetite for travel remains a reality which confirms our strategic orientations and gives us confidence in the future. In the 2021 fourth quarter, for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group managed to post positive financial results, and even above those of the 2019 second quarter.\n\nBut the pandemic is not yet behind us and this progress remains fragile. All the more so as we finalize this Universal Registration Document with the tragedy of war in Ukraine unfolding at the gates of Europe. We don't yet know the outcome of this conflict but its consequences for populations are already devastating and, since the onset, all the Group's employees have been showing their solidarity with Ukraine through both individual and collective actions. This war is already having a dramatic e/ffect on the air transportation players. Coming after two unrelenting years of exceptional crisis, this is another severe test for our Group, requiring us to continue to adapt and pursue our transformation.\n\nIn the past two years, in all the Group's airlines, businesses and professions, we have deployed in-depth transformation plans, implemented the strictest control over our spending and launched numerous initiatives to optimize our revenues. I would like to pay tribute to the remarkable commitment of our 71,000/uni00A0people, without whom none of our achievements would have been possible.\n\n- ''  The transformations we are implementing will later enable us to better seize all opportunities to emerge from the crisis and regain our full financial, strategic and operational autonomy.''",

        "page_content": "In spring 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM successfully realized a first step in its recapitalization plan. We are now planning new equity-strengthening measures to continue this improvement in our financial situation, while remaining flexible on these future steps depending on market conditions.\n\nThe end of 2021 was marked by the Group's historic announcement of an order for a hundred aircraft in the Airbus A320neo family with purchase rights for sixty additional aircraft destined for the medium-haul fleets of KLM, Transavia France and Transavia Netherlands. This order demonstrates the Group's ability to generate synergies and leverage its purchasing power to accelerate our transformation by giving us new-generation aircraft which are quieter, more fuel-e/fficient and more respectful of the environment.\n\nIt is our responsibility to accelerate our environmental transition and be a leader in a more sustainable aviation industry. This is one of our strategic priorities. We owe this to all our people, our customers, our partners and our investors. The Group is committed to validating its/uni00A0CO2 emission reduction targets in line with the science-based framework and criteria set by the independent rating agency SBTi. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is one of the first European airline groups to choose to have its decarbonization trajectory verified by SBTi. This major new step in the Group's decarbonization strategy will support its goal of net zero/uni00A0CO2 emissions in 2050.\n\nThese transformations that we are putting in place will, in time, enable us to seize every opportunity as we emerge from crisis and, in future, regain full financial, strategic and operational autonomy.\n\nI would again like to thank our shareholders for their support, our customers and all our partners for their trust, and all our employees for their exceptional commitment during another particularly di/fficult year. Together and united, the teams of Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Transavia and all the Group's airlines are our greatest strength and, since the beginning of this crisis, have shown that Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has all the assets it needs to regain a leadership position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBenjamin Smith\n\nChief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM\n\n## AIR FRANCE-KLM IN 2021\n\n45\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1,053k TONS OF CARGO\n\n536\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n310 DESTINATIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n117 COUNTRIES SERVED\n\n3,000\n\n<!-- image -->",

All Air/uni00A0France and KLM contributions will be invested in the sourcing and consumption of SAF. This will support the creation of a sustainable aviation fuel industry that guarantees increasingly eco-responsible air transport.\n\nBy investing in this corporate programme, companies are taking concrete action to reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions and are contributing to the ecological transition of air transport by supporting innovative solutions.\n\nAt a time when awareness of climate issues is at the heart of the strategy of many companies, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Corporate SAF programme gives customers the opportunity to become players in the reduction of/uni00A0CO2 emissions in the context of their business trips.\n\n## Call for expressions of interest for hydrogen branch for airports\n\nOn February 11,/uni00A02021\n\nParis Region, Choose Paris Region, Groupe ADP, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Airbus are launching an unprecedented worldwide call for expressions of interest for the hydrogen branch in airports.\n\nParis region, Groupe ADP, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Airbus are launching a call for expressions of interest to explore the opportunities generated by hydrogen in Paris airports with the aim to decarbonize air transport activities. This worldwide call for expressions of interest complies with the French government's energy transition strategy and supported by the European Commission, which strives for zero-emission aircraft by 2035.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announces a plan of capital-strengthening measures with the objective of strengthening its balance sheet, preparing the recovery and repositioning the Group on a sustainable financial trajectory\n\nOn April 6,/uni00A02021\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM ('the Group') announces the following measures in relation to Air/uni00A0France, which have been approved by the European Commission in its decision to authorize a \u20ac4/uni00A0billion French State measures to recapitalise Air/uni00A0France and its Holding company:\n\n- -  a capital increase for an amount up to \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, with a priority subscription period for shareholders, subject to market conditions and the prior approval on the prospectus by the Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers (the 'AMF') and;\n- -  simultaneously, conversion of the \u20ac3/uni00A0billion French State direct loan drawn into perpetual hybrid bonds instrument.\n\nThe Dutch State is continuing discussions with the European Commission regarding potential capital-strengthening measures for KLM.\n\nAdditionally, the French State-backed loan (Pr\u00eat Garanti par l'\u00c9tat - 'PGE') of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion has been extended with a final maturity date in 2023.

China Eastern Airlines took an equity stake in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in 2017, shaping the ambition for a long-term strategic partnership.\n\nWith this expansion of the cooperation between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines, both airline groups clearly are clearly paving the way to create the most e/fficient and powerful Joint Venture between Europe and China.\n\n## Issue of deeply subordinated notes in three \u20ac1/uni00A0billion tranches, for a total of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion\n\nOn April/uni00A019, 2021\n\nWithin the framework of its recapitalization plan announced on April/uni00A012, 2021 and realized on April/uni00A019, 2021 in the amount of \u20ac1,036/uni00A0billion, on April/uni00A020, 2021 the Company issued a series of undated deeply subordinated notes (accounted for under IFRS equity in the Company's consolidated financial statements) for an amount of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion, fully subscribed by the French State by way of set-o/ff on claims it holds on the Company pursuant to the Shareholder Loan (the 'Shareholder Loan') granted in May/uni00A02020 and fully drawn for an amount of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion (the 'Deeply Subordinated Notes').\n\nThis issue is composed of three tranches with a perpetual maturity and a nominal amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion each, with respective redemption options (call) at 4, 5 and 6/uni00A0years, then repayable on every interest payment date, and bearing interest at an initial rate of 7.00%, 7.25% and 7.50% respectively until these dates.\n\nThese initial interest rates for each tranche will increase for each to 8.50%, 8.00% and 8.00%, respectively, on the first respective early redemption date and at the option of the Company, of the relevant tranche. These interest rates will then be revised every year from April/uni00A020, 2028, based on the 12-month Euribor rate plus a margin of 10.40%, it being specified that the applicable 12-month Euribor rate will not be less than -0.45%. The Company will have the option to defer the payment of interest at its discretion, in whole or in part. Deferred interest on the Deeply Subordinated Notes will be accrued and capitalized.\n\nThe payment of interest will nevertheless become compulsory in the event of, for example, the payment of a dividend or the redemption of equity securities, subject to certain customary exceptions.\n\nThese Deeply Subordinated Notes may be converted by way of set-o/ff in the context of future issues of quasi-equity securities or capital increases. In the event of: (i)/uni00A0a third party, acting alone or in concert, holding more than 30% of the share capital of the Company; (ii)/uni00A0non-approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of a project of issuance of shares or any other securities giving right to shares of the Company, submitted by the Board of Directors, and enabling the French State to convert in shares of the Company all or part of the Deeply Subordinated Notes held by the French State; or (iii)/uni00A0in the event of an implementation of a share capital increase or of an issuance of securities giving right to shares of the Company (with the exception of transactions carried out with preferential subscription rights or with a priority subscription period and which may be subscribed by way of o/ff-set, transactions reserved for the French State or transactions with cancellation of preferential subscription rights by 'private placement' authorized in advance by the French State) without the agreement of the French State, the Company may redeem (a) in the cases referred to in (i)/uni00A0and (ii)/uni00A0above, in full, and (b) in the case referred to in (iii)/uni00A0above, in full or in part, the Deeply Subordinated Notes remaining outstanding. Otherwise, the applicable interest rate will be increased by an additional margin of 5.50% per annum from the date of occurrence of any of the events referred to in (i), (ii)/uni00A0or (iii). Such interest rate adjustments shall be cumulative provided, however, that the cumulative adjustments shall not exceed 11.00% per annum.\n\nThis transaction reinforces the Group's equity by \u20ac3/uni00A0billion under IFRS accounting standards, without impacting cash-flow, while increasing the Group's flexibility in its mandatory debt repayment profile.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announces that Group CFO Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gagey will be succeeded by Steven Zaat, current Air/uni00A0France Chief Financial O/fficer, on July 1, 2021.\n\nOn May 6,/uni00A02021\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM today announced that Group CFO Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gagey (64) will retire and leave his current position as of July/uni00A01, 2021.",

At 3:40/uni00A0p.m./uni00A0today, Air/uni00A0France Flight 342/uni00A0took o/ff from Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport's Terminal 2E/uni00A0for Montreal with its tanks filled for the first time with sustainable aviation fuel produced in Total's French plants.\n\nThis flight is a tangible result of the four groups' shared ambition to decarbonize air transportation and to develop a SAF supply chain in France, prerequisite to the generalization of their use in French airports.\n\nNo modifications to storage and distribution infrastructure, aircraft or engines are required to incorporate biofuels. Their gradual introduction worldwide should significantly reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions from air transportation, in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe biofuel used for this flight was made from waste and residue sourced from the circular economy. Total produced the SAF from used cooking oil at its La M\u00e8de biorefinery in southern France and at its Oudalle factory near Le Havre, without using any virgin plant-based oil.\n\nThis first 100% French SAF received ISCC-EU certification from the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification System, an independent organization that guarantees sustainability. The 16% blend on this flight avoided the emission of 20/uni00A0tons of/uni00A0CO2.\n\nBy developing and supporting France's first industrial SAF production, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Total, ADP Group and Airbus are paving the way for France to drive innovation in the energy and environmental transition. French legislation calls for aircraft to use at least 1% SAF by 2022 for all flights originating in France, ahead of the European ambition scheduled to gradually ramp up to 2% by 2025 and 5% by 2030, as part of the European Green Deal.\n\nToday's flight also illustrates the synergy of the di/fferent drivers for reducing aviation's environmental footprint, i.e., sustainable aviation fuel, latest-generation aircraft and electrification of ground operations. The A350 used for the flight consumes 25% less fuel than its predecessor. What's more, the aircraft was serviced by the first 100% all-electric refueling truck, developed in France with Total expertise, and all of the ground support equipment used by Air/uni00A0France was fully electric powered.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is a pioneer in testing sustainable aviation fuels. KLM made its first SAF-powered flight in 2009. Since then, the Group has multiplied the number of innovative programs. Between 2014 and 2016, for example, it carried out 78/uni00A0Air/uni00A0France flights powered by a 10% SAF blend in collaboration with a Total a/ffiliate. These tests showed that the use of SAF had no impact on the reliability of airline operations. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM intends to strengthen its leadership in SAF in the years ahead, while contributing to research on future generations of aircraft.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM: Key decisions approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021\n\nOn May 27,/uni00A02021\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Annual General Shareholders' Meeting was held behind closed doors on Tuesday May/uni00A026/uni00A0at 45/uni00A0rue de Paris, 95747/uni00A0Roissy CDG, Cedex, under Anne-Marie Couderc's chairmanship.\n\n7,533/uni00A0shareholders voted remotely or by granting a proxy to the Chair of the Meeting or a third party, representing 396,102,573/uni00A0shares and 560,871,635/uni00A0voting rights, representing a quorum of 61.753%.

The Works Council of KLM has been asked for its advice on the above proposal.\n\nMarjan Rintel is currently CEO of NS, the leading passenger railway operator in the Netherlands. Before joining NS in 2014, she held various managerial, operational and commercial positions at KLM and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, such as hub Operations at KLM and Senior Vice-President Strategic Marketing at Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. Her extensive experience in the airline industry, her intimate knowledge of the Group, and her leadership qualities, convinced the Board that she is the right person to continue the work started by Pieter Elbers to transform KLM into one of the European's leading airlines and a powerhouse for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group as a whole.\n\nMarjan Rintel will take o/ffice on July/uni00A01 st /uni00A02022.\n\nIn December/uni00A02021, following early signs of a recovery in worldwide air tra/ffic, and improved access to capital markets, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM agreed with the syndicate of the nine banks of the \u20ac4/uni00A0billion bank loan guaranteed by the French State (the ' PGE ') and the French State to redeem \u20ac500/uni00A0million of the outstanding bank loan notional, bringing it down to \u20ac3.5/uni00A0billion and, concomitantly, to amend its redemption profile by substituting the single repayment initially due on May/uni00A06, 2023 with a new maturity on May/uni00A06, 2025, at the latest, at Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's discretion.\n\nThis partial redemption combined with the now-amortized redemption profile of the PGE constituted a new milestone on the restructuring path of the debt profile and of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's balance sheet, following the above-mentioned transactions.\n\nIn parallel, with regard to KLM, in addition to the measures taken in 2020 (a revolving credit facility of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion guaranteed by the Dutch State of which \u20ac665/uni00A0million drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020 but with no additional drawdown in 2021 and a direct loan of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion of which \u20ac277/uni00A0million drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020 but with no additional drawdown in 2021), KLM continues to examine potential measures to further strengthen its capital and the discussions with its shareholders, including the Dutch State, on these measures.\n\nAdditional measures to further strengthen the Group's capital are currently under consideration.",

This was partially offset by stronger prospects for some commodity-exporting emerging markets and developing economies, the main drivers being vaccine access and early policy support. The rapid spread of the Delta variant in 2021 and the threat of new variants have increased uncertainty about how quickly the pandemic can be overcome. This has required more di/fficult policy choices, confronting multidimensional challenges with limited action: employment growth, rising inflation, food insecurity and climate change.\n\nIn the Eurozone, after a strong rebound in 2021 with GDP growth of 5% (vs -6% in 2020) as lockdowns were gradually lifted, economic activity is projected to expand, supported by strong consumption as households reduce their savings rate and increased investment owing to national and European recovery plans.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the economy is recovering with GDP growth of 6.8% in 2021, the latter now expected to reach pre-crisis levels at the beginning of 2022. Consumption is the main growth driver as increased border costs following the exit from the EU Single Market are weighing on imports and exports.\n\nChinese economic growth is expected to reach 8% this year as the economy rebounds, driven by strong exports on the back of the re-opening of overseas economies and robust investment, which had stalled in the second half of 2021. Consumption growth is stable, but adverse confidence e/ffects coupled with inadequate social protection are still acting as a dampener. Strict measures remain in place to control the spread of the virus and sporadic outbreaks are being suppressed by strict, localized lockdowns, mass testing and mass isolation measures.",

However, with the rapid spread of new virus variants that are more contagious and more di/fficult to trace, and the disruption of supply chains due to restrictions, zero-tolerance policies are increasingly being questioned; border controls are unlikely to be an e/ffective way to remain Covid-free in the long run.\n\nVaccine access remains the principal driver of fault lines in the global recovery, reinforced by the resurgence of the pandemic. Many advanced economies saw remarkable progress on vaccination in 2021 while most emerging markets and developing economies have had much slower rollouts, hampered by a lack of supply and export restrictions.\n\n## Oil price\n\n| Brent  (US$/bbl)             |   2020 Q1 |   2020 Q2 |   2020 Q3 |   2020 Q4 |   2021 Q1 |   2021 Q2 |   2021 Q3 |   2021 Q4 |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Average price for the period |     50.91 |     33.59 |      43.3 |     45.23 |     61.25 |     69.17 |     73.17 |     80.98 |\n\nSource (1)\n\nFollowing several months of oil production cuts in 2020 and as demand picked up, especially in emerging markets, OPEC+ agreed to gradually restart increasing production in 2021.

        "page_content": "## 1.1.2/emspace The industry context and competition\n\n## Worldwide capacity\n\nWorldwide industry capacity stood at around 46%/thinspace (1) in H1 2021 (versus its 2019 level) before improving throughout/uni00A0H2 2021 to reach 68% in December, 62% on average for/uni00A0H2 2021 and 54% for FY 2021. Amongst the largest domestic markets, US domestic capacity picked up and, from February to June/uni00A02021, improved from 62% to 87%, maintaining the average of 93% for the/uni00A0H2 2021. In H1 2021, domestic Chinese capacity comfortably surpassed its 2019 level with 112% (2) on average before being disrupted by the Delta variant outbreak which resulted in new restrictions being imposed as of late summer 2021, causing some reversal in capacity in August/uni00A02021 (~88%) and the stagnation of capacity at around 104% throughout/uni00A0H2 2021.\n\nThe recovery in medium-haul capacity for the European airlines is lagging that of the US and Chinese carriers, as the latter benefit from large domestic markets. The intra-European market has been negatively impacted by States imposing travel restrictions, even on entries from fellow-EU or Schengen States. Intra-European capacity su/ffered from uncoordinated restrictions throughout H1 2021, maintaining an average of 34%, but started to pick up from June/uni00A02021 onwards, reaching 83% by the end of the year (averaging 76% for/uni00A0H2 2021 and 56% FY 2021).\n\nIn terms of international capacity, the largest pick-up in 2021 was seen for the US, starting from 37% in H1 2021 and reaching 65% by the end of 2021 (with 54% in/uni00A0H2 2021 and 45% in FY 2021). Chinese international capacity, on the other hand, saw the lowest fluctuation throughout the year with a slight decrease, starting from 8% in January/uni00A02021 and ending with 6% in December/uni00A02021 (with 6% on average in FY 2021). European international capacity saw a significant improvement between the H1 2021 and/uni00A0H2/uni00A02021, with 29% and 48% respectively, ending the year at 61% in December/uni00A02021 and 38% in FY 2021.\n\n## Sanitary restrictions, variants and vaccination\n\n2021 was marked by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, first detected in India in late 2020 before spreading throughout the world and becoming the dominant strain globally in June/uni00A02021 according to The World Health Organization (WHO). After the rise in cases from the second wave, at least 20/uni00A0countries imposed travel bans and restrictions on passengers from India in April and May. By late July, Delta had driven an increase in daily infections in parts of Asia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. This led many Asian countries like Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam to re-enter national or regional lockdowns, as in 2020. Others ramped up\n\n(1)\n\nrestrictions urging populations to wear masks outdoors and limiting the size of gatherings. Tokyo again entered a state of emergency and announced that most spectators would be barred from attending the Olympics.\n\nThe Delta variant also prompted new travel restrictions across Europe from the beginning of the summer. Portugal became the first European Union country to announce that the Delta variant was dominant on its territory, requiring anyone travelling to mainland Portugal by air, land or sea to prove they had been fully vaccinated or to enter a period of mandatory quarantine. Germany implemented restrictions on people entering the country from Portugal and Russia (adding them to a list of 13 other states, including the UK), involving a two-week quarantine. Only German citizens and residents were allowed to re-enter the country provided they underwent a mandatory 14-day quarantine, irrespective of whether they had been vaccinated. The Balearic Islands also imposed new restrictions on UK travellers who needed to present a sanitary pass showing they had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 or a negative PCR test. France also added Russia to its 'red list' of 21/uni00A0countries subject to severe travel restrictions.\n\nIn November, after 20/uni00A0months of closed borders, the US finally opened to vaccinated international travellers only to see Europe face a new wave of Covid. The appearance of the Omicron variant, considered to be highly infectious, led many countries to re-introduce travel restrictions in order to limit entry from the southern African countries. Unlike during the first months of the coronavirus pandemic, health experts and government leaders did not rush to close their international borders completely for non-essential travel although several European nations imposed temporary nationwide lockdowns limiting tourism. More countries are now also adopting the 3G rules (vaccinated, recovered and tested) for entry: travelers must either be vaccinated or have recently recovered and have a negative pre-arrival test. At the end of 2021, while borders did not close, entry requirements, including vaccination and test periods, were stricter for many destinations than they had been earlier in the same year.\n\nIn 2021, progress on vaccine roll-outs varied widely by country, as did governmental policies on testing regimes, which have dictated the travel rules and paced the demand recovery on both a regional and global basis. Countries that have been quick to vaccinate their populations against Covid-19 and are managing to control infections through e/ffective public health strategies are seeing their economies recover more quickly. However, while vaccination rates are progressing well in many advanced economies, emerging-market countries are being left behind.",

        "page_content": "By early December/uni00A02021, more than 4.37/uni00A0billion people/thinspace (1) worldwide had received a dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, equal to about 57% of the world's population. About 73% of shots have been administered in high and upper-middle-income countries. Only 0.8% of doses have been administered in low-income countries which continue to lag in vaccine doses despite coordination e/fforts, such as through the COVAX program, a vaccine-sharing arrangement. In its latest projection, the program had expected to have a total of 1.4/uni00A0billion doses available by the end of 2021. Most countries are assumed to acquire broad access by the end of 2022 and some only in 2023. However, pressure for booster shots in countries with already-high rates of vaccination could further delay access in others which are still at the early stages of getting first jabs into arms. The continuing wide circulation of the virus, particularly within countries and populations where vaccination rates are low, poses a threat to health and economic recoveries everywhere. The World Health Organization is warning that more transmissible and deadly variants, which could escape protection from existing vaccines, are likely to evolve as long as a substantial proportion of the world's population remains unprotected.\n\n## Governmental actions and support, financial aid and regulations\n\nGovernment aid : Governments worldwide have kept airlines on life support with US$243/uni00A0billion/thinspace (2) of financial aid (relief measures up to September/uni00A02021), of which US$130/uni00A0billion non-reimbursable. After the crisis, the airline industry will be penalized by significant leverage, having taken on at least US$150/uni00A0billion of additional debt between late 2019 and September/uni00A02021, reaching a record figure of US$340/uni00A0billion/thinspace (3) .\n\nAir navigation and airports : Air transport infrastructures have seen a revenue shortfall during the Covid-19 crisis and some infrastructure operators are looking to recoup lost revenues by overcharging for their services. For example, the Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) in 29/uni00A0Eurocontrol countries are negotiating to recoup \u20ac8 billion. Some airports too are requiring significant charge increases during the current negotiations. For example, Heathrow Airport has asked for a 90% charge increase in 2022. The Covid-19 crisis has also impacted infrastructure projects/thinspace (4) . For example, the French Transportation Ministry cancelled plans for an additional large terminal in CDG (T4) and has asked stakeholders to come back with a less ambitious project.\n\nSlot usage : During the crisis, in addition to financial support, government assistance was also extended to slot regulation with a waiver of the '80-20/uni00A0use-it-or-lose-it' rule. This waiver, initially granted for the Summer 2020 season, was subsequently prolonged until the Winter 2021 season but with stricter conditions, enabling airlines under Covid stress to be agile to adapt to the vagaries of the pandemic and to let new competition flourish.\n\nSlot remedies : European-based companies were subject to supplementary constraints in return for the obtention of European Commission approval of state loans or equity, like giving up some slots at sought-after airports to competitors or a ban on the acquisition of competitors. For example, Lufthansa was required to give up 24/uni00A0daily slots at Frankfurt (April/uni00A020) and Munich Airports while Air/uni00A0France had to return 18/uni00A0slots at Orly (April/uni00A021)/thinspace (5) .\n\nEU tra/ffic rights : In October/uni00A021, the EU signed a Comprehensive Air Transport Agreement (CATA), with Qatar which goes far beyond the negotiation of tra/ffic rights, encompassing fair competition, financial transparency, the environment and social issues. It includes a forum to address all issues (joint committee meeting) and mechanisms to swiftly resolve any disputes not resolved by the joint committee. This agreement should serve as the basis of future negotiations with all countries looking for additional EU tra/ffic rights. Limitations on the number of flights between the EU and Qatar will progressively disappear over a three-year period and operators have been granted additional 5 th /uni00A0 freedom tra/ffic rights for all-cargo services: to the United States for Qatar, to the Far East for the European carriers. A few weeks later, the EU was to sign a fairly similar CATA, excepting the cargo part, with Oman.\n\n## Sustainable development\n\nIATA has pledged to be net carbon neutral by 2050, in line with the Paris agreement target to limit global warming to 1.5/uni00A0degrees. By 2050, with an expectation of 10/uni00A0billion passengers per year, IATA forecasts show an annual 1.8/uni00A0gigatons of carbon to abate/thinspace (6) : the major part (65%) should be abated by Sustainable Aviation Fuel, 19% should be covered either by Carbon Capture and Storage or o/ffsets, and a further 13% by new energy sources (batteries/hydrogen).\n\nSustainable aviation fuels (SAF) will be the main driver in airline e/fforts to reduce emissions at source. By 2025, it is estimated that there will be 11 technical pathways to producing SAF, with the largest acceleration expected in the 2030s as policy support becomes global, SAF becomes competitive with fossil kerosene and credible o/ffsets become scarcer.",

        "page_content": "Market and environment\n\nAlthough the industry plan for net-zero carbon emissions foresees a rapid decline in the use of o/ffsets as in-sector solutions take over, o/ffsetting mechanisms, including carbon capture technologies, will have an important role in the next decade. The Carbon O/ffsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which is the main pillar, aims to stabilize aviation's net/uni00A0CO2 emissions at 2019 levels from 2021 onwards and will be implemented in phases, starting with volunteer states, representing 77% of all international aviation activity in 2022, and applying to all international flights in 2027. The exceptions include some developing countries and small island states.\n\nIn addition, the 'Fit for 55' European Commission draft package includes mandatory SAF blending, stricter ETS rules (fewer allowances and the end of free allocations) and the introduction of a possible fuel tax on intra-EEA flights. European airlines share the EU vision to be net zero carbon by 2050, but are refusing to pay the carbon price twice, to carry the burden on their own and to be exposed to huge discrepancies in the 'common competitive playground' versus the non-EU airlines.\n\nIn the USA, rather than quotas, a credit tax will be used to subsidize SAF cost overruns aimed at covering 100% of the needs in 2050. $4.3 billion of subsidies will fund opportunities to support SAF projects.\n\n## Trend in European competitive market conditions\n\n## Main airline liquidations in 2021\n\nA number of airlines, which had already been weak prior to the Covid-19 crisis, were liquidated in 2021:\n\n- -  Alitalia disappeared in October/uni00A02021 although a smaller airline ITA emerged, operating around half the former Alitalia fleet. Its task will not be easy with a launch in a weak season as the pandemic raged and with increasing pressure from pan-European LCCs like Ryanair and WizzAir.\n- -  Stobart Air, a regional airline used for the Aer Lingus Regional network lost the Aer Lingus competitive tender for 2023-28. In June/uni00A02021, it ceased all its (wet-leased) flights operated on behalf of Aer Lingus.\n- -  Italian carrier Blue Panorama ceased flight operations in October. It had been restructured in 2017 after a first bankruptcy.\n\n## Despite the dreadful timing for airline launches or re-launches, some projects came to fruition in 2021 or have been announced for 2022:\n\n- -  Another Norwegian short-haul carrier, Flyr, started operations from June/uni00A02021/uni00A0to link Norway with Europe with four aircraft in service and six on order.\n- -  ITA, which began with 52/uni00A0aircraft from the former Alitalia, has ambitions to double its size to 105/uni00A0aircraft by 2025, including 81/uni00A0new generation aircraft.\n- -  Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, a joint-venture between state-owned HDQ (51%) and Wizz Air (49%) operated its first flight in January/uni00A02021 and currently has 4 aircraft. It shares a huge order portfolio of 334/uni00A0A320/A321s with Wizz Air.\n- -  Norse Atlantic Airways, created in February/uni00A02021 following the disappearance of Norwegian Long Haul, has secured leasing rights for 15/uni00A0B787s in 2022 and will o/ffer low-cost NATL flights on departure from London, Paris and Oslo.\n\n## The airlines implement measures to contend with the Covid-19 crisis\n\nLufthansa : In December/uni00A02020, Lufthansa completed the sale of its European catering operations to Gate group (decided in pre-Covid 2019). It simplified its long-haul fleet, with the phase-out of the A380 and A340-600 (subject to delayed Boeing 777 deliveries) and regrouped its leisure operations at the German hubs of Frankfurt and Munich in a new leisure airline called Eurowings Discover, which operated its inaugural flight in July/uni00A02021. This airline reports to Lufthansa German Airlines and not to Eurowings, and has both short-haul (10/uni00A0A320 family aircraft by mid-2022) and long-haul (11/uni00A0A330s by mid-2022) segments. In early November, Deutsche Lufthansa AG repaid or cancelled all remaining government funds from the German government.\n\nIAG : In 2020, IAG phased-out its B747-400s and A340-600s. British Airways terminated all its short-haul flights out of London Gatwick ahead of the launch of BA Euroflyer from March/uni00A02022/uni00A0from Gatwick, with up to 17/uni00A0aircraft and a new CLA (collective labor agreement). Aer Lingus transferred some of its long-haul aircraft (A321, LR/A330) to a new UK subsidiary to open a new long-haul base in Manchester. The first flight was operated in October/uni00A02020 and four aircraft are foreseen for Summer 2022.\n\nIn 2019, IAG had reached agreement with Globalia, the owner of Air Europa to acquire the latter based in Madrid. The acquisition prompted strong objections from the competition authorities owing to the overlapping of the Iberia and Air Europa networks, and the value of Air Europa had witnessed a very substantial decline since 2019. At the end of 2021, IAG finally negotiated with Globalia a payment of \u20ac75/uni00A0million to break this agreement.",

        "page_content": "Vueling was selected by the EU Commission as the winner of the contest to operate the former Air/uni00A0France slots at Orly relinquished as remedies in return for State support. The airline announced a major Orly expansion from Winter 2021 with 28/uni00A0new routes and the most significant expansion towards the British Isles. Competition from Paris between Transavia, easyJet and Vueling is expected to intensify.\n\n## Cargo\n\nIn 2020, the air cargo industry generated $128/uni00A0billion, which represented approximately a third of overall airline revenues, an increase of 10%-15% compared to 2019 pre-crisis levels. In 2021, cargo demand is expected to have exceeded its 2019 level by 8% and revenues to have risen to a record $175/uni00A0billion (+36% versus 2019), with a 15% rise in yields/thinspace (1) . For 2022, according to IATA forecasts, demand is expected to exceed pre-crisis levels by 13% while revenues should rise to $169/uni00A0billion (+31% versus 2019) although yields will decline by 8%.\n\nThe strong upward trend in air cargo tra/ffic observed in the second half of 2020 continued into 2021, with Cargo ton kilometers (CTKs) from January to July/uni00A02021 some 8% higher than the same period in 2019. In the three months to October/uni00A02021, industry-wide CTKs rose by 9% versus the same period in 2019. However, although cargo tra/ffic remains far above its pre-crisis level, it appears to have stopped trending upwards recently/thinspace (2) . The global outperformance of air cargo in 2021 showed a pattern usually seen at the beginning of economic upturns, when businesses call on air freight to rapidly restock inventories to meet rising demand. Moreover, exceptionally long supplier delivery times and expensive fares for other transport modes are driving air cargo demand higher.\n\nAir cargo tra/ffic has been rising in the major trade lanes but there have been di/fferences in the pace of recovery. The e/ffect of the grounding of passenger aircraft and travel restrictions in the North Pacific was barely negative as the large freighter fleets of the North American carriers have been unable to meet demand. On many other routes, such as the Middle EastAsia, high cargo yields and profits have forced airlines to use passenger aircraft carrying few or no passengers. However, on routes that are highly dependent on belly capacity, such as Asia and Europe-Asia, the absence of international passenger travel has weakened upward trends in air cargo tra/ffic.\n\nAir cargo capacity has seen a slow but consistent pick up, with significant progress in 2021 compared with 2020, particularly\n\nas from the summer. Belly capacity, which represented around 60% of international air cargo capacity prior to the pandemic, is limited by the lack of international travel, particularly for long-haul trips using widebody aircraft. Airlines are however using passenger aircraft to transport cargo and have increased their dedicated freighter capacity significantly, the size of the global freighter fleet rising by 12% from January to July/uni00A02021 compared with the pre-crisis, January-July/uni00A02019 period.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThe aeronautics maintenance or MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operations) market is mostly driven by the age, cycles and flight hours of the worldwide fleet. According to estimates, the global MRO market, which comprises the maintenance and modification spending by aircraft operators either directly or through sub-contractors, collapsed to US$68/uni00A0billion in 2021 versus US$83/uni00A0billion in 2019/thinspace (3) .\n\nThe trends in this business closely follow those of the commercial airline fleets globally and their utilization. The Covid-19 crisis and CSR priorities have accelerated fleet adjustment decisions, to gain e/fficiency and reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions. Airlines are tending to defer maintenance and are focusing on phasing out older-generation aircraft and increasing the proportion of next-generation aircraft. The MRO operators are su/ffering from weaker and more volatile demand on older and current-generation aircraft.\n\nChanges to fleet plans and strategies have surged to the top of the list of future disruptors, outpacing even concerns about the supply/demand impacts of Covid-19. The impact of early retirements, a prolonged downturn for international/widebody flight operations and strategic shifts in business models (such as from full service to lower cost) are clearly top of mind for the industry.\n\nThe market is also characterized by increased pricing pressure resulting from fiercer competition between maintenance operators (MROs) and more exacting requirements on the part of customer airlines in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis. Furthermore, a growing number of airlines are looking to transfer the financing of spare parts to maintenance service providers within the framework of increasingly-large-scale contracts (in terms of revenue, duration, complexity,/uni00A0etc.). The competition from Original Equipment and Engine Manufacturers (OEMs) and Original Aircraft Manufacturers (OAMs) will remain strong in the coming years. Lastly, the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis on airline bankruptcies will also have residual e/ffect on the MRO market.",

Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM sees this as an opportunity to continue strengthening its sustainable and local footprint, creating the basis for trust and long-term acceptance, and developing its activities.\n\n## An extensive network operated with an optimized fleet\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group currently operates one of the largest networks between Europe and the rest of the world, organized around the dual intercontinental hubs of Paris-CDG and Amsterdam-Schiphol, which are two of the four largest connecting platforms in Europe (the other two are: London Heathrow and Frankfurt am Main airports). In 2021, it served 310/uni00A0destinations in 117/uni00A0countries, without counting the repatriation flights within the exceptional context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Group diversifies its portfolios by being present in all the large markets. Moreover, the Group has a natural risk hedge in that no one market represents more than a third of network revenues.\n\nIn 2021, despite a very substantial impact on market capacity due to the health situation and restrictions, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM confirmed its commitment and ambition of keeping a leading position in terms of tra/ffic and capacity with over 45/uni00A0million passengers carried between Europe and the rest of the world, and on intra-European routes on departure from the Group's natural markets.\n\n## Finance: a stable shareholding structure with the French and Dutch States, Delta Air Lines and China Eastern\n\nFinancial capital not only ensures Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's financial sustainability but also its ability to accelerate its transformation while enabling value creation with all other forms of capital.

Sanitary measures encompassing quarantine, social distancing and border closures have led to the worst economic crisis since the Second World War for the aviation industry.\n\nThese travel bans and lockdowns in every continent have had dramatic e/ffects on air travel demand as well as on the airlines' business operations. At the beginning of the pandemic, in 2020, Air/uni00A0France and KLM operated under 10% of their regular scheduled capacity while Transavia and Hop! were forced to ground all flights. By the end of 2020, with additional worldwide governmental restrictions in response to a second wave of the pandemic, the Group was operating under 40% of its capacity.\n\nall touchpoints, and on products, services and health safety. The Group is targeting a leading Net Promoter Score by improving the customer experience through personalized and digitalized o/ffers and best-in-class operational performance. Thanks to the professionalism of the Group's frontline sta/ff, the quality of its products and services, and an improved operational performance, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia maintain a daily focus on customers.\n\nBeyond the satisfaction of our customers on the quality of the service Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM airlines promise to them, the financial impact of customer satisfaction is huge: it is a key driver of Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM market share gains and revenue growth, increasing customer loyalty and propelling customer growth.\n\n## Planet and society: be a pioneer in sustainable aviation\n\nThrough the initiatives of its airlines, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is committed to leading the way in terms of sustainable aviation at both flight and ground operations level. The Group aims to continue its e/fforts to reduce its environmental footprint by improving its operations and processes, partnering and innovating in the supply chain and mobilizing our sta/ff and the industry.\n\nThroughout 2021, new variants and the ensuing pandemic waves forced governments to apply further travel restrictions despite the wider use of sanitary passes, leading the Group to operate 46% of its capacity in Q1 (versus the 2019 level) increasing to 74% in Q4 (versus the 2019 level). With an annual average of 59% capacity, compared to the 2019 level, the Group operated 46% of capacity in H1 and 71% in/uni00A0H2 (versus the same period in 2019), ending the year at 77% in December compared to 2019. In 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's immediate response to the crisis was centered around two key principles: safety and social responsibility. Capacity was reduced in line with the drop in demand and travel bans while cooperating with the French and Dutch States. The safety of employees and customers was ensured through immediate actions:",

Since the beginning of the outbreak, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has repatriated more than 500,000/uni00A0European citizens from across the world with the exceptional engagement of the employees, responding to the needs and requirements of the French and Dutch nations.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group also deployed cargo capacity to respond to the increasing demand for essential medical supplies. Cargo flights were essential elements in the fight against Covid-19.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has also taken decisive financial actions over the last few months, which have resulted in immediate cash savings:\n\n- -  downwards revision of the Capex investment plan;\n- -  cut in operating costs;\n- -  labor cost reductions thanks to the partial activity in France (activit\u00e9 partielle) and the Dutch government employment support program (NOW);\n- -  halt of all non-safety and non-operational critical projects;\n- -  significant reduction in all consultants and external sta/ff;\n- -  further labor cost reductions through Voluntary Departure Plans.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's ability to rapidly adapt to this major crisis and to support governments and fellow citizens shows how capable and agile the Group has been in engaging and mobilizing when necessary.\n\nSince the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, Air/uni00A0France has assisted its customers by enabling them to easily verify the health documents required by the authorities of their destination country with real time online updates. During Summer 21, the airline went one step further with the introduction of the 'Ready to Fly' process, o/ffering customers the certainty of knowing that they have all the health documents required for their trip prior to arrival at the airport.\n\nIn May/uni00A02021, Air/uni00A0France was recognized for its efforts on implementing the strictest health and safety measures through the APEX (Airline Passenger Experience Association) Health Safety Diamond Award, the highest distinction in its category. Later in the year Skytrax recognized the airline's commitment\n\nto health security by awarding Air/uni00A0France the Covid Airline Excellence Award. This is the third time that the airline has received a distinction from Skytrax for all the measures implemented since the beginning of the Covid crisis, with first four and then five stars (the maximum rating) obtained in the Skytrax Covid Safety Rating for its Air/uni00A0France Protect program. In November/uni00A02021, KLM received the 2022 APEX World Class Award, as best airline for passengers along with six other airlines (Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines, Emirates, Saudia, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines). This award represents exceptional recognition of achievements in areas such as safety well-being and sustainability, which are now important elements in the overall customer experience, as well as high standards set for service, comfort, catering and performance.\n\nTransavia has also won awards for the quality of its customer service, its welcome on board and the booking experience:\n\n- -  The 2019 Skyscanner 'Traveler Trust' award;\n- -  The Qualiweb 'Best online customer relationship 2021';\n- -  Elected Customer Service of the Year 2022 in the collective passenger transport category;\n- -  The Capital Label 'Best Brands 2022' on which it has stood out since 2017.\n\n## Transformation\n\nIn the post-Covid-19 world, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group needs to balance its medium-term focus on managing liquidity risk and optimizing capex with the long-term focus on achieving increased competitiveness and its sustainability targets. The Group plans to do this through the five key levers of organization, productivity, network, fleet and cost management.\n\n## Organization\n\nIt is crucial for the Group and its airlines to restructure their organizations to adapt to the new reality of reduced capacity and a prolonged period of uncertainty. The airlines of the Group will accelerate their ongoing transformation plans and re-adjust the size of their organization to match these new activity levels. Air/uni00A0France's restructuring plan calls for a reduction of 6,560/uni00A0FTEs by the end of 2022. The many natural departures expected over the period (more than 3,500) represent more than half of this job reduction thanks to a favorable age pyramid. For HOP! the resizing of the activity and the restructuring of the company, linked in particular to the simplification of the fleet, will lead to a reduction of 1,020/uni00A0jobs over the next three years out of a current workforce of 2,420.",

        "page_content": "Besides the resizing of their respective organizations, both Air/uni00A0France and KLM will focus on further reducing labor costs. Since March/uni00A02020, the sta/ff in France have been on 'partial activity' and a variable remuneration system for pilots and flight attendants (otherwise known as the minimum monthly guarantee or MMG), reflecting lower levels of flight activity. In both France and the Netherlands, a percentage of employee wages is paid via the unique furlough schemes o/ffered by the respective governments as part of their Covid-19 support measures.\n\nIn France, Air/uni00A0France is prioritizing mobility options and voluntary departure programs in order to avoid involuntary layo/ffs, while also utilizing notably the Rupture Convention Collective (RCC) to permit voluntary departures beyond those that would normally be entitled under French labor laws. In the first half of 2021, Air/uni00A0France and some of its a/ffiliates finalized agreements with the representative trade unions allowing the use of the Long-Term Partial Activity ('APLD') scheme for a maximum of 24/uni00A0months. By December/uni00A02021, the target of the Voluntary Departure Plan in Air/uni00A0France had been reached. In addition, the implementation of partial activity (without compensation for lost wages) and the application of the variable remuneration system for pilots (MGA) have made it possible to reduce the wage bill. Air/uni00A0France has also announced a policy of salary moderation through the suspension of negotiations on the profit-sharing scheme for the years 2020/2021/2022 and the freezing of general and individual increases (excluding promotion and seniority).\n\nIn the Netherlands, KLM's restructuring plan submitted to the Dutch Ministry of Finance contains a significant reduction of FTEs compared to pre-Covid-2019. Substantively, the plan includes elements such as the reassessment of strategy, cost-cutting initiatives and financial considerations including reduced employment conditions.\n\nThe basic principle of the restructuring plan is that KLM's existing business model is still valid, but far-reaching, structural initiatives are required to ensure KLM's future success. Owing to the e/ffects of the current pandemic, KLM is preparing itself for an extended period during which fewer flights will be operated. The organization will become smaller, as well as more cost-e/fficient and sustainable.\n\nAs KLM plays an important economic and societal role in the Netherlands, the government has o/ffered the airline a loan package, to which it has attached certain conditions. One condition is that KLM sta/ff should contribute to KLM's restructuring by accepting reduced employment conditions, amounting to income-dependent graduated cutbacks of up to 20%. These reduced conditions will apply for the term of the loan.\n\n## Increase productivity\n\nBoth the numerous agreements signed with Air/uni00A0France sta/ff over the course of last year, and a dedicated focus on network optimization and improvement of aircraft utilization, are helping to reduce costs and increase productivity. For instance, an agreement reached with the SNPL (Syndicat National des Pilotes de Ligne) and approved by an overwhelming majority, allows for the restructuring of the French domestic network, including transferring some domestic operations to the lower-cost Transavia platform.\n\n## Fleet\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's future competitive position, the focus on sustainability and capex investments are largely linked to decisions made with regards to the network and fleet.\n\nThe principles of the Group's fleet strategy remain as follows:\n\n- -  exit aircraft as planned in order to avoid Capex due to life extension;\n- -  optimize our current fleet;\n- -  introduce committed new aircraft, in line with our existing fleet plan.\n\nFor many years, Air/uni00A0France has been committed to reducing its environmental footprint by implementing concrete actions - weight reduction on board, reducing and recycling waste, promoting eco-piloting, reducing the noise footprint, reducing and o/ffsetting/uni00A0CO2 emissions and eliminating single-use plastic items. The renewal of the fleet by environmentally-friendly latest-generation aircraft is a powerful way to reduce the airline's environmental footprint and achieve its sustainable development objectives.\n\nOn September/uni00A027, 2019, Air/uni00A0France took delivery of its first Airbus A350 which marks a new phase in Air/uni00A0France's fleet modernization strategy. By 2026, the company will welcome a total of 38/uni00A0Airbus A350-900s into its fleet, thus having more than 40% of the wide body fleet made up of new-generation aircraft. This aircraft consumes 25% less fuel, thanks to the incorporation of lighter materials, and its noise footprint is reduced by 40%. At the end of 2021, Air/uni00A0France had received 13/uni00A0A350s.\n\nOn September/uni00A029, 2021, Air/uni00A0France took delivery of its first Airbus A220-300. The company is continuing its fleet renewal thanks to its firm order for 60/uni00A0A220-300s, plus an additional mix of 30/uni00A0options and 30/uni00A0purchase rights. They will gradually replace the company's A318s and A319s as well as several A320s by 2025. The Airbus A220-300/uni00A0is a new-generation aircraft, which generates 20% less/uni00A0CO2 emissions than the aircraft it replaces, and has a 34% reduced noise footprint. With an operating range and capacity ideally suited to serving Air/uni00A0France's short and medium-haul network, the Airbus A220-300/uni00A0perfectly meets the company's operational requirements and boasts the highest standards of in-flight comfort in its category, contributing to its upmarket positioning. The choice of this aircraft, whose operating costs are 10% lower than those of the aircraft it replaces, is a response to the need to improve Air/uni00A0France's profitability in its short and medium-haul business. The aircraft will be delivered at a sustained pace. The company took delivery of 6/uni00A0aircraft in 2021 and a further 15/uni00A0aircraft are scheduled for 2022. The Airbus A220-300s will ultimately make up close to 60% of the Air/uni00A0France medium-haul fleet, alongside the Airbus A320s and A321s.\n\nOn December/uni00A016, 2021, the Air/uni00A0France KLM Group announced the decision to place a firm order for 100/uni00A0Airbus A320neo family aircraft - alongside purchase rights for 60/uni00A0additional aircraft to renew the fleets of KLM and Transavia Netherlands, and to renew and expand the fleet of Transavia France. The order covers Airbus A320neo and Airbus A321neo aircraft. Benefiting from the latest technological innovations, the A320neo family aircraft o/ffer the best performance in their category for the network needs of the Group's airlines.

The distribution of the number of aircraft over the three airlines will be announced on a later stage.\n\nFinally the Group also signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) for the purchase of 4/uni00A0Airbus A350F Full Freighter aircraft with purchase rights for an additional 4/uni00A0freighters to increase cargo capacity at Air/uni00A0France. In the context of a steady and sustainable growth in demand for air cargo, this order should increase Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's cargo capacity. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM should be\n\namongst the launch operators of the A350F Full Freighter. This order should come with full substitution rights to Airbus A350 passenger aircraft, which constitute the new spearhead of the Air/uni00A0France long-haul fleet.\n\n## Network\n\nThe agreement with the SNPL is an important first step in the Group's strategy to accelerate the transformation into profitability and restructure Air/uni00A0France's unprofitable domestic network.\n\nAir/uni00A0France will maintain operations on the historic 'La Navette' routes of Marseille, Nice and Toulouse from Paris Orly airport, while Hop! will refocus on Lyon. Transavia will begin operating domestic routes, in addition to its continued development towards other European destinations.\n\n## Cargo\n\n|                                     | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter   | Fourth quarter                | Year   | Year           | Year                          |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n| Cargo                               | 2021             | Change           | Change at  constant  currency | 2021   | Change         | Change at  constant  currency |\n| Tonnage transported  (in thousands) | 314              | -1.9%            |                               | 1, 274 | 21.0%          |                               |\n| Capacity  (in millions of ATK)      | 3,106            | 10.5%            |                               | 11,469 | 13.3%          |                               |\n| Tra/ffic  (in millions of RTK)      | 2,002            | -3.8%            |                               | 8,058  | 18.0%          |                               |\n| Load factor                         | 64.5%            | -9.6/uni00A0pt   |                               | 70.3%  | +2.8/uni00A0pt |                               |\n| Total cargo revenues  (in \u20acm)       | 1,021            | 19.0%            | 17.8%                         | 3,588  | 40.2%          | 41.9%                         |\n| Scheduled cargo revenues  (in \u20acm)   | 895              | 17.1%            | 15.9%                         | 3,167  | 41.0%          | 42.6%                         |\n| Unit revenue per ATK  (in \u20ac cents)  | 28.80            | 6.0%             | 5.0%                          | 27.61  | 24.4%          | 25.8%                         |\n\nGlobal air cargo capacity was approximately 15% lower at the end of the fourth quarter 2021 versus 2019. The tightening of supply and demand levels increased yields significantly in 2021.\n\nThe air cargo market gradually improved and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Cargo activity continued to perform strongly with a unit revenue at constant currency up 5.0% in the fourth quarter 2021.\n\nThe Group's 2021 Cargo capacity was up by 13.3%, driven by both increased belly capacity in passenger aircraft and increased full freighter capacity, partly o/ffset by a decrease in mini cargo flights (passenger aircraft with only belly capacity marketed). Yields and load factors were strongly higher, resulting in a unit revenue increase of 25.8% at constant currency, thanks to\n\nthe gap between industry capacity and demand. The Group benefited from a full freighter fleet of six aircraft and a passenger long-haul fleet well suited to the cargo activity (Boeing 777, Boeing 787, and A350).\n\nOn the demand side, world-wide air freight volumes slowly recovered in 2021 but remained below its pre Covid-19 crisis level. A further recovery is expected in line with trade growth and industrial production. The supply-demand gap of the last year is foreseen to narrow once the industry capacity supply increases, something which will depend on the recovery in passenger tra/ffic.

The Group has committed to having its/uni00A0CO2 emission reduction targets validated by the independent reference organization SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative), founded by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the United Nations Global Compact and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). SBTi assesses and checks companies'/uni00A0CO2 emission reduction targets based on a scientific approach and criteria, ensuring that the targets are in line with the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe letter of commitment, signed in October/uni00A02021 with SBTi, positions the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and its airlines on the\n\ntrajectory determined by this Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is one of the first European airline groups to have its decarbonization trajectory validated by SBTi, in addition to its objective of net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's decarbonization trajectory is mainly based on:\n\n- - an ambitious plan to renew the fleet of the Group's airlines with new generation aircraft emitting 20% to 25% less/uni00A0CO2, through an investment of \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion in fleet renewal between 2019 and 2021;\n- - the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in which Air/uni00A0 France and KLM have been pioneers, will play a key role in the decarbonization of air transport, as they reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 80% over the entire life cycle. Today, the Group is working to make these fuels more accessible in terms of quantity and price by creating an actual sustainable aviation fuel industry in Europe;\n- - the search for greater operational e/fficiency, by favoring more direct trajectories and applying procedures that limit fuel consumption (lighter aircraft, single-engine taxi, continuous descent). Air/uni00A0France and KLM have set themselves the target of carbon neutrality for their ground operations by 2030.\n\nIn addition, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is mobilizing the entire sector and is committed to the development of innovative solutions for aircraft design and maintenance, engines and synthetic fuels, which will gradually lead to totally carbon-free aviation.\n\nInformation about the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's fleet can also be found in section/uni00A01.4.\n\n## 1.2.5/emspace Commitments made in order to comply with the European Commission's 'Temporary Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy in the current Covid-19 outbreak' (TF)\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM remains subject to the commitments made by the French government in order to comply with the European Commission's 'Temporary Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy in the current Covid-19 outbreak' (TF) linked to phase one of the Group's recapitalization realized in April/uni00A02021.\n\nThese commitments, specifically paragraphs 60-61 and 71-78/uni00A0of the 'TF', included Air/uni00A0France's release of up to 18/uni00A0take-o/ff and landing rights (slots) at Paris-Orly airport to a competing carrier in order to create or develop an existing base at that airport, provided that the competing carrier obtaining Air/uni00A0France's slots bases its aircraft and crews at Paris-Orly airport, in compliance\n\nwith national and EU labor laws. Other general commitments were made under the TF, including restrictions on acquisitions, share buy-backs, dividend distributions and executive management compensation. These commitments are applicable to the entire Group with the exception of KLM and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group has reiterated the economic, financial and environmental commitments made in the framework of the State loan and reflected in its transformation plan. The Group therefore maintains an ambitious environmental roadmap to accelerate the Group's sustainable transition, in line with the objectives of the National Low Carbon Strategy (Strat\u00e9gie Nationale Bas Carbone, 'SNBC').",

        "page_content": "## 1.3/emspace ACTIVITIES IN 2021\n\n## 1.3.1/emspace Network business (passenger and cargo): 2021 still significantly impacted by the Covid-19 crisis\n\nThe Network business corresponds to passenger and cargo transportation services on the scheduled flights of the network airlines, Air/uni00A0France and KLM. The Network business is Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's principal activity, contributing approaching 76% of the Group's revenues.\n\nDue to the ongoing Covid-2019 health crisis, 2021 was to be another year of capacity reduction across all the networks, short, medium and long-haul, although capacity was slightly higher than its 2020 level. Total capacity in the Air/uni00A0France network was down by 43% versus 2019. Given that the pandemic situation was unfolding month by month and governmental measures by region were also constantly changing over the year, the Scheduling teams continued to react with agility and proactiveness to adjust capacity throughout 2021. The di/fferent quarters saw quarter on quarter increases: a first and second quarter still very strongly impacted with capacity down by a respective -61% and -60% relative to 2019 for Air/uni00A0France; a recovery in the third and fourth quarters with our capacity down by -38% and -30%.\n\nSince the beginning of the epidemic, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has repatriated more than 500,000/uni00A0European citizens from across the world thanks to the exceptional engagement of its people, thereby responding to the needs and requirements of the French and Dutch governments. The KLM Boeing 747s, which had just been retired, were notably temporarily brought back into service to deliver vital medical equipment. In collaboration with Phillips, an air bridge was established between the Netherlands and China to transport important medical and protective equipment. KLM operated more than 153/uni00A0flights with cargo in the cabins, delivering a total of 120/uni00A0million masks, gloves and other emergency supplies.\n\n1.3.1.1/emspace Short and medium-haul operations: ongoing adjustments in response to the Covid-19 crisis and continued implementation of the Domestic transformation plan\n\nFaced with the ongoing Covid-19 crisis in 2021, the short and medium-haul network maintained its agility in capacity adjustments and continued to restructure the short-haul network\n\nOn the French short-haul network , activity was down by -57% relative to 2019. The 2021 first and second quarters were characterized by very weak activity levels in short-haul of respectively -70% and -67% due to the very serious pandemic situation and governmental measures having a major impact on our network: weekend lockdowns in a number of French cities as of February, lockdowns in some French regions in March then a national lockdown in April. Following the easing of restrictions\n\nin France on May/uni00A03, we were progressively able to increase our production capacity in the third quarter to reach -44% relative to 2019. Lastly, the fourth quarter saw a stabilization at these levels with activity down -46% relative to 2019.\n\nInitiated in 2020 to contend with the magnitude of the Covid crisis but also the growing competition from the low-cost carriers, high speed rail and the Ouigo o/ffer dating back several years, in 2021 the Group continued to restructure its short-haul network. After the deployment of Transavia in short-haul as of the Winter 2021/uni00A0season on the Orly-Biarritz, Nantes-Marseilles, Nantes-Toulouse, Nantes-Nice and Nantes-Montpellier routes, over the summer of 2021 Transavia launched the Orly-Brest and Orly-Toulon routes followed, in Winter 2021, by Orly-Montpellier. Air/uni00A0France is also restructuring its network by initiating, as of the Summer 2020 Season, the closure of structurally loss-making routes; in 2021, the Metz-Nice, Caen-Marseilles, StrasbourgMarseilles, CDG-Lorient, Strasbourg-Toulouse and StrasbourgNice routes were closed. Furthermore, Air/uni00A0France has undertaken to halve its/uni00A0CO2 emissions on the domestic network by 2024 and confirmed the closure, as of Summer 2020, of routes for which there is a rail alternative with journey times of under two and a half hours from Paris (Orly-Bordeaux, Orly-Nantes, OrlyLyons). Lastly, to adapt our capacity to more-leisure-oriented demand during the peak summer season, 57/uni00A0seasonal routes were launched.\n\nThe medium-haul network also saw a substantial reduction in activity during 2021. On average, for the whole year, capacity was down by -46% on its 2019 level, the quarterly trends being similar to those in short-haul: a first and second quarter significantly down at -70% and -67% then a progressive pick-up in activity to a level of -26% in the third quarter, underpinned by leisure and VFR demand during the peak summer season. The gradual recovery in Business demand during the fourth quarter enabled the level of activity to be maintained at -26%. The end of 2021 was however marked by a resurgence of the Covid-19 epidemic in Europe and the emergence of the Omicron variant, which impacted a number of European countries as of December including Austria, the United Kingdom, Germany and Morocco with, for example, new governmental measures.\n\nBuilt around the Paris-CDG and Amsterdam-Schiphol hubs, the medium-haul network experienced an even greater impact in that capacity in the long-haul network was also significantly down, hitting connecting tra/ffic. As a result, for Summer 2021, Air/uni00A0France pursued its deployment strategy focusing on leisure destinations. 24 seasonal routes were thus launched including seven destinations like Corfu, Rhodes, Agadir, Tangiers, Monastir, Malta and Las Palmas.",

        "page_content": "Within a still extremely-volatile health context, the Group thus showed its ability very rapidly to adapt to the changes in governmental measures and demand. Agility and reactivity became the principles for the construction of the commercial proposition, in terms of adapting both capacity and the destinations faced with more leisure-oriented demand.\n\n## 1.3.1.2/emspace Long-haul operations: a historically balanced network which has mitigated the e/ffects of the Covid-19 crisis\n\nThe KLM network saw a significant reduction in capacity, down to 67% versus its 2019 level. The di/fference per quarter was significant with a progressive build up over the year, the first and second quarters at 60%, the third quarter at 73% and the fourth quarter at 75%.\n\nThe trends were very different between Long-haul and Medium-haul.\n\nIn Medium-haul, overall 2021 capacity was 62% with low levels during the first (35%) and second (42%) quarters, followed by far higher levels in the third (83%) and fourth (85%) quarters. The impact on demand volumes of Covid-19 and that of the related measures implemented by the various governments was huge, especially during the first four to five months of the year. In the third and fourth quarters KLM was able to further build up the European Network and also restore part of the seven-wave system on SPL.\n\nIn Medium-haul, average 2021 capacity stood at 66% with a more equal division between the quarters, respectively at 66%, 65%, 70% and 73% for the first to the fourth quarters. The main reason for this relatively equal spread between the quarters was the very strong Cargo performance which made it possible to operate flights on a cash positive basis, even with low passenger volumes.\n\nTo maintain the global network, KLM maximized the number of destinations, albeit at reduced frequencies. It was thus relatively easy to take advantage of opportunities and adapt to the new travel restrictions. KLM succeeded in adding new destinations, like Cancun (Mexico), Port-of Spain (Trinidad and Tobago), Bridgetown (Barbados), Palma de Mallorca (Spain), Verona (Italy) and Dubrovnik (Croatia).\n\nAs in 2020, the Air/uni00A0France long-haul operations also saw an adjustment in capacity to adapt to the travel constraints and the decline in passenger demand. Over the year, Air/uni00A0France capacity measured in Available Seat-Kilometers was down by -47% relative to its 2019 level. This level was higher than in 2020 when capacity had been down -59% relative to 2019.\n\nThe adjustments to capacity saw considerable variations between regions and were calibrated as closely as possible to the trends in demand by region, country and route. Air/uni00A0France was thus able to benefit from a historically diversified and balanced network to maintain activity in the regions the least impacted by the health crisis. The cargo contribution to the passenger aircraft was also a key element in maintaining long-haul operations.\n\nFurthermore, the overall trend was a progressive pick-up in activity over the course of 2021 with first half capacity at around -60% but a third quarter at -40% and a fourth quarter at -30%.\n\nCaribbean/Indian Ocean -22 %: Capacity held up relatively well in this network where travel is predominantly for leisure. Capacity had a particular profile with first half capacity down by -40 % versus 2019 and a second half with capacity in line with its 2019 level. This is explained by the lifting of the 'travel only for imperative reasons' restriction in the second half and the reopening of countries like Madagascar and Mauritius.\n\nIndia/Middle East -36%: Demand for travel to India and destinations like Dubai and Beirut held up relatively well. In addition to the flows from/to France, a significant proportion of travelers were connecting to other long-haul regions like North America and Africa. The diversified flight transfer o/ffering at CDG was thus able to mitigate the e/ffects of the crisis. One new destination was launched on this network as of June/uni00A02021; Chennai in India. In the winter, two new destinations were launched on this network; Muscat in the sultanate of Oman and Colombo in Sri Lanka.\n\nAfrica -18%: It was in Africa that capacity was the most maintained. Air/uni00A0France benefited from its historic presence on niche markets like West Africa and the oil-producing countries to maintain its presence. Air/uni00A0France also opened two new destinations in Africa in 2021 to reinforce its presence on leisure flows: Zanzibar in Tanzania and Banjul in Gambia.\n\nNorth America -45%: On the USA and Canada, the year was split into three periods with a first when borders were closed to Europeans and Americans, followed by a reopening in Europe to Americans as of the summer and, lastly, a reciprocal reopening of borders in September for Canada and November for the USA. This rule change on border openings had a direct impact on our level of activity: -60 % in the first and second quarters, -40 % in the third quarter and -18 % in the final quarter. A new route, Denver, was launched in Summer 2021.\n\nCentral/South America -61%: Operations were progressively reinstated over the course of the year thanks to an easing in public health measures: capacity was down by -70 % at the height of the crisis before improving to -50 % in the fourth quarter.\n\nAsia -75%: The Asian network was to see the most significant adjustments to operations, owing to several factors:\n\n- -  limitation of tra/ffic rights: in countries like China, in mid-2021, Air/uni00A0 France was only able to operate a maximum of three passenger flights a week;\n- -  operational complexity: several Asian destinations requiring PCR tests on arrival, with no guarantee of rapid repatriation to France for flight crews testing positive, made it impossible to schedule rest periods for crews. This was notably the case for China and Vietnam. To operate flights to these destinations, they need to be served via another Air/uni00A0France station with geographical proximity, where Flight Crew rest periods are possible (Seoul in Korea for China and Bangkok for Vietnam);",

        "page_content": "- -  decline in demand: the arrival restrictions imposed on travelers had a material impact on travel demand. Thus, the sharp fall in demand, combined with more complex and costly flight operations, required a more drastic reduction in capacity in Asia than for the other networks. Some countries have, however, been starting to reopen their borders to vaccinated travelers since the 2021 fourth quarter like, for example, Thailand and Singapore.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France Protect, the promise of a safe trip\n\n## Air/uni00A0 France has put in place health measures guaranteeing the highest level of safety at every step of the journey: at the airport; on board; on arrival.\n\nIn the context of a global health crisis, Air/uni00A0France has made the health and safety of its customers and sta/ff its top priority. As of the emergence of the Covid-19 virus, Air/uni00A0France introduced exceptional measures, regrouped under the Air/uni00A0France Protect label, for a safe trip at every stage of the journey, tickets that are 100% changeable and refundable tickets, pandemic-related insurance coverage and a dedicated website to check travel conditions.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France teams are monitoring developments in the health situation and remain more than ever mobilized to continue welcoming customers on board its flights in complete safety.\n\n## 1.3.1.3/emspace An accelerated digital reset for the present and future\n\n## Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Digital's crucial ability to adapt to changing circumstances\n\nAs an airline group and a player in the travel industry, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has been hit very hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Group has seen structural changes in customer behavior for both B2C and B2B, driven by an increased focus on health and sustainability, as well as by technology being embraced as an enabler to connect, from home, with colleagues, friends and family.\n\nWithin Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the Covid-19 crisis has also emphasized the need to further embrace the opportunities of digitization and automation, to remain adaptive and resilient in all disciplines and to enhance cost e/fficiency for the sales and distribution of the o/ffer. Today, the digital channels are often the first point of contact with customers and are constantly being adapted to the ever-changing worldwide travel restrictions and health measures. In this renewed perspective on the digital channels, sales and servicing go hand-in-hand when optimizing the experience for customers.\n\n## Digital mission statement and key figures for 2021\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Digital's channel objective is to be our customers' go-to travel solution by providing spot-on o/ffers and services for every step of the journey.\n\n- -  280/uni00A0million visits (metric = number of sessions) on AF.com and KLM.com, of which 53% on mobile devices (i.e. mobile phones and tablets).

        "page_content": "Alongside commercial flexibility, due to the unprecedented level of changes, it is also key to provide our customers with relevant and updated information to help them plan and anticipate the requested requirements. In this context, the Covid-19 Hub Page was created to ensure a centralized, easy-to-find starting point for customers to guide them to the relevant information. The hub page o/ffers a clear overview of previously-scattered content, regrouped in a visually understandable way according to tested and approved designs.\n\nThe page is continuously being monitored and data is driving the decisions to further evolve and improve the content so as to keep up with this fast-moving context. Since the Covid-19 Hub Page was launched on July/uni00A026, it has had the highest number of unique page views after the 'Information' page, and has received a useful score from customers of 85% on average, with even a 90% score during the first week after the go-live.\n\nAnother example is the 'Where Can I Fly To?' map launched in October. This is a joint Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Digital product to help customers find their next AF/KL destination with a general overview of current Covid-19-related travel requirements and the lowest fare available to this destination for the next 6 months. The map displays the AF/KL-operated destinations with the current travel requirements based on the customer's point of departure and vaccination status. Each destination features an integrated booking function and a link to the more detailed travel requirements associated with this destination on TravelDoc. The interactive map is accessible via the Air/uni00A0France and KLM websites.\n\nIn addition to information made available on digital touchpoints, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has proactively sent tailor-made communication to inform customers of their specific travel requirements; more than 100/uni00A0million contacts were targeted this year, with customer satisfaction increasing as the content was progressively made more accurate.\n\nOn Digital Marketing, our focus is on providing Covid-19-related information and practical support for customers, by dynamically adapting our targeted advertising in line with constantly-changing market demand and consumer sentiment. This approach is supported by dashboards integrating internal (e.g. API calls) and external data (e.g. Google demand, social media questions).\n\nA selection of the Digital Marketing highlights in 2021:\n\n- -  collaboration Brand/Sales campaign marketing through successive messages;\n- -  integration of booking flexibility in all our channels with lower funnel communication;\n- -  the 'Recovery Strategy' initiated in 2020, wherein we categorize countries by sentiment and demand, was pursued during 2021, with more and more markets entering the 'recovery phase' (reactivation of marketing and marketing investment that follow sentiment and demand). The\n\nconsequence was more active marketing and more budget spend while maintaining the return on advertising spend;\n\n- -  sales pick-ups on the American market that reopened through two sales campaign waves in the autumn and pick-ups on social media (KLM). 2021 also saw an improvement in many initiatives launched in 2020, to facilitate control for our customers and respond to increasing servicing requests, some of which dealt with by information bots dedicated to information on the Covid-19 situation, self-service rebooking, self-service vouchers and refunds.\n\nAs part of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM self-service o/ffer, Ready2Fly (Air/uni00A0France) and the Upload@Home (KLM) service were introduced to assist operational staff with the increase in Covid-19 document checks at the airport and o/ffer customers a more streamlined experience. Via this service, customers are informed prior to travel of the required Covid-19 documents for their destinations. Customers can then assemble the Covid-19-related entry documents at home at their own pace and receive validation of these documents through a dedicated back-o/ffice prior to travel. The use of this service enables the reactivation of our online self-service check-in process since validation of the customer's health status is done in advance. The service is o/ffered on those routes and destinations which are dependent on the Covid-19 entry rules and regulations.\n\nIn 2021, our hybrid model of agent servicing, supported by tooling and bots, demonstrated its essential role in our social media service organization, making tangible the best of human and AI interaction to assist our customers. The digital teams adapted and developped additional bots to handle the high servicing volumes, in a context of complex travel conditions for our customers.\n\n## Digital supporting the Group's sustainability ambitions\n\nTo support the Group's ambition to become the sustainability leader in the aviation industry, Digital has created dedicated content and pedagogic pages to promote sustainable actions (CO2 reduction and o/ffsetting, waste on board, new fleet,/uni00A0etc.) and includes '100%/uni00A0CO2 o/ffset' as a structural mention for domestic flights on both the booking module and the price comparison websites.\n\nA number of tools have also been developed to promote the offsetting of/uni00A0CO2 emissions, i.e a/uni00A0CO2 calculator, Trip&Tree module (o/ffsetting) with partner Ecoact and Payment in Miles for Trip&Tree.\n\nReducing/uni00A0CO2 is key and costly. Digital's response has been to develop additional tools to increase our investment capabilities in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with the implementation of the mandatory (for Air/uni00A0France) SAF surcharge, and a new product to allow customers to voluntary invest in SAF on the booking, reservation and check-in windows alongside o/ffsetting products.",

Some examples: first go-lives on selected markets of ticket bundles with seats (i.e seats with extra legroom), the 'paid empty seat' customers can choose to block an empty seat next to them or even a full row and, for Flying Blue members, it is now possible to buy commercial tickets and pay with cash and Miles.\n\nFurthermore, new customer segments have been attracted to our direct online channels (i.e corporate customers via Business Travel Services).\n\n## Innovation to o/ffer the most personalized digital experience\n\n## Personalization as a key driver in our commercial strategy\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM have launched numerous initiatives to personalize their o/ffers in response to customer needs; the goal is to develop the o/ffer's personalization at every stage of the customer journey.\n\nNumerous options such as the choice of seat and meals or lounge access are o/ffered with a discount to our customers through the most relevant touchpoint (email, application,/uni00A0etc.) and at the best time when they are planning their travel.\n\nThis is also the case for marketing campaigns. Thanks to data and algorithms, we are able to propose to our customers only the destinations and products in which they are truly interested. Our 'Next Best Action' dedicated algorithm is able to make suggestions based on historical bookings and the customer profile.\n\n## A pioneer on social media\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM are continuing their role as pioneers, having been the first airline brands to propose direct conversations with customers and the sending of travel documents on five social messaging platforms, 24/24 and 7/7, in 10 languages.\n\nCustomers can choose to receive their travel documents and notifications directly on their preferred social channel.\n\nThe strategy of combining artificial intelligence (bots) and 500/uni00A0advisors around the world at the service of our customers has enabled the successful management of more than 50,000/uni00A0cases a week.\n\nKey figures for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM on the social media:\n\n- -  questions from customers are answered by over 500/uni00A0advisors (based in ten call centers worldwide), making this the largest dedicated social media team in the world;\n- -  24/24 and 7/7/uni00A0service on WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, WeChat, KakaoTalk;\n- -  messages in ten languages (French, Dutch, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese and Korean);\n- -  over 50% of agent replies on social media are supported by artificial intelligence (the agents use suggested answers or fully-automated replies);\n- -  over 50% of incoming Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM customer conversations are assisted by a chatbot, with around 20% for Air/uni00A0France and 13% for KLM being fully handled by chatbots;\n- -  improving the customer experience and customer recognition by building connections between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM-owned media (Mobile App) and the social media channels (Messenger), providing personalized and e/fficient servicing on our social media channels;\n- -  more than 2 million unique users of the messaging services.\n\nNote/uni00A01: A case is a sum of messages exchanged with a customer on a specific subject/question.\n\nNote/uni00A02: The number of social fans and followers is subject to the e/ffects of centralization (closure of local pages).\n\nFurthermore, to maintain its frontrunner position, Air/uni00A0France launched its Instagram Shop in November/uni00A02021, thereby becoming the first travel brand to position itself on social commerce.\n\n## Consolidation of a joint digital platform\n\nFor some years Air/uni00A0France and KLM have combined their digital development resources and expertise to create a joint digital ecosystem for the Air/uni00A0France and KLM brands. Based on agile methods of working, a continuous e/ffort is directed at providing our customers with a state-of-the-art digital experience. The foundation of this ecosystem is a joint API framework, covering the entire journey. During 2021, significant progress was made on the new website as well as on the mobile application, for which a uniform architecture and technology set-up is applied for both the Air/uni00A0France and KLM digital channels.",

        "page_content": "In the same joint spirit, conversational and social media development was combined within the space of a year by migrating to a joint architecture and joint chatbots for both Air/uni00A0France and KLM in less than one year. All automation developments for our customers on social media are now common to both companies.\n\n## 1.3.1.4/emspace Cargo\n\nDuring the 2021 financial year, the Group carried 1,053/uni00A0million kilograms, up by 19.7%, of which 84% in the bellies of passenger aircraft and 16% in the full-freighter fleet. The tightening of supply and demand levels have increased yields significantly since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, the Group's cargo capacity was up by 13.3%, primarily driven by the increased belly capacity in passenger aircraft and the increase in full freighter capacity, and partly o/ffset by a decrease in mini-cargo flights (passenger aircraft for which only the belly capacity is marketed). The yield and load factor were higher, resulting in a unit revenue increase of 25.8% at constant currency, due to the gap between industry capacity and demand. The Group benefited from its full freighter fleet of six aircraft and a passenger long-haul fleet well suited to the cargo activity (Boeing 777, Boeing 787 and A350).\n\nWorld-wide air freight volumes have strongly recovered, and volumes are above pre-Covid levels, mainly on Europe Middle East/Asia and North Atlantic routes. The supply-demand gap is foreseen to narrow once the industry capacity supply increases which will depend on the recovery in passenger tra/ffic. In 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM transported approximately 100/uni00A0million Covid vaccines worldwide.\n\n## 1.3.1.5/emspace Airline partnerships and alliances: expanding the Group's commercial presence to respond to global air transport\n\nAir transport demand is global and, to respond to this demand, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is pursuing an ambitious strategy aimed at expanding its commercial presence in every region of the world.\n\nAirline alliances and partnerships are an integral part of this strategy. They contribute to meeting customer expectations and thus creating value for both the Group and its customers. They reinforce the Group's market positioning thanks to an expanded and more diversified network, which supplements the Group's own o/ffer. They may also enable the generation of operational synergies.\n\n## Strategic partnerships\n\nIn July/uni00A02017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced a further major step in the reinforcement of its strategic partnerships with, on one hand, the creation of a single global joint-venture between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic and, on the other hand, the intensification of its partnership with China Eastern Airlines. These two commercial alliances have been consolidated by equity links with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines each acquiring an 8.8% equity interest\n\nin Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM within the framework of reserved capital increases carried out during 2017, for a total of \u20ac751/uni00A0million.\n\nThe strategic, commercial and capitalistic reinforcement of these partnership positions Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as the European pillar of the leading global airline network.\n\n## Transatlantic joint-venture with Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic\n\nOn January/uni00A01, 2020, following approval by the US authorities on November/uni00A021, 2019, the Group launched a new transatlantic joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic. As a result, as of December/uni00A031, 2019, a decade after its creation, the Group ended the existing joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Alitalia. As with most joint-ventures in the industry, it did not lead to the creation of a common company but rather the signature of a contract defining both the mechanism of a common income statement, and governance and organizations to manage all aspects of the partnership. The existence of an internal common income statement ensures that the partners implement all the actions contributing to an improved operating result for the activity, to their mutual benefit. Each company member of the joint-venture recognizes the revenues and costs relating to the joint-venture scope in their respective income statements. If necessary, a settlement mechanism between joint-venture members will compensate the imbalances in value creation based on a mechanism agreed between the parties. This mechanism contributes to ''metal neutrality'', enabling the di/fferent members to jointly manage capacity and look for overall optimization rather than the individual interests of each airline, ultimately increasing value for both the partners and customers.\n\nThe governance bodies comprise a CEO Committee, a monthly JV Leadership Team meeting and Working Groups.\n\nThe scope of this joint-venture is very wide, covering all the flights between North America (including Canada and Mexico) and Europe through integrated cooperation and all the flights between North America to and from Africa, the Middle East and India together with the flights from Europe to and from Central America, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador through close coordination.\n\nPrior to the public health crisis this new joint-venture had revenues exceeding US$13/uni00A0billion and a market share of 23%, making it a major player on the transatlantic, the leading market for international air transportation. More than 340/uni00A0daily flights linked the nine principal hubs: Paris, Amsterdam, London, Atlanta, New York, Detroit, Minneapolis, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City. Pricing and revenue management are centralized within a 60-strong team based in Amsterdam.\n\nThe coordination of the network is reflected in the strengthening of the hub-to-hub services, the optimization of aircraft types assigned to each route and an increase in the number of destinations served by non-stop flights on both sides of the Atlantic and the English Channel. The sales forces have been regrouped in each region.",

        "page_content": "This extended scope marks the expansion and strengthening of one of the most advanced partnership models in the airline industry.\n\n## Partnership in China - a consolidated presence in the Chinese market\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM benefit from a historic presence in China, bolstered by a strong partnership with one of the three largest Chinese carriers, through a joint-venture agreement concluded ten years ago.\n\nIn 2012, Air/uni00A0France signed a joint-venture agreement involving the Paris and Shanghai routes with China Eastern Airlines, a major player in Chinese air transportation, operating a vast domestic network and internationally mainly out of its base in Shanghai, China's economic lung. This agreement was extended to KLM in 2016, when China Eastern Airlines inaugurated the ShanghaiAmsterdam service. The partnership was further reinforced in 2017 when China Eastern Airlines acquired an 8.8% equity interest in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM via a reserved capital increase. In November/uni00A02018, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern signed an agreement extending their joint-venture to two additional routes, Paris-Wuhan and Paris-Kunming, as of January/uni00A01, 2019, thereby o/ffering their respective customers new routes under code share and new connecting opportunities between Europe and China. In April/uni00A02021, China Eastern Airlines participated in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share capital increase; within this context, both airline groups decided to extend the scope of their partnership through an intensified commercial cooperation and an increased footprint on the Beijing market, with the Paris-Beijing and Amsterdam-Beijing routes joining the current existing Joint Venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines when the conditions are satisfied.\n\nThanks to this partnership, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM can o/ffer its customers access to a total of some forty destinations in China.\n\nIn total, the revenues from routes operated between Europe and China by airlines participating in the joint-venture agreement represented more than \u20ac600 million in 2019.\n\n## Strategic partnership with GOL\n\nIn 2014, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and GOL Linhas A\u00e9reas Inteligentes signed an exclusive five-year strategic partnership, reinforcing their commercial cooperation between Brazil and Europe. The partnership notably foresees the optimization of synergies between the two groups and, in particular, connecting opportunities in the major Brazilian cities served by the Group. The partnership was a great success, with almost 25% of Air/uni00A0France passengers, flying to Brazil, transferring to GOL flights. Since April/uni00A02015, GOL has used its code on Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM flights between Europe and Brazil, and on European destinations beyond Paris and Amsterdam. The two partners cooperate on promoting sales in their home markets and, since November/uni00A02017, Air/uni00A0France has been GOL's GSA for the French market. This GSA agreement is currently being deployed across the European market.\n\nIn May/uni00A02018, Air/uni00A0France and KLM took a new step in their strategic development in Brazil with the opening of new flights to Fortaleza on departure from Paris and Amsterdam. These flights connect with GOL's new strategic hub in Fortaleza, o/ffering increased connectivity for customers to the main cities in northern and north-eastern Brazil.\n\nOn October/uni00A030, 2019, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and GOL renewed this strategic partnership agreement for a five-year period, thereby reinforcing this cooperation. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM remains GOL's exclusive European partner and reciprocally, with some exceptions granted.\n\n## Other joint-ventures and code shares\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM implements various forms of partnership agreements, the choice depending on the balance between value creation for its customers and the Group, and the necessary level of interaction between the o/ffers of the partners, together with the regulatory requirements framing the scope of the agreement.\n\nThe first levels of interline cooperation are Tra/ffic and Special Prorate Agreements (SPA) between the partner airlines, enabling the combination of their networks while maintaining their respective IATA codes and setting their own fares.\n\nWithin the framework of a code-sharing agreement, two partner airlines sell tickets on the same flight, each under their own code and setting their own fares. The operating carrier has operational control over the aircraft while the marketing partner, for sales purposes, uses its own flight number on its partner's flights. Any such agreement must comply with the safety and regulatory requirements set forth by the competent authorities.\n\nThere are two types of code sharing. In the first, under a block seat agreement, the marketing partner purchases a fixed amount of capacity from the operating carrier. The marketing partner has inventory control over the seat block. In the second, known as free flow, no division of capacity is set, the two partners potentially selling all the seats on the relevant flights although inventory control remains the prerogative of the operating carrier. Access to capacity on the relevant flights is through negotiated fares for each booking class.\n\nJoint-ventures are the next level in alliances and participate in the trend towards consolidation when the partners are seeking a higher level of joint optimization on a sub-scope of their network without, however, considering a merger.\n\nA joint-venture enables value creation for customers in the markets where it is implemented and, as a result for the partners who organize coordination of the commercial activities:\n\n- -  for customers, they enable access to an expanded o/ffer of flights and improved connectivity, loyalty program benefits across a wider perimeter, a harmonized travel experience and integrated commercial propositions;\n- -  the partners thus improve their market positioning, serving a higher number of customers and enabling them to capture market growth.",

        "page_content": "The partners define the governance principles and financial sharing mechanisms, enabling decision-making and execution across the whole value chain, thus responding to the commercial objectives of the joint-venture.\n\nThe final stages in cooperation consolidation and integration are mergers or equity interests, anchoring the development of a common strategy over the long term.\n\nJoint-ventures, equity interests and mergers must be approved in the light of the regulations in force in the jurisdictions covering the scopes of the agreements, particularly with respect to the competition rules (e.g. Anti-trust Immunity).\n\n## 1.3.1.6/emspace SkyTeam  alliance\n\nThe three large alliances, SkyTeam (to which Air/uni00A0France and KLM belong), Star Alliance and oneworld, represent some 55% of worldwide tra/ffic. Among the top 50/uni00A0airline carriers in the world, only 15/uni00A0do not belong to a global alliance, including eight low-cost carriers whose business models make them unlikely to want to join an alliance.\n\nSince the inception of the global alliances, their capacity in terms of the available seats o/ffered by member airlines has grown by more than the industry average, with SkyTeam now being the second largest global alliance, behind Star Alliance and ahead of oneworld.\n\n## SkyTeam: a global alliance\n\nSkyTeam, created in 2000, is a global alliance which numbered 19/uni00A0airline members at December/uni00A031, 2020: Aeroflot, Aerolineas Argentinas, Aeromexico, Air Europa, Air/uni00A0France, Alitalia, China Eastern Airlines, China Airlines, Czech Airlines, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc., Garuda Indonesia, Kenya Airways, KLM, Korean Air, Middle East Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Tarom, Vietnam Airlines and XiamenAir.\n\nBelonging to SkyTeam enables its members to strengthen their brand awareness and extend their o/ffer around the globe, thereby bolstering their commercial presence. As members of the SkyTeam alliance, Air/uni00A0France and KLM thus have access to a global network of some 15,500/uni00A0daily flights to 1,036/uni00A0destinations in more than 170/uni00A0countries./thinspace (1)\n\nThe 676/uni00A0million annual passengers benefit from a seamless travel experience on the flights of member airlines and have access to 790/uni00A0airport lounges around the world. The 230/uni00A0million\n\npassengers who are members of frequent flyer programs can earn and burn air miles on all SkyTeam partner flights.\n\nTo become an alliance member, airlines need to fulfil a series of specific membership requirements, relating to operations, technologies and products. Members must be linked by bilateral agreements covering code sharing, their loyalty programs and access to airport lounges.\n\nWhile retaining their separate identities and brands, the airlines combine their networks to o/ffer their customers a more extensive range of travel solutions and the related global services, more rapid earning of miles, access to numerous airport lounges but also a more seamless customer service during the di/fferent stages of their journeys thanks to the SkyPriority and SkyTransfer programs.\n\nSkyTeam also provides an environment and tools enabling members to generate operational cost synergies (e.g. co-located facilities, better use of airport lounges and notably the seven SkyTeam lounges, a joint IT platform,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nAirlines must also be able to o/ffer the products and services exclusive to the alliance. SkyTeam has notably developed proprietary products such as Passes enabling travel at competitive fares, global contracts reserved for large companies or international events, and a product dedicated to Marine and O/ffshore personnel.\n\nSkyTeam's main governance body is the Alliance Board, composed of the Chairs and Chief Executive O/fficers of the 19/uni00A0member airlines. The Alliance Board meets twice a year to define the strategic orientations of the Alliance such as the introduction of new members, the definition of the customer experience and the positioning of the SkyTeam brand along with its related investment and operational budget.\n\nThe Executive Board, consisting of senior executives with direct commercial and operational roles, is appointed by the Alliance Board and translates the approved strategic orientations into action plans in a wide range of disciplines ranging from marketing, airport synergies, the interface between information systems, the transfer product between member airlines, cargo and advertising of the brand.\n\nIn parallel with their proprietary development projects, the member airlines commit to implementing the SkyTeam action plans by earmarking the required internal resources and respecting the timelines set.",

Transavia's cost structure is strictly aligned with the low-cost business model: maximizing the utilization of aircraft, simple products and fares, a strong focus on ancillary revenues, a single aircraft type, a light organizational structure and the outsourcing of a significant portion of the activities.\n\nTransavia Netherlands, the main low-cost airline in the Netherlands serves customers in the leisure segment, was celebrating its 55 th /uni00A0anniversary, saw a strong recovery and retained its number one low-cost carrier position. In general, the leisure market has recovered faster than the business market, retaining more capacity than airlines that also depend on intercontinental tra/ffic.\n\n## Adapting the network to the Covid-19 crisis\n\nIn 2021, both Transavia Netherlands and Transavia France again had to contend with the global pandemic and the emergence of new variants. Once again, the Company had to be very agile in order to constantly adapt its ASK o/ffer to the health situation and to the various border closures and re-openings.\n\nDue to a curfew followed by a lockdown in France during the first quarter of the year, Transavia France considerably revised its capacity, which was down by 68% compared to the same period in 2019.\n\nIn May/uni00A02021, as restrictions were lifted in France and in several countries key to the network (Portugal, Greece, Italy, Croatia,/uni00A0etc.), customer demand surged as passengers were again eager to travel. The customer profile (Leisure and VFR customers) proved to be an asset as it was these customers who were the first to book and fly again. With a fleet of 48/uni00A0aircraft, during Summer 2021, Transavia France capacity returned to a level comparable to that of 2019. To meet customer demand and expectations, capacity was added in Spain (+60%) Greece (+40%), Portugal (+15% from July) and other markets in the Mediterranean basin.\n\nIn June, the reopening of Morocco's air borders enabled Transavia France to relaunch flights to one of its core markets.",

        "page_content": "In total, Transavia France launched 37/uni00A0new routes during the summer to various destinations in France and elsewhere in Europe. With 1.6/uni00A0million passengers carried during the summer peak, Transavia France regained its pre-crisis levels (with a load factor of 81% in August).\n\nDuring October and November, as restrictions continued to be lifted, capacity was again increased. The All-Saints' Day holidays benefited from a 'very strong catch-up e/ffect', with 30% more passengers than in 2019.\n\nWith 13/uni00A0new routes inaugurated during the fourth quarter, Transavia developed its city break network (Krakow, Stockholm, Berlin, Rome,/uni00A0etc.) and its sun destinations for the winter (Hurghada, Cairo, Cap Verde,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nAt the end of the year, with the surge in the Delta and Omicron variants, capacity was again adapted. With the closure of Morocco, where Transavia France serves 10 destinations (20% of capacity in December), a portion of capacity from Paris-Orly was redeployed to Spain, Italy, Tunisia and Portugal.\n\nTransavia Netherlands benefitted from holiday tra/ffic within Europe and performed well around the summer and autumn holidays, from July to October. Over the summer and autumn, load factors stood at more than 80% of their pre-pandemic level, and flown capacity in 2021 was 29% higher than 2020. Revenues per passenger were good, although passengers tended to book late, impacting cash-flow and the ability to predict occupancy rates. Passengers made good use of the Flex proposition we developed in response.\n\nIn 2021, Transavia Netherlands took the bold step of opening Bilbao and Fez as two new destinations. For the 2022 season, Transavia Netherlands began selling tickets to five additional new destinations: Bastia (France), Kayseri (Turkey), Ponta Delgada (Portugal), Milan-Bergamo (Italy) and Riga (Latvia). In 2021, Transavia Netherlands operated out of Amsterdam Schiphol, The Hague Airport and Eindhoven. Low-cost carriers are trying their utmost to expand capacity in Europe although this is not possible in the Netherlands due to slot restrictions. In 2022, Transavia Netherlands plans to further roll-out operations from Brussels, starting with Innsbruck then followed by four more destinations.\n\n## French domestic network development\n\nDespite the pandemic, the development of the domestic network continued. Transavia France launched the Orly-Toulon and OrlyBrest routes in March/uni00A02021, followed by the Orly-Montpellier route in November/uni00A02021. A total of 17/uni00A0new routes, both radial and transversal, were launched in France, connecting various airports.\n\n## Continued innovation\n\nIn early 2021, Transavia France and the ADP Group launched a trial of facial recognition at Orly for passengers at two key stages of their journey: baggage drop-o/ff and boarding. This technology, which is both reliable and respectful of private data, o/ffers incomparable comfort and time savings to passengers who no longer need to present their travel and identity documents multiple times, including at the boarding gate.\n\nDespite the crisis, Transavia was able to launch customer experience innovations such as Transavia Holidays (a new holiday-booking service combining a wide choice of destinations and hotels at a/ffordable prices on a single platform) and Smooss (an automated solution for rebooking passengers).\n\nBefore the summer KLM and both Transavia airlines launched a request for purchase for the replacement of the Boeing 737NG fleet as part of a more comprehensive Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM tender. In December, KLM and both Transavia airlines signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus for the delivery of new medium-haul aircraft as from 2024. This will be a combination of Airbus A321neo and A320neo aircraft.\n\n## Customer experience\n\nIn the area of customer experience, the Net Promoter Score (NPS) for Transavia France reached an all-time high with an average of 40 for the full year. In the Netherlands, the customer experience scores as measured with our Passenger Experience Index are in line with the high scores of 2019, with especially good customer satisfaction scores during the check-in process and the flight itself.\n\nWith more than 1,700/uni00A0employees in France, Transavia France puts the quality of its services, the proximity of its crews and innovation at the center of its commitments. This stance has led to the company regularly winning awards. For the second time, Transavia France was voted 'Customer Service of the Year 2022' in the Collective Passenger Transport (ESCDA) category and obtained, for the fifth consecutive year, the Capital label 'Best Brand Quality of Service' in the Transport category, awarded by Capital magazine. The company was also awarded the Qualiweb 2021 trophy for the quality of its online service in the Tourism and Transport category.\n\nOperations and maintenance have been adapted at all stages of the crisis enabling a maintained reliable service.\n\nLastly, since 2021, Transavia France passengers have been able to earn XP miles (Experience Points) in connection with the Flying Blue program.\n\n## Sta/ff/internal recruitment\n\nTo support the resumption of tra/ffic at the beginning of the summer, Transavia France looked for new recruits internally to fill cabin crew career opportunities.\n\nIn November, Transavia France signed a new agreement for remote working with the majority of the representative trade unions, aimed at improving the quality of life at work for employees while maintaining the social ties that are essential to the company's economic and social performance objectives.\n\nIn 2021, Transavia Netherlands saw its Employee Engagement Scores return to their 2019 levels. Transavia Netherlands also temporarily employed 155/uni00A0cabin attendants from KLM.",

        "page_content": "Working during the Covid pandemic has brought a world of experience with regard to hybrid working. With the worker's council Transavia Netherlands developed a '2-3-2' working program which combines flexibility of working at home and combining social cohesion by working at o/ffices and reducing the amount of work-home travel which supports our sustainable ambition.\n\n## Sustainable development\n\nTransavia France is a pioneer in the implementation of eco-pilot programs. The pursuit of its partnerships with startups Safety Line and OpenAirlines has led to a 3% to 5% reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions per flight.\n\nIn 2021, following on from the innovation partnerships entered into in 2020, Transavia France became the first airline to test OptiLevel, a vertical flight optimization solution. The aim is to achieve even-greater fuel savings and reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions.\n\nThe three OptiFlight solutions (combined) from its partner Safety Line can save more than 80/uni00A0tons of fuel per aircraft per year, the equivalent of one aircraft flying neutrally in the Transavia France fleet.\n\nTransavia France has also worked on reducing the weight of its aircraft: choosing a lighter carpet can reduce the weight of an aircraft by 63kg, representing a saving of 5.4kg of fuel per flight.\n\nOn the ground, Transavia France has embarked on the APU OFF project with Smart Airport Systems to reduce/uni00A0CO2 and/uni00A0NOx emissions. This technology allows the air conditioner on the ground to be powered by electricity, thus no longer using the aircraft's APU (Auxiliary Power Unit). After a first successful test in August, this solution could lead to an average reduction of 16% in/uni00A0CO2 and 9% in/uni00A0NOx emissions.\n\nTransavia France has teamed up with the start-up GobUse to promote the recycling of surgical masks. Employees are invited to deposit their masks in the terminals and the masks are then recycled and transformed into building materials.\n\nIn 2021, the company also partnered with Tricycle, an SSE company, to collect o/ffice waste. The result: 1.4/uni00A0tonnes of waste sorted, of which one tonne was given a second life.\n\nThis year Transavia France again reinforced its commitment to associations like Movember, Octobre Rose, Les Rubans Rouges and the Carlesimo association, by promoting awareness-raising actions on board and with ground sta/ff.\n\nTransavia Netherlands is also making an important contribution to its own and the Group's overall sustainability. Together with\n\nKLM and Transavia France it is investing in the renewal of its fleet and has become a member of the innovation hub at Rotterdam The Hague Innovation Airport. Along with Dimple Aerospace and Delft University of Engineering, Transavia Netherlands was awarded a subsidy by the Dutch Turbulence Taskforce to find ways to reduce turbulence, which leads to lower/uni00A0CO2 emissions during flight. Transavia is a long-standing partner of JINC, an NGO that develops the talents of disadvantaged young people.\n\nTransavia Netherlands thus plans to blend one per cent sustainable airline fuel on all its outbound flights. These numbers will increase over the coming years. Transavia took the initiative to encourage its sta/ff and management to plant 5,000/uni00A0trees around Schiphol. The planting of more trees is planned for 2022.\n\nLastly, Transavia Netherlands celebrated the 25 th /uni00A0anniversary of its Peter Pan Holiday Club, which has seen Transavia volunteers organize holidays for 1,200/uni00A0chronically sick children.\n\n## Growth incoming\n\n2022 marks the continuation of Transavia growth in terms of o/fferings, presence in its core markets and new destinations. Transavia is continuing to build its fleet from 50/uni00A0aircraft this winter to 61/uni00A0next April.\n\nWith customers keen to travel again as soon as the health situation allows, Transavia France has high expectations for the upcoming summer season and plans an ambitious flight schedule with the opening of 18/uni00A0new routes.\n\nTransavia Netherlands aims to remain the number one low-cost carrier in the Netherlands, and to be an inspiring organization for employees and passengers. To this end, a recovery plan has been drawn up to sharpen the business strategy, restructure the organization and implement cost reductions.\n\nThe Transavia strategy focuses on three domains. The first one is the customer, proposition and distribution. The second is integral airline planning and the third is purpose, people and organization. In 2021, the focus was on strengthening our foundations through more simplification and integral cooperation, and cost reductions with which they are on track. In 2022, the recovery will be accelerated by diversifying the o/ffering and sharpening the purpose. A more integral approach will also be taken to the design of the operations to adapt to the market more flexibly. In terms of production, Transavia Netherlands is closing in on the 2019 capacity with a planned capacity index of 94% compared to 2019 for the full year, and in 2023 above the 2019 levels.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3.3/emspace Maintenance  business\n\nAircraft maintenance is the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's third business with third-party revenues of \u20ac1.0/uni00A0billion. These revenues generated with external clients represent 36.4% of the total revenues in this business. In 2021, despite the Covid-19 pandemic and its worldwide impact on the airline industry, the AFI KLM E&M order book remained at a high level with a total value of US$8.7/uni00A0billion.\n\nIn the aircraft maintenance or MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) market, Air/uni00A0France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance (AFI KLM E&M) ranks number two globally amongst the multi-product players. The role of AFI KLM E&M is to supply competitive support for the Group's fleet, while consolidating its position as a leading MRO in its own market.\n\nThe Group operates in three major maintenance segments: airframe maintenance, engine maintenance and component support (electronic, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic,/uni00A0etc.). Airframe maintenance covers three sub- segments: line operations support which aims to verify the proper day-to-day functioning of systems and the integrity of the aircraft structure, heavy maintenance for in-depth checks involving the disassembly of cabins, equipment and some structural elements, and the realization of modification programs, particularly the retrofitting of cabins.\n\n## 1.3.3.1/emspace Business  environment\n\n## An attractive market despite the growing constraints\n\nThe aeronautics maintenance or MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul) market is mostly driven by the age, cycles and flight hours of the worldwide fleet. According to estimates, the global MRO market, which comprises the maintenance and modification spending by aircraft operators either directly or through sub-contractors, first collapsed in 2020 before recovering in 2021. After a drop to US$50/uni00A0billion in 2020, down from an expected US$91billion in the initial forecasts, the MRO market recovered to a forecast amount of US$68/uni00A0billion for 2021, representing 83% of the 2019 levels (pre-Covid-19 crisis), mainly driven by the recovery in narrow-body operations (source: Oliver Wyman, June/uni00A02021).\n\nThe trends in this business closely follow those of the commercial airline fleets globally and their utilization. The Covid-19 crisis and a strong emphasis on sustainability have accelerated fleet adjustment decisions, to gain e/fficiency and reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions. Airlines are tending to defer maintenance and are focusing on grounding and/or phasing out older generation aircraft and increasing the proportion of next-generation aircraft, benefitting those like AFI KLM E&M which are well positioned\n\non the next-generation and the more sustainable segments. Green time management has been increasingly implemented in particular on engines and APUs. The digitalization of engineering services in MRO is expected to be increasingly used by airlines in an effort to optimize their ground time and operations. Furthermore, a growing number of airlines are looking to transfer the financing of spare parts to maintenance service providers within the framework of increasingly-large-scale contracts (in terms of revenue, duration, complexity,/uni00A0etc.). The MRO operators are su/ffering from weaker and more volatile demand on older and current-generation aircraft. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group considers that the MRO market related to newer-generation aircraft, which had yet to require significant spending in 2021, will grow and reach mature levels by 2024. By then, MRO global spending will have shifted away from the older generation aircraft which are gradually being phased out.\n\nThe market is also characterized by increased pricing pressure resulting from fiercer competition between maintenance operators and more exacting requirements from customer airlines due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. Additionally, supply chain di/fficulties and rising inflation resulting from the crisis are likely to appear as well as a warning signal on the entire aeronautics business. Ensuring a fair competition on the after-sales market is appearing as a means to secure airline operator budgets, over the long term and despite an uncertain environment.\n\nFinally, the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis on airline bankruptcies, including bankruptcy protection mechanisms such as Chapter/uni00A011, will also have a residual e/ffect on the MRO market. However, the longer-term outlook for the MRO market remains strong, with steady growth projected for the next decade.\n\n## Ever-fiercer competition\n\nAs with all the players in the aeronautics industry, the MRO operators are participating in a vast consolidation movement to reinforce economies of scale.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, air framers, engine manufacturers and aircraft component manufacturers are continuing to develop their after-sales services to o/ffer their customers increasingly-integrated aircraft maintenance solutions. This positioning corresponds to a long-term strategy based on leveraging intellectual property by selling licenses to a limited number of maintenance service providers seeking to expand their business activity on certain products. This trend is escalating, especially with the arrival of new aircraft like the E2, A220, A350, Boeing 787,/uni00A0etc. Ultimately, this trend could result in reduced competition on the MRO market, with a seriously adverse e/ffect on airline maintenance costs.",

The PROGNOS \u00ae range of solutions now includes PROGNOS \u00ae for Aircraft, PROGNOS \u00ae for APU, PROGNOS \u00ae for Inventory and PROGNOS \u00ae for Engines. AFI KLM E&M is capitalizing on the vast amount of data generated by the Air/uni00A0France and KLM fleets to develop its PROGNOS \u00ae solutions and verify their operational relevance and performance before sharing such innovations with its customers.\n\nAFI KLM E&M has developed several cost-saving projects, along with transformation and restructuring plans to enhance its competitiveness and adapt its organization to the market environment.\n\nIn aircraft maintenance, the implementation of adaptation projects has also continued to reinforce AFI KLM E&M's competitiveness. Cost-saving initiatives have been implemented to optimize activity on a site-by-site basis, strengthen external partnerships and deploy more e/fficient work organizations. All this has been accompanied by efforts to match resources to the level of business activity and build new career paths.\n\nIn the Engines and Components segments, AFI KLM E&M has managed to strengthen its positioning on products and services aligned with market cycles and expectations, and secure its global MRO network.\n\n## Contributing to the Flight Safety and Operational E/fficiency programs\n\nAFI KLM E&M's primary task is to guarantee the airworthiness of the Group's fleet and ensure regulatory compliance. To this end, AFI KLM E&M manages technical data, implements the maintenance policies, and ensures the permanent availability of the required skilled sta/ff and technical resources.\n\n## Aircraft maintenance at the service of airlines\n\n## Line Operations support\n\nAFI KLM E&M continues to market its services to customers in the line maintenance segment and to develop its business in its main bases as well as internationally.\n\n## Light Maintenance operations\n\nWithin the framework of AFI KLM E&M's continuous improvement e/fforts, the Light Maintenance operations, which are mostly executed in Amsterdam, Paris-CDG and Paris-Orly, have continued to implement new processes to further reduce Turn Around Times and increase aircraft utilization, to the benefit of Air/uni00A0France and KLM.\n\nAt the same time, AFI KLM E&M continues its iGO Solutions joint-venture operations by delivering high-performance support to its customers; Transavia for its 737/uni00A0fleet and Air Cara\u00efbes/ French Blue for their A330 and A350 fleets.",

        "page_content": "## Heavy Aircraft Maintenance\n\nHeavy maintenance continues to undergo structural change in a market where prices remain low. A maintenance master plan has thus been implemented, designed to rationalize the aircraft maintenance operations by optimizing activity on a site-by-site basis (Paris-CDG, Amsterdam-Schiphol, Paris-Orly, Toulouse-Blagnac). The Group's new fleet plans will enable this optimization to be continued in the coming years.\n\nAFI KLM E&M has continued its use of external partners to cut maintenance costs for the Group's fleets and obtain, in return, additional work in the high-growth Engine and Components segments.\n\nFrom engineering to maintenance, AFI KLM E&M provides continuous support for the Group's airlines, as well as for an ever-growing number of customers, by defining and deploying new cabin products in both short and medium-haul, and across the long-haul o/ffering.\n\n## Military Product\n\nIn recent years, AFI KLM E&M has been able to secure the operational maintenance of the French AWACS fleet for which it is responsible.\n\n## Component Support: managing a global supply chain\n\nComponent Support covers the repair of a broad technological spectrum of aircraft parts, the management of technical and reliability standards and the management of component shipments to/from customers' operating bases. The top request expressed by the airlines is to gain flexibility and help in managing the uncertainty hanging over the market as best they can. In the short term, this has led to the o/ffer of a large number of made-to-measure solutions, but also to working with operators to think about the post-crisis period and how to get back to the more stable contractual frameworks which are essential in terms of industrializing maintenance operations and achieving optimum performance levels.\n\nIn 2021, AFI KLM E&M unveiled a new MRO service o/ffering for the Airbus A220 and signed a contract with Air Austral for the support of its fleet. Also in 2021, despite the on-going Covid-19 crisis, AFI KLM E&M's o/ffer on latest-generation aircraft attracted the attention of several airlines such as Gulf Air for the A320neo and Corendon for the 737/uni00A0MAX component supports. Meanwhile, existing customers are regularly renewing their confidence in AFI KLM E&M, recognizing its overall added-value and attractiveness. Providing component support on over 3,000/uni00A0aircraft across the globe, AFI KLM E&M is a leader in all the next-generation aircraft segments.\n\n## Engines: managing soaring demand\n\nThe planned renewal of fleets has been somewhat disrupted by the e/ffects of the health crisis. It is accelerating for certain older models such as the Boeing 747, Airbus A340 and A380. The latest generation of aircraft such as the A350, 787 or A320neo are taking o/ff with new e/fficient engines, burning less fuel and emitting significantly less/uni00A0CO2. For engine products (much like other MRO products), the recovery remains di/fficult to anticipate. In 2021, AFI KLM E&M also integrated the Pratt &\n\nWhitney MRO network for the maintenance of the PW1500G engines powering the A220. The Group provides engine support on the following engines:\n\n- -CFM56: the Group's workshops support one of the world's largest fleets of CFM56 engines, handling some 400/uni00A0engines operated by various airlines. AFI KLM E&M is using its Amsterdam engine shop to position itself on the growing need for CFM56-7B support and the Orly engine shop for the CFM56-5/uni00A0support requirements;\n- -CF6-80 : by o/ffering full-service maintenance at its Amsterdam engine shop, AFI KLM E&M is well positioned to support the CF6-80E1 equipping the A330s and the final phase in the life of the CF6-80C2. AFI KLM E&M's long maintenance track record with these engines means that it currently o/ffers the most suitable maintenance solutions;\n- -GE90 : on the strength of its state-of-the-art infrastructure, AFI KLM E&M offers the main alternative to the engine manufacturer for overhauls to this engine. Since 2012, AFI KLM E&M has had a new engine test cell at Paris-CDG. This test facility can test 300/uni00A0engines per year, reducing processing time and o/ffering a more cost-e/ffective service for customers. This test facility, combined with significant expertise and proven experience, has attracted the interest of a growing number of airlines. In 2021, in addition to its infrastructure, AFI KLM E&M continued to build its know-how and can o/ffer customers the benefit of its GE90 operating experience with, for example, On-Site/On-Wing Support enabling remedial as well as preventive actions anywhere in the world. This support can be accompanied by GE90 Engine Monitoring, designed to detect technical problems upstream thereby limiting potential engine damage;\n- -GEnx : At the launch in 2015, AFI KLM E&M was the first non-OEM supplier to carry out Quick Turn checks on this engine. Since 2017, the AFI KLM E&M Zephyr test cell has successfully passed the GEnx correlation test, enabling AFI KLM E&M to also perform engine test runs for its ten GEnx airline customers;\n- -LEAP : Through the EASA/FAA approvals, AFI KLM E&M is able to assist LEAP operators worldwide during the entry into operational service phase. AFI KLM E&M can meet the needs of its customers in carrying out the on-wing/ on-site work on LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B engines. The scope of these interventions is tailored to the requirements of airline operators, and may include activities like: power plant build-up, borescope inspection, and line replaceable unit (LRU) replacement services, amongst many others. AFI KLM E&M has secured an o/ffload agreement with CFMI (GE/ Safran) to perform Quick Turn shop visits on the LEAP-1B (B737MAX) engines they have under contract. AFI KLM E&M is in the process of expanding the range of Quick Turn workscopes it is capable of performing. Furthermore, AFI KLM E&M has a General Service License Agreement with CFMI in place, authorizing it to o/ffer a large array of engine support services in our Engine workshops to support customers that operate Boeing 737 MAX fleets (LEAP-1B) and well as Airbus A320neo fleets (LEAP-1A), although the build-up of in-shop capabilities on the latter engine type is",

As an airline-MRO, AFI KLM E&M will contribute to this target and continue to support the Group in its leading role in sustainability within the aviation industry. AFI KLM E&M has been implementing this strategy for many years in order to reduce the environmental impact of its activities and thus those of its customers.\n\nAFI KLM E&M is analyzing and implementing technologies to reduce this environmental impact wherever possible. This ranges from the eco-responsible design of our infrastructures to the energy savings that this generates for the circular economy such as the recycling of plastics to feed 3D printing.\n\nThe constant adjustment of these processes is part of AFI KLM E&M's DNA. For a very long time AFI KLM E&M has been repairing and maintaining aircraft components, including engine parts, in order to extend their life cycle.\n\nInnovations, such as PROGNOS, the AFI KLM E&M predictive maintenance suite which has been awarded the Solar Impulse label, also have a positive impact in this area. This predictive analysis program is based on harnessing big data technologies to o/ffer an e/ffective and innovative aeronautics maintenance service. The environmental benefits of PROGNOS stem from reducing flight cancellations leading to extra flights to recover grounded passengers, as well as reducing the number of Quick Return Flights (return of the aircraft to its departure airport) following technical alerts, which require fuel tanks to be emptied prior to landing. It also optimizes overall aircraft fuel consumption by monitoring the status of equipment more precisely.\n\n## Key figures\n\nYear\n\n| Maintenance                                    | 2021   | Change          | Change at  constant  currency   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------------|---------------------------------|\n| Total revenues  (in \u20acm)                        | 2,801  | -2,1%           |                                 |\n| Third-party revenues  (in \u20acm)                  | 1,023  | -18.2%          | -14.2%                          |\n| Income/(loss) from current operations  (in \u20acm) | 88     | +631            | +647                            |\n| Operating margin  (%)                          | 3.1%   | +22.1/uni00A0pt | +22.6/uni00A0pt                 |\n\nDuring 2021, external revenues declined by 18.2%. Operating costs were reduced with the lower level of maintenance activity, sta/ff reductions, governmental wage support measures for employees and other cost-savings measures.\n\n## 1.4/emspace FLEET\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group fleet was composed of 536/uni00A0aircraft, of which 505 in operation versus a respective 546 and 513/uni00A0aircraft at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nThe main fleet in operation was composed of 408/uni00A0aircraft (409/uni00A0aircraft at December/uni00A031, 2020). It was divided into 160/uni00A0long-haul aircraft (157/uni00A0at December/uni00A031, 2020), six cargo aircraft (6 at December/uni00A031, 2020) and 242/uni00A0medium-haul aircraft (246/uni00A0at December/uni00A031, 2020), of which 89/uni00A0aircraft in the Transavia Group fleet (79/uni00A0aircraft at December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nThe Maintenance order book was evaluated at US$8.7/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2021, a decrease of US$0.4/uni00A0billion compared to December/uni00A031, 2020, still impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's maintenance activity is well positioned on new-generation aircraft maintenance and foresees solid opportunities in the future.\n\nThe regional fleet in operation was composed of 97/uni00A0aircraft (104/uni00A0aircraft at December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, the average age of the aircraft in the operational fleet was 12.2/uni00A0years, of which 12.2/uni00A0years for the long-haul fleet, 13.4/uni00A0years for the medium-haul fleet, 18.8/uni00A0years for the cargo fleet and 8.9/uni00A0years for the regional fleet. This compared with 12.1/uni00A0years at December/uni00A031, 2020, of which 12.0/uni00A0years for the long-haul fleet, 13.2/uni00A0years for the medium-haul fleet, 17.8/uni00A0years for the cargo fleet and 9.2/uni00A0years for the regional fleet.",

Air/uni00A0France's sizeable order book (25/uni00A0A350s and 54/uni00A0A220s) for the most-environmentally-e/fficient next-generation aircraft will\n\nnotably enable a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and respect of the Group's environmental commitments.\n\nFor its part, KLM welcomed two more new Boeing 777-300ERs into its fleet and retired two A330-200s, two 747-400s and six B737-700s. KLM Cityhopper withdrew one E190 from its fleet and took delivery of its first seven E195-E2s.\n\nOver the longer term, fleet modernization will be reflected in the continued growth of the Boeing 787 and E195-E2 fleets at KLM and those of the A350-900s and A220-300s at Air/uni00A0France. Transavia (France and Netherlands) will see its fleet adapt to the growth market in the leisure segment.\n\nThe Group will continue to invest substantial sums in cabin refurbishment, as is currently the case for its Boeing 777-300ERs, as well as in the satellite on board connectivity proposition, enabling customers to be o/ffered an in-flight WiFi connection in both medium and long-haul.\n\nBy signing, with Airbus in December/uni00A02021, a Letter of Intent for a firm order of 100/uni00A0A320/A321s, to be followed in 2022 by the signature of the final procurement contract, the Group has secured the delivery slots on these new-generation aircraft, destined for KLM, Transavia France and Transavia Netherlands.",

As of the emergence of the Covid-19 virus, Air/uni00A0France implemented exceptional measures, regrouped under the Air/uni00A0France Protect label, to ensure a safe travel experience: the strictest health protocols at every step of the journey, 100% flexible\n\ntickets, insurance cover linked to the pandemic and a dedicated website to verify the conditions for travel. The Air/uni00A0France teams are monitoring the evolving health situation closely and more than ever remain mobilized to continue to welcome customers on board its flights in total safety.\n\n## 1.5.1/emspace Air/uni00A0France Protect, the promise of a safe trip\n\n## Health measures guaranteeing the highest level of safety at every step of the journey: at the airport, on board, on arrival\n\nFor passengers aged 11/uni00A0years or more, wearing a surgical mask is mandatory as of arrival at the airport where numerous measures are in place to guarantee a journey in optimal hygiene conditions.\n\n## At the airport\n\nSpecial signage, announcements and floor markings remind people of the physical distancing measures.\n\nAll the sales, check-in and boarding counters are equipped with plexiglass protective screens. The check-in counters and self-service kiosks are regularly disinfected. Hand sanitizer dispensers are available throughout the customer journey.\n\nAs a function of the public health context, Air/uni00A0France has been able to progressively reopen its lounges by guaranteeing optimal sanitary measures; hand sanitizer and the mandatory wearing of surgical masks. At the height of the crisis the catering o/ffer and some services were also adapted: the o/ffer of individually-portioned and packaged dry snacks was maintained while drinks remained self-service and water fountains were installed. At the bu/ffets, hot and cold products were served on plates by a waiter before self-service was again reintroduced in all our lounges with a change in serving cutlery and regular disinfection of contact points. The Clarins spaces have all reopened with sanitary disinfection between customers. The bar in Terminal 2EL at Paris-Charles de Gaulle and the Children's space remain closed. In addition, a body temperature check may be required on the departure of some Air/uni00A0France flights. Since November/uni00A02020, Paris A\u00e9roport has joined forces with the Cerballiance laboratory to set up two Covid-19 testing centers to carry out RT-PCR and antigenic testing by appointment on departure from Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly airports.\n\n## On board\n\nAir/uni00A0France has reinforced the cleaning of its aircraft prior to every flight. The cabins and all surfaces in contact with customers are scrupulously disinfected, particularly armrests, tablets and entertainment screens. On board and throughout the flight, the wearing of surgical masks remains mandatory. A disinfectant\n\nwipe is o/ffered to customers on boarding the aircraft. Since January/uni00A02021, on long-haul flights, a sanitary kit containing a surgical mask, a disinfectant wipe and hand sanitizer is o/ffered to every customer in all the cabins.\n\nDuring the flight, the air is completely renewed every three minutes. The air recycling system in all Air/uni00A0France aircraft is equipped with HEPA (High E/fficiency Particulate Air) filters, identical to those used in operating theaters, which capture 99.9% of particles.\n\n## On arrival\n\nCrew announcements made on board invite customers to disembark at a steady rate to respect social distancing. Hand sanitizer dispensers are available in the luggage arrival hall, where floor markings and reminders on social distancing are also in place.\n\n## Flexible commercial measures with 100% changeable or refundable tickets until June/uni00A030, 2022\n\nTo enable customers to plan their travel with peace of mind and facilitate their journeys in the event of service disruption, Air/uni00A0 France reminds them that, within the framework of its commercial policy, the airline o/ffers 100% modifiable tickets which are reimbursed at no cost and without documentary proof until the departure date, subject to conditions. Customers may also change their bookings free of charge or obtain a reimbursable voucher if they no longer wish to travel. This commercial policy has been extended owing to the context of public health crisis.\n\n## Insurance to cover the health risk\n\nIn partnership with Allianz Travel, Air/uni00A0France has extended its travel insurance guarantees to give greater protection to customers in the event of epidemics like Covid-19. During their stays, customers benefit from medical assistance and the reimbursement of medical expenses incurred internationally or additional costs in the event of quarantine. Proposed on the purchase of a ticket on the airfrance.com website and at the airline's customer relations centers, in some European countries and soon in other countries, this insurance supplements the existing Cancellation + Missed Flight, Multirisk and Assistance products.",

        "page_content": "## 'Ready to Fly', a pre-departure verification service for travel documentation\n\nLast July, Air/uni00A0France launched 'Ready to Fly', an optional free service enabling customers to confirm that they have all the documents and proof required for their journeys prior to arrival at the airport. Into the bargain: a more serene journey and a more fluid routing process, by avoiding multiple checks on the day of departure. 'Ready To Fly' is now available on more than 143/uni00A0destinations on departure from 89/uni00A0airports in the Air/uni00A0France network.\n\nIn early 2022, for domestic flights, the vaccine pass check is automated and instantaneous. It can be done online or directly on the self-service kiosks on the day of departure.\n\n## A health protocol positively perceived by customers\n\nSince June/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France has used a questionnaire to evaluate customer satisfaction on the hygiene protocols deployed throughout their journeys and on their feelings about their overall travel experience (frustration, anxiety, stress, confidence, enthusiasm). Customers are consulted on the Air/uni00A0France Protect measures and, in 2021, this questionnaire continued to be sent to them. According to the e-score responses to the survey, on November/uni00A026, 2021 (cumulative since January/uni00A01, 2021), 91% of our customers having travelled on board our aircraft (Air/uni00A0France + HOP!) gave an excellent, very good or good score to the health measures implemented by the airline. Over the same period, 50% of customers said that they felt confident on board our aircraft and 25% were enthusiastic or happy. Inversely, 12% of customer polled were unhappy, stressed or anxious (source e-Score Air/uni00A0France).\n\n## 1.5.2/emspace Air/uni00A0France Protect, a health program that has won several awards\n\n## Air/uni00A0France wins the Diamond Award in the Apex Health Safety ranking powered by Simplifying\n\nOn May/uni00A027, 2021, Air/uni00A0France won the Diamond Award, the highest distinction in its category, at the APEX Health Safety powered by Simplifying awards ceremony recognizing airlines for their e/fforts on implementing the strictest health and safety measures. Following a comprehensive audit of the Air/uni00A0France Protect program, regrouping all the airline's health measures, the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) recognized the commitment of Air/uni00A0France which places the health and safety of its customers and sta/ff at the heart of its priorities.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France awarded 5-star Covid-19 safety rating by Skytrax\n\nOn July/uni00A027, 2021, Air/uni00A0France won a 5-star Covid-19 Airline Safety Rating from Skytrax, an international aviation rating agency. Since obtaining a 4-star rating in January/uni00A02021, the company\n\nhas now attained the highest ranking in this global benchmark for certifying Covid-19 air travel health and safety standards. Air/uni00A0 France is the first major European airline to receive this award. Skytrax thus recognizes the e/ffectiveness of the health and hygiene measures implemented by Air/uni00A0France to protect its customers and sta/ff since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, and the improvements undertaken during the first half of 2021.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France wins the prize for Covid Airline Excellence in the Skytrax World Airline awards\n\nOn September/uni00A028, 2021, Air/uni00A0France won the Covid Airline Excellence Award from Skytrax, recognizing the airline's health commitment. This is the third time that Air/uni00A0France has received a distinction from Skytrax for all the measures implemented since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis with first four and then five stars (the maximum score) obtained in the Skytrax Covid Safety Rating for its Air/uni00A0France Protect program.\n\n## 1.5.3/emspace Air/uni00A0France recognized and wins plaudits\n\nAir/uni00A0 France is continuing the move up-market for its products and services. The airline a/ffirms the importance of an attentive customer service between its sta/ff and each of our customers.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France again number one at the 2021 Customer Relation Awards\n\nIn March/uni00A02021, for the sixth year running, Air/uni00A0France won first prize in the Transport category at the Customer Relations Awards organized by BearingPoint and Kantar TNS. These Customer Relations awards are truly the voice of the customer. For each company, the customers surveyed are asked to give their opinion on 15/uni00A0key criteria that structure customer relations. These criteria are examined from three angles: execution, connection and emotion. In a year heavily impacted by the\n\nhealth crisis, the company continued to make a di/fference and to stand out mainly from the emotional point of view (loyalty, surprise e/ffect) as well as from the connection point of view (co-creation, personalization). This excellent performance is also supported by the recognition of our ability to adapt and our customers increased trust:\n\n44% of customers consider that the airline has adapted very well to the health crisis, one of the highest scores across all sectors.\n\nThe trend in the customer trust index has been marked by significant scores with 57% of customers saying they have maintained their trust in the brand and 32% that their trust has increased. Only 12% feel that their trust in the company has declined.",

It also climbed to 10 th /uni00A0p l a c e in the global ranking for the first time, gaining 13/uni00A0places compared to 2019. Air/uni00A0France is the only European airline to figure in the Top 10/uni00A0of this ranking, which includes more than 350/uni00A0airlines and is based on the opinions of more than 13/uni00A0million passengers with over 100/uni00A0nationalities.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France named the leading European airline for its Business class at the World Travel Awards\n\nOn October/uni00A022, 2021 in London, Air/uni00A0France won the 'Europe's Leading Airline' award for its Business Class at the 28 th /uni00A0 World Travel Awards ceremony. Air/uni00A0France was named leading European airline for its Business cabin. These annual awards are a prestigious event that recognizes actors in the travel, tourism and hospitality sectors. The awards, recognized as a mark of excellence within the industry, are based on a wide-ranging vote by customers and tourism industry experts. Over 2/uni00A0million votes were cast for the 2021 awards.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France recognized by TheDesignAir\n\nAir/uni00A0France has been recognized by TheDesignAir Awards, having won the 2021 award for Best New Airport Lounge for its lounge in Terminal 2F at Paris Charles de Gaulle, designed by the Jouin Manku interior design agency.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France recognized for its La Premi\u00e8re lounge\n\nIn early 2022, the La Premi\u00e8re lounge at Paris-Charles de Gaulle was named Best Lounge in the World by One Mile at a Time, a well-known blog on the customer travel experience. The satisfaction scores by touchpoint for the La Premi\u00e8re experience were excellent with an overall level of 83 (NPS) in 2021.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France ranked No.1 for its La Premi\u00e8re in-flight catering\n\nIn March/uni00A02021, Air/uni00A0France was named No.1 in The Points Guy ranking for the catering in its La Premi\u00e8re cabin.\n\nThe Points Guy, a US travel website and blog with independent contributors, evaluated all the first-class catering served on board five airlines to find 'The 5/uni00A0Best First Class Meal in the Sky'. With a score of 25/uni00A0out of 25, Air/uni00A0France was ranked ahead of Japan Airlines, Emirates, Korean Air and British Airways.\n\n## 1.5.4/emspace Air/uni00A0France adapts its services o/ffer\n\nSince the onset of the crisis, Air/uni00A0France has closely monitored the health situation and deployed the protocols required to ensure the well-being and safety of its customers and sta/ff.\n\n## On-board service\n\nTo limit interaction and as a function of the unfolding health situation, the on-board service has been regularly adapted. For example, on the short-haul flights in France and elsewhere in Europe, or towards the United Kingdom, the o/ffer was limited to a glass of water at the height of the crisis. Inversely, the catering o/ffer has been gradually reintroduced in all cabins whenever the situation has improved. Film-wrapped or individually-packaged products are prioritized. Duty free sales and the press o/ffer have been suspended and customers have access to 150/uni00A0press and magazine titles free of charge on ''Air/uni00A0France Play'', to download up to 30/uni00A0hours prior to their flight.\n\n## New catering o/ffer on the short and medium-haul flights\n\nA new on-board product has been o/ffered on the short and medium-haul network since October/uni00A031, 2021. This simplified, complimentary o/ffer is adapted to the new challenges: a di/fficult financial situation, an unprecedented health context, growing competition and new customer expectations focused notably around environmental protection.\n\n- -  A committed product: Frenchness is at the heart of this new product which gives star billing to French gastronomy. The new o/ffer prioritizes an anchorage in quality. The AOC label enables the identification of products whose production phases are realized in a same geographical region, based on recognized know-how. Labelled products sourced from producers who protect the environment, with respect for seasonality and focused on local production. Products selected in close collaboration with the Servair Culinary Studio chefs.\n- - A harmonized and rationalized product: To meet the expectations of our customers, the breakfast service has been extended until 10h00. The division of the flight zones has also been revisited, with a move to 3 zones (compared with 5 previously).\n- -  Since October/uni00A031, 2021, Fran\u00e7ois Adamski, Servair Corporate Chef, Meilleur Ouvrier de France, winner of the Bocuse d'Or and a member of the Servair Culinary Studio, has been signing the Business class menus on Air/uni00A0France medium-haul flights.

        "page_content": "## Return of the La Premi\u00e8re and Business class Michelin-starred-chef menus\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France relaunched the rotation of dishes prepared by leading French chefs for its La Premi\u00e8re and Business cabins. From July to October, for the first time, Air/uni00A0France chose to entrust its entire La Premi\u00e8re menu to the French triple-Michelin-star chef, Arnaud Donckele. Created especially for customers in the airline's most exclusive cabin, his dishes were available on departure from Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport. In collaboration with Servair's Culinary Studio, the chef created an appetizer and seven main dishes for Air/uni00A0France, to be unveiled progressively over the four months. With vegetarian, meat and fish dishes, Arnaud Donckele mixed the subtle flavours of Provence and created a mosaic of tastes and colours, producing a high-flying menu inviting customers on a gourmet journey through the Mediterranean. By teaming up with the renowned chef from the Cheval Blanc St-Tropez and Cheval Blanc Paris, Air/uni00A0France is rea/ffirming its role as an ambassador of fine French dining throughout the world.\n\n## Pre-selection of hot dishes in Business\n\nOn July/uni00A01, 2021, on its Caribbean and India Ocean destinations, Air/uni00A0 France launched the complimentary pre-selection of hot dishes from the four main meal choices o/ffered by the Business cabin menu. Since November/uni00A010, this o/ffer has been extended to customers traveling in the Business cabin on flights from/to North and South America. By discovering and selecting their meal ahead of departure, customers can be sure of being able to enjoy their in-flight dishes of choice. Meal pre-selection is integral to our commitment to o/ffering our customers the greatest possible satisfaction and an overall approach aimed at reducing the company's environmental footprint, notably thanks to a more responsible catering proposition. This enables a reduction in the loading ratio for hot dishes, and thus the weight of the aircraft, along with discards and waste. This o/ffer will be progressively rolled out in Business class on other long-haul flights and will, in time, cover the whole of the Air/uni00A0France long-haul network.\n\n## 1.5.5/emspace Despite the crisis, Air/uni00A0France is maintaining investment for its customers\n\nAir/uni00A0France is investing \u20ac500/uni00A0million over five years (2020-2024) in ongoing cabin refurbishment, the roll-out of on-board connectivity, the renovation of some lounges and a unique new lounge in Terminal 2F.\n\n## Arrival of the Airbus A220-300s in the Air/uni00A0France fleet\n\nOn September/uni00A029, 2021, Air/uni00A0France took delivery of its first Airbus A220-300, the latest jewel in its short and medium-haul network. Following the arrival of the Airbus A350 in its long-haul network, the company is continuing its fleet renewal and, by the end of 2025, will have integrated the 60/uni00A0A220-300s ordered in 2019 to gradually replace its Airbus A318s and A319s as well as several Airbus A320s. This order - the largest from a European customer - includes an additional mix of 30/uni00A0options and 30/uni00A0purchase rights. Since October/uni00A031, 2021, the Airbus A220-300/uni00A0has been flying to Berlin (Germany), Barcelona, Madrid (Spain), Milan-Linate and Venice (Italy) on departure from the Air/uni00A0France hub at Paris-Charles de Gaulle. During the Winter 2021-2022/uni00A0season, the aircraft will progressively extend its network to Bologna, Rome (Italy), Lisbon (Portugal) and Copenhagen (Denmark). A very high-performance aircraft at both financial and environmental level, the Airbus A220-300/uni00A0is perfectly suited to Air/uni00A0France's short and medium-haul network. It provides a cost reduction per seat of 10% compared to the Airbus A318 and A319, and stands out for its energy e/fficiency, consuming 20% less fuel than the aircraft it replaces while its/uni00A0CO2 emissions are also reduced by 20%. Its noise footprint is also 34% lower. These characteristics will play a decisive role in reducing Air/uni00A0France's environmental footprint and achieving its sustainable development objectives. By 2030, the airline will\n\nhave reduced its overall/uni00A0CO2 emissions per passenger/km by 50% compared to 2005, or 15% in absolute terms. Air/uni00A0France is also committed to working with all its stakeholders and the public authorities to achieve the climate target of net zero/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 2050. The Air/uni00A0France Airbus A220-300/uni00A0also o/ffers the highest level of in-flight comfort. It has 148/uni00A0seats, in a 3-2/uni00A0seat configuration (five seats per row) o/ffering 80% of customers a window or aisle seat. It o/ffers two travel cabins, Business and Economy, and access to Air/uni00A0France Connect, the airline's inflight Wi-Fi service. The seat is the widest on the market (48/uni00A0cm), reclines to 118/uni00A0degrees and has an adjustable headrest, leather upholstery and an ergonomic seat cushion for enhanced comfort. A wide solid tray table, cup holder, a pouch for storing magazines and books, individual USB A and C ports and a tablet or smartphone holder integrated into the backrest complete the package. At the end of 2021, Air/uni00A0France numbered six Airbus A220s in its fleet.\n\n## Refurbishment of the cabins in 12/uni00A0Air/uni00A0France Boeing/uni00A0777-300s\n\nIn January/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France unveiled the new travel cabins on board its Boeing 777-300s which are now serving destinations in Guadeloupe, Martinique and Reunion Island. At the end of 2021, 12/uni00A0 refurbished aircraft were brought into revenue service. On board, the aircraft's 472/uni00A0seats - 14/uni00A0full flat in Business, 28/uni00A0fixed shell seats in Premium Economy and 430 in Economy - have been comprehensively redesigned to o/ffer customers the highest standards of comfort, with a soft, warm ambiance in the airline's colors. Early 2022 marked the restart of the refurbishment plans for 12/uni00A0more Boeing 777-300s (those currently equipped with 42/uni00A0seats in the Business cabin).",

        "page_content": "## 12/uni00A0Airbus A350s in the Air/uni00A0France fleet at the end of 2021\n\nAt the end of 2021, Air/uni00A0France numbered 12/uni00A0Airbus A350s in its fleet. The company is thus accelerating its transition to more sustainable air transportation, in keeping with its HORIZON 2030 commitments. As a next-generation aircraft, the A350 uses 25% less fuel than the aircraft of the previous generation (i.e 2.5/uni00A0liters per passenger/100/uni00A0kilometers) thanks, notably, to the incorporation of lighter materials: 67%, with 53% composites and 14% titanium. Its noise footprint is also reduced by 40%. Once settled in one of its 324/uni00A0seats - 34 in Business, 24 in Premium Economy and 266 in the Economy cabin - customers discover a new definition of comfort on board: a spacious and quiet cabin, windows some 30% larger, an optimized air pressure system providing a more comfortable cabin atmosphere with regularly-renewed cabin air and ambient lighting adapted to the di/fferent flight phases. In Business, the seat turns into a real two-meter-long lie-flat bed, guaranteeing restful sleep. In Premium Economy, the new 'Recliner' seat is 48cm wide and reclines to 124\u00b0. In Economy, the seat has been redesigned for even more comfort, with a reinforced ergonomic seat cushion, a 118\u00b0/uni00A0seat recline, as well as 79-cm of leg room. Each cabin features large individual High-Definition touch screens. To stay connected on board the A350, customers have access to the inflight Wi-Fi service Air/uni00A0France CONNECT. Between now and 2025, Air/uni00A0France will receive 38/uni00A0Airbus A350s, thus modernizing its long-haul fleet.\n\n## An adjusted Business o/ffer on the domestic network\n\nWithin a context of crisis, Air/uni00A0France chose to maintain its Business o/ffer on the domestic network to/from its Paris-Charles de Gaulle hub, as well as between the French regions and the Amsterdam-Schiphol hub. On the domestic network to/from Paris-Orly, and between the French regions and internationally (excluding Amsterdam), Air/uni00A0France suspended its Business o/ffer as of January/uni00A011, 2021. This decision was part of the adaptation of the service for the French regions to regain competitiveness for the domestic operations and accelerate sustainability e/fforts with the transfer of Air/uni00A0France domestic routes to Transavia. O/ffering a single cabin on these routes enables more consistency and simplification from both a financial and commercial point of view. The Business product was terminated on internal flights to/ from Orly and between the French regions (Transversal network) as well as on the flights between the French provinces and international destinations (excluding Amsterdam). The Business o/ffer is still proposed on internal flights to/from CDG - excluding flights to/from Corsica - and on the flights between the French provinces and Amsterdam, to preserve a consistent o/ffer for connecting customers in medium or long-haul Business cabins.\n\n## Renewal of the baggage racks on the Airbus A320 (Safran ECOS 'E/fficient Cabin Open Space')\n\nAir/uni00A0France is the first airline in the world to have selected Safran Cabin's ECOS (E/fficient Cabin Open Space) shelf bins to equip its medium-haul Airbus A320s by the end of 2023. The first retrofitted aircraft came into revenue service on July/uni00A013, 2021 and the second on October/uni00A018. On its medium-haul aircraft, Air/uni00A0France continues to improve its customers' travel experience\n\nby o/ffering them more space to stow their cabin baggage. With the new ECOS shelf bins, the stowing of hand baggage is optimized, particularly baggage with wheels, which should have a positive impact on boarding times. It should also reduce the last-minute need to put some cabin baggage in the hold, a source of delays and irritation, for both the crews and customers. Into the bargain, the expected benefits for customers include our punctuality and operations. The ECOS system, the first to o/ffer lateral stowage of baggage with wheels, o/ffers up to 60% more storage capacity than some other options flying today. They consist of new bins, ceilings and infill panels with the cabin, and o/ffer a low shelf height for ease of loading and visibility of contents. The new baggage bins also have doors whose opening has been designed not to encroach on the light in the cabin.\n\n## Ongoing deployment of the Air/uni00A0France Connect WiFi o/ffer across the entire Air/uni00A0France fleet\n\nWith 'Air/uni00A0France CONNECT', customers can remain connected on board thanks to the three WiFi Pass o/ffers available on their personal smart phones, tablets or laptops.\n\nA 'Message' Pass, which is free for everyone, to send and receive text messages throughout the flight: a 'Surf' Pass for between \u20ac3 and \u20ac18/uni00A0to surf the internet, and consult and send emails; and a 'Stream' Pass for between \u20ac10 and \u20ac30/uni00A0to benefit from broadband. At the end of 2021, 90% of the Air/uni00A0France was connected with four suppliers:\n\n- -  Long-haul fleet: Boeing 787: Panasonic/Boeing 777: Intelsat/ Airbus 330: Intelsat/Airbus 350: Inmarsat;\n- -  Short and medium-haul fleet: A320 family (Airbus 318, 319, 320, 321) with Orange/Anuvu/Airbus A220: Intelsat.\n\nWithin this context of health crisis, the deployment schedule for in-flight connectivity has been impacted and the finalization of the deployment of WiFi is ongoing in 2022. The Air/uni00A0France CONNECT product is progressively being enriched and now o/ffers complementary services like a chau/ffeur-driven service with Hertz DriveU and an LEA travel assistant bot to benefit from all the information relating to travel. In terms of connectivity, Air/uni00A0France aims to o/ffer each of its customers the opportunity to remain connected throughout their journeys.\n\n## Paid-for seat choice in Premium Economy\n\nAt the end of 2021, Air/uni00A0France introduced the option to secure a pre-assigned seat by way of a new paid-for option in the Premium Economy cabin on long-haul flights. Like the paid-for seat choice in the Economy cabin, this option enables customers in the Premium Economy cabin to reserve the seat of their choice prior to the opening of check-in, thereby benefiting from a wider choice of seats and the possibility of personalizing their travel experience. The price of this pre-assigned seat option varies depending on the duration of the flight. Amongst others, Flying Blue Platinum, Gold and Silver members, corporate customers (with the exception of bluebiz accounts) and customers with Flex tickets all continue to benefit from free seat pre-selection. This option, launched for sales as of December/uni00A07 and flights from December/uni00A016, 2021. Is available across the entire Air/uni00A0France network, except for North America and Papeete, whose",

Having been closed since April/uni00A06, 2020, the La Premi\u00e8re lounge has been refurbished, investment in improving service delivery to our customers having been maintained despite the health crisis. During this transition phase, La Premi\u00e8re customers had been welcomed to a temporary lounge in the mezzanine of the Business lounge in Hall K of Terminal 2E. Amongst the major innovations, in the relaxation space, two curtained private areas have been created to o/ffer more privacy. On December/uni00A017, 2021, Air/uni00A0France unveiled a new Sisley well-being space at the heart of its La Premi\u00e8re lounge. Air/uni00A0France now o/ffers its customers a new space with beauty treatments by Sisley, the French pioneer in botanical cosmetology. A moment of well-being celebrating the art of travel with a French touch.\n\n## Medium-haul lounge at Paris-Charles de Gaulle\n\nOn August/uni00A019, 2021, Air/uni00A0France unveiled its iconic new lounge designed by Jouin Manku, located in Terminal 2F of Paris-Charles de Gaulle. An invitation to celebrate the best of French-style travel on arrival at the airport or during transit. Dedicated to Business customers and Flying Blue Elite Plus customers travelling on Air/uni00A0France's short- and medium-haul Schengen network, this lounge is one of the airline's largest, with a surface area spanning 3,000/uni00A0sq. m./uni00A0and 570/uni00A0seats spread over two levels. In collaboration with the teams from Paris A\u00e9roport, Air/uni00A0France worked with the Paris-based Jouin Manku design agency, on the concept and design of this lounge. The idea of levitation and grace guided the creative duo, Canadian architect Sanjit Manku and French designer Patrick Jouin, to o/ffer the airline's customers a real moment suspended in time and enjoy total relaxation before they board. Air/uni00A0France's choice to associate itself with this prestigious design team once again illustrates its tradition of working with the best architects and designers of its time.\n\n## Lounge in Orly\n\nThe Schengen lounge at Orly, dedicated to La Navette and short-haul flights, and now located on the mezzanine at Orly 2, opened its doors on September/uni00A01, 2021. Dedicated to Business and Flying Blue Elite Plus customers on the short- and medium-haul network of the Air/uni00A0France Schengen space on departure from Orly, this lounge spans 335/uni00A0m/two.sup o/ffering a capacity of 112/uni00A0seats. Open from 5h30 to 22h, this very luminous space o/ffers numerous services adapted to customers on short-haul flights.\n\n## Lounge in Montreal\n\nOn August/uni00A011, 2021, Air/uni00A0France opened its fully-redesigned lounge at Montreal's Pierre-Elliott Trudeau International Airport. In association with the Plaza Premium Group, the airline now o/ffers its Business and Flying Blue Elite Plus customers a vast, elegant and welcoming space, promoting French-style travel and hospitality. Located in the international section of the terminal, this 490m/two.sup lounge has a seating capacity of 149 and is open every day from 14h00 to 22h00. Since last autumn, this lounge has o/ffered a Night Service space, with a new dedicated catering service in a cosy atmosphere. This o/ffer anticipates the desire for rest of Business customers traveling from Montreal to Paris on the last evening flight, enabling them to enjoy their night on board to the full.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France a member of the Brand Union and FAIRe its responsible communication program\n\nIn view of its commitment to responsible travel, in February/uni00A02021 Air/uni00A0France became a member of the Brand Union's FAIRe program to continue to factor environmental and societal issues into its communication. As a member of the program, Air/uni00A0France adheres to a progress-based approach covering 15/uni00A0commitments and now includes three elements of self-regulation in its advertising with regard to content, the di/ffusion environment and limiting the environmental impact of its advertising. As of 2021, Air/uni00A0France rolled out a number of actions on the responsible drafting of messaging (eliminate gender, sexual and ethnical stereotyping, communicate on Air +Train transport inter-modality, avoid behavior pushing people to travel,/uni00A0etc.) and the eco-socio-design of communication materials (apply recycled paper certifications - FSC ou PEFC, Ecovadis Gold -, contain carbon emissions reduced crews, limited duration - during the filming and shooting of Air/uni00A0France communication, undertake to recycle elements of the d\u00e9cor and/or donate the design to associations and select digital partners who are themselves committed to increasing their environmental responsibility,/uni00A0etc.). A first evaluation of the 15/uni00A0criteria will be published in February/uni00A02022. Beyond this, Air/uni00A0France envisages a powerful advertising initiative to include awareness-raising for all its advertising spokespersons. Its aim is to make clear information available to consumers to guide their choices and actions at the environmental level. Air/uni00A0France is looking into the possibility of including in all its advertising a reference guaranteeing its eco-responsible commitment to supplement the systematic inclusion of all these initiatives towards even more responsible communication.",

The entire o/ffer is now available in digital form via the Air/uni00A0France Play application, which o/ffers access to some 100/uni00A0magazines, 60/uni00A0international titles (newspapers and magazines) and 13/uni00A0regional publications (newspapers and magazines). As a bonus, significant savings for Air/uni00A0France. By concentrating on a digital o/ffer, Air/uni00A0France is thus supporting the new consumption modes of its customers who prioritize the digital experience while guaranteeing them an optimal level of service. The same is true for the distribution of the 'Air/uni00A0France Magazine' and 'Air/uni00A0France Madame'. The new Air/uni00A0France editorial o/ffer will be unveiled during the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France joins forces with Reworld Media and Michelin to create and develop its new editorial o/ffer\n\nFollowing a call to tender launched by Air/uni00A0France in March/uni00A02021, Reworld Media and Michelin Editions were chosen to design and implement the company's new innovative and multi-channel (print, digital, audiovisual) editorial o/ffer. Reworld Media will coordinate the production of editorial content, the development of the various media and the advertising management of this new o/ffer. Air/uni00A0France will draw on their expertise, particularly in terms of technological innovation, digital, brand magazines and the marketing of advertising space.\n\nMichelin, a key player in the fields of gastronomy, travel and the art of living, will contribute its world-renowned know-how. Its subsidiary Michelin Editions will produce all the travel-related content in the new o/ffer. The two partners will support Air/uni00A0France in the implementation of this new platform of inspiring and informative content in order to feed the desire for escapes and to accompany travellers throughout their journeys, on the ground as well as in flight.\n\nThe collaboration with Air/uni00A0France began on November/uni00A010, 2021 and the new formula will be unveiled in early 2022. By renewing its editorial o/ffer, Air/uni00A0France is pursuing its transformation plan to continue to attract new customers and gain in e/fficiency and synergies, while guaranteeing the best quality of content.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France unveils its new flight safety film\n\nSince March/uni00A01, 2021, on its long-haul flights, Air/uni00A0France has been showing its new film on flight safety. A veritable distillation of French culture, full of life and movement, this film aims to be emblematic of the Air/uni00A0France brand. It is a musical promenade through the most iconic places in France, a travel invitation to the whole world in which the airline declares its love for France and the French art of living. From the Op\u00e9ra Garnier to the French-style gardens of the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles, from the sunny landscapes of the C\u00f4te d'Azur to the mythical H\u00f4tel Martinez via the Provence vineyards and along the banks of the Seine, the walk finishes on top of the emblematic and scintillating Ei/ffel Tower where an Air/uni00A0France crew pays tribute to the airline's customers. The company developed this film with the creative talent of the Aura by Omnicom communications\n\nagency in partnership with Atout France, the French tourism development agency.\n\n## Inter-modality: Air/uni00A0France and SNCF reinforce their partnership and expand the Train + Air product\n\nFor more than 25/uni00A0years, Air/uni00A0France and SNCF have o/ffered their customers a service enabling train and aircraft journeys to be combined in a single booking.\n\nKnown as Train + Air, this service is used every year by more than 160,000/uni00A0customers to/from Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly airports.\n\nSince December/uni00A03, 2020, the Train + Air product has been proposed by Air/uni00A0France between the station of Bordeaux Saint-Jean and Paris-Orly airport enabling a connection to all the Air/uni00A0France network on departure from the Paris airport, and notably to destinations in the French overseas territories (Cayenne, Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre, Fort-de-France, Saint-Denis de La R\u00e9union).\n\nCustomers travel by train from Bordeaux to Massy TGV station, before being transferred to Paris-Orly by a taxi service.\n\nFive daily departures are assured on departure from Bordeaux Saint-Jean and four on departure from Massy TGV, at times enabling rapid connections.\n\nSince July/uni00A019, 2021, seven additional services have been added by Air/uni00A0France and SNCF. Customer can reserve a Train + Air combined journey:\n\n- -  between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Aix-en-Provence TGV, Bordeaux Saint-Jean, Marseille Saint-Charles and Montpellier Saint-Roch;\n- -  between Paris-Orly (via the Massy TGV station) and Valence TGV, Avignon TGV, Marseille Saint-Charles.\n\nThis extension to the network increases the number of train stations proposed by Air/uni00A0France to 18, within the framework of the Train + Air service: Aix-en-Provence TGV, Angers Saint-Laud, Avignon TGV, Bordeaux Saint-Jean, Champagne-Ardenne TGV, Le Mans, Lille Europe, Lorraine TGV, Lyon Part-Dieu, Marseille Saint-Charles, Montpellier Saint-Roch, Nantes, N\u00eemes, Poitiers, Rennes, Saint-Pierre-des-Corps, Strasbourg and Valence TGV.\n\nThanks to Train + Air, customers have a single booking for their whole journey and a guaranteed seat on the next available flight or TGV INOUI service, at no extra cost, in the event of a delay to the train or aircraft. Within the framework of the Flying Blue frequent flyer program, they also earn Miles on the rail journey. Furthermore, Air/uni00A0France customers traveling in the La Premi\u00e8re or Business cabins also travel in first class on board the SNCF trains.\n\nTo simplify this combined Train + Air journey even further, Air/uni00A0 France and SNCF are trialing a new fully-digital customer experience, on departure from/arrival at the stations of Lille Europe and Strasbourg, and connecting with an Air/uni00A0France flight via the Paris-Charles de Gaulle or Paris-Orly airports. Customers can thus check in online at airfrance.fr prior to departure for the whole of their journey, including the journey by train, and thus no longer need to retrieve their tickets in the station on the day",

If this trial proves conclusive, this service will be deployed on all the Train + Air journeys during 2022.\n\n## Towards a more responsible o/ffer\n\nAfter flight safety and reassurance on health, our customers' third level of expectation relates to the sustainable development commitments. These days customers are ready to pay more for tickets from an airline which is taking real steps in terms of the ecological transition, something which was not the case a few years ago. At the heart of the customer experience, the o/ffer proposed to our customers must be more respectful of the environment and responsible. To this end, our actions turn around three priority areas: responsible catering, combating waste and reducing the utilization of single use plastics. Concretely, Air/uni00A0France promotes fair consumption by:\n\n- -  eliminating single use plastics. By the end of 2022, Air/uni00A0France will have  eliminated 90% of single use plastic (relative to 2018);\n- -  reducing waste and fine-tuning its on-board o/ffer. Thanks to the rigorous management of inventories and the development of the pre-flight main meal pre-selection service in the long-haul business cabin launched last July, the teams can fine-tune customer demand and guarantee the respect of\n\ntheir choice. This also contributes to reducing the weight of products carried on board the aircraft and thus reducing its fuel consumption;\n\n- -  encouraging the reuse and recycling of our items. Since October/uni00A01, 2019, Air/uni00A0France has been sorting on-board waste. The sorting, realized on all the short, medium and long-haul flights bound for Paris, concerns plastic bottles, juice cartons and aluminum cans;\n- -  using bio-sourced materials whenever possible. For example, plastic stirrers have been replaced by wood versions.\n- The comfort kit offered on board the aircraft since December/uni00A02021 respects our eco-responsible approach in that, for the first time, it is composed of 93% recycled material. Its plastic packaging has now been replaced by an integrity seal. The same is true for its contents whose components are now wrapped in Kraft paper to avoid plastic materials;\n- -  prioritizing local products and respecting seasonality.\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France o/ffered hot dishes with the A or B Nutri-score in the Economy and Premium Economy cabins. The goal for 2022 is to continue these improvements aimed at eco-responsible catering based on Frenchness and balance.",

They also determine the powers of each of the advisory Committees established within the Board.\n\nThe last update to the Internal Rules took place on March/uni00A012, 2019. It concerned the missions of the newly-created Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee and the changes to the AFEP-MEDEF Code having taken place in June/uni00A02018.\n\nThe Internal Rules of the Board of Directors are available on the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM website at http://www.airfranceklm.com (Governance section).\n\nOn June/uni00A017, 2004, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors adopted a set of Internal Rules based on the corporate governance principles established by the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n## 2.2.2/emspace Separation of the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nDuring its meeting of May/uni00A015, 2018, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors decided to separate the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer. This decision followed Mr. Jean-Marc Janaillac stepping down as Chair and Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, and the implementation of a transitional governance to, notably, enable the Chair of the Board of Directors to focus on the e/ffective functioning of the Board and on the search for candidates for the position of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\nOn August/uni00A016, 2018, the Board of Directors confirmed the separation of the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer within the framework of the implementation of the long-term governance with the appointment of Mr. Benjamin Smith as the new Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. The Board of Directors considered that this was the best governance option for the Company at this stage in its development in that it enables the Company to benefit from a new dynamic with a Chair of the Board of Directors who is dedicated to governance matters and a Chief Executive O/fficer with recognized expertise in the air transport industry, who is focused on the Group's operations. The complementarity of their profiles and roles optimizes the Group's governance and ensures a balanced and respectful division of their respective missions. It also enables\n\nthe e/ffective coordination of the Board of Directors thanks to the presence of a Chair of the Board of Directors who is exclusively devoted to its functioning and guarantees a more e/ffective separation between the control and management functions.\n\nOn May/uni00A026, 2021, the Shareholders' Meeting adopted a resolution setting the age limit for the Chair of the Board of Directors at 72/uni00A0years (previously 70/uni00A0years), when the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer are separate, and as applied by a number of French listed companies. Pursuant to the provisions of the Air/uni00A0France-KLN Articles of Incorporation and the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors, the role and attributions of the Chair remain unchanged. The Board of Directors also decided that Ms./uni00A0Anne-Marie Couderc would fulfil her functions as Chair of the Board of Directors until the Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the 2022 financial year. Within the context of the unprecedented public health crisis currently being traversed by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, the Board of Directors stressed the importance of stabilizing the Group's governance and thus creating the most favorable conditions for the management to concentrate its e/fforts on the operational management and the exit from crisis.",

The criteria and objectives of this policy set out below take into account the results of the evaluation of the Board of Directors as well as the skills matrix of its Board directors (see below).\n\n## Selection criteria for Board directors\n\nIn the context of the appointment and re-appointment of Board directors, and to preserve the balance of its composition, the Board of Directors gives preference to the following selection criteria:\n\n- -  openness to the world, international professional experience and the diversity of nationalities: Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM was created through the merger of two companies of di/fferent nationalities with global reach leading to numerous international challenges;\n- -  General Management experience acquired within major French and foreign international companies; the Group numbers around 71,000/uni00A0employees across three main businesses: the Network business (Passenger and Cargo transportation), the Maintenance business and the low-cost-flight passenger transportation business, operating in 116/uni00A0countries;\n- -  knowledge and experience of the transportation and airline sectors, as well as of tourism; these are the businesses in which the Group is primarily active;\n- -  the Board of Directors also ensures that expertise related to the Group's strategic priorities is represented within the Board, particularly in the areas of brand strategy, digital and customer relations, human resources, and social and environmental responsibility (CSR).\n\n## Implementation of the diversity policy\n\nIn implementing this diversity policy, the Board has set itself clear objectives:\n\n- -  maintain the balance between the Company's various stakeholders and the balanced representation of men and women;\n- -  prioritize the independence of spirit of the Board directors;\n- -  promote adherence to the Group's fundamental values;\n- -  ensure the availability of the Board directors.\n\nIn connection with this policy, the following changes to the composition of the Board of Directors took place in 2021:\n\n## Consolidation of air transportation industry expertise\n\nThe Board of Directors welcomed Ms./uni00A0Gwena\u00eblle Avice-Huet as a new independent Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021. Ms./uni00A0Gwena\u00eblle Avice-Huet replaced Ms./uni00A0Maryse Aulagnon, whose mandate expired at the end of the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021. She notably brings to the Board her expertise in sustainable development.\n\nDelta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. was re-appointed as a Board director. The Board welcomed Mr. Alain Bellemare as the new permanent representative of Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. as of February/uni00A016, 2021, who brings to the Board his experience of air transportation, the aerospace sector, and company management and transformation.\n\nMs./uni00A0Boeren, Ms./uni00A0Bouillot and Ms./uni00A0Idrac were also re-appointed as independent Board directors, as was Mr. Wang in his capacity as Board director appointed as proposed by China Eastern Airlines. They continue to contribute to the Board their expertise in a number of di/fferent areas: General Management, air transportation, governance, public a/ffairs, finance, human resources, CSR and digital.\n\nLastly, on December/uni00A03, 2021, Mr. Terence Tilgenkamp, appointed by the European Works Council on October/uni00A05, 2021 as the successor to Mr. Mathi Bouts who had retired, took up his functions as a Board director representing the employees. Mr. Tilgenkamp enables the Board to benefit from his expertise in air transportation and employee relations, and his knowledge of airline operations.\n\n## Balance of nationalities and international openness\n\nThe arrival in the Board of Directors of Mr. Bellemare, a Canadian and US national, and Mr. Tilgenkamp a Dutch national, and the re-appointment of Ms./uni00A0Boeren, an Independent director and a Dutch national, enables the Board to consolidate the diversity of its nationalities. Five directors within the Board, Ms./uni00A0Boeren and Mssrs Tilgenkamp, 't Hart, Wynaendts and van den Berg, are Dutch nationals. Mr. Wang, a Board director appointed as proposed by China Eastern Airlines, is a Chinese national. Lastly, Mr. Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer and a Board director of the Company, holds dual Canadian and British citizenship.\n\nThe Board of Directors thus numbers six di/fferent nationalities and eight non-French Board directors (a Canadian-British Board director, five Dutch Board directors, a Canadian-US Board director and a Chinese Board director), i.e. a proportion of 42%. These Board directors bring to the Board of Directors an in-depth knowledge of their respective markets.\n\n## A balance favorable to the exercize of the missions of each Committee\n\nIn addition, by applying criteria like the balanced representation of men and women, professional qualifications and experience, and nationality, the Board of Directors ensures that there is a balance conducive to the fulfilment of the individual Committees' duties.",

Ms./uni00A0 Boeren and Mr. Wynaendts have no special interest (significant shareholder, employee, other) in the Company or its Group. Ms./uni00A0Boeren and Mr. Wynaendts have been independent directors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM since, respectively, May/uni00A02017 (first appointed as a Board director) and May/uni00A02020 (re-appointment date following a first appointment as a Board director in May/uni00A02016).\n- -  the other non-independent Board directors are:\n- -  a representative of the French State appointed by ministerial order: Mr.Vial;\n- -  Board directors appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State: Mr. Comolli and Ms./uni00A0Panosyan;\n- -  a Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the Dutch State: Mr. Dirk Jan van den Berg/thinspace (2) ;\n- -  Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc./thinspace (3) , whose permanent representative is Mr. Bellemare; and\n- -  a Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by China Eastern Airlines: Mr. Wang/thinspace (4) ;\n- -  representatives of the employee shareholders: Mr. Farges and Mr. Robardet;\n- -  representatives of the employees: Mr. Belabbas and Mr. Tilgenkamp; and\n- -  executive o/fficers of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group: Mr. Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Board director of Air/uni00A0France, and Mr. 't Hart, Chair of the KLM Supervisory Board.\n\nGiven the above, and pursuant to the provision of the AFEPMEDEF Code by which Board directors representing employee shareholders and Board directors representing the employees are not counted in the calculation of the percentages of independent shareholders within the Board of Directors and its Committees (\u00a79.3 and 15.1/uni00A0of the AFEP-MEDEF Code), the percentages of independent directors as of December/uni00A031, 2021 are:\n\n- -  47% in the Board of Directors;\n- -  80% in the Audit Committee (chaired by an Independent director);\n- -  67% in the Appointments and Governance Committee (chaired by an Independent director);\n- -  60% in the Remuneration Committee (chaired by an Independent director);\n- -  40% in the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee (chaired by an Independent director).\n\nThe proportion of independent directors at December/uni00A031, 2021 is therefore 47%, i.e. below the 50% threshold recommended by the AFEP-MEDEF Code for non-controlled companies.\n\nThis divergence is due to an exceptional situation linked to the Dutch government's acquisition of a shareholding in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in February/uni00A02019. In e/ffect, on March/uni00A025, 2019, the Board of Directors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM considered, based on a report from the Appointments and Governance Committee, that in view of the Dutch State's acquisition of a shareholding in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM on February/uni00A026, 2019, Mr. de Hoop Sche/ffer, a Board director appointed as proposed by the Dutch State, could no longer qualify as an Independent director as of that date. On May/uni00A026, 2020, Mr. van den Berg was appointed as a Board director of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the Dutch State, replacing Mr. de Hoop Sche/ffer whose term of o/ffice was expiring. Mr. van dan Berg is not an independent Board director.\n\nThe discussions initiated in 2019 on the composition of the Board of Directors have continued between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the French State and the Dutch State but no decision has been taken at this stage. The issues around these discussions have changed following the impact of the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, the impact of the measures to reinforce Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's equity and quasi equity which were realized in April/uni00A02021 and those which will, in principle, be implemented in the near future will, if necessary, will need to be taken into account in the change to the composition of the Board of Directors. This situation is thus temporary.",

On their appointment, they are also sent a dossier including, notably, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation, the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors, the Universal Registration Document, the latest press releases issued by the company and a reminder of the stock market compliance rules.\n\nOn their appointment and during their terms of o/ffice, every Board director (including the Board directors representing the employees and the employee shareholders) can benefit from the training that they deem necessary for the exercise of their mandate. This training is proposed and organized by the Company.\n\nThis training, which is paid for by the Company, is mostly carried out via a program designed by a professional body, supplemented by in-house training o/ffered by the Company, and is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the functioning of the Board of Directors and their roles as Board directors. Accounting and financing modules are also proposed to enable them to improve their financial know-how. A portion of this training time is carried out within the Company. Pursuant to the applicable regulation, during its meeting of March/uni00A016, 2022, the Board of Directors decided to establish and update the training program in French and English o/ffered to the Board directors representing the employee shareholders and the employees.",

Every year, the Company sends the Board directors a questionnaire enabling confirmation that there are no conflicts of interest and the Company to be informed of any potential conflicts.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, none of the Board members are related and there are no conflicts of interest between the duties of the Board members with regard to the Company and their private interests and other duties.\n\nWith the exception of the agreements listed below, there are no arrangements or agreements between the main shareholders, customers, suppliers or other parties, in accordance with which a member of the Board of Directors has been selected:\n\n- (i) the agreements signed on October/uni00A016, 2003 between Air/uni00A0France, KLM and the Dutch government pursuant to which four Board directors are appointed to the Board of Directors as proposed by KLM and the Dutch government (see section/uni00A02.2.3 'Rules applicable to the appointment and replacement of members of the Board of Directors'); and\n- (ii) the agreements signed on July/uni00A027, 2017 between, firstly, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and, secondly, between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines pursuant to which Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Mr. Wang were appointed to the Board of Directors (see section/uni00A02.8.4 'Reinforcement of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines').\n\nFurthermore, pursuant to the provisions of Ordinance No. 2014-948/uni00A0of August/uni00A020, 2014 concerning the governance and transactions involving the share capital of public sector companies and the application decree-law No. 2014-949/uni00A0of August/uni00A020, 2014, a Board director representing the French State is appointed by ministerial order and two Board directors are appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State. In addition, pursuant to Articles L./uni00A0225-23 and L./uni00A022-10.5/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce (French Code of Commerce), L./uni00A06411-9/uni00A0of the Code des Transports (French Transport Code) and 17.2/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation, as proposed by the employee (and former employee) shareholders referred to in Article L./uni00A0225-102/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, two Board directors representing the employee and former-employee shareholders are appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting. Lastly, in that the Board of Directors is composed of more than eight\n\ndirectors, two Board directors representing the employees have seats on the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A022-10-7/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce and Article 17-3/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation (see section/uni00A02.2.3 'Rules applicable to the appointment and replacement of members of the Board of Directors').\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, there were no service level contracts binding any member of the Board of Directors to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or to one of its subsidiaries and foreseeing the granting of benefits under the terms of the contract.\n\nWith the exception of Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. (see the Subscription Agreement signed on July/uni00A027, 2017 and detailed in section/uni00A02.8.4 'Reinforcement of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines'), the Board directors have accepted no restrictions concerning the sale of their shareholdings in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, subject to respect of the rules relating to the prevention of insider trading and the statutory obligation to own at least ten shares in the Company during their terms of o/ffice/thinspace (1) .\n\n## Stock market and ethical compliance\n\nThe Compliance Rules, adopted by the Board of Directors on March/uni00A025, 2004, and as amended on November/uni00A017, 2017, remind notably company officers, senior executives of the Company, anyone with close personal ties with the latter and certain employees with access to inside information that, owing to their positions within Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, they are required to refrain from trading in the Company's shares for a minimum of (i)/uni00A0thirty calendar days prior to the publication of the full annual and half-year financial statements and (ii)/uni00A0a minimum of fifteen calendar days prior to the publication of the full quarterly financial statements, the day of their publication being included in these periods. They also reiterate the specific obligations (particularly relating to access to inside information) applying to senior executives, Board directors and anyone with access to inside information relating to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM concerning the use of this information and their trading in the shares of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM pursuant to the applicable laws and regulations relating to market abuse.\n\nIn the past five years, to the Company's knowledge, no Board director has been the subject of a fraud conviction or o/fficial public sanction by the statutory or regulatory authorities, associated with a bankruptcy, sequestration of goods or a placing of a company under administrative receivership nor has, lastly, been prevented by a court from acting as a member of a management or supervisory body of an issuer or from involvement in managing the business of an issuer. This information is confirmed every year via a questionnaire sent to the Board directors.",

The issue of Deeply Subordinated Notes is outlined in section/uni00A02.8.2. 'Securities conferring entitlement to shares'; and\n- -  on April/uni00A020, 2021, an amendment to the Shareholder Loan entered into between the Company and the French State on May/uni00A06, 2020, to modify certain provisions of the Shareholder Loan, in order to allow the repayment of the Shareholder Loan by way of conversion into deeply subordinated notes issued by the Company.\n\nMs./uni00A0Astrid Panosyan and Mr. Jean-Dominique Comolli, Board directors appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State and Mr. Martin Vial, Board director representing the French State appointed by ministerial decree, were deemed to be indirectly interested in the conclusion of the Agreements owing to the fact that the French State held 14.3% of the Company's share capital at the date of conclusion of the Agreements.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the signature of the Agreements at its meeting on April/uni00A05, 2021. Ms./uni00A0Astrid Panosyan, Mr. Jean-Dominique Comolli and Mr. Martin Vial did not take part in the deliberations or vote relating to the authorization of the Agreements.\n\nThe Subscription Commitment from the French State to the Capital Increase and the Deeply Subordinated Notes Subscription Agreement were entered into to allow the Group to strengthen its equity in the context of the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe capital increase referred to in the Subscription Commitment from the French State to the Capital Increase will thus improve the Group's equity by up to \u20ac1/uni00A0billion under IFRS and French GAAP accounting standards, and provide the Group with the same amount of cash for the benefit of Air/uni00A0France.\n\nIn addition, the issuance of the Deeply Subordinated Notes being the subject of the Deeply Subordinated Notes Subscription Agreement will improve the Group's equity by \u20ac3/uni00A0billion under IFRS accounting standards, without impacting cash-flow, while increasing the Group's flexibility in its mandatory repayment profile spread over time (with a Non-call period ranging from four to six years). The Amendment to the Shareholder Loan allows the repayment of the Shareholder's Loan by way of conversion into Deeply Subordinated Notes.\n\nThe public health crisis having considerably impacted the Company's business, its financial situation would not have allowed a sustained recovery of its activity. Consequently, the conclusion of these Agreements appeared necessary for the Company's long-term future.\n\nAssuming that the Company does not make use of the option to defer payment of interest at its discretion, the financial expenses incurred by the Company over the first twelve/thinspace (12) month period should amount to approximately \u20ac217.5/uni00A0million in respect of the Deeply Subordinated Notes.\n\n## Expansion of the cooperation agreement entered into between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and China Eastern Airlines\n\nIn the context of the Group's recapitalization plan announced on April/uni00A06, 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM entered into an agreement with China Eastern Airlines on June/uni00A023, 2021 to accelerate their e/fforts to deepen and broaden existing and future cooperation, and further strengthen their partnership for transportation services between China and Europe (the 'CEA Commercial Agreement').\n\nThe CEA Commercial Agreement sets out the ambitions for the expansion of the cooperation between China Eastern Airlines, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air/uni00A0France and Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V.

These ambitions shall be further elaborated and subsequently be separately implemented in the joint-venture agreement between the parties for passenger air transport between Europe and China.\n\nJian Wang, a Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by China Eastern Air Holding Co., Ltd., was deemed to be indirectly interested in the conclusion of the CEA Commercial Agreement, as China Eastern Airlines held 8.8% of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share capital as of the date of approval of the CEA Commercial Agreement by the Board of Directors.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Board of Directors authorized the execution of the CEA Commercial Agreement at its meeting of April/uni00A05, 2021. Mr. Jian Wang did not take part in the deliberations or vote with respect to the authorization of the CEA Commercial Agreement.\n\nThe legally-binding CEA Commercial Agreement sets out the ambitions for the future cooperation and does not automatically a/ffect or amend the terms of the existing exclusive joint-venture agreement in place between the parties for passenger air transportation between Europe and China. These ambitions shall be further elaborated and subsequently be separately implemented in the exclusive joint-venture agreement existing between the parties for passenger air transportation between Europe and China. It is thus too early to assess or determine the impact of the CEA Commercial Agreement for the Company.\n\n## Extension of the maturity date of the State Guaranteed Loan and financial conditions\n\nOn December/uni00A010, 2021, after approval by the European Commission, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM concluded, with the consortium of banks and the French State, an amendment to the State Guaranteed Loan of May/uni00A06, 2020 (the 'Amendment to the State Guaranteed Loan').\n\nAs a result of the French State holding 28.6% of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's share capital, Ms./uni00A0Astrid Panosyan and Mr. Jean-Dominique Comolli, Board directors of the Company appointed by the\n\nShareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State, and Mr. Martin Vial, Board Director of the Company representing the French State and appointed by ministerial decree, were deemed to be indirectly interested in the Amendment of the State Guaranteed Loan.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Board of Directors of Company authorized the execution of the Amendment of the State Guaranteed Loan Agreements at its meeting of October/uni00A011, 2021. Ms./uni00A0Astrid Panosyan, Mr. Jean-Dominique Comolli and Mr. Martin Vial did not take part in the deliberations and vote with respect to the Amendment of the State Guaranteed Loan.\n\nThis Amendment was concluded to allow the Company to smooth its repayment profile over time and thus balance the Group's consolidated debt maturity schedule.\n\nThe financial expenses incurred by the Company over the first twelve/thinspace (12) month period, should amount to approximately \u20ac120/uni00A0million in respect of the State Guaranteed Loan.\n\n## Agreements and commitments authorized and signed in previous financial years\n\n## Finalization of a Framework Agreement between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, KLM and the Dutch State\n\nOn August/uni00A07, 2020, within the framework of the financial support package granted by the Dutch State to KLM, a subsidiary of Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM entered into a Framework Agreement with KLM and the Dutch State, a shareholder in the Company with 14% of its share capital.\n\nOn June/uni00A025, 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a financing package for KLM in the total amount of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion, backed by the Dutch State, composed of two loans for KLM and its subsidiaries:\n\n- - a revolving credit facility in the amount of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion, granted to KLM by eleven banks and up to 90% guaranteed by the Dutch State; and\n- - a direct loan in the amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, granted by the Dutch State to KLM, with subordination to the revolving credit facility.\n\nThis financial support package aims to enable KLM to overcome the current crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic and to prepare for the future. A number of conditions were associated with the loan from the Dutch State. These conditions were the subject of a Framework Agreement entered into between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, KLM and the Dutch State foreseeing, notably, commitments made by the airline in terms of becoming more sustainable and the restored performance and competitiveness of KLM, including a comprehensive restructuring plan and a contribution made by employees. KLM has undertaken to suspend dividend payments to its shareholders until these two loans have been repaid in full. Mr. Dirk Jan van den Berg, a Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the Dutch State, and Mr. Cees 't Hart and Mr. Benjamin Smith, both being Board directors in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and KLM, were deemed to be indirectly interested by the signature of the Framework Agreement given, in particular (i)/uni00A0the Dutch State's 14% shareholding in the Company, (ii)/uni00A0the ownership by the Company of the majority",

Pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the signature of the Framework Agreement during its meeting of June/uni00A025, 2020. Mr. Dirk Jan van den Berg, Mr. Cees 't Hart and Mr. Benjamin Smith did not take part in the deliberation or the vote relating to the Framework Agreement.\n\nThe Framework Agreement was finalized within the framework of the financial support package granted by the Dutch State to KLM, aimed at enabling KLM, a subsidiary of the Company, to meet its urgent need for cash following the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. This financing should enable KLM to weather the current Covid-19 crisis and prepare for the future.\n\nIn that this crisis has considerably impacted KLM's activity, in the current state of a/ffairs, its financial situation would not have enabled a sustainable recovery in activity. The finalization of the financing and the Framework Agreement thus appeared necessary for KLM's long-term future. By covering, notably, KLM's general financial needs and foreseeing various economic, social and environmental measures, it will enable a viable recovery in activity.\n\nThe Framework Agreement constitutes a key element in the Dutch State's financial support package for KLM in the total amount of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion.\n\nAmendment to the financial settlement mechanism for the joint-ventures entered into with (i)/uni00A0Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., and (ii)/uni00A0China Eastern Airlines (the 'Joint-Venture Agreements') within the context of the Covid-19 public health crisis\n\nOn December/uni00A04, 2020, pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors authorized:\n\n- 1) the amendment of the provisions relating to the financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues and costs generated by the joint-venture) in the Blue Skies joint-venture agreement (entered into on May/uni00A015, 2018 and amended in October/uni00A02019), for the calendar year 2020. In this respect, each party waives all rights it may have with respect to the amounts due to it under the joint-venture agreement for the calendar year 2020, and agrees to waive them permanently. This waiver avoids the uncertain and potentially material financial exposure for either party given the context linked to the public health crisis. This waiver may be extended into 2021 by mutual agreement between the parties, based on the duration of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the joint-venture operations; and\n- 2) the suspension of the provisions relating to the financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues generated by the joint-venture) in the joint-venture agreement entered into with China Eastern Airlines on November/uni00A026, 2018. In this respect, each party agrees to waive all payments under the joint-venture agreement as of February/uni00A01, 2020 for a period to be mutually agreed between the parties depending on the duration of the e/ffects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the joint-venture. This waiver avoids uncertain and potentially\n\nmaterial financial exposure for each party given the context linked to the public health crisis.\n\nThe other provisions of the joint-venture agreements remain unchanged.\n\nIn that Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. is a Board director and shareholder in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines is a shareholder of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and has a representative, Mr. Jian Wang, on the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors, the supplementary clauses in the aforementioned joint-venture agreements enter into the application scope of the regulated agreements procedure referred to in Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. As of December/uni00A031, 2020, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines held more than 10% of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM voting rights.\n\nOwing to the rapidly-changing health measures and regulations linked to the Covid-19 public health crisis, and to the highly uncertain environment, the parties wish to avoid unlimited financial exposure within the framework of the existing joint-venture agreements and thus decided to suspend the financial settlement provisions in the aforementioned two joint-venture agreements during the public health crisis period.\n\nGiven the amendment to the financial settlement mechanism foreseen in the joint-venture agreements, there has been no need to calculate the impact that would have resulted from the application of these provisions.\n\nFor more information concerning the agreements between, firstly, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic and, secondly, between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines, see section/uni00A02.8.4 'Reinforcement of the strategic partnerships between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines'.\n\n## Transatlantic partnership between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic\n\nOn October/uni00A030, 2019, the Board of Directors mandated the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM management to finalize the discussions and negotiate amendments to the agreements authorized during the Board meetings of March/uni00A014 and May/uni00A015, 2018 (see section/uni00A02.8.4 'Reinforcement of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines'), so as not to proceed with the planned acquisition by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM of a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic Limited. This decision resulted in the amendment of the following agreements:\n\n- 1) termination of the Share Purchase Agreement ('SPA') between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance/uni00A0SAS and Virgin Investments Limited, enabling Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, through its 100%-owned subsidiary Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance/uni00A0SAS, to acquire a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic, and termination of agreements ancillary to the SPA;\n- 2) amendment and updating of the Joint Venture Agreement between Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc., Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, KLM and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air/uni00A0France, aimed at the implementation of a commercial joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc., Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited, Air/uni00A0France and KLM (signed on January/uni00A030, 2020 and",

Any agreement, entered into directly or through an intermediary between, notably, the company and one of its Board directors, whether the latter has a direct or indirect interest, is subject to the prior authorization of the Board of Directors. Agreements between the company and another company are also subject to prior authorization by the Board of Directors if one of the Board directors of the company is an owner, an unlimited liability partner, a manager, a Board director, a member of the Supervisory Board or, in general, a director of this other company. The termination, amendment or waiving of regulated agreements must follow the same procedure as their signature, which begins with prior approval by the Board of Directors.\n\nFor more information on the July/uni00A02017 agreements between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic, see section/uni00A02.8.4 'Reinforcement of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines'.\n\n## Commitments relating to the severance payment to the benefit of Mr. Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM\n\nOn August/uni00A016, 2018, pursuant to the provisions of the former Article L./uni00A0225-42-1/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce (repealed by Ordinance No.2019-1234 of November/uni00A027, 2019), the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors authorized the granting of a severance payment to the benefit of Mr. Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, in some instances of forced termination and, namely, dismissal, non-renewal of his mandate as Chief Executive O/fficer or forced resignation linked to a change of control.\n\nIt is stipulated that the instances of forced termination enabling the implementation of this severance payment exclude any situation of serious misconduct on the part of the Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the basis of the severance payment is equivalent to two years of his annual fixed and variable compensation (according to specific calculation modalities based, as applicable, on the target variable compensation in the event of a termination during the first 24/uni00A0months).\n\nA coe/fficient (between 0 and 100% inclusive) will be applied to the basis of the severance payment based on the achieved performance criteria relating to the annual variable component of his compensation over the two last financial years of his mandate (or since his appointment, in the event of termination during the first 24/uni00A0months). The Board will assess the achievement of these performance criteria.\n\nFor more information, see section/uni00A02.5.2 'Compensation of the company o/fficers in 2021'.\n\nThere were no agreements or commitments authorized and signed over the course of previous financial years whose execution continued during the last financial year.\n\n## Procedure for the qualification and regular evaluation of the current agreements signed in normal conditions\n\nDuring its meeting of December/uni00A011, 2019, as recommended by the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors established a procedure enabling the qualification and regular evaluation of the agreements relating to current operations entered into under normal terms and conditions pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A022-10-12/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. The current and normal nature of an agreement is evaluated on a case-by-case basis during the signature, renewal or amendment of the said agreement, on the basis of objective criteria defined in the procedure.\n\nWithin the framework of this annual evaluation procedure, the Company:\n\n- - draws up an inventory of all the agreements referred to in Article L./uni00A022-10-12/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce;\n- - reviews all the elements and documents having enabled the qualification of the agreements; and\n- - as necessary, reviews the qualification of any agreements with interested parties (regulated agreement or free agreement, depending on the case).\n\nPersons with an interest in one of these agreements, entered into either directly or through an intermediary, do not participate in their evaluation.\n\nA presentation on the result of the inventory of the agreements referred to in Article L./uni00A022-10-12/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, in respect of the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2021, was made to the Audit Committee on February/uni00A015, 2022 and was reviewed by the Board of Directoirs in the context of the corporate governance report.",

To inform this discussion, a formalized evaluation is conducted via a questionnaire. This evaluation is steered by the Appointments and Governance Committee. It may also be entrusted to an independent external consultant.\n\nConcerning 2021, the Board of Directors realized an evaluation in the form of a questionnaire submitted to each Board director. The following topics were addressed through the evaluation questionnaire:\n\n- -  the composition, organization, functioning and dynamic of the Board of Directors and its Committees;\n- -  the relationship between the Board of Directors and the General Management;\n- -  the e/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors and its Committees;\n- -  the articulation of the work of the Board of Directors with that of the Group's two main subsidiaries: Air/uni00A0France and KLM;\n- -  the individual contributions of the Board directors to the Board's work and the areas of expertise to be developed within the Board;\n- -  the main changes and areas requiring improvement.\n\nThe results of the evaluation were handled under the seal of anonymity and gave rise to a presentation and discussion during the Board of Directors meeting of March/uni00A016, 2022.\n\nIn 2021, the Board of Directors continued to be strongly mobilized around the consequences of the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic in view of the prolongation of the impacts of this crisis on the Group and on the resulting work on the recapitalization and refinancing measures for the Group. To respect the health measures, the Board directors could opt to participate either remotely or physically attend the meetings of the Board and its Committees. The Board directors continued to demonstrate a high degree of commitment during the 2021 financial year.\n\nAs a general rule, the Board directors considered that the functioning of the Board of Directors had improved during 2021 since the previous evaluation. The evaluation revealed the following positive points:\n\n- -  a high level of mobilization amongst the Board directors and internal teams enabling, notably, the continued adaptations linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group's recapitalization and refinancing measures, and those linked to the Group's major strategic developments;\n- -  the improved structuring of the tasks between the Board and its Committees enabling the topics to be e/ffectively addressed;\n- -  the composition, structure and work of the advisory Committees in response to the Board's needs;\n- -  the organization of the Board meetings ensuring a high-quality debate between the Board directors.\n\nThe results of the 2021 evaluation enabled the identification of a number of areas for improvement to be monitored during 2022, notably:\n\n- -  more concise presentation of the oral information presented to the Board;\n- -  resume more regular contact between the Board directors and the members of the General Management and Operational Divisions;\n- -  reposition the induction and training program for Board directors at its rate of prior to the public health crisis;\n- -  increase the time devoted to questions relating to the strategy, governance and digital and digital technologies;\n- -  continue to open the Board of Directors to other nationalities and competencies (notably around digital and digital technologies);\n- -  further improve the formalization of the follow-up process for decisions taken by the Board of Directors.",

Boeren, Paul Farges, Isabelle Parize, Fran\u00e7ois Robardet and Martin Vial.\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee benefit from financial and accounting competencies enabling them to exercise their functions.\n\nAt its meeting of November/uni00A09, 2011, the Board of Directors adopted the position whereby, pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0823-19/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Company's Audit Committee includes at least one independent member with specific financing and accounting skills. On July/uni00A01, 2021, the Board of Directors decided to appoint Ms./uni00A0Bouillot as Chair of the Audit Committee, in that she has the academic background and professional experience to fulfill this requirement for specific financial competence, and she has no relationships with the company, its Group or management that are such as to color her judgment. The six other Committee members also have financial and/or accounting skills.\n\nThe principal executives responsible for accounting, legal a/ffairs, finance, internal control and Internal Audit of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also attend meetings in an advisory capacity.\n\nThe Statutory Auditors attended all the meetings of the Audit Committee. At the request of the Chair of the Committee and pursuant to Article 16.3/uni00A0of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, they were able to consult with Committee members outside the presence of the Group's senior executives on the occasion of the review of the annual financial statements.\n\n## Missions\n\nThe Audit Committee's principal missions are to review the interim and annual consolidated financial statements to inform the Board of Directors of their content, ensure that they are reliable and exhaustive, and that the information they contain, including the forward-looking information provided to shareholders and the market, meets high standards of quality. The Committee also oversees the auditing of the annual financial statements. In particular, the Audit Committee reviews the:\n\n- - consolidation scope;\n- - relevance and consistency of the accounting methods used to draw up the financial statements;\n- - principal estimates made by the General Management of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM;\n- - principal financial risks with the General Management of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and the material off-balance-sheet commitments;\n- - comments and recommendations made by the Statutory Auditors and, if applicable, any significant adjustments resulting from audits.\n\nAs necessary, the Audit Committee formulates recommendations to guarantee the integrity of the process to establish the financial information.\n\nThe Audit Committee monitors the e/ffectiveness of the Internal Control and risk management procedures and, as necessary, Internal Audit, in terms of the processes relating to the establishment and treatment of the accounting and financial information, with no compromise to its independence. In this capacity, it reviews in particular the program and results of Internal Audit to ensure, notably, that, in the event of any malfunctioning, the appropriate action plans and follow-up monitoring have been implemented. The Committee discusses with the Statutory Auditors and reviews their conclusions on the half-year and annual financial statements. It also pays particular attention to the audit points identified by the Statutory Auditors and ensures compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements for financial and accounting information.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for steering the procedure to select the Statutory Auditors. It submits a recommendation to the Board of Directors when their appointment or re-appointment by the Shareholders' Meeting is envisaged pursuant to Article L./uni00A0823-3-1/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. It proposes the selection procedure to the Board of Directors and, in particular, whether a call to tender is appropriate. It verifies the independence and quality of the Statutory Auditors' work, examines issues relating to their amount of fees for the execution of statutory audit assignments, reviews and approves the fees submitted by each of the Statutory Auditors on an annual basis and ascertains that the joint system of Statutory Auditors is e/ffective.\n\nThe Committee also follows the realization by the Statutory Auditors of their assignment and notes the comments and conclusions of the Audit O/ffice Control Board (Haut Conseil du Commissariat aux Comptes) following the verification carried",

The duration of the meetings averaged two hours and thirty minutes.\n\nThe following matters were notably reviewed by the Audit Committee during the 2021 financial year:\n\n## -Review of the financial statements\n\nThe Committee reviewed the quarterly, half-year and annual financial statements, and the budget, prior to their presentation to the Board of Directors. It conducted a detailed examination of the Statutory Auditors' summary reports on the half-year and annual financial statements as well as the significant points noted in audits. The main accounting options adopted were the subject of a special presentation every quarter. In 2021, particular attention was paid, for example, to the impact of the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, the bond issues, a capital increase,\n\nthe implementation of an EMTN program and the extension in maturity of the loan guaranteed by the French State.\n\nThe review of the financial statements by the Audit Committee usually takes place the day before their review by the Board of Directors.\n\n## -Review and monitoring of the budget\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the budget prior to its presentation to the Board of Directors and oversees its tracking on a quarterly basis. This year the Audit Committee examined the major points in the 2022 budget prior to the review of the detailed budget.\n\n## -Internal control, risk management and Internal Audit\n\nDuring the Audit Committee meetings, Internal Audit gave a presentation on its half-year activity report.\n\nThe Company applies high standards of financial disclosure and corporate governance, and maintains a rigorous level of internal control across the Group.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviewed the summary sheet of the main operational and/or strategic risks on a half-yearly basis. The Committee also reviewed the financial risks (fuel and emission quotas, currency exchange rates, financing). It also reviewed and approved the process for reviewing the extra-financial risks. These extra-financial risks are submitted by Internal Audit to the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee whose comments are taken into account in the presentations on risks made to the Audit Committee.\n\n## -Statutory Auditors\n\nThe Audit Committee approved the budget for the Statutory Auditors' fees prior to the opening of the financial year together with their final amount as of the closing date. The Committee also addressed the matter of the appointment or re-appointment of the Statutory Auditors within the framework of the term of their mandates and in application of the requirement to organize a call to tender on the appointment of a new Statutory Auditor (Article 16/uni00A0of Regulation (EU) No.537/2014 of April/uni00A016, 2014).\n\nIn addition, owing to the forthcoming expiry of Deloitte's mandate at the end of the 2022 Shareholders' Meeting, a call to tender was launched during the 2021 financial year. Within this framework, the Audit Committee examined several candidates and formulated a recommendation for the Board of Directors on the choice of a new Statutory Auditor.\n\n## -Approval of non-audit services\n\nTo execute this mission, the Audit Committee relies on an internal procedure deployed within the Group in 2004 and updated in 2016, pursuant to the provisions of Ordinance No. 2016-315/uni00A0of March/uni00A017, 2016 relating to Statutory Auditors, which came into force on June/uni00A017, 2016.\n\nAs foreseen by its annual work schedule, the Audit Committee also reviewed the following matters in 2021:\n\n- - tracking of the cash and financing situation;\n- - review of the financing and capex plan;\n- - review of the principal litigation, fiscal risks and financial risks;\n- - financial transactions, recapitalization and refinancing operations including, notably, a capital increase, the",

Following the report from the Appointments and Governance Committee, on March/uni00A025, 2019 the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors considered that, in view of the Dutch State's acquisition of a shareholding in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM on February/uni00A026, 2019, Mr. Jaap de Hoop Sche/ffer, a Board director appointed as proposed by the Dutch State, could no longer be considered an independent Board director as of that same date.\n\nOn May/uni00A026, 2020, as proposed by the Dutch State, Mr. Dirk Jan van den Berg was appointed as a Board director of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM by the Shareholders' Meeting, replacing Mr. de Hoop Sche/ffer, whose mandate was expiring. Mr. van den Berg is not an independent Board director.\n\nThe discussions opened in 2019 on the composition of the Board of Directors have continued between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and the French and Dutch States but no decisions have been taken at this stage. The issues around these discussions have changed following the impact of the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, the impact of the measures to reinforce Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's equity and quasi equity realized in April/uni00A02021 and those which will, in principle, be put in place in the near future may, if necessary, also need to be taken into account in the changes to the composition of the Board of Directors. This situation is thus temporary.\n\n## Presence of an employee director within the Remuneration Committee\n\nIt (the Remuneration Committee) must not include any executive o/fficer and must be composed of a majority of independent directors. It is recommended that the chairman of the committee be independent and that an employee director be a member.'\n\n(paragraph 18.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code)\n\nA director representing the employee shareholders was appointed as a member of the Remuneration Committee from March 2014 in application of good governance practices. The Board of Directors takes note of the recommendation to appoint a Board director representing the employees to this Committee and will examine this issue during the 2022 financial year.",

The Company's Board of Directors thus establishes a compensation policy which complies with the Company's corporate interest (int\u00e9r\u00eat social), is aligned with its commercial strategy, and which contributes to its long-term sustainability. It outlines all the components of the fixed and variable compensation for the Company o/fficers, and explains the decision-making process followed for its establishment, revision and implementation. This compensation policy is the subject of a draft resolution submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting, under the conditions provided for in Article L./uni00A022-10-32/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, on an annual basis and on any significant amendment to the compensation policy.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Articles L./uni00A022-10-9 and L./uni00A022-10-34/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Shareholders' Meeting must also approve on an annual basis, firstly, the information referred to in Article L./uni00A022-10-9, including notably the total compensation and benefits of any kind paid to all the Company o/fficers in respect of their mandates during the previous financial year or granted in respect of their mandates for the same financial year and, secondly, the total compensation and benefits of any kind paid during the previous financial year or granted for the same financial year to each executive o/fficer.\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022 is thus convened to approve:\n\n- -  the information relating to the compensation for each of the Company o/fficers, pursuant to Articles L./uni00A022-10-9 and L./uni00A022-10-34/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. This information is presented hereinafter in section/uni00A02.5.2 ('Compensation of the Company o/fficers in 2021'); and\n- -  the fixed and variable elements composing the total compensation and benefits of any kind paid during the 2021 financial year or granted in respect of this financial year to Ms./uni00A0Anne-Marie Couderc, Chair of the Board of Directors and to Mr. Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer, pursuant to Article L./uni00A022-10-34/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. This information is presented hereinafter in section/uni00A02.5.2.2 ('Elements of compensation paid or granted during the 2021 financial year to the executive o/fficers and submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022'); and\n- -  the compensation policy for the Company o/fficers in respect of 2022, i.e. the members of the Board of Directors, the Chair\n\nof the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive O/fficer of the Company, as established by the Board of Directors, pursuant to Article L./uni00A022-10-8/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. This policy is set forth hereinafter in section/uni00A02.5.3 ('Compensation policy for the Company o/fficers in respect of 2022').\n\nIt is specified that, pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A022-10-8/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, to avoid becoming null and void, no element of compensation, of any kind whatsoever, may be established, granted or paid by the Company, nor any commitment made corresponding to elements of compensation, indemnities or benefits due or potentially due on taking up, stepping down or by reason of a change in their duties or following their exercize, unless it complies with the approved compensation policy or, in its absence, with past compensation or practices.\n\nFurthermore, if the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022 does not approve the draft resolution referred to in Article L./uni00A022-10-34, I of the Code de Commerce, the Board of Directors must submit a revised compensation policy, taking into account the shareholders' vote, for approval by the next Shareholders' Meeting. In such a situation, the payment of the sum allocated to the Board directors for the 2022 financial year shall be suspended until approval of the revised compensation policy. Once reinstated, it shall include the arrears incurred since the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022.\n\nIn addition, the elements of variable or extraordinary compensation granted to the Chief Executive O/fficer in respect of the 2021 financial year may only be paid after approval, by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022, of these elements of compensation under the conditions provided for in the first paragraph of Article L./uni00A022-10-34, II of the Code de Commerce.\n\nLastly, pursuant to the European Commission's decision of April/uni00A05, 2021 on case No./uni00A0SA.59913/uni00A0relating to the recapitalization of Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, until such time as at least 75% of the recapitalization measures has been repaid, the compensation of the Chair of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive O/fficer and the members of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors may not exceed the fixed portion of their respective compensation at December/uni00A031, 2019 (it being stipulated that, if an individual has become or becomes Chair of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive O/fficer or a member of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors after the recapitalization, the applicable compensation is capped at the level of the fixed compensation received by the individual fulfilling the same level of responsibility at December/uni00A031, 2019) and no bonuses or other elements of variable or comparable compensation may be paid.",

Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors has taken into account the vote of the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021 on the compensation for the executive o/fficers in respect of the 2020 financial year to determine the 2022 compensation policy for the Company o/fficers.\n\nEstablished by the Board of Directors, as recommended by the Remuneration Committee and consistent with the

The work of the Remuneration Committee takes into account the examination of benchmarking studies carried out with the help of external consultants to compare this policy with the practices in comparable companies. The Committee also ensures that the compensation policy is aligned with the Company's strategy. On the basis of this work, the Committee formulates recommendations for the Board which then sets the compensation policy on an annual basis. The Remuneration Committee also formulates recommendations for the Board regarding its implementation.\n\nAs recommended by the Remuneration Committee, during the establishment of the compensation policy for company o/fficers, the Board of Directors takes into account the remuneration and employment conditions of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's employees. As for all the employees of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the Board of Directors ensures the implementation of a simple, understandable and consistent compensation policy in a fair manner. The Board of Directors takes particular care that, at their individual level, all the employees and company o/fficers have the material resources required for the fulfilment of their respective duties.\n\nThe internal regulations of the Board of Directors stipulate that any Board director in a situation of conflict of interests, even potential, must inform the Board of Directors and abstain from participating in the debate or vote for the corresponding deliberation. The executive o/fficers are not present during the discussions of the Board of Directors and the Remuneration Committee regarding their own compensation.\n\nShould a new Chair of the Board of Directors or a new Chief Executive O/fficer be appointed, the elements of compensation foreseen in the compensation policy for company o/fficers would also apply to them. As recommended by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors will then determine, while adapting them to the situation of the interested parties, the targets, levels of performance, parameters, structure and maximum percentages relative to their annual fixed compensation which may not be higher than those approved by the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe 2022 compensation policy for the Company o/fficers outlines all the components of the fixed and, as necessary, variable compensation for Board directors (section/uni00A02.5.3.1/uni00A0hereinafter); the Chair of the Board of Directors (section/uni00A02.5.3.2/uni00A0a. hereinafter); and the Chief Executive O/fficer (section/uni00A02.5.3.2/uni00A0b. hereinafter), and explains the decision-making process for its establishment, review and implementation.\n\nThis 2022 compensation policy for the Company o/fficers will the subject of a draft resolution submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022 under the conditions\n\nprovided for in Article L./uni00A022-10-8/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce and on any material amendment to the compensation policy.\n\n## 2.5.3.1/emspace Compensation for the Board directors in respect of 2022\n\nSubject to approval of the 2022 compensation policy for the Company o/fficers by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022, the members of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors will receive, in respect of their Board directors' mandates, compensation (formerly directors' fees) amounting to a maximum which was set at \u20ac950,000 for the entire Board of Directors.\n\nThe compensation for Board directors shall be composed of a flat-rate amount of compensation, with an additional portion calculated as a function of their respective attendance records, whose modalities for distribution and granting are set by the Board of Directors, as proposed by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThese allocation rules have been unchanged since the Board of Directors' resolution of February/uni00A019, 2014, and are as follows:\n\n- -  \u20ac15,000 in flat-rate compensation;\n- -  \u20ac25,000/uni00A0of compensation based on their individual attendance records at meetings of the Board of Directors and at Shareholders' Meetings; and\n- -  a sum of additional compensation is also granted to non-resident Board directors (\u20ac7,000).\n\nAt its meeting of December/uni00A011, 2019, the Board of Directors also resolved that a portion of Board director compensation, in respect of their duties within the Committees, shall be based on their individual attendance records;\n\n- -  for the Audit Committee:\n- -  the Chair will receive flat-rate compensation of \u20ac4,500/uni00A0plus a maximum of \u20ac7,500/uni00A0based on their attendance record at Committee meetings, and\n- -  the members will each receive flat-rate compensation of \u20ac3,000/uni00A0plus a maximum of \u20ac5,000 as a variable portion based on their respective attendance records at Committee meetings;\n- -  for the other Committees:\n- -  the Chair will receive flat-rate compensation of \u20ac3,000/uni00A0plus a maximum of \u20ac4,500/uni00A0based on their individual attendance records at Committee meetings, and\n- -  the members will receive flat-rate compensation of \u20ac2,000/uni00A0plus a maximum of \u20ac3,000/uni00A0based on their individual attendance records at Committee meetings.\n\nIt is specified that, relative to the allocation policy voted in 2014, the introduction of an amount of compensation based on attendance in respect of functions exercized within the Committees (i)/uni00A0does not change the total budget granted for the duties exercized within Committees as either member or Chair, and (ii)/uni00A0has been set based on the same proportions as the attendance-record-based compensation defined for meetings of the Board of Directors.",

His Board director mandate was submitted for ratification by the shareholders during the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A028, 2019 then renewed during this same Shareholders' Meeting for a four-year term of o/ffice, i.e. until the end of the Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the financial year ending December/uni00A031, 2022. The term of his mandate as Chief Executive O/fficer is five years. The Chief Executive O/fficer may, however, be dismissed at any time by the Board of Directors. Mr. Benjamin Smith has no employment contract with the Company or any other company within the Group.\n\nNote that, given the adoption of the new Group governance during 2018, and in view of the profile and international experience of Mr. Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as of September/uni00A017, 2018, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors considered it necessary to modify the framework for the compensation of the Group's Chief Executive O/fficer which had been approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A015, 2018 and which had de facto become inapplicable.\n\nWithin this context, the Board of Directors had reviewed the compensation practices for similar functions at competitor airline companies internationally and taken into account the compensation paid to Mr. Benjamin Smith in respect of his duties at Air Canada, as well as his residency of Canada which required him to relocate to France.\n\nIt is specified that, to determine the elements of compensation for the Chief Executive O/fficer, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors referred to a sample of compensation in place in comparable international groups.\n\nThe structure of the compensation set by the Board of Directors in August/uni00A02018 remained unchanged for the 2019 to 2021 financial years. It is also within this framework that the compensation policy has been set for 2022.\n\nDuring its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2022, as proposed by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors defined the compensation structure for the Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in respect of the 2022 financial year.\n\nThe performance criteria linked to the variable compensation within the framework of the 2022 compensation were set pursuant to the Board resolutions of February/uni00A016, 2022.\n\nIt is specified that, as recommended by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors will be able to use its judgement in determining any variable compensation for the Chief Executive O/fficer. As a result, the Board of Directors will be able to determine the terms of the variable compensation for the Chief Executive O/fficer (i)/uni00A0consistent with (a) the performance achieved by the Group and the Group's financial situation at the end of the financial year, (b) the compensation policy applied to the Group's employees, and (c) the protection of the Group's interests and those of its shareholders, and (ii)/uni00A0in compliance with the restrictions on corporate o/fficers' remuneration as set forth in the European Commission's decision of April/uni00A05, 2021 on case No./uni00A0SA.59913/uni00A0relating to the recapitalization of Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM under the Temporary Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy in the current Covid-19 outbreak. Discussions are currently ongoing between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and the European Commission regarding the restrictions on corporate o/fficers' remuneration, and the remuneration policy of the Chief Executive O/fficer, as regards his variable remuneration, could change based on the outcome of these discussions.\n\nNote however that, pursuant to the European Commission's decision of April/uni00A05, 2021 on case No./uni00A0SA.59913/uni00A0relating to the recapitalization of Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, no variable compensation may be paid to the Chief Executive O/fficer until such time as at least 75% of the recapitalization measures has been repaid.",

The payment of the performance units is also subject to a three-year presence condition, except in the event of death or disability (without performance conditions), or retirement departure or in some cases of forced termination (the performance conditions remaining applicable). It is specified that one performance unit will confer the right to one Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share.\n\nThe number of performance units granted each year is calculated with reference to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM opening share price on April/uni00A01/uni00A0 of the grant year. The payment of these performance units (subject to performance and presence conditions) is made in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares (one performance unit conferring the right to one share).

Payment of these performance units (subject to performance and presence conditions) will be made in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares (one performance unit conferring the right to one share).\n\nIt is stipulated that the Chief Executive O/fficer has not used and has given a formal undertaking not to use risk hedging transations within the framework of this plan until payment of the performance units.\n\n## d) 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 long-term incentive plans\n\nIn 2022, the Chief Executive O/fficer will continue to benefit from the specific long-term incentive plans granted in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, with an option to defer payment of these performance units for a maximum of three years (already exercized for the 2018 and 2019 plans).\n\n## e) Severance payment and benefits in kind\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer will continue to benefit from the severance payment granted by the Board of Directors in its meeting of August/uni00A016, 2018, as approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A028, 2019.\n\nDuring its meeting of August/uni00A016, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the granting to the Chief Executive O/fficer of a severance payment in some instances of forced termination, including dismissal, non-renewal of his mandate as Chief Executive Officer or resignation following a change of control (other than in relation to a gross misconduct). It is specified that the\n\n## 2.6/emspace CEO  COMMITTEE\n\nThe CEO Committee is chaired by Mr. Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive Officer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, and has three other members reporting directly to Mr. Smith:\n\n- - Ms./uni00A0Anne Rigail, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France;\n- - Mr. Pieter Elbers, President and Chief Executive O/fficer of KLM; and\n- -  Mr.  Steven Zaat, Chief Financial O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as of July/uni00A01, 2021. Mr. Steven Zaat succeeded Mr. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gagey, Chief Financial Officer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM until June/uni00A030, 2021. Mr. Gagey stepped down from his position and retired as of July/uni00A01, 2021.\n\ninstance of forced termination enabling the implementation of this severance pay excludes any situation of serious misconduct on the part of the Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the basis of the severance payment is equivalent to two years of his annual fixed and variable compensation (based on specific calculation methods referring, as applicable, to the target variable in the event of a termination during the first 24/uni00A0months).\n\nA coe/fficient (between 0 and 100% inclusive) will be applied to the basis of the severance payment based on the performance of the interested party with reference to the level of the achievement of the performance criteria relating to the annual variable component of his compensation over the two last financial years of his mandate (or since his appointment, in the event of termination during the first 24/uni00A0months). The Board of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM will be responsible for evaluating the achievement of these performance criteria.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer will also benefit from the usual benefits in kind (chau/ffeur-driven company car, supplementary pension scheme benefiting all Group employees, supplementary health insurance and disability coverage, provision of free airline tickets, Group CEO civil liability insurance - D&O) and benefits consistent with policies applied within the Group for senior manager expatriation and mobility.\n\n## f) Other\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer will not benefit from an employment contract, nor from a top-up pension scheme, non-compete indemnity, stock options or free shares.\n\nAt its meeting of February/uni00A019, 2019, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors appointed Ms./uni00A0Anne Rigail and Mr. Pieter Elbers as Deputy Chief Executive O/fficers of the Group.\n\nOn January/uni00A012, 2022, the Board of Directors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM approved the decision of the Supervisory Board of KLM, taken in close consultation with Mr. Pieter Elbers, President of the Management Board and Chief Executive O/fficer of KLM, that Mr. Elbers will not serve a third term. This will allow the KLM Supervisory Board to start the process of identifying a successor for Pieter Elbers in due course.\n\nThe CEO Committee is responsible for defining the strategic direction of all of the Group's airlines and operational entities.",

Furthermore, medium-term targets of a minimum of 33% women within the Group Executive\n\nCommittee by 2030 and 40% women within the top 10% of the positions with the highest level of responsibility also by 2030 have been set by the Board of Directors. Concretely, in the event of the recruitment and/or appointment of new members, and candidates with equal skills, expertise and management qualities, preference is given to female candidates. An action plan has been deployed to accelerate the taking into account of female profiles at all levels of management. During its meeting of March/uni00A016, 2022, the Board of Directors was informed of the results achieved during the 2021 financial year. This information is detailed in section/uni00A04.2.4 'Diversity, equity and inclusion'.\n\n## 2.8/emspace SHARE CAPITAL AND SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE\n\n## 2.8.1/emspace Share  capital\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share capital comprised 642,634,034/uni00A0fully paid-up shares with a nominal value of one euro, held in registered or bearer form according to shareholder preference.\n\nUntil April/uni00A02, 2016, each share had one voting right attached. In application of the Florange Act/thinspace (1) as from April/uni00A03, 2016, in the\n\nabsence of a provision to the contrary in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation, all fully paid-up shares held in registered form in the name of the same shareholder for at least two years automatically benefit from a double voting right. There are no other specific rights attached to the shares.\n\n## Changes in the share capital over the last three financial years\n\nThe change in the share capital over the last three financial years is as follows:\n\n| Financial year ended     | Amount of capital   (in \u20ac)   | Number of shares   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|\n| December/uni00A031, 2019 | 428,634,035                  | 428,634,035        |\n| December/uni00A031, 2020 | 428,634,035                  | 428,634,035        |\n| December/uni00A031, 2021 | 642,634,034/thinspace (2)    | 642,634,034        |\n\nOn April/uni00A06, 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group announced a series of capital-strengthening measures, in the amount of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion, composed of (i)/uni00A0a capital increase without preferential subscription rights for shareholders by way of a public o/ffering and with a priority subscription period for shareholders and (ii)/uni00A0an issue of Deeply Subordinated Notes in several tranches, fully subscribed by way of debt compensation by the French State. These measures were authorized by the European Commission on April/uni00A05, 2021, as State Aid.\n\nIn this context, on April/uni00A013, 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced the launch of a capital increase without shareholders' preferential subscription rights by way of a public offering and with a priority subscription period for shareholders, for a gross amount (including issue premium) of \u20ac900,660,867.04/uni00A0which could, in the event of the exercise in full of the increase option,\n\nbe increased to a maximum gross amount (including issue premium) of \u20ac1,035,759,995.16. The capital increase, decided in accordance with the nineteenth resolution of the Company's Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2020, was the subject of a prospectus approved by the Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers on April/uni00A013, 2021 under number 21-0270. The subscription period for the capital increase closed on April/uni00A016, 2021.\n\nOn 20/uni00A0April/uni00A02021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced the final results of the capital increase, i.e. 213,999,999/uni00A0new shares issued at a unit price of \u20ac4.84/uni00A0euros, i.e. a total of around \u20ac1,036/uni00A0million (after exercise in full of the increase option). The settlement-delivery of the newly-issued shares took place on April/uni00A023, 2021.\n\nIn this context, to give the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group the flexibility and agility required to implement additional capital-strengthening",

envisaged, a number of financial resolutions were adopted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021 (resolutions 20/uni00A0to 35).\n\nThese authorizations enable the Board of

The settlement and delivery of the Tender O/ffer and the New Notes took place on January/uni00A016, 2020.\n\nThese transactions are part of the ongoing dynamic management of the Group's balance sheet structure. The issuance of the New Notes, combined with the Tender O/ffer, contribute to reducing the overall cost of the Group's debt and extending its maturity profile.\n\n## Issue of deeply subordinated notes in three \u20ac1/uni00A0billion tranches, for a total of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion\n\nWithin the framework of its recapitalization plan announced on April/uni00A012, 2021 and realized on April/uni00A019, 2021 in the amount of \u20ac1,036/uni00A0billion, on April/uni00A020, 2021 the Company issued a series of\n\nundated deeply subordinated notes (accounted for under IFRS equity in the Company's consolidated financial statements) for an amount of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion, fully subscribed by the French State by way of set-o/ff on claims it holds on the Company pursuant to the Shareholder Loan (the 'Shareholder Loan') granted in May/uni00A02020 and fully drawn for an amount of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion (the 'Deeply Subordinated Notes').\n\nThis issue is composed of three tranches with a perpetual maturity and a nominal amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion each, with respective redemption options (call) at 4, 5 and 6/uni00A0years, then repayable on every interest payment date, and bearing interest at an initial rate of 7.00%, 7.25% and 7.50% respectively until these dates.\n\nThese initial interest rates for each tranche will increase for each to 8.50%, 8.00% and 8.00%, respectively, on the first respective early redemption date and at the option of the Company, of the relevant tranche. These interest rates will then be revised every year from April/uni00A020, 2028, based on the 12-month Euribor rate plus a margin of 10.40%, it being specified that the applicable 12-month Euribor rate will not be less than -0.45%. The Company will have the option to defer the payment of interest at its discretion, in whole or in part. Deferred interest on the Deeply Subordinated Notes will be accrued and capitalized.\n\nThe payment of interest will nevertheless become compulsory in the event of, for example, the payment of a dividend or the redemption of equity securities, subject to certain customary exceptions.\n\nThese Deeply Subordinated Notes may be converted by way of set-o/ff in the context of future issues of quasi-equity securities or capital increases. In the event of: (i)/uni00A0a third party, acting alone or in concert, holding more than 30% of the share capital of the Company; (ii)/uni00A0non-approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of a project of issuance of shares or any other securities giving right to shares of the Company, submitted by the Board of Directors, and enabling the French State to convert in shares of the Company all or part of the Deeply Subordinated Notes held by the French State; or (iii)/uni00A0in the event of an implementation of a share capital increase or of an issuance of securities giving right to shares of the Company (with the exception of transactions carried out with preferential subscription rights or with a priority subscription period and which may be subscribed by way of o/ff-set, transactions reserved for the French State or transactions with cancellation of preferential subscription rights by 'private placement' authorized in advance by the French State) without the agreement of the French State, the Company may redeem (a) in the cases referred to in (i)/uni00A0and (ii)/uni00A0above, in full, and (b) in the case referred to in (iii)/uni00A0above, in full or in part, the Deeply Subordinated Notes remaining outstanding. Otherwise, the applicable interest rate will be increased by an additional margin of 5.50% per annum from the date of occurrence of any of the events referred to in (i), (ii)/uni00A0or (iii). Such interest rate adjustments shall be cumulative provided, however, that the cumulative adjustments shall not exceed 11.00% per annum.\n\nThis transaction reinforces the Group's equity by \u20ac3/uni00A0billion under IFRS accounting standards, without impacting cash-flow, while increasing the Group's flexibility in its mandatory debt repayment profile.",

Under this agreement, and in consideration for the gains resulting from the August/uni00A02015 agreement, on December/uni00A012, 2016 KLM financed the acquisition by the foundation of three million Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM treasury shares at the market price.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM held 1,208,005 of its own shares, i.e. 0.2% of the share capital, of which 1,116,420/uni00A0shares held by KLM in respect of its various stock option plans. The valuation of the portfolio stood at \u20ac4.7 million at December 31, 2021.\n\n## 2.8.4/emspace Reinforcement of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines\n\nDuring the 2021 financial year, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM continued to execute its strategic partnerships entered into in 2017 with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. (Delta) and China Eastern Airlines (CEA).\n\nOn July/uni00A027, 2017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM had announced, firstly, the planned creation of a joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic and, secondly, the intensification of its partnership with CEA. These two commercial alliances were consolidated by equity links in 2017: Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern each acquired equity interests in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM within the framework of reserved capital increases authorized by the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of September/uni00A04, 2017 for a total of \u20ac751/uni00A0million. In addition, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced its intention to acquire a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic, in which Delta has a 49% stake, for around \u00a3220/uni00A0million.\n\nWithin this framework, on July/uni00A027, 2017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and CEA on one hand, and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic on the other, signed partnership agreements aimed at defining the principles of their closer cooperation:\n\n- - on July/uni00A027, 2017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic signed Memoranda of Understanding laying the foundations for a future integration of the existing joint-ventures between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Alitalia, and between Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic, within a single joint-venture. Within this framework, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM was expected to acquire a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. having held 49% of the latter since 2013, with the historic shareholder Sir Richard Branson retaining 20%. These agreements foresaw specific conditions intended to protect the interests of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in the event of any deterioration in the joint-venture's operating conditions linked to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (Brexit);\n- - Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and CEA also stepped up their commercial cooperation and reinforced their partnership within the framework of the existing joint-venture, through the signature on July/uni00A027, 2017, of a Marketing Agreement aimed at defining the principles of their closer cooperation.\n\nFurthermore, to proceed with the capital increases reserved to CEA and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc., on July/uni00A027, 2017 China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. signed two Subscription Agreements with Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, wherein both investors agreed to subscribe to the reserved capital increases and containing the following commitments:\n\n- - lock-ups on the stakes wherein China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. both undertake, during a five-year period as of the settlement date (i.e. October/uni00A03, 2017), not to o/ffer, sell, pledge or otherwise transfer or dispose of a number of 37,527/uni00A0shares in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM (as this number shall be adjusted for any share split or share consolidation of the Company) without the prior written consent of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, and subject to certain exceptions as set out in the Securities Note for the transaction authorized under No.17-441/uni00A0dated August/uni00A017, 2017, section E.5;\n- - a standstill commitment wherein China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. both undertake, during a five-year period as of the settlement date (i.e. October/uni00A03, 2017), not to acquire or subscribe to any additional shares in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or other equity securities conferring access to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share capital, directly or indirectly, which would have the e/ffect of increasing the CEA and Delta stakes to above 10% of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share capital, without the prior written consent of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, except in the case of (a) any person announcing their intention to launch a public o/ffer (in cash. shares or a combination of both) for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares, (b) the announcement by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or any competent authority of an upcoming change of control for Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, it being specified that 'control' shall be defined in accordance with Article L./uni00A0233-3/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce or (c) the replacement of at least the majority of the members of the Board of Directors, in the event this replacement is not recommended by the Board of Directors;\n- - an approval clause wherein, for the duration of this Subscription Agreement, China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. undertake to obtain the formal approval of the Company's Board of Directors if they wish to sell their Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM",

In addition, following the expiry of the above-mentioned five-year lock-up undertaking, in the event of a trade sale of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares to a third party via an over-the-counter transaction, both CEA and Delta have undertaken to first give Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM the option of purchasing these shares, at the same pricing conditions.\n\nOn October/uni00A03, 2017, Eastern Airlines Industry Investment (Luxembourg) Company Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CEA Global Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited, and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. both subscribed in cash to capital increases without shareholders' preferential subscription rights, each for a total (including issue premium) of \u20ac375,274,100, at a subscription price of \u20ac10/uni00A0per share (including issue premium). The acquisition of these shareholdings was accompanied by the appointment of two directors to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors designated, firstly, by China Eastern Airlines and, secondly, by Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc.\n\nLastly, on March/uni00A014 and May/uni00A015, 2018, within the framework of the implementation of the future single joint-venture between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic, and following authorization by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors (see section/uni00A02.3.1 'Activities and functioning of the Board of Directors') the following agreements were signed:\n\n- - a Share Purchase Agreement (the 'SPA') between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance/uni00A0SAS and Virgin Investments Limited, allowing Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, through its 100%-owned subsidiary Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance/uni00A0SAS, to purchase a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic for \u00a3220.1/uni00A0million. Within this framework, a Disclosure Letter relating to the SPA and compensation from Virgin Investments to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM linked to tax liabilities relating to the Virgin Atlantic Group (the Tax Deed) were also agreed between the parties;\n- - a Shareholders' Agreement) between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance, Delta, Virgin Investments Limited, Virgin Atlantic Limited and Sir Richard Branson organizing the shareholding in Virgin Atlantic;\n- - a Put and call Option Deed between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance, Virgin Investments and Delta relating to 31% of the Virgin Atlantic share capital;\n- - a joint-venture Agreement aimed at the implementation of a commercial joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta, Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited, Air/uni00A0France and KLM together with the related bilateral Transition Agreement signed with Delta; and\n- - an Implementation Agreement between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance/uni00A0SAS, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Delta, Virgin Atlantic Limited, Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited and Sir Richard Branson, concerning the realization of the transaction.\n\nOn November/uni00A021, 2019, the US Department of Transportation granted Antitrust Immunity (ATI) within the framework of the extension of the transatlantic joint-venture. This regulatory step enabled the airlines to move forward with their transatlantic partnership.\n\nIn parallel, the partners finalized the expanded joint-venture's governance, agreeing on simplified decision-making processes enabling the joint-venture to deliver its full synergy potential. Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Virgin thus finally considered that Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's acquisition of an equity interest in Virgin Atlantic was no longer necessary and negotiated an agreement whereby Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM would not acquire an equity interest in Virgin Atlantic with no impact on Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's position in the commercial joint-venture between Delta Air Lines/uni00A0Inc., Virgin Atlantic and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. The Virgin Group was to retain its 51% majority shareholding in the capital of Virgin Atlantic while Delta was to retain the remaining 49%. This partnership is considered to be key to reinforcing the Group's leadership position between Europe and North America, and will o/ffer customers a seamless travel experience across the Atlantic.\n\nAs a result, on October/uni00A030, 2019, the Board of Directors mandated the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM management to finalize the discussions and negotiate amendments to the relevant agreements so as to no longer proceed with the planned investment in a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic. This decision led to the following amendments to the agreements, whose signature had been authorized by the Board meetings of March/uni00A014 and May 15, 2018:\n\n- - termination of the Share Purchase Agreement ('SPA') for the acquisition of a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic, and termination of agreements ancillary to the SPA.;\n- - amendment and updating of the joint-venture Agreement to reflect the termination of the SPA. This agreement was signed on January/uni00A030, 2020, e/ffective as from January/uni00A01, 2020;\n- - amendment (reflecting the termination of the SPA) and updating of the Implementation Agreement. This agreement was signed on January/uni00A09, 2020 e/ffective as from January/uni00A01, 2020;\n- - signature of the agreement between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Virgin Group (signed and e/ffective as from January/uni00A030, 2020) giving Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, subject to certain conditions, the right to acquire Virgin Atlantic Limited shares in the event of sale by Virgin Group of Virgin Atlantic Limited shares to a third party.\n\nThe overall joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic was launched in early February/uni00A02020, o/ffering customers a wider choice of routes and loyalty options for travel between Europe, the United Kingdom and North America.\n\nWithin the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, restrictive border regulations and constantly-changing health measures led to a drastic reduction in airline capacity and created a highly uncertain environment regarding the management of networks by joint-venture partners. In view of the impact on the implementation of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's existing joint-ventures, in December/uni00A02020, the partners reviewed the financial conditions of their agreements and amended the provisions relating to the financial 'settlement' mechanisms provided in the Group's joint-venture agreements signed, on one hand, with Delta and Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited and, on the other, with CEA.",

In this respect, each party waives all rights it may have with respect to the amounts due to it under the joint-venture agreement for the calendar year 2020, and agrees to waive them permanently. This waiver avoids uncertain and potentially material financial exposure for either party given the context linked to the public health crisis. The duration of this waiver may be extended in 2021 by mutual agreement of the parties based on the duration of the impacts on the joint-venture operations of the Covid-19 pandemic. The other provisions of the joint-venture agreement remain unchanged.\n\nOn December/uni00A04, 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors also authorized the suspension of the provisions concerning the financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues generated by the joint-venture) in the joint-venture agreement entered into\n\nwith CEA on November/uni00A026, 2018.

This agreement enables the Group to reinforce its commercial cooperation with China Eastern Airlines and its position in the Chinese market (see section/uni00A02.3.1 'Activities and functioning of the Board of Directors').

This is because, over time, changes in the shareholder structure of an air transport company whose shares are listed for trading on a regulated market could jeopardize its operating license as an EU air transport carrier, the retention thereof being conditional on EU interests holding a majority of the shares and maintaining e/ffective control, or the tra/ffic rights held by the Company as a French air transport company, pursuant to bilateral international agreements concluded between France and other States outside the European Union.\n\n## Identification and monitoring of shareholders\n\nArticles 9 and following of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation set the conditions under which the Board of Directors can or must decide either to reduce the 5% threshold above which shares must be held in registered form to 10,000/uni00A0shares, or to require all shares in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to be held in registered form. Thus, when the 40% share capital or voting right threshold has been passed by non-French shareholders, the Board of Directors can decide to reduce this 5% threshold to 10,000/uni00A0shares.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM publishes a notice informing the shareholders and the public that non-French shareholders as defined by Article 14/uni00A0of the Articles of Incorporation own, directly or indirectly, 45% of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's share capital or voting rights. If it appears that non-French shareholders as defined by Article 14/uni00A0of the Articles of Incorporation represent, directly or indirectly, more than 45% of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's capital or voting rights on a long-term basis, the Board of Directors must decide to make it mandatory for all Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares to be held in registered form.

Based on this threshold, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM will be entitled to launch procedures requiring the sale of shares in order to safeguard its nationality.

Other risks of which the Group is currently not aware, or risks that as of the date of this document are not considered to be amongst the most material, could also negatively a/ffect its activities.\n\nThis section includes the main risks which, as of the date of this document, could potentially impact the Group's activity, financial situation, reputation, results and outlook, as notably identified within the framework of the establishment of the Group's risk mapping, which evaluates their criticality, i.e. their gravity and probability of occurrence, as well as the mitigation plans in place. In accordance with the provisions of Article 16/uni00A0of Regulation (EU) No. 2017-1129 of the European Parliament and the European Council, within each of the risk categories mentioned below, the risk factors considered to be the most significant (indicated by an asterisk) are presented first.\n\n## 3.1.1/emspace Geopolitical and macro-economic risks\n\n## 3.1.1.1/emspace Impact of the Covid-19 epidemic on the Group's activities*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic had a major adverse impact on the Group's operational activity, financial position and results during the 2021 financial year and is expected to continue to impact the Group in the near future.\n\nSince February/uni00A02020, the Group's activities have been strongly a/ffected by the Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic. Characterized as a 'pandemic' by the WHO, the Covid-19 coronavirus epidemic has resulted in numerous restrictive measures to limit its spread. The measures put in place by the public authorities in numerous countries have notably led to the temporary suspension of airline operations and a significant reduction or suspension of travel, thereby having a material and negative impact on the Group's activity in the countries where it operates. Inter-continental/ business travel is in particular being impacted by these regulatory restrictions and the cost-saving plans of the Group's corporate customers. During 2021, restrictive measures were still in place, but were adapted by region and throughout the year to limit the spread and impact of the di/fferent variants, (Delta, Omicron,/uni00A0etc.). For the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2021, the Group's passenger tra/ffic (measured in thousands of passengers) was well below its 2019 level but was 31.1% up on the previous year (vs -67% for 2020).\n\nGiven the ever-changing travel restrictions and the decrease in passenger tra/ffic and sales, the Group has been obliged to significantly reduce its capacity and, notably, drastically curtail its flight activity.\n\nFor full year 2021, the Group's capacity (in millions of ASK (available seat-kilometers)) was well down on its 2019 level but increased by 29.5% compared to the previous year (vs -54% for 2020).\n\nThis health crisis continued to have a very strong impact on the Group's activities and results for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2021, with an operating loss of \u20ac1.6/uni00A0billion (vs. income of \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion in 2019 and a \u20ac4.6 billion loss in 2020).\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has also implemented substantial cost-saving measures, involving staff reductions and the curtailment of non-essential investment and expenditure, the implementation of which could in particular damage the Group's reputation due to negative reactions from public authorities or unfavorable media coverage, or even lead to labor disputes, with a negative impact on the Group's activity.\n\nThe Group has also taken various measures to strengthen its cash and liquidity position which are outlined in the 'Mitigating principles and actions' paragraph below. As at December/uni00A031, 2021, the Group's net debt amounted to \u20ac8.2/uni00A0billion (vs. \u20ac11/uni00A0billion in 2020).\n\nIn view of the pandemic's progressive spread and the unfolding developments, the current and future measures implemented by the public authorities in many countries could further disrupt, or even prevent, any activity by the Group for an indefinite period. In this context, several countries where the Group conducts its activities, including France and the Netherlands, again implemented lockdowns or several other health measures at the end of 2021, in light of the proliferation of the pandemic and the emergence of new variants. However, the second half of 2021 was characterized by a recovery in tra/ffic over the summer and during the Christmas holiday period, mainly due to the gradual reopening of borders.\n\nGiven the uncertainties inherent in any health crisis, the Group does not expect this situation to be fully stabilized in the short term, despite significant progress on vaccination throughout the world. The Group's baseline scenario is a return to the pre-crisis level of capacity in 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nEach airline is supported by a coordination structure responsible for prevention, crisis management, the circulation of health advice and liaising with the national and international authorities on outbreaks of epidemics or threats of epidemics. Concerning the management of the public health crisis associated with the Covid-19 virus, the Group's airlines are also being supported by a dedicated coordination structure. Furthermore, the Group has implemented a Network Contingency Planning process, for capacity and schedule optimization, in coordination with its partner airlines and is continuously monitoring the restrictions in various countries, adapting schedules and route planning accordingly. To this end, the processes for building and adjusting flight schedules have had to be reinvented for all the Group's companies. A combined analysis of the latest routing results with the booking trends enables capacity to be adjusted to match demand as closely as possible. As a result, capacity has varied by a factor of four between periods of lockdown and vacation periods.\n\nTo strengthen its cash and liquidity position, the Group has taken various measures, to the benefit of Air/uni00A0France, including the implementation of a loan guaranteed by the French State (Pr\u00eat Garanti par l'\u00c9tat - PGE) for a total amount of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion, granted by a syndicate of nine banks (the 'PGE'), and a \u20ac3/uni00A0billion loan from the French State; these two loans were drawn down in full respectively at July/uni00A031, 2020 for the PGE and December/uni00A031, 2020 for the shareholder loan, and the amounts borrowed allocated to the general needs of the business.\n\nWith regard to KLM, the measures taken mainly relate to a revolving credit facility of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion guaranteed by the Dutch State (of which \u20ac665/uni00A0million drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020 but with no additional drawdown in 2021) and a direct loan of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion (of which \u20ac277/uni00A0million drawn down at December/uni00A031, 2020 but with no additional drawdown in 2021) (see Note/uni00A033.3 in section/uni00A05.6 for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2021 for a description of the main characteristics of these financing packages). The amounts borrowed were allocated to the general needs of the business.\n\nThe first step in the recapitalization took place in April/uni00A02021 with the \u20ac1/uni00A0billion capital increase and the conversion of the \u20ac3/uni00A0billion French State loan into three perpetual hybrid bonds of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion each. Other measures followed: in June/uni00A02021, \u20ac800/uni00A0million of senior bonds were issued via two tranches (with settlement and delivery taking place in July/uni00A02021) and, in July/uni00A02021, an EMTN (Euro Medium Term Notes) program was also implemented; this is a flexible instrument facilitating the issuance of bond instruments.\n\nOn December/uni00A010, 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM redeemed \u20ac500/uni00A0million of the PGE and negotiated a revised redemption profile with a maturity extended from May/uni00A06, 2023 to May/uni00A06, 2025. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is considering the next steps in its recapitalization measures to strengthen its balance sheet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\nThe Group has also adopted budgetary measures in order to save cash:\n\n- -  downwards revision in the capex plan;\n- -  reduction in operating costs;\n- -  labor cost reductions thanks to the partial activity (Activit\u00e9 Partielle) in France and recourse to the employment support program from the Dutch government in response to Covid-19 (NOW);\n- -  halt to all non-safety and non-operational critical projects; and\n- -  significant reduction in all consultants and external sta/ff.\n\nBeyond that, with the crisis continuing and the conditions for a recovery remaining uncertain, the Group will continue to monitor the unfolding situation on a daily basis, to make adjustments as necessary and define/deploy protection resources like the appropriate health measures.\n\n## 3.1.1.2/emspace Terrorist attacks, threats of attack or geopolitical instability*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nSince 2016, the security situation resulting from terrorist attacks perpetrated in France, elsewhere in Europe and in the Group's operational zones, together with worldwide politico-security events (Middle Eastern and African countries) have all represented a range of security risks negatively impacting the Group. For example, the estimated impact of the Paris terrorist attacks in November/uni00A02015 on the Group's fourth quarter revenues in the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2015 amounted to \u20ac120/uni00A0million.\n\nThe occurrence of geopolitical instability, terrorist attacks or threats of attacks, closure of an airspace or military action could have a negative e/ffect on both the Group's passenger tra/ffic, and thus its revenues, and on the level of operating expenses.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nIn terms of security, the Group's airlines comply with national, European and international regulations and submit regular reports to the competent authorities of the measures and procedures in place.\n\nThe Group has no hedging in place for air transportation operating losses but is insured for the consequences of an attack on one of its aircraft and has subscribed to war and assimilated risks insurance.\n\nThe Group has implemented a series of safety and security management processes in line with the sector's best practices and fully compliant with the IOSA requirements (IATA).\n\nProtecting individuals and assets from assault, terrorist attacks and threatened attacks, and potential threats to their integrity of any nature, is a major priority for the Group. The Security departments in each Air/uni00A0France and KLM company establish the security policies, analyze the threats and take all the appropriate measures, particularly in relation to the factors involved in geopolitical instability.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, the threat linked to jihadist terrorism remained very high in the world, especially in areas where it had hitherto not been particularly present or active (East Africa, Gulf of Guinea countries, other Asian regions,/uni00A0etc.), requiring airlines to increase their security measures to ensure secure operations. In addition, geopolitical events and even international organized crime have also necessitated the establishment of contingency plans to anticipate these developments.\n\nFinally, new questions have arisen about the attitude of certain States restricting air navigation (notably the Belarusian incident), prompting us to be particularly vigilant. The Group has also developed emergency plans and temporary adaptation procedures (e.g the suspension of flight operations) enabling an e/ffective response to diverse situations should an epidemic, geopolitical or other type of event occur. The aim of these plans is the e/ffective protection of passengers and sta/ff, operational and service continuity, and the preservation of the long-term viability of the Group's businesses. These plans are regularly adjusted to take into account the lessons learnt from events experienced.\n\nThe Ukrainian crisis has repercussions for the Group's activity, the latter having announced the suspension until further notice of services to/from and overflight of Ukraine (February/uni00A012, 2022 for KLM and February/uni00A021, 2022 for Air/uni00A0France) and Russia (February/uni00A026, 2022 for KLM and February/uni00A027, 2022 for Air/uni00A0France). These routes represent less than 1% of the Group's network business in terms of revenues. The impact of route extensions on flights to China, Japan and South Korea also remains, for the moment, limited. However, uncertainty as to the outcome of the conflict does not currently enable us precisely to anticipate the totality of its impact on the Group's activity.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has also, pursuant to the sanctions decided by the Western countries, suspended its maintenance activities for Russian airlines; the impact of this measure is not material.\n\nBeyond the impact of these suspensions of activity and the required adjustments to its network, the main impact for the Group from this Ukrainian crisis is the risk incurred by higher fuel prices (on this subject, see sections 3.1.1.4 'Trend in the oil price*' and 3.1.5.2 'Risks relating to the fuel price') and the risk to global economic growth.\n\n## 3.1.1.3/emspace Cyclical nature of the air transportation industry*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nLocal, regional and international economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Group's activities and, hence, on its financial results. Periods of crisis or post-crisis with an unstable economic environment are liable to a/ffect demand for transportation, both for tourism and business travel. Furthermore, during such periods, the Group may have to accept delivery of\n\nnew aircraft or be unable to sell unused aircraft under acceptable financial conditions. The negative impact on the global economy of the current Covid-19 health crisis, combined with the tra/ffic restrictions imposed by several countries, has led to a significant reduction in business and leisure transport flows, which has also impacted many companies within the value chain such as travel agents, ground handling companies and other suppliers and subcontractors involved in engineering and maintenance. The di/fficult financial position of suppliers may result in cost increases or worsened contractual conditions for the Group and the bankruptcy of certain suppliers, as the case may be, could lead to cost increases due to the monopolistic position of the remaining suppliers. Finally, airports and air navigation service providers (ANSP) are looking to increase their charges in coming years, a/ffecting the profitability of the Group.\n\nIf the economic crisis were to continue or deteriorate, this would have a significant impact on air transportation activity and consequently, on the Group's performance. The Covid-19 crisis and the associated travel restrictions have strongly impacted Business travel. New remote working habits and environmental expectations may have a lasting e/ffect on Business demand. Weaker Business demand would have an impact on yield and network structure.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has a balanced international geographical network and can address all customer segments enabling it to limit its exposure to risk. To expand its own network, for some years the Group has also been developing an extensive air partner portfolio.\n\nTo contend with the lower level of activity, the Group has reduced its costs and improved flexibility in several processes. Regarding its subcontractors and suppliers which may be a/ffected by the Covid-19 epidemic, the Group closely monitors potential distress at all levels within the supply chain with the support of local teams, centralized teams, IATA and the Procurement department, and seeks to find alternative suppliers in the most distressed cases. Regarding airport and air navigation charges, the Group is engaged in ongoing discussions with airports and ANSPs on lowering charges or improving the value for money.\n\n## 3.1.1.4/emspace Trend in the oil price*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe fuel bill is one of the largest cost items for airlines, making oil price volatility a risk for the air transportation industry. A sharp increase in the oil price can have a very material negative impact on the profitability of airlines, particularly if the economic environment does not enable them to adjust their pricing strategies. Similarly, a sharp decline in fuel prices is generally favorable for airline profitability. However, the way in which airlines pass on a sharp fall in the fuel price in their fares is a factor of significant uncertainty.",

        "page_content": "For the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2021, the fuel bill amounted to \u20ac2,748/uni00A0million, up by 15% compared to the previous year due, in particular, to (i)/uni00A0the higher activity in 2021 compared with 2020 following a progressive restart in tra/ffic as from Summer 2021 and (ii)/uni00A0a higher fuel price supported by demand.\n\nThe Ukrainian crisis is pushing up oil prices to levels not seen since 2012, mainly as a result of the sanctions imposed on Russian oil producers by the international community. Whilst the impact of such price increases could be significant should they remain at the levels prevailing since the inception of the crisis, the uncertainties around the outcome of the conflict do not enable a precise evaluation at this stage.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nInsofar as possible, the Group seeks to protect itself from any further increases in the oil price, whilst remaining protected against downwards risks, and adapts its fares when necessary to reduce the impact of rising fuel prices.\n\nIn addition to fare adjustments and permanent e/fforts to reduce fuel consumption, the Group has implemented a policy of systematically hedging the fuel price risk which is detailed in section/uni00A03.1.5.2 'Risks relating to the fuel price'.\n\nNotwithstanding the uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the Ukrainian crisis, the Group is maintaining the systematic implementation of its fuel hedging policy. In addition, Air/uni00A0France and KLM have already implemented two fare increases, in February and March, which vary according to destination and travel class.\n\n## 3.1.1.5/emspace Competition in the short, medium and long-haul air passenger transportation market*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs the leading group in terms of intercontinental tra/ffic on departure from Europe, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is a major global air transport player; in 2021, the Group carried 45/uni00A0million passengers (104/uni00A0million in 2019 and 34/uni00A0million in 2020) between Europe and the rest of the world, as well as on intra-European routes on departure from its local markets.\n\nThe air transport industry is extremely competitive. This competitive pressure could be exacerbated by the Covid-19 crisis and its long aftermath, impacting the demand for air transport. During the recovery period, a mismatch between airline overcapacity and low customer demand could lead to more aggressive pricing policies being implemented by airlines. Conditions related to State Aid could also dramatically reshape the European aviation landscape: slot remedies, acquisition bans and environmental conditions can all distort competition.\n\nIn short and medium-haul, the Group competes with other airlines and, in particular, the low-cost and low-fare carriers which have seen very rapid growth over the last fifteen years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt also competes with alternative means of transportation like high-speed rail (TGV), in particular further to the adoption of the Climate and Resilience Law which has introduced a ban on operating airline services on domestic routes whenever the route is also served by the national rail network in under 2h30. Modernization, growth and increased competition from high-speed rail in Europe are liable to have a negative impact on the air transport industry's activity and financial results. 2021 was the first year of full implementation for the Fourth Railway Package, an EU legislative measure that breaks down the remaining institutional, legal and technical barriers to competition, creating a single, integrated European rail area and spurring economic growth.\n\nIn addition, self-connect platforms like Kiwi.com or easyJet Worldwide enable the di/fferent point-to-point airlines to o/ffer connecting journeys. Should these platforms be significantly expanded and prove successful, the current hub and spoke model of hub carriers like Air/uni00A0France or KLM could be a/ffected.\n\nThe competition is also very intense in long-haul, with di/fferent competitive landscapes and recovery dynamics depending on the region.\n\nMeanwhile, manufacturers are selling narrowbody aircraft with extended range, which may open the way to competition from low-cost carriers on a growing number of routes in the medium-haul narrowbody segment.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe Group's di/fferent strategic plans seek to respond to these risks, particularly via the restructuring of the point-to-point operations, the accelerated development of Transavia, air/rail inter-modality development, fleet evolution and modernization, and the development of partnerships in large high-growth markets. In parallel, the Group is lobbying the authorities for a legal framework ensuring fair competition between carriers (see also section 1.2 'Strategy' and 1.3 'Activities in 2021').\n\nFurthermore, within the framework of the Open Skies agreement between Europe and the United States, European airlines are authorized to operate flights to the United States from any European airport. While this agreement potentially opens the way to increased competition for Paris-CDG and AmsterdamSchiphol, it has also enabled Air/uni00A0France and KLM to expand their networks and strengthen cooperation within the SkyTeam alliance within the framework, notably, of a transatlantic joint-venture with their transatlantic partners.",

This positioning corresponds to a long-term strategy based on leveraging intellectual property by selling licenses to maintenance providers seeking to exercise their business activity on certain products. This competition is putting pressure on the revenues of the maintenance business (which represented 7% of the Group's revenues for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2021 versus 11% in 2020) due to increased competition in the sale of services and, on the cost side, owing to an aggressive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) escalation policy. Ultimately, if it were to result in reduced competition in the aeronautics maintenance market, this trend could have a material adverse impact on airline maintenance costs.\n\nThis trend is escalating, especially with the arrival of new aircraft (A220, A350, B787,/uni00A0etc.). The ability to maintain balanced competitive conditions is a priority objective, both for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's commercial activity in maintenance and to contain the Group's maintenance costs.\n\nThe Maintenance, Repair, overhaul (MRO) market is showing healthy growth although most of this growth is outside the EU and especially in Asia. To maintain customer proximity and optimize the supply chain, further development of the AFI KLM E&M supply chain is needed via the expansion of local service centers and the regional industrial footprint.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the MRO market is leading to additional competitive pressure and thus a drop in sales prices and production overcapacity, resulting in a loss of profitability. In addition, several airlines which are also customers of the Group for engineering and maintenance services have incurred losses due to the crisis, which exposes the Group to a risk of delayed payment of its receivables or even the bankruptcy of these companies.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is working on a number of initiatives to limit the impacts inherent to this risk:\n\n- -  the involvement of the Maintenance teams in fleet renewal campaigns: procurement of licenses and the securing of industrial cooperation with Original Equipment and Engine Manufacturers (OEMs) and Original Aircraft Manufacturers (OAMs) be able to continue to develop Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's commercial activity in maintenance;\n- -  Air France - KLM's current strong market position has the necessary scale and scope to serve as a basis for win-win partnerships with OEMs and other airlines;\n- -  developing repair solutions and the use of Used Serviceable Materials, thereby reducing the dependence on certain OEMs;\n- -  negotiation of the value added contributed by licenses.\n\nFurthermore, at the request of the airlines, IATA is also maintaining a watching brief on this issue.\n\nRegarding the impact of the Covid-19 public health crisis on the MRO market, the Group is adapting its product portfolio to the market's needs, reinforcing the attractiveness of the o/ffers, reinforcing dynamic partnerships and its global industrial footprint and continuing digital initiatives. With regards to production overcapacity issues related to the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic, the Group has implemented workforce restructuring plans. Regarding the impact of the Covid-19 epidemic on its customers for engineering and maintenance services, and the risk of non-payment or bankruptcy of these customers, the Group actively monitors receivables and the risks of non-payment, and adapts the services proposed to customers according to their demand and financial capabilities. In addition, the processes and controls have been improved in order to maintain the profitability of future contracts at an acceptable level. For airlines under financial administration, the Group continues its services subject to a payment commitment from the administrators and the freezing of previous receivables, with recourse to COFACE for some companies.\n\n## 3.1.2/emspace Risks relating to the air transportation activity\n\n## 3.1.2.1/emspace Risks related to airline safety*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAccident risk, with the possibility of damage to people and property, is inherent to air transportation which is why airline activities - passenger and cargo transportation, aircraft maintenance - are regulated by a series of European regulatory provisions directly applicable or for some of them transposed\n\ninto French and Dutch law. Compliance with these regulations is governed by whether an airline is awarded the AOC (Air Operator Certificate).\n\nThe national Civil Aviation Authority carries out a series of checks on the proper application of these rules covering notably the:\n\n- - designation of a senior executive and managers responsible for the principal operational functions;",

        "page_content": "- - appropriate organization of the flight, ground, cargo and maintenance operations;\n- - deployment of a Safety Management System (SMS); and\n- - implementation of a quality assurance system.\n\nThe materialization of this risk could have a significant negative impact on the Group's reputation and legal or financial consequences.\n\nIn the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the risks related to airline safety may increase as a result, notably, of reduced employee activity, the integration and respect of health measures, the partial availability of the infrastructures, and the grounding and re-entry into service of some aircraft.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Flight Safety is the absolute priority. Safety is fundamental to maintaining the confidence of customers and sta/ff and is a day-to-day imperative which determines the Group's activity and the long-term future of the air transportation industry.\n\nAll of the Group's businesses are subject to numerous checks and certifications, and meet extremely strict standards and the highest level of regulations in the industry, both at European level with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and globally with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), whose IOSA Operational Safety Audit is a benchmark within the industry and leads to certification which must be renewed every two years.\n\nThe IOSA audits were carried out between the end of 2020 and early of 2021, enabling the certifications. The Air/uni00A0France and KLM IOSA certifications were renewed in early 2021 following an on-site audit.\n\nTo reach the highest possible level of Flight Safety, each airline updates and reinforces its SMS which defines in concrete terms the conditions for the implementation of its risk management system. The SMS, which is an integral part of the organization, procedures and corporate culture, is supported by a commitment made at the highest level of management, and by training and awareness-raising programs for all sta/ff (see section/uni00A04.4.1 'Operational safety for stakeholders').\n\nThis risk is covered by the aviation insurance policy.\n\nAs of March/uni00A02020, the Covid-19 pandemic and the counter-measures implemented by governments and global aviation industry organizations refocused the individual airlines on re-engineering their procedures and working methodologies to ensure the safety and well-being of their customers, employees and the environment worldwide. The airlines played a crucial role in this period by determining the variability risk prior to implementation and, above all, indicating what was needed to make it feasible. In addition, the airlines identified, assessed and embedded all the restrictions imposed by local governments and agencies within their operations. To ensure the safety of passengers and sta/ff, the Covid-19 regulations have constantly been adapted and, where necessary, have been improved through the introduction of additional regulations as a result of safety studies and risk analysis. The measures have since been adapted to the variations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin flight activity and the state of the infrastructures, to maintain our level of Flight Safety.\n\n## 3.1.2.2/emspace Risks related to the environment\n\n## Acceptability of air transportation growth*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nFrom the Flygskam or 'flight-shaming' movement in the social media to calls for a tax on kerosene in several countries and court cases on corporate legal responsibility for climate change, air transportation is having to contend with ever-increasing public pressure at both local and global level, condemning the industry's impacts on the environment. Furthermore, the unprecedented crisis triggered by Covid-19 has further questioned our societies' focus on economic growth and globalization at the cost of environmental impacts - with aviation very much remaining in the spotlight on these issues. As a result, the sector now finds itself confronted with a renewed and urgent societal acceptability challenge. This requires aviation to fully embrace sustainability as part of the necessary evolution of its business and economic model in the post-Covid-19 era.\n\nThe airline industry must pursue its efforts to reduce its impacts and intensify communication on its commitments and the mitigating initiatives that are already in place. Airlines are accommodating their customers' growing need for mobility, while improving their energy e/fficiency and focusing on containing noise hindrance at an acceptable level for those living near airports. Public pressure never ceases to grow, at both local and global level, with regard to the environmental impacts linked to the air transport industry.\n\nIn this respect, the actions implemented by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to limit and reduce its environmental impact directly influence its ability to manage and develop its activities ('license to grow') in all regions of the world and over the long-term.\n\nThe air transport industry is subject to a significant level of environmental legislation governing areas such as the exposure of people to aircraft noise and local emissions, air quality, the treatment of waste products, and the introduction of taxes on airlines and obligations to ensure the compliance of their operations. For example, since 2020, airline tickets issued by all airlines have attracted a tax on all flights departing from France (but not on arrivals), except connecting flights. This tax will raise funds for investment in greener transportation infrastructure, including rail.\n\nSuch legislation may have a significant negative impact on the Group's operations and growth which could be reflected in more substantial costs, and could lead to competitive distortions between airlines when applied solely to a specific geographical area. The debate about the role of aviation in climate change increases the risk that/uni00A0CO2 emissions will be subject to more rigorous pricing in the future. In future, the regulation will also take into account the 'non-CO2 climate impact of aviation', such as condensation trails and nitrogen oxide emissions which may impact aviation activities.",

Air/uni00A0France and KLM are therefore members of working groups and support research projects aimed at the creation of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel market (see section/uni00A04.5 'Environmental impact').\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe airline industry is amongst the sectors that are mobilizing the most to reduce their carbon footprints and was the first sector to commit to collectively reducing its/uni00A0CO2 emissions. As early as 2009, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) set an ambitious global commitment to stabilizing the/uni00A0CO2 emissions from international aviation at the 2020 level (Carbon Neutral Growth as of 2020), and committed in 2021 to Net Zero emissions by 2050. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is a member of the representative associations for the airline industry (IATA, ATAG, A4E, FNAM) which engage in lobbying activities directed at the relevant national, European and international authorities and bodies (ICAO, European Union, supervisory Ministries in France and the Netherlands) to promote e/ffective solutions for the environment, and also to ensure that the measures which are put in place do not lead to any distortion in competition between the air transportation players.\n\nThe Group's airlines have communicated widely, in conjunction with the industry players, on their commitments, the measures already in place and the medium and long-term emission reduction targets. The use of sustainable aviation fuel is a proven avenue towards reducing/uni00A0CO2 emissions from aviation and a key element in achieving Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's/uni00A0CO2 emission reduction targets, as well as those of the aviation industry as a whole. On the ground, the Group is investing in a fleet of electric ground support equipment and in sources of renewable energy to supply power to its buildings. The Group has set a carbon neutrality target for its Ground Operations by 2030. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and its airlines are continuing their e/fforts to reduce their\n\nenvironmental footprint as part of a transparent and responsible approach to the challenges of global warming. In 2021, the Group committed to having its/uni00A0CO2 emission reduction targets validated by the independent reference organization SBTi, founded by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the United Nations Global Compact and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). SBTi assesses and checks companies'/uni00A0CO2 emission reduction targets based on a scientific approach and criteria, ensuring that the targets are in line with the Paris Agreement. The letter of commitment signed in 2021 with SBTi positions the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and its airlines on the trajectory determined by this Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C. This new important step in the Group's decarbonization strategy is in addition to its objective of net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nFurthermore, to objectivize its ESG profile and enhance its strategy and practice, in 2021 Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM proactively sought an independent ESG rating from Standard and Poor's. This makes Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM the first airline group to be evaluated via a requested ESG rating. S&P Global Ratings has assigned Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM an ESG score of 64/100. This evaluation reflects S&P Global Ratings' view that Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM compares well with the airline industry in terms of the management of its significant exposure to environmental challenges. S&P noted that the Group is adequately prepared to manage the ESG-related risks facing airlines over the near-to-medium term.\n\nDuring the public health crisis in 2020 and 2021, and within the framework of the Group's environmental strategy, a number of initiatives were announced to customers and the general public (introduction of a high-energy-performance fleet, accelerated phase-out of the most-polluting aircraft which are the least adapted to our environmental route map, launch of the Cargo & Corporate Sustainable Aviation Fuel Program, enabling customers to invest in the development and use of SAF, in addition to the introduction, since January/uni00A02022, of a SAF contribution on ticket prices, thereby contributing to a cleaner future for air transportation, development of inter-modality by extending the Train + Air product with the SNCF business partner/uni00A0etc.).\n\nThe renewal of the fleet with environmentally-friendly latest-generation aircraft is a powerful way to reduce the airlines' environmental footprint and achieve sustainable development objectives (for a description of the measures linked to the arrival of new aircraft in the Group's airline fleets see sections/uni00A01.2.4 'Strategic orientations' and 1.4 'Fleet').\n\nIn addition, regular discussion meetings take place with residents' associations, local elected representatives and the public authorities to address any matters relating to the e/ffects of air transportation activity around airports.",

        "page_content": "## Climate change and violent natural phenomena\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nTo meet the requirements of Article 173/uni00A0III of Act No. 2015-992/uni00A0of August/uni00A017, 2015 relating to the Energy Transition for Green Growth, the Group takes into account the financial risks related to the e/ffects of climate change and implements measures to reduce them through a low-carbon strategy in all the components of its activity. These risks are both operational (linked to the physical impacts of climate change) and financial in nature, the latter being linked to the political and regulatory impacts of the energy transition (e.g environmental tax).\n\nClimate change will lead to more frequent extreme weather events that will have a greater or lesser impact on all world regions. Air operations depend on meteorological conditions and may be impacted by other natural phenomena (earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods,/uni00A0etc.) which may lead to operational disruption such as flight cancellations or delays and diversions. As a general rule, the duration of such adverse natural events tends to be short and their geographical range limited but they may require the temporary closure of an airport or airspace, like in September/uni00A02017 when Hurricane Irma caused considerable damage in the Caribbean, mainly on St. Martin. Another emblematic illustration is the eruption of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland in 2010, during which nearly 100,000/uni00A0flights were cancelled in eleven European countries, leaving ten million passengers stranded. Such events may have significant operational and financial repercussions for the Group's activity given the regulations requiring the Company to assist passengers in the European Union territory (e.g. passenger repatriation and accommodation).\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nTo adapt to the already-visible consequences of climate change such as more frequent extreme weather events, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has a policy in place to ensure safe operational and passenger handling conditions, and regularly conducts comprehensive risk analyses to optimize these arrangements.\n\nThrough its international operations, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is present in all continents and operates in di/fferent weather conditions, including the most extreme. It regularly reviews the operational risks to improve the existing procedures. The operation of a network balanced between the di/fferent continents and the flexibility related to the composition of the fleet enable the financial consequences of these impacts to be minimized.\n\nWith its partners, the Group has deployed procedures aimed at guaranteeing its services as far as possible and thus minimizing the consequences of these situations for its customers. In such circumstances, the Group deploys commercial measures to enable passengers to defer their travel if they so wish, or change their destination. The Group has no hedging in place for operating losses incurred due to such events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, during a major climate event, its aim is to reestablish flight operations as soon as possible to fulfil its mission of service continuity and ensure operations and the transportation of humanitarian assistance to the a/ffected regions.\n\nThe Group deploys measures to limit the impact on climate change via a low-carbon strategy. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Climate Action Plan stipulates the Group's priorities in terms of reducing its environmental impacts, like fleet modernization, improved fuel management and optimizing operational procedures such as eco-piloting.\n\nThe Group follows the format recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) for the management of the financial risks linked to climate change (see table in section/uni00A04.6.3 'Monitoring of Act No. 2017-399/uni00A0known as the Duty of Vigilance Law').\n\n## Carbon credit risk\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs an air operator, the Group is an emitter of carbon dioxide meaning that it has, since 2012, been subject to the European Union emission quota system (EU-ETS or European Union Emission Trading Scheme). It is thus required to o/ffset its emissions by purchasing carbon quotas in the financial markets.\n\nFor the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2021, as a result of the Covid-19 crisis, the Group's/uni00A0CO2 emissions remained well below their level for normal activity at 16.3/uni00A0million tons, of which 2.6/uni00A0million tons fell under the EU-ETS requirement. Taking into account free allowances received, the Group purchased emission allowances in the amount 897,000/uni00A0tons of/uni00A0CO2 to o/ffset its emissions, complying with the EU-ETS.\n\nSince 2021, the Group has been subject to the global carbon o/ffsetting mechanism, known as CORSIA, adopted by the ICAO in October/uni00A02016.\n\nDuring its 40 th /uni00A0 General Assembly in October/uni00A02019, the ICAO resolved that 'CORSIA is the only global market-based measure applying to/uni00A0CO2 emissions from international aviation so as to avoid a possible patchwork of duplicative State or regional MBMs, thus ensuring that international aviation/uni00A0CO2 emissions should be accounted for only once.' In this context, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM considers that its/uni00A0CO2 emissions cannot be subject to both the European ETS and CORSIA. Furthermore, assuming a change to the provisions of the European ETS, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is calling for a detailed impact study to be conducted on the envisaged amendments. In addition, the Group is drawing attention to the need for the prior design of a carbon adjustment mechanism at the frontiers of the European Union, to protect the European airlines from 'carbon leakage' which neutralizes or even aggravates the environmental impacts and benefits their international competitors.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nAt financial level, the Group has implemented a carbon credit risk hedging strategy in the form of forward purchases, a strategy whose components are approved by the Risk Management Committee.\n\nAt operational level, the Group is also committed to exploring all avenues potentially reducing its fuel consumption and carbon emissions:\n\n- - at its own initiative within the framework of its Climate Action Plan; and\n- - in cooperation with the authorities (SESAR project for the Single European Sky and optimization of air tra/ffic control).\n\nThe Group also uses an internal carbon price (price range) when deciding on whether to proceed with investments and projects, to factor the carbon risk into its decision-making scenarios (see section/uni00A04.3 'Environmental impact').\n\n## 3.1.2.3/emspace Loss of flight slots or lack of access to flight slots\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nDue to the saturation of major European airports, air carriers must obtain flight slots which are allocated in accordance with the terms and conditions defined in Regulation No. 95/93/uni00A0issued by the EC Council of Ministers. Pursuant to this Regulation, at least 80% of the flight slots held by air carriers must be used during the period for which they have been allocated. Unused slots will be lost by this carrier and transferred into a pool. The Regulation does not provide for any exemptions to this rule for situations in which, due to a dramatic drop in tra/ffic caused by exceptional events, air transport companies are required to reduce activity levels substantially and no longer use their flight slots at the required 80% level during the period in question. The European Commission can, however, decide to temporarily suspend Regulation No. 95/93/uni00A0governing the loss of unused flight slots, as it has done on several occasions.\n\nIn the context of the Covid-19 public health crisis, Regulation No. 95/93/uni00A0was thus amended to enable slots allocated for the period from March/uni00A01, 2020 to October/uni00A024, 2020 to be considered as having been operated by the air carrier to which they were initially granted. In view of the continuing health crisis and the low demand for air transportation in the coming months, on October/uni00A014, 2020 the European Commission decided to extend this exception to cover the entire Winter season, until March/uni00A027, 2021. On February/uni00A016, 2021, the European Commission adopted a new amendment to the Slot Regulation, potentially enabling maintained temporary relief from the usual slot utilization rules in view of the crisis. These provisions are applicable until the end of the Summer 2022 season. The precise parameters are defined for each IATA season depending on the health situation and specific provisions on slot relief were implemented for the Summer 2021 season. In July/uni00A02021, the European Commission\n\nfurther amended the Slot Regulation by extending the slot relief to the Winter 2021 season, setting the slot usage requirement at 50% in order for airlines to qualify for historical precedence. Lastly, in December/uni00A02021, the European Commission adopted another extension to the slot relief rules for the Summer 2022 season. Instead of the normal requirement to use at least 80% of a given slot series, airlines now have to use 64% to retain their historic rights to those slots.\n\nAny loss of flight slots or lack of access to flight slots due to a limited number of slots, especially at Schiphol, or saturation could have an impact in terms of market share, results and even growth.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM applies the provisions of the European Regulation on the allocation of flight slots, guaranteeing an air carrier the ongoing use of these slots from one season to another provided they have been used for 80% of the time excluding exceptional circumstances. Air/uni00A0France and KLM also liaise with their national authorities to ensure the regular availability at their principal hubs of the capacity necessary to the Group's growth. They also liaise with the national and European Authorities to try to ensure that no revisions of the current European Regulation take place that would limit their accessibility to slots. Lastly, they ensure that specific provision is being made within the framework of the Covid-19 crisis to ensure that they can preserve their slot portfolio worldwide despite not being in a position to operate numerous flights given the health measures introduced by the public authorities.\n\n## 3.1.2.4/emspace Reinforcement of passenger compensation rights\n\n## Description of the risk\n\n## a) European  regulations\n\nWithin the European Union, the rights of passengers in the event of flight delays, cancellation or denied boarding are defined by Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 of February/uni00A011, 2004 which came into force in 2005. It applies to all flights, whether scheduled or unscheduled, departing from an airport located in a European Union Member State (including Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Amsterdam Schiphol, the Group's two hubs) and establishes the European rules for compensation and assistance on denied boarding, substantial delay, flight cancellation and class downgrading.\n\nNumerous rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) have contributed to reinforcing passenger rights by reducing the possibilities for airlines to invoke 'extraordinary circumstances' to exempt them from the compensation foreseen in Regulation No.261/2004.",

        "page_content": "The ever-stricter regulations applying to the European airlines, but only partially applicable to airlines of third-party countries, only increase the existing distortions to competition. The emergence of companies specialized in passenger compensation is increasing the financial cost resulting from this risk. The amount of compensation is, however, the same for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, whether the customer contacts the company directly or via an intermediary.\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis has also highlighted the fact that the Regulation may not be appropriate to a situation of massive cancellations and needs to be revised to achieve a better balance between the rights of passengers and airlines in such circumstances.\n\nUnder Community rules on passenger rights, flights cancelled due to extraordinary circumstances, such as a decision by one or more States to restrict air tra/ffic, do not qualify for the compensation package provided for in Regulation (EC) No 261/2004. In these circumstances, passengers may nevertheless request reimbursement of their tickets.\n\n## b) US  regulations\n\nIn the United States, the regulation increasing US airline passenger protections came into e/ffect on August/uni00A023, 2011, and its provisions are now in force.\n\nThe US regulations in terms of passenger rights apply to all airlines operating in the US territory and/or marketing flights to/from the United States which means that Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is concerned by these US protections.\n\n## c) National  regulations\n\nIATA has collated some fifty national regulations in a database to be able to monitor changes more e/ffectively.\n\nOver the course of 2021 (as was the case in 2020), owing to the Covid-19 health crisis and the resulting border closures, the Group was forced to reduce its capacity and cancel a large number of flights, customers then being able to request the refunding of their tickets or the issue of a voucher. As of December/uni00A031, 2021, this line included \u20ac307/uni00A0million of tickets (fare and additional fee) and ancillary transport revenues whose date of transportation had passed and potentially giving rise to refunding, and \u20ac387/uni00A0million of vouchers to be used on future flights (or giving rise to a possible refund). Since 2020, the Group has also implemented a revised refund and voucher policy, which has led to a complex business process redesign.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nTo keep the e/ffects of these regulations as much as possible within financially-acceptable limits, the Group lobbies the national and European institutions, both directly and indirectly through the air transportation industry's professional associations (IATA, A4E), to obtain reasonable obligations which create no competitive distortions or major additional costs which could lead it either to increase its fares or decrease its margins. In this respect, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM continues to lobby for the revision of Regulation (EC) No.261/2004 of February/uni00A011, 2004.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn relation to the changes made to its refund and voucher policy in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Group implemented several actions including intense cooperation across all the relevant Group departments to secure swift decision-taking so as to adapt to changes in legislation worldwide, an extensive communication campaign for customers and trade partners via various platforms and the priority handling of cash refund requests to prevent litigation.\n\n## 3.1.2.5/emspace Changes in international, national or regional regulations and legislation\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAir transportation activities remain highly regulated particularly with regard to the allocation of tra/ffic rights for extra-community services and the conditions relating to operations (standards on safety, aircraft noise,/uni00A0CO2 emissions, airport access and the allocation of slots). Within this context, the EU institutions may adopt regulations which could prove restrictive for airlines and are liable to have significant organizational and/or financial impacts. Any changes to regulations and legislation may increase the Group's operating expenses or reduce its revenues.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group actively defends its positions with the French and Dutch governments, and the European institutions, both directly and through industry bodies such as the Airlines for Europe association (A4E) regarding changes to European and national regulations. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is engaged in direct lobbying of the European Commission and the national authorities to ensure a reasonable and balanced allocation of tra/ffic rights to non-European airlines. Coordination with like-minded carriers on this topic takes place within the framework of the Airline Coordination Platform (ACP).\n\n## 3.1.2.6/emspace Regulatory authorities' inquiry into the commercial cooperation agreements between carriers\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAlliance operations and commercial cooperation are required to comply with the competition law in force. In certain jurisdictions, these agreements are liable to be subject to prior investigation by the competition authorities prior to any implementation. In other jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, airlines are required to ensure that their operations are compliant with the applicable competition rules. At any time, the European Commission also has the right to open inquiries into any cases of cooperation it considers of interest to the European Community. For example, the joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Delta and Alitalia was the subject of such an inquiry (resulting in a positive decision in 2015). Such inquiries could have a negative e/ffect on the Group's results, business, reputation, financial position and outlook.",

Certain measures in this plan contained State Aid, which were accordingly notified by the French authorities to the European Commission, the latter approving them in its decision of April/uni00A05, 2021 pursuant to the rules pertaining to State Aid. This decision made the approval of the measures subject to a number of structural and behavioral commitments made by the French State with regard to the companies Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Air/uni00A0France, notably requiring Air/uni00A0 France to make landing and take-o/ff slots available to a designated third-party carrier at Orly airport. Other behavioral undertakings were also imposed within the framework of the European Commission's Temporary Framework for State Aid (such as restrictions on acquisitions, share buybacks and dividend payments) which could have an impact on the Group's activities.\n\nLike all airlines receiving State support in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, the European Commission's decisions granting support measures to Air/uni00A0France and KLM have been subject to annulment proceedings brought by Ryanair.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\n## a) Merger regulation and cooperation agreements\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has ascertained that the eventual consequences of slot availability under the 2004 and 2015 remedies remain admissible and do not a/ffect the economics of the lines in question.

The IT applications, deployed in the operating centers or via cloud computing systems, are accessed via a network comprising thousands of work positions and a growing number of mobile devices. The information contained in all these systems is exposed to a growing number of threats. The volume of information exchanged with customers and third parties is growing while aircraft are increasingly connected to the Information System. The number of laws and regulations to be taken into account is also growing.\n\n## Cybercriminality*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs with any business making extensive use of modern communication and IT data processing technologies, including revenue management systems and booking systems (including Altea), the Group is exposed to threats of cyber-criminality.\n\nCyber-criminality and cyber-espionage refer to a wide range of di/fferent activities related to the improper use of data and interference with the integrity of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Information System for personal, financial, psychological and political ends. Their heavy dependence on IT and communication technologies makes airlines vulnerable to cyber-criminality. Should Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM fail to counter such incidents of cyber-criminality, this could have a negative impact on the Group's activity, reputation, revenues and costs, and thus its results.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nTo protect itself against this risk, the Group deploys substantial resources aimed at ensuring business continuity, data protection, the security of personal information pursuant to law and the safeguarding of at-risk tangible and intangible assets.\n\nThe Cyber-crime program, approved by the Group's Audit Committee, covers the prevention and detection procedures such as cyber-threat surveillance, evaluations of Information System security and tests to pinpoint any Information System incursions via the internet. There are regular awareness-raising campaigns on IT security for sta/ff across the Company. An audit of this program was realized in 2017 which confirmed the best practices in place and the orientations adopted. The recommended improvements have been added to the program. The Group complies with the Cyber standards of the Original Aircraft Manufacturers (OAM). Since 2020, the Group has subscribed to a permanent 24/7/uni00A0independent cybersecurity assessment by the world leading company BitSight to monitor in real time its cybersecurity posture and performance to stay ahead of the emerging cyber threats.\n\nSince 2018, the Group has subscribed to a cyber insurance policy to transfer a part of this risk.\n\nAs an illustration of the e/ffectiveness of the security measures in place, a sophisticated cyber incident took place on December/uni00A02, 2020 which was swiftly detected and blocked before any negative e/ffect could impact the business. No partner interfaces were impacted. Immediate mitigation measures were taken to suspend the assets used by the cybercriminals to connect to the network. All the connections in the Microsoft 365/uni00A0Cloud, and all user passwords and system passwords were reset within the framework of these mitigation measures. A special notification on how to protect and safeguard passwords was sent to all employees in both airlines as a precautionary measure. External parties specialized in cyber investigation in the Netherlands and in France were involved in analyzing and cleaning all the assets. In addition, this incident was reported to the relevant parties such as Risk Management, the DPO (Data Protection O/fficer) and to the authorities.\n\nIn 2021, three independent audits on IT Security were successfully performed to finetune the Cybercrime program action plan. The IT sta/ff dedicated to security were increased by 20% to adapt our organization to the new threats. New processes and tools were deployed to detect, protect and fix any potential deviations spotted or system vulnerabilities more rapidly. A new cyber awareness training module was approved at Executive Committee level to become mandatory for all sta/ff.\n\n## Data security\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs airline companies, Air/uni00A0France and KLM collect personal data from their customers and employees. Management of the Group's assets is supported by rigorous management of the required data, whose consistency and integrity presents a permanent challenge for IT projects, and in the operation of digital services. Frequent changes to both applications and processes call for the ongoing adaptation of IT management tools and methods, in coordination with the businesses and their regulatory and operational requirements. If the Group fails to implement such frequent changes or to protect data of a personal nature pursuant to the relevant laws and regulation, this could have a negative impact on the Group's activity, reputation, revenues and costs, and thus its results.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

The access controls to IT applications and to the computer files at each work station together with control over the data exchanged outside the Company all comply with rules pursuant to national, European and international standards. Campaigns to raise the awareness of all sta/ff on the potential threats and encourage best practices are regularly carried out. Specialized companies and Internal Audit regularly evaluate the e/ffectiveness of the solutions in place.\n\nData security is a priority for the Group, and specifically the protection of data of a personal nature pursuant to the relevant laws and regulations. The new EU General Data Protection Regulation No. 2016/679 ('GDPR') is being applied via the GDPR and NIS compliance programs. Within each company, specialist teams ensure that the processing of personal information by the company complies with the relevant legislation.\n\nIn each Air/uni00A0France and KLM company, the Data Privacy O/fficers define the applicable policies, promote the data protection culture and ensure the e/ffective fulfilment of the regulatory standards.\n\n## Business continuity and regulatory compliance\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe IT systems, including the revenue management systems and booking systems (including Altea) used by the Group, and the information they contain may be exposed to risks concerning continuity of functioning, data security and regulatory compliance. These risks have diverse origins both inside and outside the Group. The materialization of one of these risks could have an impact on the Group's activity, reputation, revenues and costs, and thus its results.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe Group Executive Vice-President Information Technology, assisted by the Group IT Committee and the Group Chief Information Security O/fficer, is responsible for managing the risks relating to their processes and defining, in particular, the IT and Telecommunications Security policy.\n\nThe context requires a high level of security, which is guaranteed by the mandate of the Group Executive Vice-President Information Technology and his sta/ff who are responsible for System security. Air/uni00A0 France and KLM ensure the allocation of the resources required to counter such threats, secure the information and guarantee the regulatory compliance of the information systems.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM monitors the secure functioning of the IT systems on a permanent basis. Dedicated help centers and redundant networks guarantee the availability and accessibility of data and IT processing in the event of major incidents.\n\nThe infrastructures of the back-up operating centers and business continuity plans are tested regularly. The access controls to the IT systems and to the data exchanged within the company are governed by rules which meet international laws and standards.\n\nCompanies specializing in IT security, Internal Audit and Internal Control all regularly evaluate the relevance and e/ffectiveness of the solutions in place.\n\nThe risk of damage to the IT facilities is covered by an insurance policy.\n\n## 3.1.3.2/emspace Operational performance and customer risks*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nFor customers, our operational performance is a cornerstone of the product. In the day-to-day operations, where there is pressure on airlines and growing congestion in airports and airlines, and where regulations are increasingly complex (e.g. security and health measures), within a context of social unrest within the airline industry but also externally (air tra/ffic control and ground handler strikes), increased tra/ffic volume brings with it a risk of sub-optimal operational performance or a lower standard of customer service, leading to an increase in the costs of operational performance and a reduction in levels of customer satisfaction, which can result in a negative impact on the Group's reputation.\n\nIn the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, as a result of needing to comply with governmental health and social distancing requirements, airports have, for example, only been open for limited hours leading to long turnaround times. The additional requirements in the departure and/or arrival processes are also causing delays and resulting in long passenger boarding and turnaround times. In addition, the risk of a lack of operational resources within Air/uni00A0France and KLM, or at airports (e.g. security, customs) and subcontractors (e.g. ground handlers), could a/ffect the planned restart of re-dimensioned operations or generate the associated costs.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nFor both Air/uni00A0France and KLM, the Operations Control Center is at the heart of operations and any disruption is managed in an integrated manner. Numerous action plans are deployed on operational excellence, service disruption management and recovery, security, network agility, the compensation procedure (EU 261), crew management and other critical internal and external resources, and coordination with key stakeholders like the authorities and airports. The goal is to reduce the number of service disruptions, reduce the impact on customers, improve customer satisfaction and reduce the costs of sub-optimal performance.",

The Group is currently involved in investigations in relation to anti-trust matters in the air-freight industry, initiated before the European Commission in December/uni00A02005 and still ongoing, and in the passenger sector (see Note/uni00A032.2.1/uni00A0to the Group's consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\nIn addition, the Group and, in particular, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as a company that is listed for trading, is also exposed to risks involving capital market compliance. Since July/uni00A02016, the EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) and many other national and European regulations have codified bans on insider trading and market manipulation, the obligation to make ad hoc announcements as well as other obligations relating to capital markets.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nVarious measures are in place to mitigate the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations. The preventive measures include, for example, guidelines in the form of manuals, policies and instructions to clarify expected and acceptable behavior, training in the form of e-learning as well as classroom-based training or training by video conference dedicated to certain domains (i.e procurement, IT, cargo and maintenance in 2021) or categories of personnel based on their risk exposure (managers, newly-hired or promoted employees), and the ability to report any compliance concerns.\n\nWith regard to competition law, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has developed its policy to prevent anti-competitive practices by circulating a Competition Law Compliance Manual which is available in three languages. An e-learning module on competition law was made available on December/uni00A014, 2021 for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM employees, and may subsequently be deployed in 2022 to the main subsidiaries with the assistance of the members of the compliance correspondents' network.\n\nOther prevention-based tools include dedicated training modules. Having completed this training and taken an evaluation test, employees sign an individual declaration promising to respect the competition rules applying to their functions.\n\nRegarding corruption, following the anti-bribery campaign at the end of 2019, ongoing e/fforts have been deployed to further strengthen the awareness and knowledge of employees regarding the prevention of bribery like, for example, presentations and discussions, improved access to compliance documents and communication by the Group's management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\nRegarding compliance with the requirements of the applicable capital markets, the Group has implemented internal documentation (i.e 'Compliance Rules regarding securities trading') and uses internal tools to compile insider lists, enabling it to publish any ad hoc announcements, and provide such insiders with the relevant policies, information letters and process descriptions to ensure their compliance and enforcement by the relevant employees and recipients. For more detail see section/uni00A04.5.3 'Business ethics'.\n\n## 3.1.3.4/emspace Working conditions and human capital development\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nEmployees are at the heart of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and maintaining their trust is vital to enabling them to attain their highest standards of performance to the benefit of customers. Employee engagement, talent development and social stability is imperative for the long-term viability and success of the company.\n\nThe sta/ff in the di/fferent Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group entities have di/fferent (local) HR contracts and policies which comply with the corporate form of each of the entities and employment legislation in force in their respective countries. Strategic changes and changes impacting the working conditions of sta/ff are applied pursuant to the legislation and protocols as defined for each of the entities comprising the Group.\n\nIn the past and potentially in future, the Group's operations may be disrupted by labor disputes such as strikes, walkouts, industrial action or other forms of social unrest, which could also have a negative impact on the Group's operations, profitability and image.\n\nIn particular, in the context of the Covid-19 health crisis and its impact on the Group's activities, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and their subsidiaries have been forced to implement measures to reduce labor costs for the various categories of sta/ff and major sta/ff reduction and reorganization plans. They may be forced to do so again in the future.\n\nThe measures taken by the Group in this context may result in a decline in employee engagement, motivation and commitment at work, and di/fficulty in recruiting and retaining key competencies owing to, inter alia: uncertainty about the future of the Group and their own employment or worries about the economic situation; remote working and partial activity (activit\u00e9 partielle) resulting in reduced contact with colleagues and management; Voluntary Departure Plans, salary reductions, an increasing workload and loss of expertise. Absenteeism may also rise due to employees being infected with Covid-19 at work or outside the professional environment, also leading to fear of infection (e.g at work or in public transport). There is also a risk of the closure of crucial departments due to an internal Covid-19 outbreak, meaning that specialized functions cannot be performed, leading to serious operational problems for the Group.",

At the same time, the Group seeks to preserve cohesion by fostering a constructive and transparent workplace dialogue and by pursuing a policy based on respect and responsibility. Internal communication has been swiftly adapted to the new situation in terms of both frequency and resources, with sta/ff connecting remotely and with new interactive ways to share their questions and concerns.\n\nTo ensure the e/ffective coordination of the workplace dialogue, responsibilities and accountabilities are defined for each entity and category of sta/ff. At Group level, coordination takes place between the di/fferent entities, specifically for transverse topics concerning categories of sta/ff across several entities. Significant changes to the HR policies and collective labor agreements are approved at the highest level of management within the airlines and the Group.\n\nVarious initiatives aimed at improving the workplace dialogue are planned and implemented in the di/fferent Group entities.\n\nIn Air/uni00A0France and KLM, an Employee Promotor Score indicator has been implemented to measure the engagement of employees.\n\n## 3.1.4/emspace Legal  risks\n\nDuring their ordinary course of business, the Group's companies may be involved in legal, administrative, criminal, or arbitration proceedings, especially concerning civil liability, competition, industrial, fiscal, or intellectual property claims, or claims relating to the environment and discrimination. In some of these proceedings, significant monetary claims have been made or may be made against one or more Group companies. The relevant provisions, if any, that the Group may have to record in its financial statements may not be su/fficient, which could have a material adverse e/ffect on its business, financial position, results and outlook. As of December/uni00A031, 2021, the Group's total provisions for litigation amounted to \u20ac424/uni00A0million (see Note/uni00A032 in section/uni00A05.6 \"Notes to the consolidated financial statements\").\n\nNew proceedings, stemming from existing proceedings or otherwise, related to risks already identified by the Group or to new risks, could be initiated against a Group entity. Should these proceedings result in an unfavorable outcome, there could be a significant adverse e/ffect on the Group's business, financial position, results and outlook. With the exception of the proceedings and litigation outlined in Notes/uni00A032.1 and 32.2 in section/uni00A05.6 \"Notes to the consolidated financial statements\", there are no other administrative, legal or arbitration proceedings\n\nThe results feed into local action plans aimed at improving employee engagement and opening up the dialogue between managers and their teams. Decreasing the distance between management and sta/ff is key to understanding the needs and concerns of sta/ff, tackling any issues in a proactive manner and avoiding any escalation.\n\nThe level of employee engagement is included in the targets for the highest level of management within Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. Continuous monitoring takes place and the methodology will be subject to ongoing improvement (see section/uni00A04.2 'Human Resources').\n\nRegarding the consequences of the measures implemented by the Group within the context of the Covid-19 epidemic, the Group has maintained its openness and transparency with unions, with negotiations based on relationships of trust. Given its reduced workforce the Group is focused on optimizing and transforming its ways of working, by reviewing organizational structures and workloads, and by e/fficient communication,/uni00A0etc. The Group is also seeking to minimize the impact on employees physically present at the Group's premises and has implemented a specific and detailed health protocol to ensure the mitigation of contamination risk, in close cooperation with the health and safety committees.\n\n(including, to the Group's knowledge, any proceedings under way or threats of proceedings) that could have or have recently had a material e/ffect on the Group's financial position or profitability in the past twelve months.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nOngoing procedures are regularly monitored and analyzed by the legal department, with the support of external legal counsel where necessary.\n\nIf necessary, provisions may be recorded in the Group's financial statements in respect of these disputes. The Group's estimate of its financial exposure to pending proceedings is regularly reassessed in the light of changes in such proceedings, and the amount of the corresponding provisions is adjusted accordingly to the best of the Group's knowledge. These amounts are also reviewed and validated by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nCertain risks relating to these procedures are also covered, under certain conditions, by the insurance policies taken out by the Group and outlined in section 3.1.1 \"Geopolitical and macro-economic risks\".",

Furthermore, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to increased pressure on fleet financing, with lenders requiring additional guarantees and charging higher interest rates, within a context where the renewal of the Group's fleet is important for the years to come, particularly owing to its/uni00A0CO2 reduction commitments.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's net debt stood at \u20ac8.2/uni00A0billion, taking into account net cash of \u20ac7.7/uni00A0billion (not including \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion of undrawn credit lines).\n\nThis level of liquidity is fairly comfortable in terms of the Group's ability to perform operations for the coming years.\n\nHowever, bond redemptions and refinancing within the market will be significant. This is why the Group initiated an amendment and extension to the loan guaranteed by the French State (Pr\u00eat Garanti par l'\u00c9tat - PGE), to smooth the impact of the \u20ac4/uni00A0billion to be redeemed in May/uni00A02023. After an early redemption of \u20ac0.5/uni00A0billion in December/uni00A02021, the redemption schedule is now as follows:\n\n- -  May/uni00A02023:  \u20ac0.8/uni00A0billion;\n- -  May/uni00A02024:  \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion;\n- -  May/uni00A02025:  \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion.\n\nThis step should provide an adequate liquidity cushion for the Group.\n\n## Cash and liquidity requirements linked to the impact of the current public health crisis\n\nWithin the framework of the current public health crisis linked to Covid-19 and its negative impact on the Group's activities, balance sheet and financial position, and to strengthen its capital, following its first step of recapitalization, the Group realized a major recapitalization plan in April/uni00A02021 consisting of two operations: a \u20ac1/uni00A0billion capital increase and the conversion of the \u20ac3/uni00A0billion French State direct loan into three \u20ac1/uni00A0billion tranches of undated deeply subordinated notes, for a total of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\nThe other measures include the issuance of senior bonds for \u20ac800/uni00A0million in June/uni00A02021 (with settlement and delivery taking place in July/uni00A02021) and the partial redemption of the PGE for \u20ac500/uni00A0million as mentioned above.\n\nIn the meantime, additional measures to further strengthen the Group and its subsidiaries' equity are currently under consideration, including equity and quasi-equity instruments (to allow for smooth debt profiling). Furthermore, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air/uni00A0France also has a legal obligation to reconstitute its stockholders' equity by December/uni00A031, 2023.\n\nIn the unlikely event of a further deterioration in the health situation and/or the economic environment, this plan could prove insu/fficient, and thus require the Group to further reinforce its financial structure with, as the case may be, the risk of not being able to raise funds in the capital markets under favorable conditions, in view of the deteriorating context.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe financing strategy is decided by the Group in coordination with the Air/uni00A0France Group and the KLM Group. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's financing is mainly composed of unsecured bond debt and/or the issuance of equity or quasi-equity capital, and debt collateralized by assets at the level of the Companies. For the bonds, the issuer is mainly Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0S.A.\n\nFurthermore, in view of the Group's investment program, particularly in the fleet, Air/uni00A0France and KLM plan to be active in the financing market. In the current market conditions, the Group and its airlines thus intend to finance its forthcoming aircraft deliveries using, notably, collateralized debt. These financing or refinancing operations will, as usual, be the subject of requests for proposals.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, the Group and the Companies plan to adapt their financing strategy:\n\n- -  priority recourse to capital market financing via Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0S.A.;\n- -  diversification of the asset-financing structures by the Air/uni00A0France and KLM subsidiaries via secured financing;\n- -  diversification of the banking and/or financial counterparties;\n- -  solicitation of a ESG rating.\n\nIn July/uni00A02021, the EMTN (Euro Medium Term Notes) program was implemented to facilitate and simplify the rapid issuance of bonds when the market conditions are favorable.\n\nFurthermore, an ESG rating (64/100) has been established in cooperation with S&P Global, to support the Group to access sustainable financing.",

The hedging uses simple futures or option-based instruments, eligible for hedging pursuant to the accounting standards in force.\n\nIn respect of the application of IFRS/uni00A09, hedging by component has applied since January/uni00A01, 2018. Since the Group's fuel procurement is strongly correlated to the Jet Kerosene Cargoes CIF NWE Index, components specific to this fuel risk are used (Brent ICE, Gasoil ICE, Jet CIF NWE) to align the fuel hedging accounting and the Group's risk management policy more e/ffectively.\n\nWithin the framework of a dynamic risk monitoring approach, the Group tracks indicators capping the potential maximum loss and the potential maximum gain (value of the portfolio prompting its restructuring).\n\nAn indicator enabling the measurement of the extreme risk of the portfolio has been deployed. The level of this Value at Risk indicator is calculated and regularly analyzed and may also trigger a restructuring of the portfolio.\n\nFollowing the Covid-19 public health crisis and the unforeseeable reduction in the volume of fuel used during 2020, like most European airlines, the Group found itself in a situation of overhedging which led to a financial loss being recognized in the 2020 financial results. Faced with this situation, and the uncertainty which continued to weigh on capacity growth in 2021 and 2022, together with the tightening of the credit facilities granted by the financial partners, on February/uni00A017, 2021 the Risk Management Committee (RMC) submitted a revised hedging policy to the Board which approved it. Compared with the previous policy, the latter is characterized by a reduction in the timespan of the hedges, from a rolling 24/uni00A0months to a rolling 12/uni00A0months, and a reduction in the hedge amounts, from an equivalent of 80% to 50% of the annual volume consumed. This revised policy is now implemented by the Air/uni00A0France and KLM fuel departments.\n\nThe Group has decided to continue the systematic imple\u00ad mentation of the hedging policy, in spite of the uncertainties linked to the Ukrainian crisis.\n\n## 3.1.5.3/emspace Currency  risks\n\nMost of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's revenues are generated in euros. However, because of its international activities, the Group incurs currency exchange risks.\n\nThe Group's main exposure relates to the US dollar. Since expenditures on items such as fuel and maintenance exceed the amount of overall revenues in US dollars, the Group is a net buyer of US dollars, representing a residual structural risk. As a result, any significant appreciation in the US dollar against the euro could result in a negative impact on the Group's financial results.\n\nOn the contrary, the Group is a net seller of other currencies, the level of its revenues in currencies other than the US dollar exceeding its expenditures in the same currencies. This exposure is, however, much lower than with the US dollar. A significant decline in these currencies against the euro could nevertheless have a negative e/ffect on the Group's financial results.",

For airlines generating US dollar revenues, the revaluation of this debt in US dollars is neutralized at the accounting level through the recognition of this debt as a natural hedge against a fraction of the Group's US dollar revenues. With the Covid-19 public health crisis, as soon as the revenues in US dollars became too low relative to the lease payments, the hedge accounting was temporarily suspended for the coming periods. For airlines not generating US dollar revenues, US dollar-denominated assets and currency hedges are in place to mitigate the exchange rate risk.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, the exchange rate risk on the debt, other than coming from operating leases, denominated in currencies other than the euro mostly concerns the yen (6%), the US dollar (5%) and the Swiss franc (3%).\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe exchange rate risk on the non-operating lease debt (nonIFRS/uni00A016) is limited. At December/uni00A031, 2021, 86% of the Group's gross debt, after taking into account derivative instruments, was euro-denominated, thereby significantly reducing the risk of currency fluctuation on the debt.\n\n## 3.1.5.6/emspace Interest rate risk\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nA portion of the overall debt is linked to floating rates and, even though Euribor may be capped in some contractual arrangements, the Group is thus exposed to volatility risk.\n\nAfter swaps, the exposure to floating rates of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's consolidated debt represents 50% of the total debt. The interest rate on the Group's gross debt after swaps stood at 2.23% at December/uni00A031, 2021 (versus 2.55% at December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nThe risk management of the Group's overall currency exposure is carried out on the basis of a forecast net exposure for each currency. Currencies highly correlated to the US dollar are usually aggregated with the US dollar exposure.\n\nFor each currency hedged, the time span of the hedging is a rolling 12/uni00A0to 24-month period, the first four quarters being relatively more hedged than the following four. The RMC sets hedging targets for the US dollar, sterling and the yen on a quarterly basis.",

They are invested in money market mutual funds, and, secondarily, in debt securities and term deposits with highly-rated banks. The investment risk is considered to be low, in that the investments in debt securities and term deposits are managed within the framework of the overall counterparty management (see paragraph 3.1.5.8).\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nTo reduce the currency risk on the debt, a portion of KLM's liquid assets is invested in foreign-currency AAA and AA+ rated bonds.\n\n## 3.1.5.8/emspace Counterparty risk exposure\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nTo mitigate the di/fferent market risks to which it is exposed, Air/uni00A0France works with a number of financial counterparties. In the event of default by a counterparty in a liability position vis-\u00e0-vis Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM on a derivatives portfolio, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM could lose the gain linked to the hedging required to be the subject of a termination. Except in the event of express dispensation from the RMC, counterparties must benefit from a minimum rating of BBB+ (S&P) with the exception of mutual funds where the risk is considered negligible. The maximum commitments by counterparty are determined based on the quality and ranking of their ratings. The RMC also monitors the trend in the respective proportion each counterparty represents in the overall hedging portfolio (fuel, currency and interest rate) and investments. The positions of both Air/uni00A0France and KLM, together with those of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM parent company, are taken into account in the assessment of the overall exposure.\n\n## Mitigating principles and actions\n\nThe rules concerning counterparty risk management are established by the RMC and applied within each company.\n\nA monthly report is established and circulated to the members of the General Management of the two airline companies. It is supplemented by real time information in the event of any real risk of a rating downgrading for counterparties.",

        "page_content": "In addition to the regulatory approvals enabling each company to carry out its activities, progress is recognized in the achievement of certification from independent bodies, notably, for example:\n\n## For Air/uni00A0France:\n\n- - IOSA certification (IATA Operational Safety Audit) since September/uni00A02005, renewed in 2021;\n- - Air/uni00A0France global IMS certification based on the ISO/uni00A014001/ Environment, ISO/uni00A022000/uni00A0certification for food health renewed in 2021.\n\n## For KLM:\n\n- - the ISO/uni00A014001/Environment and ISO/uni00A0500001/Energy certifications were renewed in 2021;\n- - IOSA certification (IATA Operational Safety Audit): The audit was performed in the autumn of 2020 and the renewal of the certificate took place in March/uni00A02021.\n\n## Quality assurance\n\nControl over the operational processes is based primarily on three monitoring methods:\n\nInternal monitoring is carried out by the quality assurance departments articulated around:\n\n- - an audit and inspection program (covering, in particular, organization and management, flight operations, in-flight service, flight planning, ground handling and freight, hazardous merchandise, engineering and maintenance);\n- - regular monitoring of operations with incident analysis and routine use of debriefing;\n- - proactive prevention processes.\n\nExternal monitoring is carried out by the Civil Aviation Authorities (IVW-DL, DGAC, FAA,/uni00A0etc.) and specialized certification bodies, and takes the form of audits of the operating principles and of the Group's proprietary internal monitoring system. Air/uni00A0France and KLM are also regularly audited by their customers and partners.\n\n## Monitoring of partners\n\nControl over sub-contractors and suppliers is undertaken within the framework of the regulatory monitoring program approved by the Civil Aviation Authorities.\n\nCode share partnerships are subject to an additional requirement to comply with IOSA standards that are recognized by the profession as the ultimate reference in Flight Safety and Security. The general rule is that partners are IOSA certified except in the specific case when, for example, the size of aircraft excludes the airline from the IOSA scope. In this case, the partner airline is not IOSA certified, Air/uni00A0France and KLM implement a special technical monitoring process aimed at providing a reasonable assurance of an equivalent level.\n\nIn terms of control over the monitoring process, the supervision of the e/ffective implementation of preventive/remedial actions resulting from this overall monitoring is ensured by the quality assurance departments, coordinated within each airline.\n\nMore generally, the sub-contractor control procedure addresses all the areas of risk. It is reflected in the realization of monitoring activities like audits, inspections and checks, sometimes carried out by the sub-contractors themselves. Monitoring is ensured on a quarterly basis. An expanded transverse action plan is in place, taking into consideration the new legislation on the duty of vigilance. More globally an action plan covering the monitoring of sub-contractor activity is deployed in the di/fferent Air/uni00A0France entities and coordinated at the corporate transverse level in dedicated steering committees.\n\n## Information systems\n\nThe control procedures cover the information and telecommunication systems.\n\nThese procedures aim to ensure the:\n\n- - reliability of the IT and telecommunications systems;\n- - integrity of the data through the appropriate resources, infrastructure and checks;\n- - continuity of IT services and the availability of data at the production sites through a local contingency strategy, secure architecture and a security system covering external access points;\n- - confidentiality of information within the framework of national laws and the security of IT infrastructures through the establishment of secure, monitored and e/ffective accesses.\n\nThe managements of the Air/uni00A0France Group and the KLM Group ensure that the resources and expertise required by the information systems are developed within the framework of defined strategic objectives.\n\nProject management and software application development tools are also deployed: the so-called Symphony method for common Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM projects was based on the Tempo (Air/uni00A0France) and Prince2/Steelband (KLM) methods. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has adopted an 'Agile' development process based on the SCRUM and DEVOPS methodologies. The main aims are to generate business line added value more rapidly, accelerate 'Time to Market', align IT and business line objectives by prioritizing value, avoiding the development of rarely-used functionalities, reducing the risks at the earliest-possible opportunity, streamlining the development and maintenance processes and increasing the e/ffectiveness of the teams.\n\nThe work carried out in connection with Internal Control projects and the ongoing project to gradually establish a coordinated and optimized organization is leading to the launch of action plans designed to strengthen Internal Control, particularly with regard to risks like business continuity and personal data protection.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's Information Technology division defines the policies establishing the framework for the functioning, security and consistency of the information systems deployed and has published a Security Information Manual (ISM ISO/uni00A027001/uni00A0standard), establishing a common security policy for information systems.\n\n## Procurement\n\nThe common Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Procurement organization has been operational since September/uni00A01, 2008, and is headed by a Group Chief Procurement O/fficer from KLM, seconded by an Air/uni00A0France Senior Vice-President, Procurement. It is structured around seven procurement teams. These procurement teams act in a transverse and coordinated manner for each of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Air/uni00A0France and KLM as well as for, when required, a number of the Group's airline subsidiaries.\n\nThe activity of the Procurement function aims to supply the entities with suitable products and services at the required time, at the best possible cost of ownership and at the lowest possible risks.\n\nThis is achieved by applying a procurement policy focused on the expertise of the buyers, with separate responsibilities (buyer, prescriber and supplier), the establishment of contracts and the use of various (electronic) tools.\n\nThe CPO Board, comprising the Group Chief Procurement O/fficer from KLM and Air/uni00A0France's Senior Vice-President, Procurement, coordinates the Procurement teams through regular meetings and presents the procurement performance and developments to the CFOs on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe Heads of Procurement meet on a regular basis in the di/fferent structures (e.g. the Quarterly Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM DPO Meeting, a Quarterly Performance Meeting, direct meetings between Heads,/uni00A0etc.) to develop joint programs and share best practices.\n\nTo assess the risks related to sustainability (environmental, ethics, procurement, social) vendors are analyzed and evaluated by EcoVadis, a company mandated by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, with the emphasis on high-risk segments such as production in low-cost countries, and with a minimum score requirement. In addition,\n\nall procurement-managed vendors are required to commit to a Code of Conduct, reflecting Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's sustainability requirements.\n\nAll new vendors are assessed on their level of financial risk on the basis of the Dun & Bradstreet evaluation. Risk reduction strategies are required for vendors with a high level of financial risk.\n\nLastly, to reduce the risks at Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM level, all contracts with vendors include clauses on anti-bribery, personal data handling and other relevant risk areas.\n\n## Prevention of ticketing fraud\n\nA fraud prevention unit is responsible for preventing, insofar as possible, the risks relating to the:\n\n- - fraudulent use of illegally-purchased tickets (credit cards and other means of payment);\n- - protection of loyalty programs (individual and corporate clients) in terms of both earn and burn;\n- - internal fraud.\n\nA fraud prevention activity report was submitted to the Audit Committee in October/uni00A02021.\n\nBoth Air/uni00A0France and KLM have put in place whistle-blower procedures and an e-learning anti-fraud training module aimed mainly at the sales teams.\n\n## Prevention of financial fraud\n\nDue to the proliferation of cases of attempted fraud, the Group has strengthened its internal control processes with detailed instruction notes, e-learning modules and training/information sessions.\n\n## Evaluation and monitoring of Internal Control\n\nWhen establishing its internal control framework and risk management process, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM chose the COSO 2013 (Committee Of Sponsoring Organisation of the Treadway Commission) standard and the COBIT 5 (Control Objectives for Information and related Technology) as its starting point.\n\n## 3.3.3/emspace Internal control relating to the establishment and processing of financial and accounting information\n\nBased on an analysis of the significant entries in the consolidated financial statements and an assessment of the risks, the Airlines have identified the most significant divisions and subsidiaries and, within these divisions, the processes that make a predominant contribution to the establishment of the financial statements.\n\nThe Group's major divisions and subsidiaries had thus evaluated the e/ffectiveness of their Internal Control relating to financial information as at December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nPursuant to Article L./uni00A0823-19/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Audit Committee oversees the process to establish the financial information and, when necessary, formulates recommendations to guarantee the integrity of the process to establish the financial information, the e/ffectiveness of the Internal Control and risk management procedures and, as necessary, of Internal Audit, as regards the procedures required to establish and process the accounting and financial information, with no compromise to its independence. It also ensures the realization by the Statutory Auditors of their mission and respect by the Statutory Auditors of the conditions for their independence.",

This Group Investment Committee is composed of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Chief Financial O/fficer and the Chief Financial O/fficers of Air/uni00A0France and KLM.\n\nAll investments of more than \u20ac5/uni00A0million, together with operations relating to the fleet, and shareholding and divestment transactions, are submitted for approval to the Group Executive Committee by the Group's Management Controller and the Group's Chief Financial O/fficer.\n\nThe management of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's market risks is overseen by the Risk Management Committee (RMC), which meets at least each quarter to define the risk management strategy of the Group, and, after examining the various Group risk reports, determines the hedges to be set up during the coming quarters, with notably, the hedging ratios to be achieved, the time period for respecting these targets and, potentially, the preferred type of hedging instrument.\n\nThese decisions are then implemented in each company by the respective Treasury Management departments, pursuant to the procedures for the delegation of powers.\n\nRegular meetings are organized between the Treasury Management departments of the two companies, to optimize the coordination of recommendations made to the RMC and subsequent decision implementation (hedging instruments, the strategies planned and counterparties).\n\nThe fuel hedges are covered in a weekly report forwarded to the General Managements of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Air/uni00A0France and KLM. A summary of the cash positions of Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is communicated weekly to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's General Management.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM cash positions are the subject of monthly reports to the Finance departments. These reports include the interest rate and currency positions, the portfolio of hedging operations, a summary of investments and financing by currency and a tracking statement of the risk exposure by counterparty. The Risk Management Committee sets the minimum thresholds in terms of the financial quality of counterparties, determines the maximum amount to be allocated to a single counterparty and is responsible for monitoring the quarterly positions.\n\nThe hedge strategies aim to reduce the exposure of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and therefore to preserve budgeted margins. The instruments used are futures, swaps and options. The internal risk management procedures prohibit instruments characterized as trading instruments unless expressly authorized by the Chief Financial O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. All the instruments used must qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to the IAS/IFRS accounting rules. Generally speaking, no trading or speculation is authorized.\n\nAny substantive change in the hedging strategy is the subject of a systematic presentation to the Group Audit Committee.\n\n## Accounting and financial statements process\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group are prepared on the basis of the data provided by the finance departments of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM holding company and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group is principally composed of the two operational sub-Groups, Air/uni00A0France and KLM, which prepare their own consolidated financial statements prior to their consolidation within the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM financial statements.\n\nIt is imperative that the accounting information reported by the di/fferent companies complies with the Group's accounting rules, methods and standards as defined by the Group, and the presentation of the financial statements must comply with the format circulated by the Group.\n\nAll the companies within the Group refer to the Accounting Procedures Manual which is based on the International Financial Reporting Standards governing the establishment of the financial statements of European listed companies.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are submitted to the General Management then presented to the Audit Committee every quarter. Furthermore, the half-year and annual financial statements are also audited by the Statutory Auditors prior to their formal closure.\n\nThe parent company's financial statements are the subject of a presentation to the General Management and the Audit Committee, are approved by the Board of Directors and are audited by the Statutory Auditors.\n\n## Process for reporting passenger and cargo revenues\n\nThis process is performed in each of the companies and enables monthly revenue figures to be communicated to management. Furthermore, Air/uni00A0France and KLM have established a procedure known as the 'progressive daily revenue' process making it possible to know the estimated amount of passenger revenues for the previous day.\n\nIn addition, departments of the Group, Air/uni00A0France and KLM analyze the results by market and by route (unit revenues per revenue passenger-kilometer, per available seat-kilometer, per revenue ton-kilometer/uni00A0etc.) at the level of the passenger and cargo businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The same applies to the figures on cash-flow, and the cash and debt positions.\n\nThis monthly Group management report is distributed to the Group Executive Committee and presented to the CEO Committee by the Group's Chief Financial O/fficer.\n\nIn addition, management review meetings take place on at least a quarterly basis between the CEOs, CFOs and Executive VicePresidents of the Passenger, Cargo, Engineering & Maintenance and Transavia businesses.",

When the information relates to a di/fferent scope, the scope of application is specified in the text.\n\n## 4.1/emspace CREATING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS\n\n## 4.1.1/emspace The Group's business model\n\nThe world has been traversing a major public health crisis. The global fight against Covid-19 has had a severe impact on our economies and societies. This is an unprecedented chapter in the history of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, as well as for the airline industry as a whole. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is committed to tackling this crisis and demonstrating that we have all the assets we need to overcome it, as we have done repeatedly throughout our history.\n\nThe Group's business brings together people, economies and cultures, and drives economic growth and social progress. The overarching ambition of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is to become an aviation champion in Europe, while assuming its role as a pioneer in sustainable aviation. As such, flight and health security are both an absolute imperative that the Group owes to its customers and sta/ff, and a daily commitment.\n\nfundamental strengths and unique competitive advantages, enables a response to the societal and sustainability challenges. As part of its day-to-day activities, the Group interacts with all its stakeholders (employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, authorities, local communities and players in civil society like NGOs,/uni00A0etc.), while its activities and operations have multiple impacts on wider society.\n\nThe main impacts, both quantitative and qualitative, are summarized in the 'Reporting of the Group's extra-financial risks' paragraph in section/uni00A04.1.2 'Identification of the key priorities for building long-term relationships'. The policies implemented are outlined in sections 4.2/uni00A0to 4.6.\n\nThe post-crisis world will no longer be the same. Within this context, the fundamentals of our strategy, in particular our commitment to sustainability, remain and are being accelerated.\n\nThe value creation model shows the impact areas where the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group adds value and which, thanks to its\n\n## 4.1.2/emspace Identification of the key priorities for building long-term relationships\n\nOngoing dialogue and a mutual understanding of the challenges facing Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and its environment are key to building long-term relationships with stakeholders.\n\n## Dialogue with stakeholders\n\nThe Group pays a great deal of attention to the expectations of its stakeholders, in particular its customers, shareholders, employees, the authorities and national policy makers, its suppliers, associations and local communities, and players in civil society, like NGOs. A number of initiatives enable their perception to be evaluated on a regular basis through, notably:\n\n- -  internal barometers and meetings to gather employee suggestions;\n- -  customer perception and satisfaction surveys;\n\n- -  regular exchanges with individual shareholders, mainstream and Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) investors together with recommendations from extra-financial ratings agencies;\n- -  dialogue with the authorities and national policy makers;\n- -  dialogue and evaluation of supplier CSR performance;\n- -  exchange of best practices and working groups within the industry, and with other large companies;\n- -  opinions and remarks gleaned from the dedicated email addresses, websites and the social media;\n- -  feedback channels deployed to enable stakeholders (particularly employees, customers and local residents around airports) to communicate any comments and complaints.",

        "page_content": "Every two years, the Group carries out materiality analyses, enabling the priorities key to the Group's activity to be re-evaluated and the results to be compared with those from previous materiality analyses. Group stakeholders like corporate and individual customers, employees, shareholders, investors, suppliers, NGOs, governmental organizations, local representatives from the Paris and Schiphol regions, sustainability managers from leading companies and representatives of the airline sector and the Group's peers, are requested to reassess the key priorities of the Group's activity. For each topic, the respondents rank the level of priority to be accorded by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and their perception of the Group's current level of performance.\n\nThe materiality analysis carried out in 2021 reaffirmed the priorities deemed to be the most important for the Group in 2019. Customer Satisfaction, Fleet development, Reducing/uni00A0CO2 Emissions, Financial Performance and Safety (flight, health safety and security) remain the top materiality issues raised by stakeholders. The 2021 materiality analysis also shows the growing concern surrounding Sustainable Aviation Fuel, sustainable supply chain management and climate change in the impact of the Group's activity. Innovation is also a concern for our customers. The detailed results highlight that the Group and its stakeholders agree on the perception of the priority nature of these issues.\n\nWithin the framework of this analysis, stakeholders also ranked a list of strategic priorities potentially impacting the sector's long-term growth, namely: the acceptability of the environmental impacts of aviation, the use of sustainable alternative fuels, changing customer behavior, control over the carbon reduction trajectory and fair competition between airlines all headed the list.\n\nIn 2021, BlueLink, the Group's largest non-aviation subsidiary, a specialist in customer relations in the airline, luxury, tourism and cultural sectors, also carried out a consultation process with all its stakeholders: a map of 15/uni00A0issues drawn up by the Management Committee were ranked in order of priority by the various stakeholders of BlueLink. More than 400/uni00A0employees worldwide, the company's Board, trade unions, government entities, customers, the different key partners and various representatives of the local community all participated in this process. As a result of this consultation process, a sustainability strategy was built based on three priority issues on which BlueLink will focus over the next three years (2022-24): human capital development, sta/ff engagement and local & environmental impact. An additional four issues have been identified and\n\nwill continue to guide its actions on a daily basis: customer engagement, economic impact, data security and responsibility & business ethics. By focusing on these three priority issues and consolidating the four additional issues, BlueLink seeks to contribute to attaining UN Sustainable Development Goals 5, 8, 9, 10 and 13/thinspace (1) . By pursuing and developing its sustainable development strategy, BlueLink's ambition is to be a responsible, solid and e/fficient international group, focused on business development, innovation and sta/ff engagement.\n\n## Analysis of the extra-financial risks\n\nThe extra-financial risks are monitored on a permanent basis and are an integral part of the Group's operational risk sheets. They are also an integral part of the Group's Sustainable Development strategy and are the subject of measures, monitoring procedures and action plans.\n\nThe Group reviews its main extra-financial risks and opportunities on an annual basis. The main environmental, social and societal risks resulting from its activities across the entire value chain are evaluated to establish a matrix of the extra-financial risks. The results are reconciled with those of the materiality matrix which illustrates the di/ffering perceptions of the internal and external stakeholders.\n\nWithin the Board of Directors, the main extra-financial risks are discussed and reviewed each year by the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee, then validated by the Audit Committee. These risks and the policies implemented are outlined in chapter/uni00A03 'Risk and risk management' and in sections 4.2/uni00A0to 4.6.\n\n## Reporting of the Group's extra-financial risks\n\nIn 2020, the extra-financial risks analysis enabled a re-evaluation of the main risks to which the Group must respond and these risks were outlined in its Extra-financial performance statement.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Group's priorities, the related risks and the opportunities deemed to be the most material, the policies in force to reduce their impacts, the performance indicators and the Group's contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For each topic, the risks are ranked by order of importance. The most material issues are marked with an asterisk. In addition, wherever possible, key performance indicators have been added.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The Board of Directors and Executive Committees ensure that sustainability topics are given high priority and the sustainability teams report frequently to the most senior levels of management. They make sure that sustainability decisions are taken at the right level within all the relevant entities:\n\n- -  the Board of Directors approves the strategic orientations and monitors their implementation;\n- -  within the Board of Directors, the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee, established in 2018, assists in reviewing the risks and policies, by issuing recommendations and ensuring that issues linked to sustainable development are taken into account when defining the Group's strategy. In particular, twice a year, the Sustainable Development and\n\nCompliance Committee reviews the risks linked to climate change and the remedial measures in place. Having taken into account the recommendations of the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee, the Audit Committee approves the review of the main extra-financial risks on an annual basis;\n\n- -  the Group Executive Committee determines the sustainable development policy and ensures that it is an integral part of the Group's strategic planning. It reviews the sustainable development strategy and performance on an annual basis. The Group's Corporate Secretary is responsible for the Sustainability and Compliance department;\n- -  at Air/uni00A0France, the Sustainable Development policy is steered by the Executive Vice-President, Corporate Secretary, who is a member of the Air/uni00A0France Executive Committee, supported by Air/uni00A0France's Sustainable Development Committee composed of members of the Air/uni00A0France Executive Committee, which guides and ensures the advancement of Air/uni00A0France's sustainability strategy and e/fforts. At KLM, this role is fulfilled by the Executive Vice-President General Counsel & Corporate Center who is a member of the KLM Executive Committee, supported by KLM's Sustainable Development Council, which guides and ensures the advancement of KLM's sustainability strategy and e/fforts.",

The same sustainable development criteria are also included in the variable portion of the compensation of Anne Rigail, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France and Pieter Elbers, President & Chief Executive O/fficer of KLM.\n\n## Centralized and transversal responsibility for sustainability\n\n## Initiation, coordination and management of activities related to sustainability\n\nThe Group and airline Sustainability Departments are tasked with proposing and implementing the sustainable development strategy. The teams align their actions and policies in a weekly meeting known as the 'Sustainability Circle'. Department Sustainability Leaders act as multipliers in their respective business units. These sustainability champions function as a network in close cooperation with their Sustainability Departments as well as their own EVP/SVPs, to initiate, embed and accelerate sustainability topics within their functions.\n\nIn addition, during 2021, a Decarbonization Committee was established as a cross-functional internal management body for the review and strategic advancement of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Decarbonization Road Map and its execution.\n\n## Commitments\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM assumes its responsibilities as an employer and economic partner. It places its commitment to responsible and innovative corporate citizenship at the heart of its strategy. The Group's commitments are set forth in its Corporate Social Responsibility Statement, The Air France-KLM Principles and its Climate Action Plan.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Sustainable Development policy enshrines the respect of fundamental rights as defined in the leading international principles: Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) guiding principles.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003 and is committed to respecting its ten principles in the areas of Human Rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption, and to promoting this commitment to its partners. By integrating sustainability into its business and operations, the Group strives to contribute significantly to the attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals within its scope of influence.\n\n## Extra-financial ratings\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM assesses its extra-financial performance on a regular basis through the ratings of RobecoSAM (DJSI), Ecovadis, CDP, Vigeo Eiris, MSCI, Sustainalytics and ISS-ESG.\n\nIn 2021, for the seventeenth year running, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM figured in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI World and DJSI Europe) and, for the second consecutive year, the Ecovadis sustainability rating agency awarded the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group the Platinum Medal (highest recognition for the top 1% highest label) while CDP awarded the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group a score of C (awareness level) for the Climate Change rating questionnaire.\n\nFurthermore, in 2021, to objectify its ESG performance and improve its strategy and practices, Air France-KLM proactively requested an independent ESG rating from Standard and Poor's, becoming the first airline group to be evaluated through a requested ESG rating. Standard & Poor's (S&P) Global Ratings thus assigned to Air France-KLM an ESG score of 64/100. With this rating, the Group is well positioned among the players in the airline industry with regard to the management of its significant exposure to environmental challenges. S&P underlined that Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM was well prepared to manage the ESG risks faced by airlines in the short and medium term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

It may play an important role in helping the EU scale up sustainable investment and implement the European green deal. The EU taxonomy provides companies, investors and policymakers with appropriate definitions and criteria to be met by economic activities to be considered environmentally sustainable. The Taxonomy Regulation was published in the O/fficial Journal of the European Union on June/uni00A022, 2020 and entered into force on July/uni00A012, 2020, with a first application in the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nIn 2021, as air transport and the maintenance of aircraft are not included in the delegated acts related to the taxonomy, the share of eligible activities in the Group's turnover is nil. Globally, in compliance with the definition provided by the Taxonomy Regulation, 1.8/uni00A0percent of the Group's capital expenditure and 1.4/uni00A0percent of its operational expenses, are eligible to the taxonomy. These percentages are mainly driven by investments and costs related\n\nto Energy, Waste Management and Remediation, Transport, Construction and Real Estate activities, and Professional, Scientific and Technical activities.\n\nDue to the absence of technologically and economically-feasible low-carbon alternatives in the aviation sector, and with the objective to meet our net zero emission commitment by 2050, aviation's contribution to fighting climate change and reducing emissions will have to be achieved by continuing to use kerosene in more fuel-e/fficient aircraft, progressively switching to sustainable aviation fuels that are increasingly/uni00A0CO2 neutral. As current aircraft technology does not support zero or low-emission flying and is unlikely to do so until the next decade, the decarbonization of air transport will have to count on these transition activities. In this respect, the concept of sustainable aviation activity needs to be clarified as well as the key role of transition activities essential to achieving our goal of net zero emissions by 2050.",

Border closures, health measures to respect for travel, a climate of international alarm and uncertain professional futures all devastated the aviation industry.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM did everything in its power to protect the health and safety of its customers and sta/ff thanks to strict and e/ffective health protocols. Against this backdrop of crisis and despite the context of remote and partial activity, employees maintained a very high level of engagement.\n\nA continuous dialogue between the social partners and the General Management enabled all the negotiations on the reconstruction plan to take place in full transparency and in a constructive manner. In recognition of the loans guaranteed by the French and Dutch States, and recognizing the urgency, the entire social structure mobilized with agility and contributed significantly to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's long-term future.\n\nNow, more than ever, the strategy common to all the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's businesses remains fostering the commitment and\n\nmotivation of employees, by o/ffering the working conditions enabling them e/ffectively to fulfil their professional functions, in support of the Group's levels of performance.\n\nDuring 2021, our employees showed resilience and agility to adapt to the changing volume of operations. With many employees leaving the company mainly under voluntary departure plans, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group focused on employee mobility and the retention of talent.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nWithin the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, the Employee Experience is a key element of its People strategy and a pillar of its Sustainable Development strategy. 'Our people deliver our customer experience' and it is through this policy that the company can outperform its competitors. The roadmap is defined in action plans at the level of every division of the airlines and the Group including, notably, an ongoing commitment to sta/ff development, support for initiative, the promotion of team spirit and reinforcing levels of motivation which is key to surmounting the Covid-19 crisis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the two companies, a rotating random selection of employees is regularly polled to ascertain whether they would recommend Air/uni00A0France and KLM as employers to their friends and family. The results are shared with all sta/ff. At Group level the consolidated EPS dropped by 38.3% between 2020 and 2021, which had been expected owing to the impact of the crisis on working conditions, a reduced workforce, the impact on compensation and benefits, and other elements related to the di/fficulties the industry is currently facing.\n\nIn addition to measuring the EPS, both airlines are working on a restructuring plan to give substance to the recovery in the longer term.\n\nDuring the public health crisis, Transavia Netherlands experienced the highest ever score for its EPS. The airline has created a dedicated index to monitor the impact of Covid-19 on the Employee Experience. In the first month of the Covid outbreak, it identified ten dimensions potentially influencing the happiness of its employees which have been monitored by the airline throughout the crisis and have been maintained at a stable level.\n\n## Working conditions during the public health crisis\n\nAs of the onset of the public health crisis in March/uni00A02020 and throughout 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM implemented the company public health protocols stipulated by the French, Dutch and foreign governments, and sought to adapt these protocols to its various sta/ff categories during the di/fferent phases of the pandemic (lockdowns, curfew,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nThese health measures have been communicated throughout the crisis via the di/fferent digital communication channels in support of line managers and via a proactive Health and Safety in the Workplace network: protective measures, availability of health kits, limitation on the number of days spent in the workplace, closure of the workplace restaurants, remote working, certification of professional travel,/uni00A0etc.\n\nHealth, safety and working conditions commissions have been organized at every key stage to agree with the employee representatives the measures to be put in place.\n\nIn France, in line with the recommendations of the health authorities and the national protocol for each change, the implementation of measures to protect employees against the risk of epidemics have been accompanied by a strengthening of the surveillance and follow-up of cases and contacts through occupational medicine, a statistical focus on declarations, and the constant availability of medical experts for the validation of the preventive measures.\n\nIn the Netherlands, any adjustments to Dutch legislation have been immediately translated into measures within KLM. Continuous\n\ncompany-wide execution of Safety Issue Risk Analyses on the virus and the monitoring/introduction of new regulations, procedures and methodologies have ensured the appropriate measures and mitigations are in place to maintain safety.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France has implemented successful health prevention measures thanks to the identification of/work-arounds for its key challenges: the deployment of prevention measures, adoption of a multidisciplinary approach (Prevention OHS, management, HR, occupational medicine, logistics, the authorities,/uni00A0etc.), introduction of the French Sanitary Pass, constant adaptation and agility, clear processes and communication, involvement of the authorities and documentation, have all been addressed with positive energy.\n\nTo guarantee optimal working conditions for their employees, KLM, Transavia and Air/uni00A0France have enabled the development of remote working, as already provisioned, or by adding this provision to the existing agreement between Air/uni00A0France and the unions, signed in 2018.\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France, feedback on the practice of remote working was conducted over the summer of 2020 involving the relevant 12,200/uni00A0employees. The results fueled a thinking process about di/fferent ways of working in the future, in particular hybrid working.\n\nAt Transavia France, specific attention was paid to the conditions for remote working. Guidelines have been provided for managers and regular communications including weekly live events have been organized to maintain strong links between all team members and employees. In November 2021, an innovative and flexible Working-From-Home agreement was signed for all support functions and crew management undertaking o/ffice activities.\n\nKLM continued to facilitate the government's Covid-19 'working from home unless' guidelines and regulations, and applied strict safety and hygiene measures. In the meantime, taking the aspects of working from home into account, a corporate policy for hybrid working (combining working from home and in the o/ffice) was rolled out. To ensure that this hybrid way of working is sustainable and positive for all parties, KLM developed a digital guide that includes a team chart addressing relevant team collaboration topics. The mental health of employees working under increased pressure and/or from home is monitored via surveys.\n\nIn 2021, KLM also announced the results of its 'How Are You?' well-being survey summarizing the answers of more than 5,500/uni00A0respondents. In addition to the fact that 71% of the respondents reported their job satisfaction as 'at least su/fficient', this survey highlighted a broadly common perception of health and job satisfaction amongst those working at a KLM location or from home. The survey in itself showed care on the part of the company and KLM employees indicated their appreciation, opening the way to ongoing dialogue and follow-up.",

        "page_content": "Transavia Netherlands organized a number of 'Healthy Talks' and online sessions on themes such as stress and a good work-life balance. This initiative will be followed up in 2022.\n\nFor frontline sta/ff in contact with customers or aircraft who are not eligible for remote working, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has continued to communicate the protection measures to be respected and equipped them with health protection kits.\n\n## Employee commitment despite the di/fficulties\n\n2021 was marked by a very significant level of commitment from the Group's employees despite the voluntary or compulsory departures of many colleagues. In 2021, the economic and social context prompted a feeling of uncertainty and this weighed on the major airlines' Employee Promoter Scores (EPS) which dropped to below their levels of 2019. In 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group rea/ffirmed its commitment to social and environmental topics in the regions where it operates.\n\nIn partnership with the start-up Vendredi, Air/uni00A0France mobilized its employees around volunteering with the creation of the 'Mon Engagement Citoyen' initiative. Via this network and throughout the year, employees can o/ffer their free time, positive energy and skills to partner associations in six areas of action dear to Air/uni00A0France and the Air/uni00A0France Foundation: Children, Education Training - Employment, Disability-Health, Combating Precarity, Intergenerational Sharing and the Environment. Since its launch, 3,000/uni00A0Air/uni00A0France employees have registered on the Vendredi platform and nearly 400/uni00A0volunteering actions have already been carried out. This dynamic follows on from the Citizenship Days organized by the company in the past three years.\n\nKLM's approach to promoting sustainable development at the scale of the organization also drove the establishment of programs aimed at making KLM a more welcoming and inspirational employer o/ffering diverse professional development opportunities. The aim is to stimulate employees and facilitate the activities enabling them to discover and develop their talents so that they can make better choices in a constantly-changing environment.\n\nA few examples:\n\n- -  in collaboration with MBO Airport College, KLM provides vocational education programs for employees without diplomas but with many years of professional experience. In the last five years, more than five hundred KLM operational employees have graduated with a nationally-recognized vocational degree in this 'life-long learning' program. In 2021, the students of the BBL-3/uni00A0Logistic team lead class and the BBL-4/uni00A0supervisor logistic classes, which started in the 2019-20/uni00A0academic year, completed their programs and obtained their degrees. In September/uni00A02021, new classes were launched in both programs;\n- -  Regarding newly-hired employees on temporary KLM contracts, the company strengthened their position on the labor market by o/ffering them a training program in September 2021 and obtaining a recognized degree. These students were well equipped to find positions with another employer;\n- -  thanks to a collaboration with MBO Airport College lecturers which started in 2020, together with three other preferred schools, a further improvement in the quality of the steward/ stewardess internship training program was achieved, benefiting hundreds of students.\n\nSince 2020, the yearly societal initiative the 'KLM Employee Blue Heart Event' has consisted of two parts: the KLM Blue Heart Days and the KLM Blue Heart Broadcast. Due to Covid-19 circumstances, the 2021 Blue Heart Day was cancelled, however the KLM Blue Heart Broadcast aired live in February.\n\nDuring the year, KLM held multiple employee events across the Group and in the divisions to create memorable individual experiences. Managers continued to use WhatsUpp, a tool to facilitate dialogue within teams and help determine the actions to improve the Employee Experience (empowerment).\n\nThroughout the year the CEOs, Board members and Executive Committee members frequently held webcasts to connect with sta/ff, keep them informed of relevant developments and be available to answer any questions. In addition, the Human Resources departments multiplied their touch points with employees and managers.\n\n## 4.2.2/emspaceResource adaptation and employee dialogue\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nThis is the most serious crisis experienced by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group since the Second World War.\n\nWithin this unprecedented context, the Group's airlines have initiated a number of di/fferent actions to enable a return to financial breakeven, notably by reducing their labor costs, while prioritizing voluntary departures as far as possible. The Dutch\n\nand French governments have supported the Group's e/fforts, each within the framework of their own country's social systems.\n\nThis resource adaptation has been accompanied by reorganization and transformation projects aimed at improving the Group's e/fficiency and restructuring its French domestic network, but also to take into account the new environmental conditions. The proposed measures have taken di/fferent forms adapted to the Group's companies and depending on the legislation in force.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nRight from the start, the calibration of the di/fferent plans and support measures have systematically been discussed and negotiated with the unions within the framework of the procedures imposed by the country's legal framework.\n\nThis constant and intense employee dialogue has been maintained throughout the crisis, notably via the use of an in-house video conferencing system, enabling all the relevant players to exchange ideas, including during lockdowns or periods of self-isolation.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the coordination of the workplace dialogue takes place in each Group entity and within the Group's European Works Council, bringing together the representatives of sta/ff whose head offices or entities are based in the European Community.\n\nDuring 2021, Benjamin Smith (Chief Executive Officer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM), Pieter Elbers (KLM's President & Chief Executive O/fficer) and Anne Rigail (Air/uni00A0France's Chief Executive O/fficer) held regular meetings with employees in the various sites, mainly via web conferences due to the situation of public health crisis, to engage in dialogue on current topics.\n\nThe number of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM employees needs to be adapted to the present level of activity but also with that of the future, particularly in the face of the crisis currently being traversed by the aviation industry. Demographic changes, digitalization, changes in the employment markets and the new aviation industry technologies are pressurizing the company to prepare its employees to adapt to these changes. Strategic planning combined with an HR and business-oriented approach is focusing on the sta/ffing outlook and the various future scenarios, while providing solutions on mobility, employability, sta/ff recruitment and loyalty, and the management of the e/ffects of the digital transformation.\n\n## The implementation of emergency measures for all employees\n\nIn France, further to the Partial activity (Activit\u00e9 Partielle) scheme implemented in 2020, the company and the unions signed an agreement with the three sta/ff categories (Hostesses/Stewards, Ground Sta/ff and Pilots) to enable the company to benefit from the Long-Term Partial Activity, from January/uni00A01, 2021 and for a two-year period (the maximum allowed by law).\n\nThis agreement mitigated the effects of the crisis on the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's cash position during 2021 and will extend the savings on personnel costs for Air/uni00A0France over this two-year period. It is also a lever for adapting organizations to the level of activity which remains dependent on the public health decisions and travel restrictions linked to border closures worldwide.\n\nIn April/uni00A02020, the Dutch government launched a generic wage support grant for companies in the Netherlands whose revenues had been impacted by the Covid-19 crisis. Both KLM and its subsidiaries applied for this so-called NOW-grant (whose literal\n\ntranslation is the Emergency Bridging Measure for Employment) and committed to respecting the conditions linked to this measure. The NOW-grant was applied from March/uni00A02020 and continued in 2021. This support mechanism has prevented forced redundancies as far as possible in the short term.\n\n## Signature of major agreements in times of crisis\n\nThe negotiation of agreements in the di/fferent airlines of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group continued throughout 2021, to respond to the health and financial issues arising from the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nIn view of the health context and following the lockdowns in France, an amendment on remote working arrangements was signed in the summer of 2021 allowing employees whose positions are qualified to benefit from up to three days of remote working per week and to expand the use of this working method, while initiating discussions on hybrid working.\n\nThe salary negotiations with Air France Ground Sta/ff, Cabin Crew and Pilots formalized the commitment to no general or individual salary increases during the crisis period of 2021-22, while recording additional cost-saving measures based on the reduction in the number of days of leave and the prioritization of the end-of-year additional remuneration as per the rate of partial activity.\n\nThe impact of salary reduction linked to partial activity is greater for employees with higher levels of remuneration. These measures enabled the avoidance of layo/ffs, Air France having reached its Voluntary Departure Plan objectives for the three sta/ff categories.\n\nConsidering its growth outlook, Transavia France did not implement a resource adaptation program however partial activity was implemented until July/uni00A02021 and no general or individual salary increases took place in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, the Dutch government also facilitated a loan package to help mitigate the impact of the crisis. There are conditions attached to this loan package including a mandatory reduction in payroll costs. Employees earning a higher-than-median salary (\u20ac36,500/uni00A0on an annual, full-time basis) have to contribute to this via a reduction in salary. This reduction depends on the level of salary and rises to 20% for employees earning three times the average salary or more.\n\nWhile a workable Social Plan for Flight Deck Crew had already been part of an existing collective labor agreement, in 2020 KLM and the unions signed two new Social Plan agreements for Cabin Crew and Ground Sta/ff. These agreements apply between October 2020 and December 2024. These two Social Plans for Cabin Crew and Ground Sta/ff are based on measures aimed at limiting compulsory lay-o/ffs as far as possible via recourse to a voluntary severance scheme and new career opportunities outside of KLM (e.g. a move into the healthcare or education sectors). Employees whose jobs are redundant after these measures will be forced to leave KLM. Agreements have been signed with the unions concerning one-o/ff payments in the event of dismissal, and outplacement and assistance in finding new employment.",

        "page_content": "In 2017, the pension schemes for Flight Deck Crews and Cabin Crews had been de-risked while the pension fund for Ground Sta/ff had remained a Defined Benefit scheme. In 2020, KLM and the unions for Ground Sta/ff reached agreement on a Collective Defined Contribution Scheme (CDC-scheme). In 2021, the Pension Fund approved this new agreement and implemented the CDC-scheme.\n\n## Resource adaptation via a number of measures\n\nAt the beginning of the crisis in March/uni00A02020, the Group implemented emergency measures via a hiring freeze for external sta/ff and only limited renewal of temporary contracts.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France Group adapted its resource level with Voluntary Departure Plans. The restructuring of the Hop! entity led to 40% shrinkage in the number of positions. At Air/uni00A0France, collective contractual terminations (Ruptures Conventionnelles Collectives - RCC) implemented in the summer of 2020 enabled the departure of 368/uni00A0pilots and 1,063/uni00A0cabin crew employees, and a Job Protection and Voluntary Departure Plan (Plan de Sauvegarde de l'Emploi - PDV-PSE) was negotiated between July and November/uni00A02020 for ground sta/ff. Having been approved by the French Employment Ministry in December/uni00A02020, this plan was implemented in 2021 with 97% of the targeted workforce subscribing. Most of the relevant employees left in 2021 while the remaining departures will take place between January and June/uni00A02022. The success of these plans has enabled the company to avoid compulsory departures in the short term.\n\nIn 2021, recruitment at Air France was extremely targeted (e.g. doctors, cyber-security), concerning only profiles and essential technical skills that could not be filled by internal mobility. The level of activity during the year did not enable the resumption of outside hiring aside from very specific, precise needs. As detailed in paragraph 4.2.4, the recruitment of certain categories like people with disabilities or apprentices and trainees was maintained, at an adapted level.\n\nTo support the redeployment of resources within the framework of the transformation projects associated with these plans, specific internal mobility steering committees were deployed to collectively manage the employees in oversta/ffed business segments and prioritize their applications for the available\n\ninternal positions. In particular, short-haul and Hop! employees benefitted from this initiative.\n\nIn total, during the 2021 financial year, Transavia France convened 12 meetings of the works councils and four of the health and safety committees, while Air France convened 12 meetings of the Social and Economic Committee (Comit\u00e9 Social et \u00c9conomique - CSE), of which three were extraordinary, and four meetings of the Comit\u00e9 de Groupe Fran\u00e7ais, testifying to the intensive employee dialogue required to continue to respond to an unprecedented crisis.\n\nIn 2020, conscious of the need to adapt to reality to ensure the company's long-term viability, KLM had decided to reduce headcount by around 5,000 FTEs. The implementation of this plan ended in 2021 while other actions were initiated to terminate temporary contracts, reduce new hires and launch two voluntary departure plans. Around 2,200 employees opted for voluntary redundancy. Others took advantage of the opportunities for part-time working, further education and secondments to other companies.\n\nNever in the Company's history have so many employees left the Company at the same time. Thanks to these measures, during 2021 KLM was able to avoid Cabin Crew redundancies and limit redundancies amongst Ground Sta/ff. The social plan agreed with the unions included support for the employees a/ffected in their search for new job opportunities.\n\nThe restructuring of the organization led to many new job vacancies which were filled mainly by internal candidates. The second half of 2021 saw renewed recruitment of interns and the restart of the program to attract young talented people.\n\nAt the height of the Covid-19 crisis, KLM created the Loket Blauwe Inzet program to help find temporary outplacements for employees in departments where posts were available. In 2020 and 2021, over 1,700/uni00A0employees volunteered to be temporarily assigned to another workplace. These temporarily-assigned employees gave expression to their 'Blue Heart' driven by the feeling that they were doing the best they could for KLM. These temporary assignments also helped fill gaps that might otherwise have been filled by external hiring and helped develop the skills of the employees concerned. Transavia Netherlands has a similar scheme in place via the WeCare platform.\n\n## 4.2.3/emspace Development of human capital and talent management\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nWithin this context of crisis, internal reorganization and headcount reduction, the development of human capital and securing the loyalty of talented individuals are imperative for transforming the companies within the Group.\n\nThe 2020-22/uni00A0campaign on the Forward Planning of Jobs and Skills (GPEC), combined with a business-focused approach,\n\nenabled the identification of the future sta/ffing needs based on a number of di/fferent scenarios, while providing solutions on mobility, employability, research and employee loyalty.\n\nThe Human Resources teams and the Executive Committee very rapidly pinpointed the strategic challenges involved in retaining and developing talent, but also the need to establish succession plans in key posts in the context of the departure plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Priority areas for improvement were defined and implementation will continue in 2022.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nDespite this challenging context, the Group pursued its policy of prioritizing training: the number of training hours per employee stood at 31.3/uni00A0hours in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France and KLM continued the policy launched in 2019, to transition from exclusive (aimed at a targeted group of employees) to inclusive talent management (every employee is a talented individual who must be given the opportunity to develop his or her skills) by using a talent development approach created jointly by the two companies and by implementing joint development strategies and actions.\n\nOn January/uni00A017, 2020, Air/uni00A0France and the unions representing the Ground Sta/ff had signed a three-year agreement on Employment and Career Management. This agreement notably foresees the deployment of a training and development path but also the recruitment of new talent and end-of-career support. It remains in force for the next two years even if some provisions have been improved within the framework of the Job Protection and Voluntary Departure Plan and the FNE (Fond National pour l'Emploi), while others are no longer relevant in view of the current crisis.\n\nIn KLM, dashboards based on HR data are used and updated to monitor the number of promotions, and the inflow and outflow of employees. In 2021, HR conducted a data collection process (including survey and exit interviews) to gain insights into the reasons why some employees chose to leave the company. Based on these insights, KLM will be able to further improve its employee value proposition.\n\nThe departure of many employees with the voluntary or compulsory departure plans and the reorganization of the company accelerated internal job transfers; within the airlines, these moves were collectively steered to meet the need for business-specific competencies.\n\nAir/uni00A0France also continued to encourage its employees to benefit from training to maintain and develop their employability through various programs advertised on the joint Learning Management System:\n\n- -  Personal Training Account;\n- -  Validation of Previous Experience;\n- -  2021 FNE (Fond National pour l'Emploi) courses that cover a broad range of training courses such as languages, sustainable development, big data, management and professional e/ffectiveness;\n- -  internal digital training modules: MOOCs, Webinars, Videos, Courses.\n\nIn November/uni00A02021, the Air/uni00A0France teams obtained Qualiopi certification for training, a new French regulatory requirement for Air/uni00A0France to be recognized as a training center.\n\nManagers played an important role in conducting Career Development interviews and proposing these di/fferent types of training to their teams on their days of partial activity.\n\nLinked to the transformation of the company and the context of accelerated internal mobility, Air/uni00A0France prioritized several areas of development, including:\n\n- -  risk management: flight safety, occupational health, and safety;\n- -  fundamentals and hard business skills: digitalization, customer care, cyber security, sustainable development, fleet development, etc;\n- -  development of individualized career paths: for short-haul employees to become cabin crew or sales advisors, or for support employees to meet identified purchasing needs, as well as management skills for new managers.\n\nAt Transavia France, a training module dedicated to managers was launched at the end of 2021; it focused on the consolidation of performance and leadership spirit with the development of specific soft and hard skills.\n\nKLM continued to improve its renewed MyLearning learning environment: a modern and user-friendly digital learning platform for its entire organization. This cutting-edge management system provides training, management and collaboration solutions as well as personalized learning solutions, and has a state-of-the-art search function.\n\nIn 2021, KLM enlarged the scope of learning content distributed through MyLearning, via a link to the 'Anotherday' learning portal which includes a rich and varied training catalogue with an open external o/ffering.\n\nTo further encourage personalized learning, KLM introduced the ability to request courses from outside the catalogue aimed at enhancing and expanding the employee's personal e/ffectiveness, professional skills and knowledge. In its quest for a broad, varied and challenging Learning and Development portfolio, KLM identified the need for an excellent service and advisory helpdesk. This was achieved by adding an 'Intercom' chat function to support sta/ff in exploring and defining their individual and customized development paths.\n\nIn 2020, KLM had developed a dedicated SharePoint website whose goal is to help employees find the right learning and development support. The development possibilities it o/ffers are based on personae or imaginary employees asking typical questions like 'I am new to the role. How do I get up to speed?' or 'I have been in the same role too long. How can I keep adding to my skills?'. In 2021, the Sharepoint content was further improved and made more user friendly.",

        "page_content": "## Reinforced steering of mobility\n\nIn 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group rea/ffirmed its commitment to promoting skills-based mobility within the context of restructuring and voluntary departures. Throughout 2021, the steering process for transverse mobility between the di/fferent Group companies, deployed in December/uni00A02020, was activated to enable the more e/ffective matching of requirements and resources, and to foster the development of human capital.\n\nDuring 2021, KLM adjusted rapidly to the numerous internal and external labor market changes. Due to Covid-19, in 2020, the entire labor market experienced significant change and the Ground Sta/ff recruitment procedures and advertised vacancies (internal and external) were immediately put on hold with only the most pressing hires being advertised internally. In 2021, the activity of the airline sector partially recovered and KLM returned to the labor market to attract talented individuals, specifically in the technical and IT functions. The KLM Management Traineeships were adapted, enabling young top talents to find their way within KLM and use their skills to help create a more innovative, sustainable, people-orientated and e/fficient organization.\n\nThroughout the crisis, KLM has continued to build a strong employer brand. Internally, KLM further optimized the candidate journey, with updated communication and a leaner application process, with no motivation letter required. Due to its agile team structure, KLM was rapidly able to adapt to the sudden change in internal mobility forecasts. At the end of 2021, KLM prepared for the roll-out of a series of external recruitment campaigns during 2022.\n\nIn anticipation of the departure of ground sta/ff in 2021, Air/uni00A0France had established the Mobility Steering Committee to address the challenges of matching needs and resources linked to activity reorganization. The aim is to monitor sta/ffing levels and skill sets, bring visibility to applications from employees whose positions disappear and limit the need for external recruitment to provide rare skills. The Mobility Steering Committee also promotes the retention and development of talents, bringing agility to both selection and development.\n\nIn response to the many employees finding opportunities to move jobs following the Voluntary Departure Plan in France, Air/uni00A0France set up and positively tested a dedicated onboarding process for new positions; this process will be systematically implemented in 2022.\n\n## Developing leadership and performance management\n\nIn the shift from performance management to performance development, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's approach to performance appraisals is now oriented towards a forward-looking and appreciative process based on encouraging feedback. In these individual conversations, managers are asked to put the emphasis on talent and the development of the expertise and actions needed to enhance an individual's value in both their\n\ncurrent and future roles and activities. The aim is to help identify employees' talents and their individual growth potential, and thus maximize everyone's contribution to the company's results.\n\nIn early 2019, Air/uni00A0France had launched its new continuous performance management learning program. This program is supported by a tool developed internally and is positioned as a management transformation lever. It is based on two key concepts: continuous performance management and multi-evaluation. This new program has enabled the development of the feedback process to build employee skills and, consequently, enhance collective performance. Since this launch, Air/uni00A0France has asked its managers to conduct at least one annual interview with every member of their teams to assess their performance for the year and their potential development for the following year.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France continues to improve and adjust its managerial leadership model to the challenges of the business and the changing environment. In 2021, it updated the cross-functional skills reference framework for executives and managers. This new framework will be deployed at the beginning of 2022; it aims to help managers identify the hard and soft skills necessary to address the market and business transformation, and will provide development orientations and open up career path opportunities.\n\nIn 2021, Transavia Netherlands managed the restructuring of the Transavia ground organization and a dedicated team is making progress towards an inclusive talent management policy, focused on mobilizing everyone's talents. This Talent Management initiative has been formally adopted within the Career Journey team.\n\nKLM and Air/uni00A0France continue to o/ffer talent and leadership programs like the Femmes de Talent  training and coaching program, aimed at enabling high-potential women to develop their skills within the Group and occupy senior management positions, and joint financial programs with the HEC business school for future managers. The first KLM female leadership program ended in 2021 and is currently being evaluated.\n\nFurther to Transavia Netherlands focusing on leadership, along with communication and connection, in 2021 a module was added to the leadership program to develop managers' ability to take care of themselves and support their teams. The airline also encouraged connection and discussion, via online peer groups of leaders or on wider platforms.\n\n## Internal coaching and mentoring continue to be o/ffered at the di/fferent levels of the company\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group promotes all kinds of positive and constructive feedback, seeing this as a key part of development and also contributing to a healthy working environment: on-the-spot and timely feedback, individual conversations, 360\u00b0/uni00A0and other forms of feedback are all encouraged throughout the Group, supplemented by coaching and mentoring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nBased on KLM's People Strategy, the transition to an inclusive Talent and Performance Development process was implemented in 2021. With this process, KLM aims to enable employees to make optimal use of their talents, improve their employability and thus add value to the organization. A new conversation method was developed in collaboration with the Works Council to discuss talent, performance and personal development. This contributes to a healthy in-, through- and out flow of KLM sta/ff.\n\nTo structure this process, the Talent Development Cycle has been developed: a yearly cycle for managers and employees with a specific route to be followed on Talent and Performance Development topics, based on the business priorities.\n\nAs the Covid-19 crisis continued, KLM further adjusted the content of its leadership development program, o/ffering interactive online learning. Relevant and appropriate content for inspiration and learning is available on a curated Sharepoint site for leadership development: The Optimal Leadership hub. The baseline of leadership development - building on the Optimal Leadership framework - remained in place in 2021. Transavia continued to pursue its leadership program of the last three years, while responding to the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nin response to the crisis, KLM has adopted an improvement plan, known as the 'From More to Better', strategy. Since sta/ff engagement and talent management are one of the foundations for this strategy, KLM has developed 'The Spirit for the Future' program aimed at meeting the talents needed for inspiration, and enhancing skills and knowledge, personal growth, making an impact, enlarging their view and building a network outside their own immediate working environments. To date, 125/uni00A0middle managers and specialists have been selected for the program with the first cohort of 24/uni00A0successfully completing it in the autumn of 2021.\n\nDiagnostic tools such as 360\u00b0/uni00A0feedback saw wider roll-outs in 2021 and individual mentoring and coaching continued to be deployed. Furthermore, training paths for key roles, such as manager, project manager and expert, were made available.\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France moved up four places in the Glassdoor ranking of the best French employers, continuing its progression.\n\nIn addition, for the second year in a row, Air/uni00A0France won the award for the company of choice for students in the transportation category.\n\n## 4.2.4/emspace Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nAs a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is committed to respecting the universal principles relating to the respect of Human Rights.\n\nIn the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles, the Group affirms its commitment to fostering a climate of trust and mutual respect in a working environment where no form of discrimination or harassment is tolerated. Various initiatives have been implemented at Air/uni00A0France and KLM to support this commitment.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM strongly believes that a diverse and inclusive workforce has a positive impact on the performance of the organization and thus continues to support all forms of action to encourage equal opportunity, equity between men and women, LGBTIQ+ networks, the vocational integration of young people, the transmission of knowledge and skills, and the maintained employment and recruitment of persons with disabilities.\n\nThe current global pandemic, with its far-reaching societal and economic implications, presents both opportunities for and challenges to promoting Diversity & Inclusion within the workplace. Prior to Covid-19, the business imperatives for Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) had become increasingly clear with,\n\nas a consequence, an increased management commitment and e/fforts directed at reinforcing D&I. As part of its restructuring, diversity and inclusion remains a key priority in the transformation of the Group, of the teams, of each individual.\n\nIn September/uni00A02021, the Group launched an internal assessment to understand its current D&I departure point and its transversal mindset going forward to emerge stronger from the crisis. The goals will be to further improve and encourage an inclusive culture and leadership, improve our approach to combating all forms of discrimination and inequality, make our progress more measurable based on relevant data, insights and good practices, and prioritize decentralized activation based on specific needs, with clear objectives and initiatives. In November/uni00A02021, a D&I survey was sent to all employees within the Group and the strong response testified to their keen interest in the topic of D&I. The objective of the survey is to develop deeper insights into multiple aspects, like representation, inclusion and equity.\n\nThe survey's results will be analyzed in early 2022 and will help us to set a baseline on D&I to be able to track progress, gain a targeted understanding as to where our D&I e/fforts have an impact and enhance our knowledge and insights into employee perceptions on D&I.",

        "page_content": "## Measures and performance\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has set itself a long-term objective of reaching parity between men and women within the Group Executive Committee and within the top 10% highest levels of management.\n\nIn addition, medium-term targets of a minimum of 33% women within the Group Executive Committee and 40% of the top 10% management level positions to be held by women by 2030 have also been set by the Board of Directors. Concretely, in the event of the recruitment and/or appointment of new members and candidates with equal skills, expertise and management qualities, preference is given to female candidates. An action plan has been deployed to accelerate the taking into account of female profiles at all levels of management. In 2021, 25% of the members of the Group Executive Committee were women.\n\nIn 2021, the proportion of women in managerial positions continued to increase for all categories of sta/ff: ground sta/ff (34,6% of the 10% highest levels of management were women compared to 34% in 2020), pilots (5.8% of Flight Captains were women compared to 5.7% in 2020), cabin crew (65.8% of Pursers were women compared to 65.7% in 2020). Air/uni00A0France - KLM has pursued its policy of promoting diversity and reiterated the need to combat all forms of prejudice and discrimination by putting the emphasis on the power of diversity and inclusion via coordinated interventions and reinforced commitment.\n\nMore diverse and inclusive organizations are known to attract more talent and be more customer driven, have higher levels of employee engagement, take better decisions and be more innovative and creative. All of these factors are key to the shared ambition set by the two airlines in terms of equal opportunity and combating all forms of prejudice and discrimination.\n\n## Promoting gender equality\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France, professional and wage equality between men and women is a major business priority in which the company would like to make further progress in terms of human resource management. This undertaking has been reflected in the signature of agreements with the unions on Professional Gender Equality. A sixth three-year agreement was signed in January/uni00A02022.\n\nTo ensure equal treatment between men and women, a number of male-female comparative indicators are tracked annually within the framework of an audit carried out within each division of the company (training, careers, vocational safety, remuneration,/uni00A0etc.). Special wage equalization and equitable salary management measures are in place, together with an annual audit of male and female comparative remuneration.\n\nTo encourage women to access the highest management positions, coaching and mentoring initiatives are in place to promote their career progression. In 2020 and 2021, despite the public health crisis, the Femmes de Talent  coaching program was maintained and adapted (digitalized content and optimized duration) thanks to FNE financing. Fifty participants were able to benefit from this program in 2020-21.\n\nThe internal Women For Tomorrow (WoTo) network, aimed at reinforcing the recognition of women within the Group, currently numbers some 600/uni00A0members. Air/uni00A0France is also a member of the Elles Bougent  external network, whose female business mentors encourage young girls to join the engineering and technical professions. In 2021, 60/uni00A0female pupils from middle schools participated in the smart city week and industry week organized by Elles Bougent , benefiting from input about maintenance, flight operations and IT career choices.\n\nAir/uni00A0France is a partner of Air Emploi and supports the F\u00e9minisons les M\u00e9tiers de l'A\u00e9ronautique initiative dedicated to promoting airline vocations for women. A special competition was organized with the aim of raising awareness of aeronautics and space industry career opportunities and promoting its access to young female students.\n\nIn the 2021 financial year, Air/uni00A0France continued its awareness-raising and actions to prevent sexism and sexual harassment. In June/uni00A02021, all members of the Executive Committee signed the Stop Sexism commitment. The e-learning module deployed in November/uni00A02020 for all sta/ff realized in partnership with several other large French companies having signed up for the #StOpE au Sexisme initiative is still online as a reference tool for Air/uni00A0France and Transavia France employees.\n\nIn partnership with the occupational medicine teams and social o/fficers, Air/uni00A0France takes awareness-raising actions to prevent violence against women.\n\nOn November/uni00A025, 2021, International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, the HR department partnered with social services, the occupational medicine teams and a specialized lawyer, to o/ffer its HR community a webinar focusing on women victims of domestic or intra-family violence. In September/uni00A02021, Air/uni00A0France launched a game dedicated to diversity and combating discrimination, to which all managers have access.\n\nA section is dedicated to professional equality between women and men.\n\nIn early 2021, KLM participated in the annual Talent to the Top monitor and, despite the Covid-19 crisis impacting the industry, the metrics of the monitor remained stable in all six criteria. In March/uni00A02019, the KLM President & CEO had signed the Talent to the Top Charter, a manifesto aimed at increasing the number of women in management positions.\n\nThis Charter helps to bring the right focus to the company's diversity policy and activate the appropriate dialogue. The Charter contains guidelines and clear agreements that help KLM purposefully work towards durable and e/ffective results. Every year KLM's progress is monitored based on six criteria: Leadership, Strategy and Interventions, HR Management, Communication, Knowledge and Skills, and Work Climate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, the D&I circle continued with four work streams led by Executive Vice-Presidents. The targets remained focused on gender diversity but, in addition, the scope was enlarged to diversity in the broadest sense.\n\nThe 2030 People Sustainability Goals have been defined and the target is for KLM employees to experience a diverse and inclusive working environment within the company.\n\nDuring the 2021 financial year, KLM carried out numerous actions in favor of diversity and inclusion:\n\n- - with the signature of Workplace Pride's Declaration of Amsterdam on Friday November/uni00A012, 2021, KLM committed to developing a working environment where openness and equality are fundamental, and where there is an explicit awareness of diversity, inclusion and the LGBTIQ+ community;\n- - while completing the Group Diversity & Inclusion survey, KLM deep dived into specific demographic questions for its population in the Netherlands to be able to set targets for the coming years based on data-driven insights. The results of the survey are expected in the 2022 first quarter. The Women on Board network organizes inspirational events giving women opportunities to connect and learn from each other;\n- - in 2021, KLM continued the Female Leadership training program at the top management level. Due to Covid-19, the first group went ahead mostly on a virtual basis;\n- - Transavia Netherlands had taken several Transavia women employees through a Branded U leadership development series of seminars, this initiative having positively a/ffected their leadership development. In 2021, Transavia Netherlands partnered with the Refugee Talent hub to improve the Branded U initiative, offering seven Transavia women employees an opportunity not only to accelerate their leadership development but also support another woman in their development goals. In addition to a package of online/ o/ffline seminars on leadership development, the program also o/ffered the opportunity to attend a female leadership visibility conference, Amplify Her, and the chance to act as a mentor to a fellow woman leader with a refugee background. This new Branded U program was the opportunity, on the one hand, to assess the potential of this format in leadership learning and development and, on another hand, to gain further insights into diversity and inclusion (to support a development project to begin in 2022).\n\n## Equal opportunities within the Group: persons with disabilities\n\nThroughout the Covid-19 public health crisis and despite a challenging economic situation, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has rea/ffirmed its commitment to welcoming persons with disabilities.\n\nThe 2021-23/uni00A0Disability Agreement was signed in January/uni00A02021. Through this 11 th /uni00A0 agreement, Air/uni00A0France rea/ffirms its desire to pursue an ambitious policy by maintaining the recruitment of people with disabilities, by pursuing actions on maintained employment, training and professional support via, in particular, coaching and co-development.\n\nFor the third year running, Air/uni00A0France took part in the DuoDay (six events in digital form and one in a face-to-face setting) and organized remote internships for school children with disabilities. During European Week for the Employment of People with Disabilities, amongst its many awareness-raising initiatives, Air/uni00A0France invited its CEO Anne Rigail who rea/ffirmed Air/uni00A0France's commitment to the inclusion of employees with disabilities.\n\nIn 2021, the hiring of employees with disabilities was maintained despite a global hiring freeze in the company linked to its economic situation, along with dedicated actions towards the retention of people with disabilities. The airline strongly supports suppliers who employ people with disabilities. Thus, about forty external organizations have signed agreements with Air/uni00A0France, to cover activities such as the laundering of blankets or bolting in aircraft maintenance.\n\nAt KLM, pursuant to Dutch Law, all employees have equal rights in the workplace. Di/fferentiating between employees on the basis of disability or chronic disease is not permitted. It is only when people with a disability or health condition are unable to fulfil the tasks necessary to do a job e/ffectively that employers may refuse to hire them, especially if health or safety is a major issue.\n\nIt is also mandatory for an employer to investigate whether an adjustment in tasks or the working environment might help a disabled person to execute the relevant work.\n\n## Equal opportunities within the Group\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has a long history of proud engagement with the LGBT+ community. In 2019, Air/uni00A0France's Chief Executive O/fficer, Anne Rigail, signed the association L'Autre Cercle's  LGBT+ Commitment Charter.\n\nAt KLM, the LGBTIQ+ Over the Rainbow network continues to work closely with the KLM D&I Circle. The focus of Over the Rainbow has been on increasing awareness and enhancing discussion.",

        "page_content": "In 2021, KLM led a Pride 'road show' involving colleagues discussing D&I at di/fferent KLM locations. More attention has been paid to transgender. KLM has been a member of Workplace Pride for ten years and has joined the international organization Workplace Pride for the fourth year. 2021 saw KLM participate for the fourth time in the Workplace Pride Global Benchmark, whose report showed an increase in the commitment and representation of the LGBTI community within the airline.\n\nAt the end of 2020, KLM had set up the 'Inclusive Ally' program, aimed at recognizing colleagues who demonstrate innovative and appreciate inclusive behavior, and encouraging them to share their best practices This initiative drives culture change and is in line with the 2030 People Sustainability strategy. Since its inception, 18/uni00A0Inclusive Allies have come forward. During the annual Workplace Pride Leadership Gala, individuals and organizations that have made an exceptional contribution to the acceptance of LGBTQ+ colleagues in the workplace are recognized; one of KLM's captains won the award for being the most e/ffective ally.\n\n## Adapted initiatives for young people\n\nDespite the public health crisis and its financial impact on the company, Air/uni00A0France continued to welcome interns and school children on work experience placements. These programs took place both at the company's premises in the respect of the health rules and remotely, notably via digital sessions with the company's Tous En Stage  partner association.\n\nIn 2021, support for Air/uni00A0France interns nearing the end of their contracts was if anything an even greater priority for the company. The resources in place were adapted to the situation and individual support prioritized in partnership with Sodesi. Remote workshops on job-seeking techniques, building self-confidence and starting a business were thus proposed to interns. A dedicated website enabling them to access numerous job o/ffers, training and internships but also training content was put at their disposal.\n\nAs part of a growing commitment to the territories in which it exercises its activities, this year Air/uni00A0France reinforced its support for educational actions in line with the airline industry. It cooperated with the CFA of the AFMAE aviation professions and worked with local missions and P\u00f4le Emploi in the identification of profiles who could benefit from this perspective. An innovative\n\ncollaboration between JEREMY and Air/uni00A0France's Maintenance division, AFMAE and Grand Paris Seine Bi\u00e8vre was successful and offered a pre-training program to unemployed young people, enabling them to be prepared for the AFMAE selections and to integrate a two-year or three-year apprenticeship. In 2021, 17/uni00A0young people benefited from this program and Air/uni00A0 France welcomed 11/uni00A0of them on apprenticeship contracts. Despite the crisis, Air/uni00A0France continued to welcome internship students in 2020 and 2021, their number being adapted to the situation, while students were able to benefit from the support of committed tutors. In 2020, around 9% of the apprentices present at Air/uni00A0France came from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds (Quartiers Prioritaires de la Ville).\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France partnered with local associations 'Article 1' and 'Nos Quartiers Ont du Talent' to sponsor secondary school students and young graduates from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and to help them succeed in their studies or in their professional integration. In line with its commitment to helping local young people find employment, Air/uni00A0 France has voluntarily signed the governmental PAQTE programs agreement, 'La France, Une Chance, Les Entreprise S'ententent' and '1/uni00A0student, 1/uni00A0solution'. In parallel, Air/uni00A0France in partnership with the association 'Tous en Stage' continues to regularly welcome students in year three of secondary school for an internship lasting a few days. Lastly, in November/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France pilots proposed a ground-breaking initiative enabling the children of employees aged between 13/uni00A0to 25/uni00A0years to train for an Aeronautics Initiation Certificate (Brevet d'Initiation A\u00e9ronautique) awarded by the DGAC. Most of the registered students successfully passed the exam and the decision was taken to re-run the program for a second group of young people.\n\nFinally, Air/uni00A0France compensates for the job losses linked to the Voluntary Departure Plans in the French regions through regeneration actions. Since 2011, three regeneration agreements have been implemented with the payment of \u20ac9.8/uni00A0million and more than 3,600/uni00A0jobs created or maintained (500/uni00A0more than the total number of job losses) in the Ile de France and the French regions and overseas territories. The subsidiary Sodesi is responsible for implementing job creation projects as close to the ground as possible, in conjunction with the regional state representatives and the Directions R\u00e9gionales des Entreprises, de la Concurrence, de la Consommation, du Travail et de l'Emploi (DIRECCTEs).\n\n## 4.2.5/emspace Health, Safety and Quality of Life in the Workplace\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nFor the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, health, safety and the quality of life in the workplace is a major priority on which there may be no compromise. Everyone working for or with the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has the right to a healthy and safe working environment that takes into account their physical and mental well-being.\n\nIn addition to the financial impacts, the current public health crisis has major human consequences for every one of us and thus for the Group's employees.\n\nRemote working, partial activity but also and especially the Job Protection and Voluntary Departure Plan formalized in 2020 have human repercussions that the company must foresee and support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The monitoring of indicators ensures that the initiatives are continuously adapted.\n\nIn 2020, Air/uni00A0France signed an agreement to prevent and take action against violence and harassment in the workplace. This agreement establishes simplified, more e/ffective and swifter procedures for the handling of the relevant employees, but also awareness-raising and training actions together with the diagnostics to be realized.\n\nWithin both Transavia Netherlands and KLM, safety and compliance are achieved via a continuous system of processes and procedures known as the Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS). The ISMS guarantees the safety performance of all processes, in all domains, through the e/ffective management of safety risks. Safety and compliance are continuously improved via collaboration between the tasks and responsibilities of the Integrated Safety Services Organization (ISSO) and the divisions/business units. The ISMS identifies hazards, threats and safety issues, collects and analyses data, assesses safety risks, implements mitigations and monitors the results. The ISMS supports the mitigation of risks in order to keep accident and incident rates below an 'acceptable level'.\n\nIn 2021, the focus was fully on improving the occupational safety and health performance. The mitigation team of occupational experts continued to support the line management and their departments in the implementation of KLM's Occupational Safety and Health policies and the mitigation of the occupational safety and health risks.\n\nDuring 2021, the focus was on the ever-changing Covid situation in terms of current knowledge, risk assessment and the appropriate mitigating measures. Within the framework of the risk inventory and evaluation, further in-depth studies were conducted in the areas of physical load, work equipment and psycho-social workloads.\n\n## Permanent adaptation and application of the health measures\n\nIn line with 2020, the focus in 2021 remained on managing the consequences and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and adapting and continuing the risk prevention measures for the Group's operations.\n\nThese measures consisted of implementing procedures to protect employees from the risk of the epidemic in line with the recommendations from the public health authorities and the national protocol in response to the unfolding public health crisis.\n\nThe deployment of these measures was accompanied by the reinforcement of the intelligence teams and the monitoring of the cases and contacts by the occupational medicine teams, a statistical focus on the declarations and the permanent availability of occupational experts to approve the prevention measures.\n\n## Reinforced prevention of psycho-social risks\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France, to provide the best-possible support for sta/ff facing personal or professional di/fficulties, the network of social assistants rapidly mobilized. As of March/uni00A02020, the social assistants established telephone hot lines functioning five days a week to listen to and assist callers, and provide the appropriate responses. Counseling was also available from the vocational psychiatrist for situations requiring their specialist input, with direct action or the appropriate referrals for employees or their families. In January/uni00A02021, Air/uni00A0France set up a completely anonymous and confidential psychological support and advice program with a 24/7/uni00A0number. A digital platform is also available on computer, tablet and cell phone for rapid contact with a psychologist or access to psychological health information.\n\nContinuous company-wide execution of Safety Issue Risk Analyses on the virus and the monitoring/introduction of new regulations, procedures and methodologies have ensured the appropriate measures and mitigations are in place to maintain safety. To guarantee the safety of all employees, the Covid-19 regulations have constantly been adapted and wherever possible improved with more rules added as a result of safety studies and risk analysis. The mental health of employees working under increased pressure and/or from home is monitored via surveys. Initiatives to safeguard social coherence are also carried out throughout the company.",

        "page_content": "In addition to the commissioning of Verea (an absenteeism tracking system), KLM also rolled out a digital tool in which the legislation and regulations are explained. In addition, a customized approach is set up in cases where employees are no longer able to return to their own work. In November/uni00A02021, both KLM and Transavia Netherlands participated in the Week of Work Stress. By organizing various activities for all employees, attention was drawn to work stress and its prevention. Workshops were o/ffered on mindfulness, yoga, psychological capital, the balance between energy givers and energy takers, and the energy balance. In 2021, KLM won a Diamond Award for Best Airline for Health Safety.\n\n## Support for remote workers during the lockdowns\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France internal survey conducted in summer 2020 indicates that 61% of the respondents noted an improvement in the quality of life in the workplace for their teams and gave a positive score for the e/ffectiveness of their teams during the remote working period of the first lockdown, the Company and unions (CFDT and CGC-CFE) concluded an agreement on remote working on July/uni00A013, 2021. This agreement simplifies access to remote working and proposes a flexible approach. The organization proposes three types of remote working, the dates and frequencies being submitted for line management agreement in the light of the operating requirements of the department:\n\n- -  occasional remote working, where employees have an annual number of days during which they can work remotely;\n- -  alternate remote working, where, each week, employees alternate working days at and outside the Company's premises; it is possible to combine alternate with occasional remote working;\n- -  regular remote working where employees spend the major part of their working days away from the Company's premises.\n\nSince September/uni00A02021, about 8,500/uni00A0employees have signed up for a remote working scheme. The agreement also reminds participants of the criteria for accessing remote working: su/fficient autonomy, mastery of the skills to be exercised, mutual trust with the manager, a compatible work organization and position, and a suitable remote working space. Finally, more than a basic trend, the sustainable coexistence of remote and face-to-face working is leading the Group to contemplate hybrid working.\n\nAt the end of 2020, KLM conducted a survey to ascertain the level of well-being of its employees. The survey was well received and asking the question proved to be important.\n\nIn 2021, seeing that the Covid public health crises still had an impact on absenteeism, KLM introduced guidance for employees to encourage a return to the workplace. Reintegration O/fficers guaranteed a faster return to the workplace for employees, and thus maintained overall productivity and limited the damage\n\ncaused by incapacity for work. A new absenteeism tracking system was rolled out in September/uni00A02021, regrouping individual files, tasks and agreements, and ensuring the transparency of the responsibilities of all the parties.\n\nStaying both physically and mentally fit has been particularly important during the pandemic and periods of lockdown or quarantine.\n\nTo highlight good practices and encourage employees to take this question seriously, KLM has deployed various interventions advertised on the KLM MyHealth Portal, such as:\n\n- -  physiotherapy on site: dedicated to Ground Sta/ff, a team of occupational therapists are available to prevent or treat physical complaints.\n- -  corporate Social Work (Gimd): experts are available for any form of mental support, for instance questions about maintaining a healthy work-life balance, setting boundaries and dealing with changes. Financial assistance is also provided. Since the 2021 third quarter, Corporate Social Work has also been active at various workplace locations within KLM.\n- -  physically strong; various interventions to stay/become physically strong were o/ffered in 2021 such as; Stapril (a monthly challenge to walk 10,000/uni00A0steps a day), Summerrun, Urban Trails and Hello Fit (online exercises on the MyHealth portal).\n\nIn 2021, the KLM MyHealth portal was visited at least once by almost every KLM employee. Transavia Netherlands Ground Sta/ff have a personal budget of \u20ac700/uni00A0per year (full-time, part-time in proportion) to spend on various interventions to support their health. From 2022 onwards, all Transavia Netherlands employees will have access to the health portal with a budget in accordance with the CLA agreements.\n\nDue to the many compulsory and voluntary departures linked to the crisis, workload stress was an important theme in 2021. KLM o/ffered various interventions, webinars and workshops to support its employees in stress management. As in previous years, in November/uni00A02021, the KLM focus was on the Week van de Werkstress, or Stress in the Workplace Week, whose theme this year was 'Mentally Strong!' The content was updated on MyHealth and, for employees who preferred to approach the theme by themselves, KLM also o/ffered a video training module on how to prevent too much pressure, at home or at work, leading to stress. Transavia Netherlands highlighted the Dutch governmental guidelines, mainly 'Work at home unless\u2026 '. This directive had an impact on about 350/uni00A0colleagues working in the o/ffice, leading Transavia Netherlands to start looking into whether a hybrid way of working could be introduced in the future.\n\nDifferent hybrid working methods were tested during a three-month pilot among 40% of our o/ffice sta/ff and this will enable the company to introduce a hybrid working method in early 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 4.2.6.4/emspace Note on the methodology for the reporting of the social performance indicators\n\nIn 2005-06, under the aegis of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Disclosure Committee, and validated by the college of Statutory Auditors, the social performance indicators were defined to comply with the requirements of the French New Economic Regulations law (Les Nouvelles R\u00e9gulations Economiques, NRE, May/uni00A015, 2001) and the European Prospectus Directive Regulation (EC 809/2004).\n\nWork on optimizing these indicators was undertaken in 2018 to align the Grenelle II reporting with the new requirements linked to the transposition of the Directive on the Extra-Financial Performance Statement.\n\nSince the 2007-08/uni00A0financial year, the Group has chosen to appoint one of its Statutory Auditors, KPMG Audit, a department of KPMG/uni00A0SA, to be responsible for verifying a selection of its reported social indicators.\n\nSince 2018 and in application of the provisions of Article L./uni00A0 225-102-1/uni00A0of the French Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce), it has been the responsibility of our Independent Third Party to determine the compliance of the Extra-financial performance statement and the accuracy of the published CSR information.\n\n## Reporting scope\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's social reporting consolidation scope is based on the number of employees (expressed as headcount) on the payroll at the end of the calendar year.\n\nThe reporting scope covers 98% of the average employees in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group at the end of the 2021 calendar year, expressed in full-time equivalent.\n\nThe subsidiaries of Air/uni00A0France and KLM over which the Group exercises control at the 50% minimum, whose acquisition dates back at least one full year and which have at least 250/uni00A0employees, are included in this social reporting scope.\n\nNote that the number of employees for Air/uni00A0France and KLM and its subsidiaries comprises their entire workforces including sta/ff employed internationally:\n\n- -  for the 2021 financial year, the Air/uni00A0France consolidated subsidiaries are: Barfield/uni00A0Inc., Blue Connect, BlueLink, BlueLink International CZ, CRMA, HOP, Sodexi and Transavia France, representing 93% of the employees of the subsidiaries in the Air/uni00A0France Group;\n- -  for the 2021 financial year, the KLM consolidated subsidiaries are: Cygnific, KLM UK Engineering, KLM Cityhopper, Transavia C.V., KLM Catering Services and Int. Airline Services, representing 86% of the employees in the subsidiaries of the KLM Group.\n\nThe reporting scope for the AF subsidiaries did not change relative to 2020, with no subsidiaries being either included or withdrawn.\n\nThe reporting scope for the KLM subsidiaries did not change relative to 2020, with no subsidiaries being either included or withdrawn.\n\nThe reference number of employees for calculating the coverage rate of the social reporting is the average number of employees in Full Time Equivalent during 2021, derived from the Management Control division's BFC tool.\n\nThe reporting period for the Group's social information is based on the calendar year to ensure consistency with the social performance indicators of other French companies.\n\n## Reporting tools\n\nThis year the social reporting has been carried out using the ONEmission tool from the editor Enablon implemented for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. Consistency tests have been incorporated within this tool together with precise definitions of each indicator. The data are verified and approved locally at the level of each subsidiary by a manager who is responsible for the HR statistical data.\n\nThis tool is supplemented by overall coordination of the process and by a general reporting procedure which defines the process for compiling, calculating and consolidating the indicators, based on an instruction memorandum circulated by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's Finance division.\n\nThe consolidation of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's social information is carried out by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Sustainability & Compliance department.\n\n## Details and methodology - Definition of the key performance indicators and comments on changes in the indicators\n\n## Definition of the key performance indicators\n\n## Employee Promoter Score (EPS)\n\nScope: Air/uni00A0France and KLM (employees on French or Dutch contracts).\n\nThe Employee Promoter Score (or EPS) is the score given to Air/uni00A0 France and KLM in their capacity as employers by their employees. Since July/uni00A02019, this indicator has been measured at Air/uni00A0France and KLM on a weekly basis, based on a random group of 1,500/uni00A0employees representing all the Air/uni00A0France and KLM businesses, in the form of a question sent by mail: 'How likely are you to recommend Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as an employer to friends and family?', on a scale of 0/uni00A0to 10. The EPS corresponds to the di/fference between the percentage of employee promoters (score of 8/uni00A0to 10) of the employer brand and the percentage of detractors (scores 0/uni00A0to 5).\n\nThe indicator measured is the annual change in the consolidated EPS for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\n## Percentage of women in management functions (ground sta/ff, pilots, cabin crews)\n\nScope: Air/uni00A0France and KLM employees (expressed as 'headcount') on both permanent (CDI) and fixed-term (CDD) contracts, on the payroll as of December/uni00A031/uni00A0of the reference year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nThe indicator measured is the percentage of women in the three sta/ff categories:\n\n- - Ground sta/ff: percentage of women in the top 10% management level. The percentage of women is calculated by combining all the levels of management, classified in descending hierarchical order, until the threshold of 10% of the total salaried workforce of Air/uni00A0France and KLM is reached. For this last level of management, the entire workforce is taken into account;\n- - Pilots: percentage of women amongst the pilots exercising management functions (Flight Captain);\n- - Cabin crews: percentage of women amongst the cabin crews exercising management functions (Pursers).\n\n## Number of training hours\n\nSee 'Training' below - Note/uni00A05.\n\n## Comments on changes in the social indicators\n\nNo changes were made to the social indicators in 2021.\n\nFor the other social data dashboard (Absenteeism, Health and Safety, Disabled Sta/ff and Collective Agreements Signed), the data of Air/uni00A0France and its subsidiaries have been aggregated. KLM and its subsidiaries' data have also been aggregated.\n\n## 'Consolidated social data for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group' table\n\nThis table presents the indicators relating to the number of employees, hires and departures, the proportion of female employees and the percentage of sta/ff working part time. These indicators are consolidated at the level of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group.\n\nThe following notes refer to the references in the social indicator tables (section/uni00A04.2.1).\n\n## Employees\n\nNote/uni00A01 : The number of people employed by the Group (expressed as headcount) on both permanent (CDI) and fixed-term contracts (CDD) on December/uni00A031/uni00A0of the reference year.\n\n## Recruitment on permanent contracts\n\nNote/uni00A02 : The indicator concerns employees hired on permanent contracts (CDI).\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France, the calculation of the number of employees recruited on permanent contracts includes those initially recruited on fixed-term contracts (CDD) transferring to permanent contracts (CDI) during the year.\n\nFor KLM, only employees recruited directly on permanent contracts are taken into account.\n\n## Percentage of women - Organization of working time\n\nNote/uni00A03: These indicators enable the percentage of women to be evaluated relative to the workforce and the proportion of part-time employees on both permanent and fixed-term contracts at December/uni00A031/uni00A0of the reference year.\n\n## Employees by geographical zone at December/uni00A031\n\nNote/uni00A04: In 2021, the Air/uni00A0France Group employees in the French Overseas Departments and Territories, i.e. 592/uni00A0employees, have been included in the Caribbean-Indian Ocean geographical zone.\n\n## Training\n\nNote/uni00A05: The 'Number of training hours by employee' indicator is calculated based on all the training sessions, divided by the average monthly headcount. This indicator is presented at Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group consolidated level.\n\nFor KLM and the KLM subsidiaries, the hours of external training dispensed to KLM Group administrative employees and the hours of training given to employees of the Transavia Netherlands subsidiary (less than 10% of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's headcount) are not included in the 'Training Hours' indicator due to there being no information collation process in place. Measures will be taken to progressively expand the reporting scope of the indicator in the coming financial years.\n\nThe subsidiaries regrouped under KLM International are managed independently locally and the KLM Group only has access to e-learning training.\n\n## 'Other social data' tables\n\nThe indicators reported in the 'Other social data' tables are subject to di/fferent qualification and legal reporting obligations in France and the Netherlands, meaning that they are not comparable and need to be presented separately for Air/uni00A0France and KLM. The subsidiaries concerned in these tables are listed in the reporting scope section above.\n\n## Absenteeism - Health and safety in the workplace (see Note/uni00A01)\n\nA significant portion of the work-related accidents reported by Air/uni00A0France is due to cases of barometric otitis and musculoskeletal disorders which are recognized as work-related accidents in France whereas they are recorded as sick leave by KLM in accordance with Dutch law.\n\nAll KLM absences are on a declarative basis due to the local legislation which, unlike in France, only requires the employee to provide a certificate of absence from work after six weeks of absence. For work-related absences, only absences following a work-related accident are easily detected.\n\n## -Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France subsidiaries (Note/uni00A01)\n\nThe absenteeism rates are calculated based on the hours of absence expressed as a ratio of the hours theoretically worked (excluding leave). For Air/uni00A0France flight crews, absenteeism is broken down into days then converted into hours by multiplying by five hours.\n\nThe absenteeism rate for accidents in the workplace also takes into account travel-related accidents.\n\n## -KLM and KLM subsidiaries (Note 1)\n\nSince the 2014 financial year, the absenteeism rates due to work-related accidents or illness have been reported separately.",

Attitudes towards the acceptability of air transportation growth are changing at both political level and in terms of wider society. Both France and the Netherlands have implemented policies to ensure the transition to a net zero carbon society by 2050. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group intends to be a player in the transformation of its sector of activity, and aims to occupy a leading role and influence.\n\nPlaying an active role in advancing our goal of net zero emissions by 2050 as an industry, and committing to setting science-based targets in line with the SBTi criteria, were crucial milestones in 2021 and a strong marker for the Group, reflecting people's changing perceptions of travel and calls for more responsible use of aviation.

Studies are ongoing in order to assess the 'e/ffective radiative forcing' when taking non-CO2 impacts on the climate into account. Projections show that, within a decade and unless the airline industry takes action now, this contribution could reach 10%. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's ambition is to rise to the challenge of the ecological transition along with all the players in the aviation sector. Companies must now adopt a new model guaranteeing a balance between growth and ecology. The challenges facing the aviation sector are not just restrictions but also technological. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has the opportunity to lead the construction of this new model. The Group will reach these ambitious objectives by working with all the players in the aviation industry - aircraft manufacturers, airlines and industrial partners - as well as with the entire transport sector, rail partners included.\n\nIn 2021, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) reinforced its previous climate ambitions and approved a resolution targeting net zero carbon emissions for the global air transport industry by 2050. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has taken very proactive action by defining a decarbonization trajectory with ambitious targets:\n\n- -  target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050;\n- -  50% reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 2030;\n- -  carbon neutrality for the ground operations by 2030.\n\nAlthough international aviation is not included in the Paris Climate Agreement, the industry's e/fforts respond to the latter's goal of limiting the global temperature increase to well below 2\u00b0C. In 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group announced plans to align its/uni00A0CO2 emission targets with the UN's Paris Climate Agreement.",

        "page_content": "On October/uni00A029, Air/uni00A0France and KLM also announced their commitment to having their/uni00A0CO2 emission reduction targets validated by the independent reference organization SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative), founded by the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project), the United Nations Global Compact and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). This commitment shows the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's determination to achieve its/uni00A0CO2 reduction targets by allowing them to be evaluated and verified using a scientific framework and criteria, to guarantee that the targets set are aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement. With the Science-Based Targets initiative, stakeholders have the assurance that the targets set are in line with the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to below 2\u00b0C. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is one of the first European airline groups to choose to have its decarbonization trajectory validated by the SBTi. With this commitment, the Group has adopted the principle of full transparency, the scientific evaluation of our ambitions and a supplementary commitment to reducing/uni00A0CO2 by 2030 in addition to our net zero carbon emission target by 2050.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is, however, not only a company committed to preserving the environment but also a company committed to giving the best of its human qualities, which continues to take initiatives and innovate.\n\nTo achieve these objectives and reduce its carbon footprint by activating all the levers at its disposal, the Group is pursuing its Climate Action Plan. A key element of this plan is the decarbonization road map. This road map has six priority areas for which targets have been identified and action plans deployed:\n\n- -  fleet modernization and contributing to aeronautical research; increased aircraft e/fficiency is a key priority and is being addressed in all the company's business segments;\n- -  sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and participation in research into alternative propulsion technologies; Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's contribution to the energy transition involves a commitment to developing the use of SAF. Fleet renewal and the generation of new fuels are the two main levels in the transformation of an airline. Air/uni00A0France is participating in the SAF call for projects in France and aims to open the way to their utilization: the Group will progressively include a 5% SAF component by 2030 and more than 60% in 2050;\n- -  operational measures;\n- -  support for the implementation of the global climate agreement (CORSIA, Carbon O/ffsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation to reduce net/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 50% by 2050 relative to the 2005 baseline) and a fair contribution from aviation;\n- -  regulatory and proactive o/ffsetting;\n- -  support for environmental programs.\n\nThe European aviation sector believes that its recovery is fully compatible with, and should be accompanied by, broader efforts to reduce its environmental footprint, provided the right policies are in place. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and the\n\nEuropean aviation players are thus committed to pursuing their e/fforts to reduce their environmental impacts, at both local and global level. The latter implies, in particular, that all stakeholders and policy-makers work together to achieve net zero/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 2050.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions: Scopes 1, 2 and 3\n\nMost of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are generated by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's direct activities (scope/uni00A01), and mainly by the flight operations which represent 99.7% of the Group's total direct emissions. The ground operations (testing bench, runway vehicles,/uni00A0etc.) represent 0.3%.\n\nThe ground operations, like the aircraft maintenance and tertiary activities, also generate indirect greenhouse gas emissions (scope/uni00A02), through energy consumption in buildings (electricity and air conditioning). The Group implements measures to reduce ground energy consumption.\n\nThe indirect Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0greenhouse gas emissions mostly come from the upstream phase (extraction, production, distribution,/uni00A0etc.) in aviation kerosene production and carbon emissions from runway vehicles and equipment. The other scope/uni00A03/uni00A0components are the purchasing of goods and services, aircraft manufacturing, passenger road travel to and from airports, and employee commuting. Air/uni00A0France and KLM implement measures to reduce scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions.\n\nEvery year, the Group reports 100% of its scope/uni00A01 and 2/uni00A0CO2 emissions, and the scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions resulting from the upstream phase in aviation kerosene production. These emissions are reported in the form of indicators presented in the environmental indicator tables, accompanied by a definition of the respective scopes (see section/uni00A04.3.5).\n\n## Fuel-saving measures\n\nAll possible avenues of fuel-savings are identified and, when feasible, implemented, subject to strict respect of the rules on Flight Safety. All the airlines within Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM are included in the Fuel Plan, to improve the Group's energy e/fficiency and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\n## Fleet modernization\n\nCurrently, the most impactful way to reduce the carbon footprint is to invest in more fuel-e/fficient fleet. The Group is focusing on simplification and rationalization to make the fleet more competitive. The transformation of the Group is therefore continuing with the arrival of more modern, high-performance aircraft with a significantly lower environmental impact. The Covid-19 public health crisis has accelerated the phase-out of the aircraft least adapted to the environmental route map; the A340s and A380s at Air/uni00A0France and the B747s at KLM were phased out respectively in March/uni00A02020 and October/uni00A02021 (except for the four B747 Freighters).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The latest-generation A350 consumes 25% less fuel than previous-generation aircraft (a gain of 2.5/uni00A0liters per passenger per 100/uni00A0kilometers) thanks, in particular, to the incorporation of 67% lighter materials: 53% composites and 14% titanium. Its noise footprint has also been reduced by 40%. The latest-generation Airbus A220 embodies Air/uni00A0France's commitment to sustainable development: it consumes 20% less fuel than the aircraft it replaces and its noise footprint is 34% lower than that the older generation aircraft.\n\nIn 2021, KLM received its first Embraer 195-E2. This new aircraft type is both quieter and more economical than its predecessor the EMB190. The 195-E2 consumes 9% less fuel per flight and therefore emits 31% less/uni00A0CO2 per passenger km in comparison with the E-190. This new aircraft type is also 63% quieter than the EMB190. Seven new aircraft of this type entered the KLM Cityhopper fleet this year of the total 25 that KLM has on order.\n\nDespite the crisis, the Group is maintaining its investment e/fforts and thus contributing to improving its environmental performance. The average age of the Group's fleet moved from 12.1/uni00A0years in 2020 to 12.2/uni00A0years in 2021 (see section/uni00A01.4 for more information on the fleet).\n\n## Sustainable aviation fuel\n\nThe use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is one of the most promising avenues for reducing/uni00A0CO2 emissions from aviation. Depending on the bio mass and technology utilized, they can reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions, over the total life cycle, by up to 90% (existing technologies) with the prospect of more than 100% for future technologies (synthetic fuels). When sourcing SAF, the Group aims for at least a 75% reduction in/uni00A0CO2. By 2022, the Group will incorporate around 1% SAF in the total fuel consumption of flights on departure from France and the Netherlands. Such fuels will be key to supporting the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's energy transition but also that of the aviation industry as a whole.\n\nAfter analysis phases during which Air/uni00A0France and KLM respectively demonstrated no operational impact and the ability to carry out safe air operations in any type of aircraft powered by all engine types, for several years the Group has been committed to fostering the development of a sustainable alternative fuel industry for aviation. By mobilizing the eco-system, Air/uni00A0France and KLM have established innovative partnerships with corporate clients, suppliers, airports and logistics partners exemplified, in 2019, by the announcement from KLM and SkyNRG of plans to develop Europe's first dedicated plant for the production of SAF in Delfzijl (the Netherlands). For its part, Air/uni00A0France was behind the Engagement for Green Growth (Engagement pour la Croissance Verte  - ECV), a public-private initiative to study the\n\nconditions necessary to establish French and European industries, whose report was submitted to the government in 2019. In 2020, the airline made a commitment to various consortia supporting French production projects. Strong governmental support, for example via incentive mechanisms, is however required to ensure the economic viability of such biofuels, in terms of both their more-wide-scale deployment and the creation of production facilities for producers and operators alike.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has strict standards for the sustainability criteria of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel it uses. It requires a reduction of more than 75% in/uni00A0CO2 emissions over its total lifecycle, a minimal impact on biodiversity, no competition with food production or access to food resources, no use of palm oil as it is a strong driver of deforestation, and a positive impact on local development.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM have been members of a sustainable certification body, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), since 2008, in their capacity as founding members of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG). This body takes into account 12/uni00A0criteria ranging from food security to rural development, the quality of air, soil and water resources, and waste management.\n\n## Stimulating the industry\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM are members of working groups and support research projects aimed at the creation of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel market. For example:\n\n## In 2021:\n\n- - Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM joined forces with the global airline leaders and Boston Consulting Group to form the Aviation Climate Taskforce (ACT), a new non-profit organization founded to accelerate breakthroughs in emerging technologies to decarbonize aviation. ACT will stimulate innovation in the next generation of technologies, principally focused on critical medium-term solutions, such as synthetic fuel and direct air capture. Over time, the portfolio will expand to include more near-term solutions, such as emerging bio-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel pathways, and long-term solutions, such as hydrogen technologies. ACT's mission will be supported by two pillars: an Innovation network and a Collaboration Forum to help accelerate innovation and expedite adoption.\n- - KLM has operated the world's first commercial passenger flight with a mixture of 500/uni00A0liters of sustainably-produced synthetic kerosene. Shell produced this synthetic kerosene at its research centre in Amsterdam based on/uni00A0CO2, water and renewable energy from sun and wind in the Dutch territory. In addition to this initiative, KLM also announced that the start-up Synkero is collaborating with the Port of Amsterdam, Schiphol, KLM and SkyNRG on the realization of a commercial synthetic sustainable kerosene plant in the Amsterdam port.",

        "page_content": "- - On May/uni00A018, 2021, Air/uni00A0France operated the first long-haul flight powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This first 'Made in France' SAF was ISCC-EU certified by the International Sustainability & Carbon Certification, an independent body which guarantees sustainability. The 16% SAF blend powering this flight avoided the emission of 20/uni00A0tonnes of/uni00A0CO2. This flight also illustrates the complementarity between the levers in reducing the environmental footprint: sustainable aviation fuel, latest-generation aircraft and electrification of the ground operations. The flight was operated in the A350, an aircraft consuming 25% less fuel than its predecessors. The aircraft was serviced using the first 100% all-electric refueling truck, developed in France with Total expertise, and all of the ground support equipment used by Air/uni00A0France was fully electric powered.\n- - KLM is member of the Clean Skies for Tomorrow (CST) coalition, which was established within the World Economic Forum to ensure adequate supplies of SAF so as to be able to fly/uni00A0CO2-neutral by the middle of this century. In 2021, the coalition worked on creating a coalition-wide ambition of 'using 10% SAF by 2030'.\n\nIn previous years:\n\n- - Air/uni00A0France joined forces with ATAG (Air Transport Aviation Group) to promote, with the French Civil Aviation Research Council, greater knowledge of biofuels for aviation and thus raise public authority awareness of the need to support a French biofuels industry. The airline is also actively participating in the establishment of the French national road map on aviation biofuels managed by the National Alliance for Coordination of Research on Energy (ANCRE);\n- - In 2017, Air/uni00A0France initiated the Green Growth Commitment (ECV) with the Ministries of Ecological Transition and Solidarity, Transport and Economy and Finance, as well as four other major French industrial groups (Airbus, Safran, Suez and Total). This ECV has made it possible to identify the conditions for the emergence of sustainable aeronautical fuel industries in France, under economically viable conditions.\n\n## Supporting regulatory incentives in France and the Netherlands, and at international level\n\nThe flight path and ART fuel forum platforms are being transformed. Air/uni00A0France and KLM are now involved in the creation and implementation of a new European platform, the ESAF (European SAF Alliance), to support the development and use of SAF at European level.\n\nWithin the framework of the French State's call for Projects in 2021, Air/uni00A0France supported several new Sustainable Aviation Fuel production programs. By actively seeking industrial and logistics partners to combine forces in consortia, the Group is backing innovative technologies, with alternative fuels originating from the circular economy (e.g. wood residues and household waste) and, in future, synthetic fuels whose design is based on green electricity and carbon capture (e.g. from the cement industry).\n\nIn 2021, the Swedish Energy Agency granted funding to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, S\u00f6dra, V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Energi, SkyNRG, RISE Research Institutes of Sweden and 2030-sekretariatet, enabling them to continue their research into developing the manufacturing of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the V\u00e4xj\u00f6 region in Sm\u00e5land, Sweden. The funding will support the consortium's ongoing research on an integrated Fischer-Tropsch SAF production facility using forestry residues. To meet future demand, the partners will study all the engineering, technical, business and sustainability angles of the project.\n\nThe European Commission has awarded funding to a number of consortia aiming to speed up the rollout of sustainable technologies in aviation and significantly contribute towards zero-emission and zero-waste airports by 2030, and climate-neutral aviation by 2050. These consortia include:\n\n- -TULIPS: a consortium of 29/uni00A0partners, including KLM, led by Royal Schiphol Group. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol will be the proving ground for 17/uni00A0demonstrator projects originating from the collaboration. The TULIPS project will kick o/ff in January/uni00A02022 and last until December/uni00A02025.\n- -OLGA: led by ADP Group with Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport as frontrunner, this project regrouping four international airports and 57/uni00A0partners was launched on October/uni00A01, 2021: Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Milan Malpensa, Zagreb, and Cluj. Air/uni00A0France, as a partner of the OLGA project and a pioneer in the electrification of the ground support equipment fleet at the Paris airports, is a real driving force in the clean energy transition and the reduction of local emissions thanks to its work on optimizing electric recharging operations and hydrogen solutions, and the use of sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nThis funding is part of the European Green Deal, to develop innovative solutions that facilitate the transition to low-carbon mobility and enhance sustainability at airports. To rise to these emission-reduction challenges in the aviation sector, a real commitment is required from the entire chain. The cooperation between airports, airlines, knowledge institutes and industrial partners in these unique European consortia makes it possible to contribute significantly to sustainable aviation.\n\nThrough the Council for Civil Aviation Research (CORAC), Air/uni00A0France is participating in the definition of a sustainable fuel strategy in coherent technological research and innovation actions, aimed at achieving the objectives of the ecological transition, in a global context.\n\nKLM is actively involved in the BioPort Holland project, a collaboration between the Dutch Government and several private parties with a collective ambition of launching sustainable aviation fuel production in the Netherlands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Since 2016, all KLM flights on departure from Los Angeles airport have been operated with SAF produced by the local World Energy (former AltAir Fuels) refinery and supplied by SkyNRG. This sustainable fuel, produced by Neste from used cooking oil, will bridge the gap until the coming on stream of the SAF production plant.\n\nIn 2019, KLM made a decade-long commitment to developing and purchasing an annual 75,000/uni00A0tons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, making it the first airline in the world to invest in SAF on this scale. SkyNRG will develop Europe's first dedicated plant for the production of SAF. The construction of this facility, which is scheduled to open in 2024, is a concrete step towards fulfilling KLM's sustainability ambitions.\n\n## Involving customers and partners\n\nAs part of a KLM WWF-Netherlands partnership and Green Deal commitment, thanks to this initial production of SAF, Air/uni00A0 France and KLM have been the first carriers to o/ffer both a Corporate SAF program and a Cargo SAF program to their customers, creating awareness and knowledge around SAF, and encouraging companies to reduce their business-travel-related scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions. In 2021, seventy companies signed up, tripling the number of corporate customers committed to the program compared to 2020.\n\n## Operational measures\n\nWeight reduction: the lighter the aircraft, the less fuel it consumes. All the divisions of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM are working to reduce weight on board. This includes, for example, reducing the weight of seats, galley and service equipment, products such as paper documentation for cargo and flight decks, magazines and the loading of drinking water.\n\nRoute and flight path optimization: improvements in fuel e/fficiency are achieved through the optimization of routes, flight paths and altitudes, and a reduction in aircraft waiting times. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is proactively involved in the SESAR program, which contributes to the targets of the Single European Sky (SES) for the better management of air tra/ffic. SESAR aims to contribute to the SES's 10%/uni00A0CO2 reduction target by reducing fuel burn.\n\nFlight operations optimization: whenever possible, pilots apply the most-fuel-e/fficient procedures: Flight Plan precision, speed adjustments and optimized trajectories, and, on the ground, taxiing with one engine shut down. New e/fficient tools based on artificial intelligence are being implemented, in partnership with innovative start-ups.\n\nFor example, Transavia has joined forces with OpenAirlines, a start-up which has been awarded the Solar Impulse E/fficient Solution label by Bertrand Piccard's Solar Impulse Foundation. The SkyBreathe tool enables the highly-precise tracking of the application of fuel-e/fficiency practices for each flight. Transavia was the first airline to deploy this solution in France and is pursuing its e/fforts on eco-flying. The airline has thus announced a new partnership with OpenAirlines for the roll-out of SkyBreathe OnBoard, a real-time, eco-flying solution.\n\nThe company has also deployed a tool proposed by Satefy Line: Optidirect. The application proposes direct alternative routes in flight to reduce fuel consumption. With Optiflight (composed of Opticlimb, Optispeed and Opdirect) Transavia France benefits from e/fficient tools to reduce its inflight/uni00A0CO2 emissions. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group airline thus benefits from high-performance and innovative tools enabling a reduction in its inflight/uni00A0CO2 emissions.\n\n## Mandatory/uni00A0CO2 compensation\n\nSince 2012, all intra-European flights have been subject to the application of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme for greenhouse gas emission quotas (EU-ETS) (for the 2021 figures, see section/uni00A04.3.6 'Environmental indicators').\n\nThe global market-based mechanism established by the ICAO, known as CORSIA (Carbon O/ffsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), aims to limit the/uni00A0CO2 emissions from international aviation by targeting carbon neutral growth relative to the 2020 baseline. In 2020, due to the impact of the public health crisis on aviation, the baseline was changed to 2019.\n\nFor the implementation of CORSIA, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group contributed to the calculation of the/uni00A0CO2 emission baseline data as of January/uni00A01, 2019. The implementation of CORSIA o/ffsetting began with a first phase from 2021 to 2026, based on those States volunteering to contribute: i.e. currently 88/uni00A0countries, representing around 77% of international aviation activity.\n\nThe European Union will implement the ICAO's CORSIA scheme within the framework of the current EU-ETS regulation for the scope of international flights. In this context, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM considers that the same/uni00A0CO2 emissions should not be subject to both EU-ETS and CORSIA. Assuming a change to the provisions of the EU-ETS, the Group is calling for a detailed impact study to be conducted on the envisaged amendments and is drawing attention to the need for the prior design of a carbon adjustment mechanism at the borders of the European Union, to protect the European airlines from 'carbon leakage'.\n\n## Voluntary carbon o/ffsetting and support for environmental programs\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM offer their individual and corporate customers the opportunity to o/ffset their/uni00A0CO2 emissions on a voluntary basis, by making/uni00A0CO2 emission calculators available to customers on their websites. These calculators are directly linked to an emission evaluation system, enabling passengers to o/ffset the carbon emissions associated with their travel, should they so wish.",

        "page_content": "With the Trip and Tree program, Air/uni00A0France is partnering with the A Tree for You association which brings together, in total transparency, donors and tree-planting projects from all over the world. When purchasing a flight ticket, customers can volunteer to help the planet by making a donation in the amount of their choice to finance one of the tree-planting projects supported by the Trip and Tree program.\n\nKLM's CO2ZERO compensation service also enables passengers to o/ffset their carbon emissions. Customer contributions are invested directly in a carbon-offsetting project in Panama certified by the Gold Standard for the Global Goals label that focuses on planting new trees, preserving existing forests and supporting the local community. In 2021, the number of journeys booked including a/uni00A0CO2 compensation request represented the purchase of 71,000/uni00A0tons of carbon credits.\n\nTransavia also o/ffers its customers the opportunity to o/ffset their/uni00A0CO2 emissions on a voluntary basis when booking thanks to the CO2ZERO program. Every month, in 2020, between 5% and 8% of customers thus o/ffset their emissions. This figure has remained stable despite the Covid-19 public health crisis.\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2020, Air/uni00A0France has been proactively o/ffsetting 100% of the/uni00A0CO2 emissions generated by its domestic flights. This represents a daily average of more than 450/uni00A0flights. In cooperation with its partner EcoAct, this compensation takes the form of participation in projects certified by the highest international standards, and selected for their e/ffective contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their significant benefits for the local populations, to support reforestation, preserve forests and biodiversity, and develop renewable energies. Air/uni00A0France is one of the first airlines in the world to o/ffset the emissions generated by its domestic flights.\n\nLastly, corporate customers can also volunteer to o/ffset up to 100% of the emissions generated on their short, medium and long-haul flights thanks to a dedicated o/ffer. Seventy-eight corporate customers (under Corporate Incentive Agreements) and 92/uni00A0Bluebiz customers thus participated in our o/ffsetting programs, representing 11,382/uni00A0mT of/uni00A0CO2.\n\nFor more information on these programs see section/uni00A04.3.5 'Biodiversity'.\n\n## Ground energy consumption\n\nEnergy consumption in the ground operations, such as the fuel used by ground support equipment, gas for heating purposes and electricity for aircraft maintenance and tertiary activities, generates direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (scope/uni00A01 and scope/uni00A02).\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM had initially been targeting a 20% improvement in ground operation energy e/fficiency by 2020 (relative to the 2011 level), by optimizing energy consumption and increasing the use of renewable energies. Air/uni00A0France reached this target in 2017 and has pursued its initiatives to maintain and build on these results, despite the fluctuations in consumption linked to climate events.\n\nIn 2019, Air/uni00A0France and KLM set themselves a target of carbon-neutral ground operations by 2030. In 2021, the Group reduced its/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 10% compared with their 2020 level.\n\nIn 2021, within the framework of its zero-emission target for the ground operations by 2030, the Group pursued and stepped up its actions to reduce its energy consumption by upgrading its equipment and including this target in supplier contracts with, notably, an energy-e/fficiency commitment based on a bonus/ malus principle and the implementation of a five-year action plan aiming for carbon neutrality.\n\nIn 2020, a plan to rationalize the Group's floor area and di/fferent buildings had also enabled an increase in the per/uni00A0m/two.sup utilization ratio and thus a reduction in the associated energy footprint. For example, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM sales teams for the French market moved to more suitable premises in central Montreuil. In November/uni00A02020, it was the turn of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM delegation in Dubai to move into its new LEED OR (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) ecological-excellence-certified premises.\n\nOther initiatives are based on the increased use of renewable energies. For example, at Toulouse and Valbonne in the south of France where the bulk of the IT servers are located, 100% of the heating needs of the tertiary buildings are met by recycling the heat generated by the air conditioning system. Photovoltaic energy projects will be deployed in the Group's facilities at the Roissy-CDG head o/ffice. Another example is KLM's initiative to install solar panels on the roof of its largest aircraft hangar, finalized in 2021.\n\n2020 was the last year of KLM's third multi-year energy e/fficiency agreement with the Dutch Ministry of Economic A/ffairs, aimed at increasing energy e/fficiency by at least 2% a year. In order to comply with the Energy E/fficiency Directive, which replaced this agreement as of January/uni00A01, 2021, KLM has obtained ISO/uni00A050001/uni00A0certification for its energy management system.\n\nTo reduce fuel consumption, all the ramp equipment transporting baggage have been replaced by electrically-powered alternatives, enabling the proportion of electrically-powered ground assistance equipment to reach 61% at Roissy-CDG airport in 2021. KLM has trialed electrical alternatives to the ground propulsion units, and push back and towing equipment. All this equipment is responsible for 72% of the/uni00A0CO2 emissions from ground equipment, meaning that pursuing these trials in 2022 o/ffers a promising avenue towards reducing direct emissions in airports.\n\nIn 2020, with other industry players, KLM and Transavia participated in a Proof-of-Concept exercise for the Taxibot at Schiphol Airport. This aircraft towing vehicle can replace the use of aircraft engines during taxiing. The pilot project was realized to gather information on its feasibility, the impact on safety and capacity, and emission reductions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The ISO/uni00A014001 certificate (2015 version) has been renewed until 2023 for Air/uni00A0France and KLM. Internal and external audits verify the e/ffective implementation of the EMS.\n\nIn addition to compliance with the regulations in force, the Environmental Management System is used to drive an improvement in environmental performance and innovation, both within the Group and at its suppliers.\n\n## Mobilizing partners and supporting research and development\n\nThe Group is mobilizing the industry and is committed to research and development into innovative solutions, design, aeronautical and engine maintenance and navigation tools, and in Sustainable Alternative Fuels.\n\nIn December/uni00A02019, Air/uni00A0France announced the signature of a partnership with the Solar Impulse Foundation, to promote the identification and rapid implementation of economically and ecologically-viable solutions for aviation. Air/uni00A0France and the Solar Impulse Foundation have launched a call for clean, e/fficient and profitable solutions to accelerate the ecological transition of the aviation sector. The PROGNOS solution, deployed by Air/uni00A0France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance, has already obtained the Solar Impulse Label. This predictive analysis program is based on harnessing big data technologies to o/ffer an e/ffective and innovative aeronautics maintenance service. The environmental benefits of PROGNOS stem from reducing\n\nflight cancellations leading to extra flights to recover grounded passengers, as well as reducing the number of Quick Return Flights (return of the aircraft to its departure airport) following technical alerts, which require fuel tanks to be emptied prior to landing. It also optimizes overall aircraft fuel consumption by monitoring the status of equipment more precisely.\n\nIn 2019, TU Delft and KLM announced the start of the design of the Flying-V aircraft. The Flying-V is a design for a very-energy-e/fficient long-haul aircraft. The improved aerodynamic shape and reduced weight of the aircraft will reduce fuel consumption by 20% compared to today's most advanced aircraft. After extensive wind tunnel and ground tests, the first successful test flight with a scale model of the Flying-V took place in 2020. Further flight simulator tests were successfully completed in 2021, making further climate assessments and studying the potential for noise reduction and improvements in flight characteristics and structures. The Hydrogen Flying V concept was also featured in a National Geographic article 'Take a look inside the Flying-V' (nationalgeographic.com).\n\nAir France - KLM Group companies are investing in training their future pilots on electric aircraft. Since March 2021, pilots in the Air France 'cadets' program have been trained on V\u00e9lis Electro, the world's first certified electric aircraft. This has enabled Air France to become the first airline in the world to introduce electric aviation in its pilot training.\n\nAlso, on the occasion of its 75 th /uni00A0 anniversary, the KLM Flight Academy announced that flight training on electric training aircraft had started for future KLM pilots, in collaboration with the E-Flight Academy at Teuge Airport. In addition, purchase options have been taken out for the next generation of electric training aircraft being developed in the US by Bye Aerospace, which are expected to become available within a few years.",

These recommendations, which are applicable across all sectors and can be included in existing financial reports, aim to increase the transparency between companies and investors, thereby\n\nreducing investment risks and reconciling short-term financial decisions with the longer-term consequences of climate change.\n\nIn 2019, the Group realized the TCDF Climate Maturity Assessment developed by KPMG, to evaluate the concordance of its environmental reporting with the principles of the TCDF. The actions implemented by the Group are presented in the table below.\n\nAs a result, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM decided to become an o/fficial supporter of the TCFD principles with a commitment to continuing to improve its knowledge and reporting.\n\nSections in the 2021 Universal\n\nTable of concordance with URD document and TCFD principles\n\n|   TCFD Principles | TCFD Principles                                                                                                                                             | Registration Document        |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|               1   | Governance                                                                                                                                                  |                              |\n|               1.1 | Describe the Board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities                                                                                   | Sections 2.3.2, 3.2.1        |\n|               1.2 | Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and  opportunities                                                               | Section/uni00A02.3.2         |\n|               2   | Strategy                                                                                                                                                    |                              |\n|               2.1 | Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified   over the short, medium, and long term                                | Sections 3.1.2, 4.1.2, 4.3.2 |\n|               2.2 | Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's  businesses, strategy and financial planning                           | Sections 3.1.2, 4.1.2, 4.3.2 |\n|               2.3 | Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration   di/fferent climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario | Section/uni00A04.3.2         |\n|               3   | Risk management                                                                                                                                             |                              |\n|               3.1 | Describe the organization's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks                                                                   | Sections 3.1.2, 4.3.2        |\n|               3.2 | Describe the organization's processes for managing climate-related risks                                                                                    | Sections 2.3.2, 3.1.2, 4.3.2 |\n|               3.3 | Describe how the processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related  risks are integrated into the organization's overall risk management   | Section/uni00A03.2.2         |\n|               4   | Metrics and targets                                                                                                                                         |                              |\n|               4.1 | Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and  opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process      | Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.2        |\n|               4.2 | Disclose Scope/uni00A01, Scope/uni00A02 and, if appropriate, Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,  and the related risks                   | Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.6        |\n|               4.3 | Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and  opportunities, and performance against targets                           | Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.2        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The Group has formalized its commitment to noise mitigation by making it a requirement enshrined in The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles.\n\nFleet modernization and improved operational procedures are the two pillars of the Group's noise reduction strategy. Despite the crisis, the Group is pursuing its investment in fleet renewal, thereby significantly reducing its noise impact. In 2021, Air/uni00A0France and KLM thus took delivery of, respectively, 13 (of a total of 253) and 7 (of a total of 164) new aircraft.\n\nSpecific solutions are also sought to reduce the noise emissions from aircraft. Whenever possible, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM thus implements continuous descent or NADP (Noise Abatement Departure Procedure) procedures which significantly reduce noise pollution. The SESAR program also aims to improve the management of noise and its impact through precision landing procedures using satellite navigation and optimized flight paths, including optimized climb and descent operations.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nIn 2021, 70% of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's fleet complied with the ICAO Chapter/uni00A04 or 14/uni00A0certification criteria, the most stringent jet aircraft noise levels to date.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM are committed to ensuring a permanent dialogue with stakeholders in all territories. They meet with the representatives of local communities, the airport authorities and air tra/ffic control to identify measures enabling a reduction in noise hindrance potentially a/ffecting the inhabitants of areas located near airports.\n\nIn 2020, KLM took part in the Minder Hinder (less hindrance) program with Schiphol and Air Tra/ffic Control The Netherlands to reduce noise hindrance and improve the quality of the local environment. KLM is committed to contributing to a 2% annual reduction in serious disruption around Schiphol airport and has undertaken to contribute to the government and Schiphol's local emission reduction plans covering ultrafine particles and nitrogen. KLM will make a proportional reduction in its night flights from 32,000/uni00A0to 25,000/uni00A0at Schiphol in return for, amongst other conditions, an increase in the number of aircraft movements at Schiphol to 540,000, the opening of Lelystad airport and the development of rail replacement services for destinations like Brussels and D\u00fcsseldorf, the latter within the framework of the Air Rail program in which KLM participates.\n\nIn the Netherlands, KLM participates in Het Regioforum which addresses issues surrounding noise with the local community. In France, this dialogue is mainly conducted within the context of the CCEs (Environmental Consultative Commissions) and CCARs (Advisory Residents' Assistance Commissions) in which Air/uni00A0 France participates at all the French airports where it has operations.\n\nAir/uni00A0France has been actively involved in the Night Flights working group, overseen by the Prefect of the Paris-CDG airport region. This working Group has notably proposed new 'dead of night' continuous descent procedures and welcomed the voluntary retirement of noisy aircraft, including Air/uni00A0France's B747s and A340s. In 2019, during the French National Air Transportation Debate (Assises du Transport A\u00e9rien ), the government announced a commitment to the widespread application of continuous descent procedures in the medium-term (2023). Lastly, the punctuality of flights scheduled for late at night or early in the morning is the subject of a specific expert monitoring group.\n\nIn 2021, the Air/uni00A0France Group's (Air/uni00A0France, Air/uni00A0France HOP! and Transavia France) contribution to the Airport Noise Tax (TNSA) paid to the French State amounted to \u20ac10/uni00A0million. Its proceeds are allocated to the financing of sound-proofing for homes located around the main airports. Since the TSNA was put in place, around \u20ac16/uni00A0million has been allocated to the sound-proofing of housing, to which the Air/uni00A0France Group has made a substantial contribution.\n\nAround Schiphol airport, all the measures to reduce the noise footprint have been implemented. Over the past two decades, KLM has contributed most of the total \u20ac750/uni00A0million in noise taxes, devoted to the sound-proofing and compensation for loss of value in property around Schiphol airport.\n\n## Air quality\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group monitors its atmospheric emissions for both the flight and ground operations, including low altitude emissions which impact the quality of the air around airports. The indicators cover emissions of/uni00A0CO2,/uni00A0SO2 and/uni00A0NOx.\n\nMost of these gas and particle emissions come from aircraft movements. The remainder is produced by the ground operations and maintenance activities, airport logistics and road travel by passengers, employees and suppliers.",

        "page_content": "## Measures and performance\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM reduces its local emissions via  a number of levers:\n\n- -  a modern fleet with more energy-e/fficient aircraft;\n- -  electric or more efficient ground vehicles and runway equipment, powered by cleaner fuels;\n- -  optimized operational procedures for the ground operations: taxiing time, taxiing using just one engine, the use of ground power units (GPUs) to ensure the functioning of on-board systems, replacing the Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) on kerosene-powered aircraft.\n\n## Towards carbon neutral ground operations\n\nIn 2020, Air/uni00A0France committed to investing \u20ac3.4/uni00A0million in the electrification of its ground support equipment fleet, to replace the old diesel engine equipment. An additional \u20ac0.3/uni00A0million has subsequently been allocated to continue the electrification of vehicles.\n\nBy the end of 2021, the rate of electrification of the Air/uni00A0France GSE fleet was 66% for CDG and 61% for the entire fleet. The process of electrifying old equipment has been maintained for eight belt loaders.\n\nBy 2020, Air/uni00A0France was servicing 100% of its long-haul flights with electric ACUs at all terminal gates. The implementation of long-haul electric ACUs was extended to Orly in 2021 to drastically reduce the use of APUs during aircraft ground operations.\n\nAt the end of 2020, the CDG hub and Orly station adopted Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) to replace Non-Road Diesel (GNR). All Air/uni00A0France GSEs at CDG are fueled by this fuel, which is 15% to 20% more economical in terms of/uni00A0CO2, generates 10% less/uni00A0NOx, requires 10% less fuel consumption and lowers maintenance costs (less engine clogging). We plan to systematically use GTL as a substitute fuel for GNR throughout the electrification phase of our equipment.\n\nFor KLM, the proportion of full-electric ground support equipment surpassed 60% in 2021, thereby reducing/uni00A0CO2 and local emissions (see section/uni00A04.3.1 'Ground energy consumption' for progress on the electrification strategy). Since 2019, all the ground support equipment at Schiphol Airport has been powered by Gas-toLiquid (GTL), a transition initiated by KLM to ensure a substantial reduction in the related local emissions.\n\nTransavia has been experimenting with the start-up/uni00A0SAS on the use of thermal ACU converters for air conditioning on the ground. This reduces emissions from the use of APUs. During the first test phase, Transavia was able to save 50,000/uni00A0liters of fuel, i.e. around 100/uni00A0tonnes of/uni00A0CO2 emissions. In the long term, Transavia is pursuing its road map for the use of electric GPUs and ACUs.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France has participated in the Paris Region's Atmosphere Protection Plan since 2008 through its Mobility Plan and, at the outstations in the French provinces, has launched the roll-out of proprietary Mobility Plans.\n\nWith more than 80% of sta/ff commuting to work by car, the aim of the Mobility Plan is to reduce the pollutant emissions linked to their travel. This is thus a major challenge for the company, in terms of both the environment and health and safety in the workplace.\n\nIn 2021, the Air/uni00A0France Mobility Plans in Ile de France were based on the same actions as in 2020 in a health context that remained generally unfavorable. However, the committed action plans have been continued.\n\nIn 2021, remote working was the main measure developed. The figures are still exceptional, but they are partly indicative of a work organization that should see remote working continue at a higher level than prior to the onset of the public health crisis: while the number of employees (11,709) working remotely was down by 11% compared to 2020, the associated unrealized commuting to and from work continued to increase to almost 30/uni00A0 million kilometers and a saving of 7,194/uni00A0tons of/uni00A0CO2, i.e. 748/uni00A0circumnavigations of the earth. Taking into account the partial activity measures implemented throughout 2021 within the company, an additional 22/uni00A0million kilometers were saved and 5,270/uni00A0tons of/uni00A0CO2 avoided.\n\nThe initiatives under way include the:\n\n- -  change in carpooling service provider: Air/uni00A0France and sixteen other member companies of the mobility plans in the Paris region have opted for a national platform o/ffering much-higher-quality services. The new Karos platform is free for employees in the member companies.\n\nDespite a context that is not very favorable to carpooling (partial activity work and remote working), 139/uni00A0Air/uni00A0France users have already adopted Karos and made 880/uni00A0carpooling trips between the launch of the platform on May/uni00A011, 2021 and the end of December/uni00A02021.\n\nIn total, all the companies that are members of the R'Pro and Orly'Pro mobility plans in the Ile de France region have adopted Karos, with 332/uni00A0users and 2,505/uni00A0trips made between May/uni00A011, 2021 and the end of December/uni00A02021.\n\n- -  promotion of public transport, even if this action was not very prominent this year;\n- -  installation of new charging points for electric vehicles in car parks (70/uni00A0electrical terminals installed in 2021 in the parking lot of Air/uni00A0France headquarters);\n- -  studies have confirmed the feasibility of cycle tracks at Orly and Roissy. A first deployment should take place at Orly in 2022;\n- -  raising of employee awareness of the link between air quality and commuting patterns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

In May/uni00A02021, the car-sharing service available in Montreuil (mainly for business needs) was redesigned with a new provider.\n\nIn addition, a questionnaire sent to all employees in the \u00cele-deFrance region in the last quarter of 2020 provided a wealth of information on travel habits before and after the health crisis in\n\norder to devise the appropriate mobility solutions. Two feedback webinars were organized during 2021.\n\nIn the provinces, carpooling is also encouraged and supported. In Toulouse, for example, the mobility plans underway have made it possible to launch several challenges and concrete actions such as bicycle trials, the installation of charging stations in employee car parks, the promotion of public transport, and communication on sustainable mobility in general and carpooling in particular.\n\n## 4.3.3/emspace Waste and the circular economy\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM handles many forms of waste, mostly arising from flight operations and maintenance, within a context of strict regulatory requirements. Across the entire supply chain, the Group strives to minimize waste and increase the proportion of waste recycled or incinerated with energy recovery where recycling is not possible.\n\nIn 2019, Air/uni00A0France and KLM had set themselves a target of halving residual waste (non-recycled waste from the cabin and ground activities) by 2030 compared to 2011. In 2021, while the public health crisis caused operating disruption meaning that this result does not directly reflect its strategy, the Group reduced its non-recycled waste by 70% compared to the 2011 baseline.\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM base their actions on the four principles of the circular economy: rethink, reduce, reuse and recycle. Risks and mitigation actions are assessed from a life cycle perspective.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\n## Inflight waste\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM run programs aimed at a constant improvement in the overall management of flight waste: waste prevention, increasing the recycled portion, the eco-design of products and the identification of appropriate reprocessing facilities, with the main goal being a reduction in residual waste. The end-of-life management of items is factored into their design.\n\nOn-board sorting concerns plastic bottles, juice cartons and cans for all short, medium and long-haul flights to Paris. The articles are sorted on board by the cabin crews, then handled by Servair at Paris-CDG and Paris-Orly, before being recycled in France or elsewhere in Europe. Despite the decline in activity, on-board sorting and recycling have been maintained, enabling the ongoing mobilization of crews. In 2021, trial periods aimed at expanding on-board sorting to the outstations were set up for Montreal, Cancun and Papeete.\n\nAt KLM, the use of less product packaging and the overall design of products have been a focus of e/fforts. In 2020, KLM was nominated for an Onboard Hospitality Award for the design of its closed loop food tray. The trays are washed and reused unless they are damaged in which case they are recycled by the supplier and used in the design of new trays.\n\nOn all the European flights, on-board waste is sorted and the trolleys have been adapted to collect plastic and cardboard cups. Glass, cans, aluminum lids, paper, EPS boxes, PET plastic bottles and other forms of plastic are also sorted and recycled by the catering teams.\n\nWhether for reasons of hygiene and food safety, or to reduce the weight embarked, the inflight service uses a substantial quantity of Single-Use Plastic products (SUPs). The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is committed to reducing the environmental impact of SUP in its operations. The Group achieves this via a number of levers: by eliminating SUPs wherever possible; by replacing these plastics with other materials whenever more sustainable alternatives are available (based on Life Cycle Assessments or other environmental proofs); by redesigning SUP items to decrease material use; and by using recycled plastic or ensuring SUPs are recycled wherever possible.\n\nIn 2019, to reduce its environmental footprint, Air/uni00A0France had set itself a target of replacing 80% of single-use plastic (SUP) items with sustainable alternatives by the end of 2025 compared to 2019. By the end of 2021, Air/uni00A0France had removed or abandoned 45% of its single-use plastic articles, representing 1,318/uni00A0tons.\n\nIn the same year, Transavia had also committed to the progressive and significant reduction of single-use plastic items on board its aircraft by proposing, on its scheduled flights, certified alternatives to single-use plastic (Duty Free bags in Kraft paper and cups, stirrers and cutlery kits of plant origin,/uni00A0etc.). In total, more than seven million single-use plastic items are no longer distributed each year on the scheduled flights, or 41/uni00A0tons of plastic.\n\n## Action to combat food waste and food insecurity\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM handles food waste from flight operations in the respect of a permanent commitment to guaranteeing food safety and security, within a context of strict regulation. The regulations vary depending on the context of each station and are often very exacting, like the European Regulation requiring the incineration of any elements potentially having been in contact with foods of animal origin for flights arriving from outside the EU.",

        "page_content": "Two main levers enable a reduction in food waste: the adjustment of the catering embarked on flights and a strict policy of merchandise inventory management. Based on statistics and historic flight load factors, and on passenger habits, the number of meals actually embarked is regularly re-evaluated. This re-evaluation prevents waste and reduces both production and transportation costs, and overall wastage. This also reduces the onboard weight, resulting in lower/uni00A0CO2 emissions. However, owing to the disruption of flight schedules and unpredictable load factors resulting from the Covid-19 public health crisis, these measures have been temporarily suspended. New measures have been established and will be implemented as soon as there is a return to a higher volume of flight operations.\n\nThe pre-selection of the hot meal in the Business cabin had been suspended during the Covid-19 crisis due to the disruption of the flight schedule. This service was reinstated in 2021 for the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, North America and South America regions, with a full roll-out scheduled for 2022. Rethinking some o/ffers also contributes to a reduction in food waste. Air/uni00A0France therefore takes this parameter into account as soon as a new product development is launched.\n\nIn order to fight poverty and limit waste, Air/uni00A0France donates food and non-food products to charitable associations such as L'Agence du Don en Nature, Les Restaurants du C\u0153ur, Le Samu Social, Les \u0152uvres de la Mie de Pain and the Food Bank. In 2020, approximately 5.3/uni00A0million food products were donated. Adjusting orders for perishable products and maintaining a rigorous merchandise inventory management policy also helps to reduce wastage of unconsumed fresh produce. Meetings of the steering bodies are held annually during which a summary presentation is made on donations, and updates provided on combating waste and the monitoring indicators on waste avoided and recycled, with a view to a continuous improvement.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Martinair Cargo are active in the perishable goods transportation segment. The teams maintain a permanent relationship with all the players in the value chain (producers, exporters, importers, supermarkets, airport authorities,/uni00A0etc.) to promote sustainable development in the agricultural and air transportation sectors. Numerous initiatives are under way: joint communication actions with the Paris-CDG plant protection department and exporter customers, an improvement in perishable goods handling capacity and management of the cold chain,/uni00A0etc. The Group is also a member of the Cold Chain association and contributes to its work on reducing food waste. Within this framework, 2019 saw the definition of the priority measures to be implemented for the sustainable development of air-shipped exports of West African mangoes, at both technical (combatting fruit flies which degrade the quality of the fruit) and logistical level (improvement in airport infrastructures, notably at Burkina Faso and in Senegal, and verification procedures at Paris-CDG).\n\n## Aeronautical waste\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM have procedures in place for recycling metal aeronautical waste. Wherever possible, the cradle-to-cradle principle is applied to reintegrate waste in a new production cycle. The process foresees procedures to reuse and recycle spare parts. This program has been extended to other types of waste: furniture, equipment, pallets and blankets.\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France, the move up-market for the medium and long-haul cabins with the installation of new seats has been accompanied by the implementation of a recycling and dismantling process for the old seats ranging from the reuse and recycling of components to the recovery of foams and metals.\n\nHazardous waste from the maintenance activities is the subject of a comprehensive tracing system and its management is harmonized in the di/fferent maintenance sites. This approach is also reflected in the optimized management of suppliers and costs, and the search for more relevant solutions in the light of regulatory changes. In 2020, KLM employees revisited the key points in the collection of hazardous and non-hazardous waste in the hangers and implemented an awareness-raising campaign to involve all employees in attaining the waste reduction target for 2030.\n\n## Applying the principles of the circular economy\n\nThe companies are working on initiatives to up-cycle waste for new uses like, for example, the recycling of used uniforms.\n\nA permanent recycling system is in place for Air/uni00A0France uniforms and work clothing. Sta/ff are invited to adopt good recycling practice by depositing uniforms and work clothing in secure containers in the Air/uni00A0France premises. The uniforms are collected (63.2/uni00A0tons of textiles since September/uni00A02018 at the Roissy site) from the various sites and are recovered by di/fferent partners including a French Support and Work Assistance Establishment (ESAT for the employment of disabled workers), before subsequently being up-cycled. Uniforms are thus up-cycled via the help of energy recovery in the form of textile pellets while the ashes are used in the manufacturing of cement. In addition, employees have launched the 100% Uniforms initiative to recycle these uniforms into other products such as a new collection of non-aeronautic accessories (pouches,/uni00A0etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

By donating new, refurbished products such as crockery or blankets, Air/uni00A0 France supports the work of the ADN association, which collects and redistributes new, non-food products for everyday use to combat exclusion in France. In 2020, nearly 70,000/uni00A0items were donated to the association.\n\n## 4.3.4/emspace Biodiversity\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nThe impact of air transportation on biodiversity is linked to the e/ffects of climate change induced by the/uni00A0CO2 emissions that it generates. The Group supports a number of projects and initiatives aimed at protecting biodiversity around its hubs and destinations.\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France made a strong commitment to biodiversity by joining the Act4Nature international initiative: this is a voluntary commitment initiative in favor of biodiversity aimed at French international companies. At the end of 2021, Act4Nature regrouped 57/uni00A0major French companies with an international presence, which will adopt ten common commitments as well as their own specific undertakings.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\n## Forestry projects supported by client donation\n\nAlongside the French Civil Aviation Authority (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Aviation Civile  - DGAC), Air/uni00A0France is a founding member of the A Tree For You association which brings together, in complete transparency, donors and tree-planting projects everywhere in the world.\n\nThe Trip and Tree by Air/uni00A0France program was integrated into the online ticket sales process in 2019. When purchasing a ticket, customers have the opportunity to make a donation of their choice to reduce their environmental footprints and contribute to reforestation projects in France and around the world. Selected by a committee of recognized and independent experts, the projects must be beneficial to soil enrichment, the water cycle and the climate. They must allow biodiversity to flourish and assist the human populations in developing an activity in harmony with nature.\n\nBy the end of 2021, 79,594/uni00A0donors from the Trip and Tree eco-travel group had contributed to the comprehensive funding of 28/uni00A0projects, with 233,768/uni00A0trees planted.\n\n## Supporting projects via  the o/ffsetting of domestic flights\n\nSince January/uni00A01/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France has proactively o/ffset 100% of the/uni00A0CO2 emissions on its domestic flights. In liaison with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this o/ffsetting scheme takes the form of a contribution to reforestation, forest preservation and biodiversity projects, and those dedicated to the development of renewable energies, while guaranteeing the protection of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nKLM sorts over 14/uni00A0types of waste, with wood, plastic and metal being its main residual forms. In cooperation with its partners. For example, KLM up-cycles old cargo straps into bags, pillows and laptop cases, recycles uniform fibers into cabin carpets, furniture and KLM goodies, and up-cycles old furniture.\n\nProjects on four continents (located in France, Brazil, Peru, Cambodia, India and Kenya) have been selected and launched with EcoAct, a pioneer in carbon o/ffsetting in France.\n\nAll the projects selected have received the highest certification standards in the voluntary carbon o/ffset market, The Gold Standard, VERRA's VCS and CCBA's additional CCB standard.\n\n## KLM CO2ZERO program\n\nSince 2008, KLM has contributed to preserving and restoring forests via its CO2ZERO-projects in Panama and a number of African countries. The Gold Standard for the Global Goals-certified project in Panama, CO2OL Tropical Mix, turns formerly degraded pasture land into mixed forestry by planting a blend of mainly native tree and some exotic species. In addition to the numerous environmental benefits such as biodiversity protection and ecosystem restoration, the project's activities enable skills development and the creation of long-term employment with a sustainable source of income for the local population which improves their living conditions.\n\nSince January/uni00A02020, Transavia has also o/ffered its customers this service.\n\n## An association to promote the preservation of biodiversity in the areas around airports\n\nGoing against the tide of received wisdom, airports are home to enclosed and protected areas: their grasslands constitute a preserved environment which hosts a rich and sometimes remarkable level of biodiversity, thus contributing to the development of the local ecosystem. This is why the scientific community, public administrations and aviation players all come together around common and shared objectives: expanding knowledge, improving and promoting biodiversity in airport spaces in the respect of the safety requirements.\n\nCreated in 2015 after two years of preliminary studies, the A\u00e9ro Biodiversit\u00e9  association is thus tasked with evaluating and highlighting airport biodiversity, identifying best practices and acting as the link between the industry players to promote more responsible management of biodiversity while taking into account the operational constraints.\n\nAt the end of 2021, three airlines (Air/uni00A0France, Air Corsica, Air Saint-Pierre) but also the DGAC, UAF&FA, FFA and FFPLUM were members of the association and teams of professional naturalists were present at 37/uni00A0airport sites (compared to 20 in 2020). All of them have factored this project into their sustainable development policies and the commitment on the ground",

They involve local sta/ff through participatory science protocols. The data amassed supplements the national databases of knowledge on biodiversity. While always giving priority to aviation safety - the French Civil Aviation Authority (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Aviation Civile ) is also a member of the association - this work shows that it is possible to enrich the biodiversity of the relevant spaces by, for example, practicing the appropriate strategies (reasoned management, late mowing that respects the life cycle of biodiversity, elimination of crop protection products,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nThis year, A\u00e9robiodiversit\u00e9 also launched an 'aerobio' label to promote commitments in favor of biodiversity. Orly, Perpignan Sud de France and Tarbes-Lourdes were the first airports to be awarded this label.\n\nWith an average surface area in airports reserved for green spaces of 73%, i.e. approximately 350/uni00A0km/two.sup at national level for all structures hosting aircraft, aviation can play a role in preserving lowland meadows, the most threatened natural habitat in Western Europe.\n\nAs active members, Air/uni00A0France and the ADP Group ensure the continuity of the work and contribute to raising awareness amongst their employees and the general public.\n\n## Contributing to combating the tra/ffic in protected species\n\nIn 2017, Air/uni00A0France and KLM became signatories of the Buckingham Palace Declaration, which formalizes their resolute commitment to combating illegal trading in protected species.\n\nFor many years, the Group has been committed to combating this illegal trade. For example, the Cargo division has already carried out a number of initiatives, notably employee training and awareness raising for customers, and participates in working groups with international bodies and associations (World Organization for Animal Health - OIE, IATA, United for Wildlife).\n\nDespite a very reduced level of activity in 2020 due to the health context, Air/uni00A0France continued its program for frontline Ground Operations sta/ff to help them spot and report suspicious behavior or baggage to the relevant authorities. Air/uni00A0France provides information for its customers, particularly on its commercial website under Prohibited and Regulated Goods and also on board its long-haul flights through an awareness-raising video on illegal tra/fficking.\n\nAir/uni00A0France was also behind a working Group set up at the end of 2017, bringing together Paris Airport, the Customs authorities, Chronopost and WWF, to plan joint, coordinated initiatives at the Paris-CDG hub. In 2019, the Europe Handling Group joined this working group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Work on optimizing these indicators was undertaken in 2018 to align the Grenelle II reporting with the new requirements linked to the transposition of the Directive in the Extra-Financial Performance Statement.\n\nSince 2018 and in application of the provisions of Article L./uni00A0 225-102-1/uni00A0of the French Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce ), it has been the responsibility of our Independent Third Party to determine the compliance of the Extra-Financial Performance Statement and the accuracy of the published CSR information. Furthermore, the data relating to the 'Conventional kerosene consumption' and 'CO2 emissions associated with conventional kerosene consumption' indicators linked to the Flight Operations have been verified with the highest level of assurance, reasonable assurance (indicated by the symbol \u221a ), since 2007-08.\n\n## Scope covered and scope N-1\n\nFor the flight operations, the environmental consolidation scope covers:\n\n- -  all the commercial flights under the AF codes operated by Air/uni00A0France and HOP!, and the TO codes operated by Transavia France;\n- -  all the commercial flights under the KLM code operated by KLM and its subsidiaries KLM Cityhopper B.V. (KLC), Martinair and Transavia Netherlands.\n\nFor the ground operations, the environmental consolidation scope covers:\n\n- -  Air France consolidated subsidiaries: HOP!, CRMA, Sodexi, BlueLink and Transavia France.\n- -  KLM consolidated subsidiaries: KLC (KLM Cityhopper), KES (KLM Equipment Services), KCS (KLM Catering Services), KHS (KLM Health Services), Transavia Netherlands, Martinair and EPCOR (for a portion of the indicators).\n\nFor the ground activities, the consolidation scope for the environmental reporting covers nearly 100% of the sites in France and the Netherlands (some very small subsidiaries being excluded). The international stations are not taken into account (partially for the French Overseas Departments and Territories).\n\n- - For Air/uni00A0France, the indicators in the French stations are not reported when there is no detail available on the charges invoiced by airports. The contribution from the relevant stations is, however, marginal compared with the reported data.\n\n## Reporting tools\n\nThe environmental indicators are assembled at local level via different reporting tools: ONEmission (Enablon software), Tennaxia for waste, SAP Finance (invoicing) for Air/uni00A0France and CaeSaR for KLM.\n\nThe reliability of the reporting process is supported by definitions of each indicator and tool user guides made available to the contributors. Consistency tests have also been implemented.\n\nThe consolidation of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's environmental data is carried out by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Sustainability department.\n\n## Details and methodology - Definition of the key performance indicators and comments on changes in the indicators\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group level, the regulatory requirements and the reporting and consolidation principles are outlined in a joint document which is updated regularly. Within the framework of an improvement-based approach, methodological details are provided on some indicators, and particularly on their definitions. When these changes have a significant impact on the data, comparison with the figures for previous years is not meaningful.\n\nWhen the data is not available, the figure reported for the year (N) is estimated based on the value reported for the previous year (N-1).\n\nThe reporting period for the Group's environmental data is based on a rolling twelve-month period from October/uni00A01/uni00A0until September/uni00A030 for ground data and January/uni00A01/uni00A0to December/uni00A031 for flight and social data.\n\n## Definition of the key performance indicators\n\n## Comments on changes in the indicators\n\nIn 2021, the crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic continued to impact Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's business and results. Border closures, health measures to be respected for travel and a climate of international concern devastated the air transport sector and all the published indicators were significantly a/ffected for the second consecutive year. The latter therefore do not reflect Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's long-term commitments and its environmental performance in recent years.\n\nWhile the Group increased its activity by about 30% in 2021 compared to 2020 in terms of seat capacity or passengers transported, its level of activity did not regain the 2019 level. The load factor remained low (60%), negatively impacting energy e/fficiency per passenger (CO2/passenger/km).\n\nE/fficiency per passenger however increased by 6% in 2021 (after a sharp 29% deterioration in 2020) but remained far from the 2019 level (72gr/uni00A0CO2/passengers/km in 2019, 96/uni00A0gr/uni00A0CO2/ passengers/km in 2021).",

        "page_content": "The Group's overall energy e/fficiency also improved in 2021, kerosene consumption and carbon emissions increasing by less (+16%) than the Group's activity (+30%).\n\n## CO2 e/fficiency per passenger kilometer\n\nOperational/uni00A0CO2 e/fficiency is expressed as grams of/uni00A0CO2 per passenger kilometer. It is calculated using the actual jet fuel consumed and the number of passengers flown over the actual flight distance planned. For international flights, the fuel burned is divided between passengers and cargo based on mass. The distance used is the flight distance planned which is on average around 7% longer than the great circle distance due to various restrictions (no fly zones, local air tra/ffic control, weather conditions,/uni00A0etc.). The standard mass for a passenger plus luggage amounts to 100kg (ICAO-standard).\n\nThe fuel e/fficiency with the market-based measures compares the e/fficiency of the current year with the value in 2005. The actual/uni00A0CO2 from mandatory and voluntary o/ffsetting is deducted, as well as the/uni00A0CO2 emission savings from the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The mandatory offsetting per calendar year is based on an estimate since the final data will be reported after the publication of this document. To determine the/uni00A0CO2 o/ffsetting, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM deducts the free allowances from the total/uni00A0CO2 emissions subject to the EU ETS.\n\n## CO2 emissions from the ground operations\n\nThe/uni00A0C O 2 emissions from the ground operations include all scope/uni00A01 and 2/uni00A0emissions at the sites in France and the Netherlands.\n\n## Non-recycled non-hazardous industrial waste\n\nNon-recycled non-hazardous industrial waste is defined as waste disposed of (Eural Code D). Incinerated waste (Eural Code R1) and R12 or R13 waste, for which it is not possible to know whether this waste has been recycled or incinerated, is categorized as Non-Recycled Waste as a conservative position.\n\n## Comments on changes in the environmental indicators\n\n## Carbon emissions\n\nDirect and indirect/uni00A0CO2 emissions are reported in line with the GreenHouseGas Protocol. Since 2017, scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions have been reported. These are solely based on the reported scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions from the flight operations (upstream emissions from Jet fuel). According to ADEME, the/uni00A0CO2 emissions correspond to 98% of all greenhouse gases.\n\n## Scope/uni00A01 - Aviation fuel\n\nScope/uni00A01/uni00A0emissions generated by the combustion of aviation fuel are reported for all the kerosene used in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's flight operations. The used emission factor of 3.16/uni00A0kg/uni00A0CO2 per\n\nkg kerosene is in line with the emission factor from the ICAO (CORSIA - Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). Note that there are di/fferences between the scope of the reported/uni00A0CO2 emissions and those in the EU ETS for greenhouse gas emission quotas, so comparison is not meaningful.\n\n## Scope/uni00A01 -/uni00A0CO2 savings from Sustainable Aviation Fuel\n\nThe/uni00A0C O 2 savings from the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are calculated based on the specific percentage/uni00A0CO2 saving for the particular SAF batch and the total volume purchased.\n\n## Scope/uni00A01 - Ground operations\n\nThe direct emissions from the ground operations are based on the consumption of energy coming from di/fferent sources and their corresponding emission factors. The factors are based on national standards or are delivered by the energy supplier.\n\n## Scope/uni00A02 - Electricity\n\nThe emissions from electricity use are based on the consumption volume and the corresponding emission factors (ADEME reference for Air/uni00A0France, no/uni00A0CO2 emissions for KLM's green electricity). The/uni00A0CO2 saving from purchasing Certificates of Origin for renewable electricity are subtracted from the total. The electricity supply is 100% renewable for KLM.\n\n## Scope/uni00A03 - Upstream emissions from kerosene production\n\nThese emissions are generated during the production, transportation and distribution of kerosene. The greenhouse gas emission factor used for the scope/uni00A03/uni00A0calculation is 0.6448 kg/uni00A0CO2e per kg of fuel is based on the ICAO full life cycle GHG emissions factor (89gCO2e/MJ for jet fuel A1).\n\n## O/ffsetting - Mandatory carbon o/ffsets (EU ETS)\n\nThe volume of reported mandatory carbon credits is based on the annual reporting of the EU ETS and CORSIA. Free allowances and the trading costs are excluded.\n\n## O/ffsetting - Voluntary carbon o/ffsets\n\nThe volume of voluntary carbon credits is calculated over the calendar year. Voluntary carbon offsetting of/uni00A0CO2 paid by customers is not included. The carbon credits are purchased by Air/uni00A0France and KLM (e.g. for the/uni00A0CO2 emissions from Air/uni00A0France's domestic flights since January/uni00A02020 and for employee business trips); These carbon credits are Gold Standard or VERRA certified.\n\n## O/ffsetting - Customer carbon o/ffsets\n\nThe volume of voluntary carbon o/ffsets is calculated based on the calendar year. This concerns the voluntary/uni00A0CO2 compensation paid by customers via  the Air/uni00A0France and KLM o/ffsetting programs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## Flight operations\n\n## Consumption of Conventional Aviation Fuel\n\nThis is the actual conventional aviation fuel consumption for each flight. It includes the fuel consumption for the use of APUs (Auxiliary Power Unit).\n\n## Consumption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel\n\nThis is the quantity of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) purchased during the reporting period.\n\n## Fuel e/fficiency -/uni00A0CO2 emissions for passenger transportation\n\nFuel efficiency is expressed in both liters of fuel per passenger-kilometer and in grams of/uni00A0CO2 per passenger-kilometer. The calculation is based on an allocation of fuel between passengers and cargo. The fuel consumption for passengers is divided by the RPKs (Revenue Passenger Kilometers) and adjusted by the Flight Plan distance/ground circle distance ratio. The/uni00A0CO2 emissions for passengers are based on fuel use, from which the/uni00A0CO2 savings from the use of SAF are deducted.\n\n## Fuel e/fficiency -/uni00A0CO2 emissions for cargo transportation\n\nFuel e/fficiency is expressed in both liters of fuel per 100kg of cargo-100/uni00A0kilometers and in grams of/uni00A0CO2 per 100kg of cargo. The calculation is based on an allocation of fuel between passengers and cargo. The fuel consumption for cargo is divided by 0.1TK and adjusted by the Flight Plan distance/ground circle distance ratio. The/uni00A0CO2 emissions for cargo are based on fuel use, from which the/uni00A0CO2 savings from the use of SAF are deducted.\n\n## Non-carbon emissions -/uni00A0NOx low altitude\n\nThe methodology used to calculate low-altitude emissions (i.e. below 3,000/uni00A0feet) is common to Air/uni00A0France and KLM. It is based on the LTO (Landing-Take O/ff) cycle and on engine data communicated by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). The taxiing time taken into account is the actual taxiing time, which is more precise than the standard values recommended by the ICAO methodology. Note that, since the actual taxiing time is not available for Transavia France, the standard ICAO values have been used for this subsidiary.\n\n## Non-carbon emissions -/uni00A0SO2 low altitude\n\nNote: the 'low altitude' and 'LTO' for Landing-Take O/ff cycle denominations are equivalent. The calculation of the/uni00A0SO2 emissions from flight operations is based on the average sulfur content (level provided by the SMCA company for Air/uni00A0France and AFS for KLM, in charge of Jet Fuel logistics at CDG and AMS) of the fuel loaded, respectively, on the Amsterdam and Paris platforms which is applied, respectively, to all fuel used during the year by KLM and its subsidiaries, and by Air/uni00A0France and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Acoustic impact\n\nThe measurement of the acoustic impact of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group has changed in 2021 due to the particularity of the previous indicator (complex indicator, expressed in energy). The new indicator is closer to those commonly used by other air transport operators. It is measured according to the classification of its fleet in operation according to the ICAO noise chapters. The indicator evaluates the percentage of aircraft certified under chapters 4 and 14 (which are the most e/fficient noise levels for jet aircraft to date) out of the total fleet in operation. A comparison with the year 2020 is therefore not possible. Nevertheless, thanks to its ongoing e/fforts to renew its fleet, the Group has performed well, with 70% of its fleet certified at very high noise standards (chapters 4 and 14). The flights concerned are AF, KL, TO, HV or MP operated, franchised and chartered, code-share excepted.\n\n## Ground operations\n\n## Consumption - Electricity (of which renewable)\n\nThis is the total volume of electricity use in/uni00A0MWh. For KLM the volume of renewable electricity is based on the purchase of EU Certificates of Origin coming from wind energy.\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Fuel\n\nThe total volume of fuel use for the ground operations includes:\n\n- -  kerosene (Jet fuel A1) for testing engines;\n- -  non-road diesel fuel for the Air/uni00A0France runway equipment;\n- -  gasoline, diesel and GTL for the Ground Support Equipment (GSE).\n\nIn 2021, the fuel consumption of some French outstations has been estimated on the basis of the 2020 data.\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Natural gas\n\nThe total quantity of natural gas is mainly used for heating buildings, maintenance hangars and cargo warehouses. The conversion factor for the quantity of gas used is based on the characteristics of the gas specific to France and the Netherlands.\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Steam/other heating/ cooling (of which renewable)\n\nThis includes superheated and iced water for climate comfort. For Air/uni00A0France, superheated and iced water is supplied by ADP (A\u00e9roports de Paris) at the Orly and Roissy sites. The KLM facilities do not consume this type of energy.\n\n## Consumption - Other: Water consumption\n\nThe consumption of water is taken into account for all the ground activities. The water used on board the aircraft is not included.",

Other sources of/uni00A0NOx include combustion by ground support vehicles and runway equipment. For Air/uni00A0France, the calculation is based on the European standards EURO 1/uni00A0to 6 for light and heavy vehicles, and Stage I to IV for diesel engines (European Directive 97/68/EC for non-road mobile machinery), setting the emission limits based on engine power. For KLM, the/uni00A0NOx emissions from gas installations and vehicles are determined by direct measurements, from manufacturer data or external databases.\n\n## Waste - Non-hazardous industrial waste and percentage recycled\n\nNon-hazardous industrial waste (NHIW) is monitored and reported by specialized waste management suppliers. The KLM scope includes KLM Catering Services (KLM subsidiary) and thus includes catering waste, unlike the Air/uni00A0France scope which sub contracts this service. The reported percentage of recycled\n\nnon-hazardous industrial waste covers all forms of waste that are collected separately for recycling purposes. The recycling percentage does not include the waste that is incinerated with energy recovery (Eural Code R1).\n\nTransavia France waste is not included (services included in the rental cost) in the data on waste but represents only a non-material amount of the overall total (less than 1% of the total tonnage).\n\n## Waste - Hazardous industrial waste and percentage recovered\n\nHazardous industrial waste (HIW) is monitored and reported based on data provided by specialized waste management suppliers. If the quantity of hazardous waste has not been communicated by the suppliers at the end of the reporting period, the quantity mentioned in the specification slip is taken into account. This quantity is, however, estimated to be marginal. The reprocessing of hazardous waste complies with the EU Regulation. The recovery percentage is the ratio between the HIW waste recycled/recovered (R code) to the total HIW.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Customer satisfaction is notably measured through the Net Promoter Score (NPS), the reference indicator driving customer recommendations. Performance indicators and tools have been developed to track the results on a daily basis.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is above all based on their trust in the Group's airline activities. As a responsible airline Group, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM\n\nmust ensure the safety and health of its customers, employees and partners. This commitment covers flight safety, health security, the safety of the food services offered on board and in the lounges, the protection of personal data and also occupational health and safety (see section/uni00A04.2.3). The Group is also committed to facilitating access to its products and services, particularly for passengers with disabilities or those with reduced mobility.\n\n| Key Performance Indicator Definition   |                                                       | Companies             | 21/20 variation   | 2021 target   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Net Promoter Scores                    | Change in the NPS (expressed as an annual             | Air/uni00A0France     | +1/uni00A0pt      | Yes           |\n| (NPS)                                  | average) of Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Transavia (France | KLM                   | -4/uni00A0pts     | No            |\n|                                        | and the Netherlands) between 2020 and 2021            | Transavia France      | 0/uni00A0pt       | Yes           |\n|                                        | Achievement of the 2021 target                        | Transavia Netherlands | -11/uni00A0pts    | No            |\n\n## Definition\n\nScope: Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Transavia France and Transavia Netherlands.\n\nThe Net Promoter Score (or NPS) is a recommendation indicator given by customers to the products and services of Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia (France and the Netherlands) in their capacity as airlines, ranging from 0/uni00A0to 10 (0/uni00A0corresponding to 'I will definitely not recommend' and 10/uni00A0to 'I will definitively recommend'. It corresponds to the di/fference between the percentage of promoter customers (scores 9 and 10) and the percentage of customers critical of the brand (scores 0/uni00A0to 6). This concerns the response to the first question asked in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's e-Score online customer satisfaction questionnaire: 'Based on\n\nyour opinion and experience, how likely are you to recommend Air/uni00A0France/KLM/Transavia to your friends/colleagues?'. For each brand, the indicator measured is the annual change in the NPS (calculated as an annual average). Note that, since they are reported via two di/fferent measurement tools, the Net Promoter Scores for Transavia France and Transavia Netherlands cannot be consolidated.\n\nFor each brand, whether or not the annual target has been achieved is also indicated.\n\n## 4.4.1/emspace Operational safety for stakeholders\n\n## Flight safety\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nFlight Safety is paramount for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. It is key to retaining the trust of both customers and sta/ff, and imperative for the long-term viability of its operations and of air transportation as a whole.\n\nWithin a context of crisis and a changing environment, the Group does whatever it takes to maintain the highest level of Flight Safety thanks to its Safety Management System and by supporting its Flight Safety players through specific measures.\n\nAll of the Group's activities are subject to numerous checks and certifications; in particular, via the supervisory actions carried out by the Civil Aviation authorities in each country and via the International Air Transport Association (IATA), whose IOSA Operational Safety Audit is a benchmark within the industry. Air/uni00A0 France's and KLM's IOSA certifications were renewed in early 2021 following an on-site audit.\n\nSee also section/uni00A03.1.2 in chapter/uni00A03 'Risks relating to the air transportation activity'.\n\n## Measures and action plan\n\nTo achieve the highest attainable standard of Flight Safety, each airline updates and reinforces its Safety Management System (SMS), which concretely defines the modalities in place to manage aviation risks.\n\n## Management of Flight Safety risks\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM both use the evaluation method for operational risks recommended by the European Aviation Safety Agency. They have deployed this method in all the operational entities and at all levels of the business. The management of Flight Safety risks, notably through systems compiling flight parameters and situation reports, enables threats to be identified, risks to be evaluated, the implementation of remedial measures and the monitoring of the results obtained. It enables proactive management of the risks to maintain them below the level that is deemed acceptable to the responsible management and monitored by the Corporate Safety Department. An internal quality assurance procedure continuously evaluates the proper functioning of Flight Safety Risk Management.",

        "page_content": "Air/uni00A0 France is developing synergies between an array of progress-oriented and risk management approaches - Flight Safety, Health & Safety in the Workplace, Customer Service Quality, Operational Performance, Environmental & Sustainable Development, Food Safety & Hygiene. This quality-based approach is the vector for the steering and management of the businesses, aimed at a continuous improvement in results.\n\nKLM deploys a similar approach. The company is building on the best safety and security practices through an Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS), a working environment of continuous learning and improvement, and independent oversight of the four safety domains: operational, occupational, environmental safety and operational security. KLM thus continuously aims to improve its industry-leading, risk and performance-based Safety Management System in which risk-based decisions can be taken by the responsible management at all levels within KLM. The ISMS is outlined in KLM's Integrated Safety Management Manual (ISMM) and has been approved by the Dutch Civil Aviation authorities as part of the Air Operator Certificate.\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM's Safety Culture programs, which include promotion, communication, training and learning interventions, are embedded in the companies to enhance safety awareness and the relevant safe attitude and behavior at all levels.\n\nThe specific situation linked to the Covid-19 public health crisis saw the Group realize safety studies aimed at identifying the risks generated by the situation and defining risk mitigation measures enabling the level of safety to be maintained. These actions form part of the international cooperation framework via, notably, participation in the work of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Flight Safety Foundation, and by generating synergies within the SkyTeam alliance and sharing information with partner airlines. These measures are adapted according to the level of activity, which varies in line with transport demand.\n\n## Governance\n\nFlight Safety Committees, chaired by the Executive VicePresidents responsible for the operational entities, meet every quarter within Air/uni00A0France. Their task is to approve the action plans established to apply the orientations set by the companies, the results of inquiries and the results of supervisory acts.\n\nThese committees are also tasked with sharing information on the emergence of new Flight Safety issues originating from feedback or risk analysis, by ensuring that the resources and action plans in place are adapted to the issues.\n\nFlight Safety Committee meetings are held twice a year at the level of each company, to evaluate the e/ffectiveness of the existing action plans.\n\nAt KLM, the Corporate Safety Committee within the KLM Board of Directors meets every quarter to analyze the Safety Indicators. In 2021, KLM continued its focus on Occupational Safety hazards by updating the main Occupational Safety Policy to provide structure for the required mitigating action. However, the main focus in 2021 was the Covid-19 pandemic. Occupational risk analyses were performed on the transmission of the virus followed by the implementation of mitigating measures. All working environments, whether these be aircraft, o/ffices or operational work spaces, have been set up to facilitate a safe working and living environment. Safety Action Groups (SAGs), chaired by the Nominated Persons and/or Head of Divisions are in place across the company with, at the highest level, the Corporate Safety Action Group chaired by the COO and Accountable Manager. The SAGs decide on the safety action plans during meetings held either weekly or fortnightly. In cooperation with the aviation industry stakeholders at Schiphol Airport, like the airport authorities and Dutch Air Tra/ffic Control, KLM has carried out a number of joint safety risk assessments and conducted mitigating actions to improve safety around the airport. These activities were carried out within the joint sector Integrated Safety Management System, a unique collaboration between the aviation players at the airport which was established in 2018.\n\nFurthermore, in that flight safety is an absolute priority for Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the Board of Directors conducts an annual review of the flight safety KPIs and results, and the measures in place to mitigate the impact of the risks.\n\n## Developing a safety-first culture\n\nBuilding a company-wide awareness of the prerequisite for a safety-first culture across all the operations is a gradual yet ongoing approach aimed at raising the ambition of the airlines in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. Vocational training is a cornerstone of this culture and thus primarily takes into account the skills and expertise to be acquired in matters of safety: safety training for pilots and cabin crews, training relating to the maintenance professions and ground operations.\n\nThe quintessential idea that concerns all employees is a comprehensive safety awareness and a safe working environment, both physical and mental/social. Everyone working in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group should feel safe and free to report mistakes and incidents, even caused by themselves. By embracing a 'Just Culture' we learn, develop and improve on a permanent basis.\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM are further embedding safety in the attitude of every employee and the execution of every function by making safety awareness an integral part of every 'onboarding' and 'cross-boarding' program.\n\nAir/uni00A0France has set itself the objective of developing its safety culture through the Safety Attitude program, launched at the end of 2018. The ambition of Safety Attitude is to always be strengthening the company's safety performance and promote industry best practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nThe Safety Attitude program began with a benchmarking study of five companies, completed by a diagnostic phase, conducted by an independent organization. 22,500/uni00A0employees from all the Air/uni00A0France professions responded to a questionnaire and over 600/uni00A0people were interviewed. This in-depth diagnosis enabled us to identify the areas of work that will enable us to unite all employees around a common safety culture as close to operations as possible, based on transparency and trust. In 2020, despite the crisis, the Executive Committee rea/ffirmed its determination to pursue the project by implementing the first concrete actions, in particular the introduction of field visits for the entire line management. The action plan has been developed with all the departments to maintain a culture of transparency, simplification and respect for procedures, the evaluation of non-technical skills and inter-business exchanges. In 2021, other major actions were launched, such as the 'Safety Leadership' training courses deployed from the Executive Committee to middle management, dealing with major subjects such as the right culture and arbitration. To this end, a three-year program of concrete actions adapted to each business line has been structured: mobilization of the line management, a culture of transparency, respect of the procedures, evaluation of non-technical skills and inter-business-line exchanges.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nDuring 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM had one non-major accident and one serious incident, respectively a passenger having fallen when disembarking using the airstair and a pilot becoming unwell, which resulted in a diversion.\n\nThe rate of reporting of Flight Safety events by sta/ff is above target, contributing to the proper functioning of the Safety Management System.\n\nThe measures taken during the resumption of operations post the first lockdown to reduce the risk associated with a low level of activity have borne fruit. Vigilance nonetheless remains the order of the day hence the launch of a new safety study. The Flight Safety network teams are mobilized to analyze the signals coming from the Safety Management System and to take the appropriate action, in addition to the measures already in force.\n\n## Health security and commercial measures\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nIn 2021, the world had to contend with one of the gravest public health emergencies in its history, a/ffecting all populations across all continents. As of the emergence of Covid-19, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group implemented never-before-seen measures to guarantee the health and safety of its customers and sta/ff.\n\nIn 2021, exceptional commercial measures were maintained and constantly adjusted by the Group's airlines to enable customers to plan their trips with complete peace of mind.\n\nGiven the health situation, some countries require a health Pass, a negative test for Covid-19, quarantine and specific travel documents.\n\nIn 2021, customers were given access to the 'TravelDoc' website, enabling them to check the latest entry requirements before travelling. In addition, Air/uni00A0France's 'Ready to Fly' and KLM's 'Upload@Home' digital services, free of charge and optional, were introduced to enable customers to verify that they have all the necessary health documentation before starting their journeys and to pre-validate the documents required by the destination so that customers can ensure that their documentation is in order prior to embarkation.\n\nThroughout the year, the Company maintained a flexible commercial policy with 100% changeable and refundable tickets.\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has implemented the strictest health measures both on the ground and on board, as well as a fully-flexible commercial policy and a new travel insurance policy in partnership with Allianz Travel for epidemic-related risks. These measures include the:\n\n- -  mandatory wearing of surgical masks by both customers and sta/ff;\n- -  at the airport, posters, announcements and floor signage remind people of the physical distancing measures;\n- -  sales, check-in and boarding counters are equipped with Plexiglass protective screen;.\n- -  check-in counters and self-service kiosks are regularly disinfected, hydro alcoholic gel dispensers are available throughout the customer journey;\n- -  body temperature checks may be implemented on departure of certain flights;\n- -  all the health measures are also implemented in the lounges: hydro alcoholic gel dispenser at the entrance, mandatory wearing of masks, organized physical distancing and cleaning of all surfaces. The bu/ffet, bar, beauty treatment and children's spaces have been adapted or closed;\n- -  on board, prior to every departure, all the aircraft are thoroughly cleaned: vacuuming of carpets, seats and headrests. All contact surfaces (tablets, armrests, entertainment screens, remote controls, baggage racks, windows and toilets) are cleaned and disinfected;\n- -  aircraft are equipped with air recycling systems consisting of HEPA (High E/fficiency Particulate Air) filters, identical to those used in operating theaters, which trap 99.9% of particles. The air is thus renewed every three minutes;\n- -  a return to a normal in-flight and airport catering o/ffer has begun, but individually wrapped products or products served under a bell are still prioritized;",

To facilitate customers in the event of unforeseen developments, the Group's airlines have adapted their commercial policies. With 100% changeable and refundable tickets, it allows trip postponement for any reason, a refundable credit if the customer no longer wishes to travel or a refund if the flight is cancelled.\n\nKLM has introduced an interactive 'Where can I fly to?' map showing the current travel requirements for every country in the KLM network. The map displays the travel requirements based on the customer's country of departure and vaccination status, so they can choose their next destination at a glance.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nIn 2021, following a comprehensive audit of its health measures, the Group won the APEX (Airline Passenger Experience Association) Diamond Award Health Safety award, the highest distinction in its category. This award recognizes the best measures put in place by airlines in terms of health and health safety, showing that the airlines take the right measures at the highest level to o/ffer customers the safest possible journey.\n\nFollowing the implementation of the Air/uni00A0France Protect measures, customers were rapidly consulted to evaluate their level of satisfaction with the hygiene measures deployed throughout the customer journey and their in-flight experiences. Since June/uni00A02020, they have thus been invited to complete a questionnaire. Nearly 90% of Air/uni00A0France customers say they are satisfied or very satisfied with the measures in place, approaching 60% reply that they feel comfortable during their journeys and some 23% say that they are enthusiastic/happy; feelings of aggravation, anxiety or stress are reported by 8.5% of the customers polled.\n\n## Operational measures to take into account the impact of climate change\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nFor air transportation, the impacts of climate change could have consequences for the routes and destinations served. In particular, the more frequent occurrence of extreme climate events could a/ffect the safety of flight operations and service continuity (re-routing, flight cancellations and delays,/uni00A0etc.) causing disruption for customers.\n\n## Measures and performance\n\nSince they are present across all continents, the Group's airlines already operate in all weather conditions. They have thus already\n\ndeployed the procedures and resources to ensure operations in extreme climate conditions. Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia have developed special training programs for employees on the management of emergency situations.\n\nThe airlines also work in cooperation with airports to ensure safe operational and passenger handling conditions and, in such circumstances, deploy commercial measures to enable passengers to defer their travel should they so wish, or change their destinations.\n\nLastly, the size of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM network, with services balanced between the di/fferent continents and the flexibility obtained through fleet composition, are all valuable assets when it comes to minimizing the economic and commercial consequences of these impacts, and adapting flight schedules to market requirements.\n\n## Food safety\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is committed to guaranteeing food services that are safe for its customers and flight crews.\n\nAs the years go by the relevant regulations are becoming increasingly exacting. This is why food safety is a key priority for the Group. Air/uni00A0France and KLM both deploy quality-control procedures to fulfil these requirements.\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\nThe management system is based on four processes, steered by a centralized unit within the Group.\n\n- -  the first process is cross-cutting and applies to the whole risk area: regulatory intelligence, risk analysis and definition of the measures to mitigate these risks, staff training, establishment and updating of the reference standards, monitoring of the action plans;\n- -  the three other processes are operational and are detailed based on the activity: on board services, water on board and services o/ffered in the lounges.\n\nThe management measures are deployed by a Food Safety specialist in each relevant entity: procurement, air operations, ground services, maintenance, operations, international stations, logistics and flight product. They are the guarantors that the measures have been applied within their business lines and report back on functioning together with the associated action plans. The management measures are regularly monitored through indicators and decision-making committees ensuring the e/ffectiveness of the provisions in place relating to Food Safety.\n\nDespite the significant reduction in the number of flights linked to the public health crisis, the monitoring of catering suppliers has been maintained while adapting the model. Food safety audits have continued for some catering suppliers. In order to adapt to the health crisis, remote audits have been set up. Microbiological checks, water analyses and temperature checks have been maintained in proportion to the flight schedule.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

These audits are executed by specially-trained auditors, and are unannounced and on-site. The audits verify compliance with the QSAI Food Processing Safety and Food Processing Quality standards, based on the HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) principles;\n- -  e-audits are also conducted to verify the exhaustiveness and e/ffectiveness of the traceability within all caterers.\n- -  in addition, all food product suppliers are referenced based on very strict specifications and are the subject of close microbiological monitoring, carried out by an in-house ISO/uni00A017025-accredited laboratory for KLM and by an external microbiological analysis laboratory for Air/uni00A0France.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nIn addition to compliance with the HACCP Principles & Application Guidelines, Air/uni00A0France is the first airline in the world to have attained ISO/uni00A022000/uni00A0certification. An annual audit carried out by an external body verifies that the management system complies with the standard and with the regulatory requirements. In response to the standard's new requirements, Air/uni00A0France made some changes to its management system which were approved by an external audit in March/uni00A02021. Internal audits are also realized based on a three-year plan across all the relevant business lines.\n\nA series of key indicators, one per operational process, form part of a monthly dashboard presented to the Executive Committee. Any malfunctioning flagged, notably, by flight crews or customers, is also studied to be able to implement remedial and/or preventive measures. Throughout the year, several meetings of in-house steering bodies are held, enabling the monitoring of current events in this area and the tracking of performance via indicators and action plans, with a view to ensuring a continuous improvement.\n\n## 4.4.2/emspace Confidentiality and data protection\n\n## Data and IT systems protection\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nPassenger bookings, flight schedule management, baggage check-in, the calculation of ticket prices, aircraft maintenance and crew information: IT is at the heart of all of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's activities. Privacy and data protection constitutes a major operational and financial challenge for the business, and for customer trust.\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group manages its cybersecurity risks in liaison with the national authorities and cooperates with the relevant European agencies (EASA, ENISA). Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has its cyber security assessed annually by several independent auditors who participate in the continuous improvement of its action plans. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also takes part in the cybersecurity working groups of the main professional airline associations (IATA, A4E,/uni00A0etc.) and contributes to research by associations specialized in cybersecurity (CLUSIF, CESIN, CIGREF, R2GS, European Aviation ISAC).\n\nPermanent benchmarking and an independent cyber rating agency enable Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to be compared with other companies in the air transportation industry. In December/uni00A02021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's IT centers were ranked amongst the leading large companies.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also calls on the expertise of leading consultants in the cybersecurity market and actively cooperates with companies with which its Information System is connected.\n\nTo o/ffer the best level of protection on the ground and in the air, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is increasing the number of sta/ff dedicated to cyber security and the major cyber security programs in line with the risks:\n\n- -  a program directed at more effective cybersecurity techniques, to adapt to the evolving cyber threat. This includes cyber insurance;\n- -  an awareness-raising program for all sta/ff involving mandatory Cyber training;\n- -  a program to ensure regulatory compliance which includes a specific level of protection and supervision for critical systems;\n- -  a program to support the digital transformation to o/ffer a simplified and secure user experience.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nAn annual presentation on these programs is made to the Group Executive Committee and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, guaranteeing sponsorship at the highest level of the company. These programs are supported by Cybersecurity Governance composed of:\n\n- -  a cybersecurity regulatory framework for ground IT and onboard systems (safety policy based on a series of international ISO/uni00A027000/uni00A0regulations and other standards or regulations concerning Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's activities);",

This framework is subject to a continuous improvement process.\n\nRisks related to Data Protection are periodically assessed within the various business activities of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and integrated into the overall risk management and control system.\n\nInsofar as these risks, combined with cybersecurity threats, become more and more significant, the protection of personal data, and, more generally. data privacy, is an absolute imperative for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group.\n\nSee also section 3.1.3 'Risks relating to the Group's processes'.\n\n## 4.4.3/emspace Accessibility of the products and services\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nThe Group offers all its customers the best-possible travel experience and undertakes to provide comfortable, attentive and reliable air travel. Passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility (PDRM) are welcome, providing that air travel is not counter to medical advice.\n\nThis calls for the appropriate assistance involving a degree of complexity owing, notably, to the di/fferences between EU and US regulations. In the US, the responsibility falls solely to the airline and there are no reporting requirements for US citizens and passengers on flights to/from the US. In the European Union, however, the airport authority is responsible for the end-to-end assistance of PDRMs during their journeys through airports and customers are invited to transmit this information to the airline 48/uni00A0hours before departure, the airline then being responsible for forwarding this information to the airport authority 36/uni00A0hours prior to departure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

At AmsterdamSchiphol Airport, PDRM assistance is supplied by Axxicom Airport Caddy.\n\nFor disabled and reduced mobility (PDRM) customers, within the context of the public health crisis, the airlines have reinforced their protocols to guarantee their health and well-being (wheelchairs disinfected daily and after every use, the wearing of masks and gloves by airport assistance personnel,/uni00A0etc.). Lastly, all the communication channels are updated to help customers comply with all the travel conditions (entry documents, tests,/uni00A0etc.).\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France dedicated assistance service for passengers with reduced mobility, known as Saphir (Service d'Assistance aux Personnes Handicap\u00e9es pour les Informations et la R\u00e9servation ), o/ffers an array of adapted services, such as facilitated booking procedures, airport assistance, baggage assistance and special equipment on board. With some twenty dedicated advisors, Saphir fielded around 56,000/uni00A0calls in 2020: telephone and online services enable ticket bookings and the provision of the appropriate assistance. A special telephone assistance service for the hard of hearing or deaf customers is also o/ffered. Nineteen other Customer Relations Centers around the world are able to process requests from our PDRM customers via our business partner Acc\u00e9o. SAPHIR is available in 19/uni00A0other countries and not only for the deaf and hard of Hearing persons.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France has also long partnered multiple associations dedicated to disability and has forged strong links with national and European bodies in this field, to cooperate on the design and development of service improvements.\n\nKLM Cares is a dedicated service to assist PDRM customers with the planning and booking of flights. At the airport and on board, KLM o/ffers specially-adapted facilities and equipment to ensure a seamless travel experience.\n\nBoth Air/uni00A0France and KLM cabin crews are specially trained in the assistance needs of customers with disabilities and have received specific instructions to contend with the public health crisis.\n\n1,000/uni00A0of them have obtained the status of 'PHRM referral clients' after undergoing in-depth training. They are the vectors of a change in attitude towards this clientele, and the guarantee of appropriate treatment on board. In addition, some sta/ff members (approximately 30 in 2015) speak French sign language (LSF). LSF-qualified sales agents and crew members wear a pin so they can be easily identified.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nThe number of people with disabilities or reduced mobility flying with the Group is growing year after year. Despite the Covid-19 public health crisis, nearly 215,000/uni00A0PDRM customers traveled with Air/uni00A0France in 2020.\n\nWith around 127,000/uni00A0PDRM passengers flying KLM, the breakdown in the nature of the requests in 2020 was similar to 2019 (+/- 1.1%). In early 2020, the increasing trend in the number of wheelchair assistance requests continued, showing year-on-year growth of about 10%. Due to Covid-19, this trend finally stabilized leading to figures very similar to those of 2019: 94% of PDRM customers requested wheelchair assistance, of whom about half requested the most basic service (for customers unable to walk long distances).\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France, a Key Customer Club with PDRM passengers has been created. Their feedback has helped to improve certain services, particularly better information, both up-stream and during the journey, for both customers and frontline sta/ff, within the framework of Air/uni00A0France's Attentive Relationship.\n\nOther new initiatives have also been deployed, such as the upgraded pages on the Air/uni00A0France and KLM websites devoted to PDRMs, providing a wealth of travel tips and pushing tailored information to all passengers based on their type of disability.\n\nFor customer-facing staff, on board and at the airport, awareness-raising workshops focusing on the appropriate forms of words and actions to adopt with PDRM customers have been launched, together with IT tools to facilitate their care.",

This includes, in particular, the protection of Human Rights, combating corruption and all forms of child and forced labor, and the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion.\n\nThese fundamental principles are based on the international standards for businesses, including the UN Global Compact, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the Core Conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the Children's Rights and Business Principles.\n\nAs a signatory of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact since 2003, the Group supports its ten principles and actively promotes them with partners and suppliers.\n\n## 4.5.1/emspace The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles\n\nIn 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM developed its Social Rights and Ethics Charter which become The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles rea/ffirm to all employees the Group's commitment to fostering a climate of mutual trust, respect, transparency and confidentiality, and to promoting a work environment where health, safety and quality of life are a major priority without compromise.\n\nThe principles apply to all individual employees in the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, including those on part-time and temporary contracts. They serve as a shared foundation for all companies within the Group and support new initiatives, procedures, rules, and Codes of Conduct. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM\n\n## 4.5.2/emspace Respect of Human Rights\n\nHuman Rights are the foundation for social, economic and cultural cohesion within each company and across the Group. Every employee of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has the right to working conditions that respect their health, safety and dignity, and guarantee a social dialogue.\n\nWithin the framework of its activities, the Group has identified the risk factors relating to Human Rights. The measures put in place to mitigate these risks fall into a number of di/fferent areas: health and safety of individuals, equal opportunity, achieving a better work/life balance and data protection procedures to protect the personal data of customers and employees (see sections 4.2, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, 4.4.3 and 4.6.3).\n\nIn its relationships with suppliers, the Group is committed to ensuring that the fundamental principles and social rights are\n\nPrinciples were developed in cooperation with the European Works Council.\n\nWhere relevant, these principles apply to all Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM stakeholders, irrespective of their nature, and the Group encourages all its customers, shareholders, business partners and local communities to respect them.\n\nPlease see the below link for the full text of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles:\n\nhttps://www.airfranceklm.com/sites/default/files/afklm\\_ principles\\_2021\\_en.pdf\n\nproperly respected, everywhere in the world. Suppliers are invited to sign a Supplier Code of Conduct based on the principles of the United Nations Global Compact (see sections 4.6.2 and 4.6.3).\n\nAir/uni00A0France carries out awareness-raising actions for its employees on human tra/fficking, to help them to identify at-risk situations and take action against this form of international organized crime, comparable with modern-day slavery. Whether it is tra/fficking for the purpose of forced labor or crime, sexual exploitation, illegal adoption or forced marriage, child soldiers, organ tra/fficking or other forms of human exploitation, the ground sta/ff and flight crews should be able to recognize behavior that may be considered abnormal or worrying and, in the event of suspected human tra/fficking, report the event as soon as possible and in accordance with the instructions. These actions, which were initiated in 2019, will continue in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Anti-Bribery Manual, supported by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Gift & Hospitality policy, is publicly available on the airfranceklm.com website.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's commitment to conducting business in good faith, founded on equity, transparency, honesty and integrity, and in the strict respect of the anti-corruption laws in all the countries where its companies or subsidiaries exercise their activities, is a/ffirmed in The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles and the Anti-Bribery Manual. This Manual acts as a Code of Conduct for all employees and establishes the guidelines for preventing corruption, and for identifying and handling at-risk situations in the light of the anti-corruption legislation.\n\nFollowing the publication of recommendations from the French Anti-Corruption Agency (AFA) on September/uni00A011, 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is currently updating its Gift & Hospitality policy and has clarified other policies such as those relating to conflicts of interest and facilitation payments.\n\nThe Procurement divisions contributed to the establishment of a Sustainable Development Charter for suppliers. As the application of ethical, social and environmental principles constitutes an important criterion when selecting suppliers, the latter must confirm their respect of these principles. This Charter has since been replaced by a Supplier Code of Conduct which specifies the commitments on Human Rights, health and safety, the environment and ethics. This Supplier Code of Conduct is regularly checked and updated to be in line with applicable regulations, notably the French Sapin 2/uni00A0Act which sets forth a monitoring obligation on the probity of contracting partners.\n\n## Fair business practice\n\n## Prevention of bribery and anti-competitive practices\n\nThe prevention of bribery and anti-competitive behavior is an important factor in honest and fair business practice. As unethical or inappropriate behavior can have considerable negative consequences, both financial and in terms of the Group's reputation, preventing unfair practices is key.\n\nSince 2017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has been required to comply with the French Sapin II Act (Act No.2016-1691) and has accordingly improved its anti-bribery compliance program. Work is ongoing\n\non improving its e/ffectiveness within the Group. For example, the Anti-Bribery Manual and the Gift & Hospitality Policy are regularly checked for updates and improvements. This Policy aims to provide clear guidelines for sta/ff, including financial limits, on giving and receiving gifts and hospitality. Both the Anti-Bribery Manual and the Gift & Hospitality Policy documents are available in three languages and can be consulted by sta/ff on the intranet sites. In 2021, it was decided to simplify the structure and language of the Anti-Bribery Manual (which will become the 'Anti-bribery Code of Conduct') with a framework document and appendices dedicated to each topic to be covered in accordance with the Recommendations of the French Anti-corruption Agency and bribery risk mapping. Subject to validation by top management and the European Works Council, this revised version of the manual should be released in 2022.\n\nIn terms of anti-competitive practices, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is developing its policy aimed at the prevention of anti-competitive acts by circulating to sta/ff a Competition Law Compliance Manual which was updated in 2020.\n\nThe KLM Group has adopted a Code of Conduct which stipulates all the rules governing the activities exercised by the KLM Group and its suppliers. The KLM Code of Conduct covers the following areas: Safety, Business Integrity, Social Responsibility and reporting Violations. The KLM Group has also deployed a Code of Ethics for the Finance Function.\n\nAn anti-bribery e-learning training campaign has been deployed to maintain and reinforce the anti-bribery awareness and knowledge of sta/ff. At the end of 2021, the realization rate for this training was 85%. Awareness is also reinforced through, for example, information meetings and discussions, improved access to compliance documents and regular communication by the Group's General Management.\n\nA competition law e-learning module was developed in-house and deployed in December/uni00A02021 amongst a significant number of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group employees, to remind them of the competition law principles and the risks at stake.\n\nSee also section/uni00A03.1.2 'Risks relating to the air transportation activity'.\n\n## Compliance and fair business conduct\n\nThe Compliance activities are based on compliance programs, executed within the context of a formalized framework. New legislation or requirements relating, for example, to anti-bribery or data privacy are taken into account when establishing the compliance programs and their increased appropriation is ensured via, amongst other initiatives, awareness-raising campaigns, and dedicated processes or projects which are organized to ensure compliance.",

The Compliance O/fficers within Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM are tasked with overseeing the implementation of the Compliance programs within the Group. They are supported by a network of compliance correspondents in the activities or departments and subsidiaries. Depending on the type of business transaction and the complexity within the activities or departments and entities, subject matter experts and compliance correspondents facilitate compliance with specific legislation and the roll-out of the relevant elements of the compliance program.\n\nThe compliance program is mainly based on training and awareness-raising. Matters that require greater awareness\n\nand transcend businesses, like the prevention of bribery and anti-competitive behavior, are the subject of information campaigns. These campaigns are supplemented by dedicated training which is available to individual employees. Employees can also raise questions or concerns with the Compliance O/fficers and legal experts.\n\nBefore entering into any undertakings and during commercial relationships with customers, suppliers and intermediaries ('Third Parties'), the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group ensures that the compliance and fair business conduct rules are duly respected through an evaluation by a third party.\n\n2020-21\n\nwant to act fairly, transparent and with integrity towards all our stakeholders.

The Company is committed to comply with the letter, the intent and the spirit of the tax legislation, local and international laws (including bilateral tax treaties, OECD and UN guidelines) of the countries in which it operates and to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM complies with the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan and files all the required transfer pricing documents, including a Country-byCountry Report.\n\nPursuant to the specific guidelines relating to the taxation of international air transportation services, wherein operational income is taxed in the country of domicile, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM consequently reports most of its airline income in France and the Netherlands. Specific local taxation rules require the Group to also report a relatively small portion in foreign jurisdictions where the Group operates. Tax returns will be well sourced, based on sound evidence and full disclosure. Any information is to be recorded and reported in a fair, timely, and accurate manner following good business practices, applicable accounting standards and local tax laws.\n\n| Key Performance Indicators                                       | Definition                                                                                                            | 2019   results   | results   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------|\n| Realization rate of the e-learning  program on the prevention of | Number of employees having completed the entire training  program as of December/uni00A031, 2021 divided by the total |                  |           |\n| corruption                                                       | number of employees invited to undertake this training                                                                | 86%              | 85%       |\n\nDefinition\n\nScope: Target group of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group employees.\n\nTraining is mandatory for the target group of employees. The target group is selected based on level of function or exposure to bribery risk. The measured indicator is the number of employees having completed the entire training program as of December/uni00A031, 2021, divided by the total number of employees invited to undertake this training. The training is considered to have been completed if the individual passes the test with a score of at least 70%.\n\n## Whistle-blower procedures:\n\nSince all employees are required to respect these rules, employees in all the Group's entities are encouraged to discuss any compliance concerns with their line managers. They can also contact a Compliance O/fficer directly. Employees also have the option of flagging any issues via the Whistle-blower procedures. These procedures also include the possibility of reporting any serious situations, notably relating to corruption o/ffences and the duty of vigilance (Human Rights, fundamental freedoms, health and safety, environment), pursuant to the regulation in force. The whistle-blower mechanism includes guidance for employees on the reporting of incidents and states the measures undertaken to ensure the strict confidentiality of the alert and identity of the relevant employees. It also includes a guarantee that no sanctions will be taken against employees reporting any such incidents in good faith, as provided under the applicable law.\n\nReports under the whistle-blower procedures are investigated and the appropriate corrective actions are implemented.\n\n## Tax strategy\n\nTax is an integral part of the Finance function within Air/uni00A0France and KLM and supports Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's corporate strategy.

The Group participates in the development of tax policies by contributing constructive inputs to public consultations.\n\nThe aim is to proactively deal with disputed taxation matters, avoid unnecessary challenges and disputes to achieve certainty wherever possible.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group's aim is to take sustainable tax positions which are long-term in nature, in support of the business operations.

It does not look for schemes that might be deemed improper at the fiscal level or are intended to avoid paying taxes.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM conducts its operations with a minimum level of risk with respect to tax matters and as such applies the anti-tax-avoidance rules within the framework of the European Directive (EU) 2016-1164 transposed into French and Dutch tax laws.\n\nThe European mandatory disclosure regime for potentially aggressive international tax arrangements came into e/ffect on July/uni00A01, 2020 (DAC6 Directive, EU 2018/822/uni00A0of May/uni00A025, 2018). Both Air/uni00A0France and KLM's tax departments have reviewed the compliance reporting obligations the businesses are potentially facing under the new Mandatory Disclosure Rules (MDR) in relation to certain cross border arrangements. No such arrangements have been identified.\n\nThe Tax A/ffairs departments in France and the Netherlands seek to anticipate and reduce the tax risks to their lowest-possible level. They ensure that reasonable care applies in relation to all the Group's processes that could materially a/ffect compliance with the tax obligations and are particularly vigilant in the application of the rules combating fraud and tax evasion.\n\n## The global challenges of the public health crisis for tax\n\nThe ongoing pandemic has led to unprecedented challenges for all businesses and for tax a/ffairs globally, in terms of supporting the operations aimed at preserving and improving the Group's liquidity position. The possibility of obtaining governmental aid through employment subsidies and financial packages has also been the subject of rigorous scrutiny on the part of the French and Dutch governments.\n\nDuring this whole period, new tax legislation, tax relief measures and tax payment deferrals in a number of countries, together with the implementation of restructuring and automation projects, have been an integral part of the fiscal strategies developed locally.",

These hubs o/ffer multiple connecting opportunities in Europe and with the rest of the world, and are part of an extensive, high-quality network that generates an attractive business environment. According to an Opinionway survey of international investors carried out in 2019, the presence of a hub o/ffering direct and frequent international connections is the second most important criterion when choosing a location.\n\nWith more than 90% of the Group's employees based in France and the Netherlands, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is a significant contributor to direct job creation in the regions around its two main hubs. The Group's activities also generate numerous indirect and induced jobs: assistance and catering in the outstations, cleaning and sub-contracted services required for the operation of an aircraft.\n\nThe hubs create highly-attractive business environments while airport proximity leads to the development of other activities (hotels, conferences, company show-rooms, commercial and marketing functions, business services and activities linked to innovation).\n\nAs the number one air operator carrying international tourists visiting France, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM makes a significant contribution towards promoting France and the Netherlands as destinations, and to the development of tourism.\n\nKLM's extensive network has contributed to making the Netherlands an attractive location for both Dutch and international companies. The Air/uni00A0France Group, with operations at 33/uni00A0French airports in 2021 (in mainland France and overseas), reinforces the appeal of the regions and contributes to the growth in local activity.\n\nHistorically, the Group has also played an active role in promoting international development, particularly through its support of NGOs and projects sponsored by its own employees.\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\n## Contributing to national and local development\n\nFor many years, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has supported the development of small and medium-sized companies to which it entrusts a significant proportion of its procurement. The Group also promotes innovation and working with start-ups via its involvement in initiatives such as the creation of an innovation counter, and participation in special business incubators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

This association aims to foster harmonious and balanced development of the Grand Roissy area, in synergy with the airport platform, and to promote public transport, housing and infrastructure projects that are vital to the development of this area.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group was significantly impacted by the consequences of the Covid-19 public health crisis. It nonetheless maintained an intensive dialogue with stakeholders at both local and national level to adapt and optimize its schedule, operations and network to take into account, as far as possible, the expectations and connectivity needs of the regions. During the various lockdown phases, particularly in France and the Netherlands, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia thus maintained a minimum schedule enabling the repatriation of fellow French and Dutch compatriots, and ensuring the basic needs for regional access and connectivity. Furthermore, the Air/uni00A0 France Group maintained territorial continuity between France and the overseas departments and territories, while the whole Group mobilized around operating the air bridge for the transportation of masks and medical equipment.\n\n## Creating social impact\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM support initiatives enabling the development of skills, the vocational integration of young people and the social inclusion of vulnerable individuals. This also includes promoting access to training leading to professions in the airline industry, through numerous associations and educational programs for young people.\n\nAir/uni00A0France is a founder member and partner of four associations involved in information and training programs on aviation careers (AirEmploi, Jeremy, AFMA\u00e9, and Engineers for Schools). The company organizes skills sponsorship initiatives by mobilizing its in-house teams and leveraging the expertise of associations like 'Nos Quartiers ont du Talent ', 'Article 1' and 'Tous En Stage ', an association for which Air/uni00A0France was a founder member. 'Tous En Stage ' organizes multi-company internships for school children in the regions (mainland France, French Overseas Departments and Territories) and young people with disabilities.\n\nThe KLM Group supports a number of educational programs to attract and develop future talent through collaboration with ROCs, Delft University of Technology, Schiphol Aviation College, the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and the JINC foundation. In particular, the KLM Maintenance division o/ffers internships to students training for the aeronautical mechanics professions.\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM continue to support workers with disabilities by using companies in the sheltered and adapted sector for multiple projects (e.g. the upkeep of green spaces at some sites, shipment of packages of uniforms, packaging of headphones used on board, laundering of on-board linen) and by entrusting them with highly-critical services (four sheltered sector suppliers work with the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM IT department).\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France, in partnership with the start-up Vendredi mobilized its employees around volunteering with the creation of the 'Mon Engagement Citoyen' initiative. The company is thus rea/ffirming its commitment to social and environmental issues in the areas where it operates. Via this network and throughout the year, employees can o/ffer their free time, positive energy and skills to partner associations in the six areas of action prioritized by Air/uni00A0France and the Air/uni00A0France Foundation: Children, Education - Training - Employment, Disability - Health, Combating Precarity, Intergenerational Sharing and the Environment. Since its launch, 3,000/uni00A0Air/uni00A0France employees have registered on the Vendredi platform and nearly 400/uni00A0volunteering actions have already been carried out. This dynamic follows on from the Citizenship Days organized by the company in the past three years.\n\n## Social partnerships\n\nAir/uni00A0France provides practical support to development projects through four long-standing partnerships: the Air/uni00A0France Foundation, the Air/uni00A0France Humanitarian Aid Department, Acting for Life and Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res .\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France Foundation has adapted its projects while pursuing its primary objective: supporting children. The long-standing projects on the themes of education for sick, disabled and vulnerable children are being pursued and now include environmental issues. The Foundation finances educational projects contributing to fostering new kinds of behavior and increased understanding of climate issues, together with training and awareness-raising projects on sustainable practices respecting natural resources. In 2021, the Air/uni00A0France Foundation was active in 48/uni00A0projects (12/uni00A0projects for environmental education, 23/uni00A0projects for children in di/fficulty, nine projects for sick or disabled children and four projects to support the social and health crisis) in 18/uni00A0countries with 100,000/uni00A0beneficiaries. The Friends of the Air/uni00A0France Foundation network mobilizes more than 4,800/uni00A0employees around di/fferent volunteering, skills-sharing and donation-based initiatives.\n\nThe Humanitarian Patronage Service supports 18/uni00A0medical NGOs working with children. Following the health situation related to Covid-19, 240/uni00A0tickets were issued in 2021 for medical teams and the repatriation of sick children. In addition, free excess baggage fees were o/ffered to more than 38/uni00A0NGOs for the transport of medical equipment and health emergencies in the context of the health crisis, i.e. 118/uni00A0pieces of luggage.",

Acting for Life is involved in the promotion of sustainable social and economic territorial development.\n\nThanks to the financial support and transportation facilities donated by Air/uni00A0France, the emergency aid organization Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res  accompanied more than 950/uni00A0sick children on the airline's flights and shipped nearly 8,500/uni00A0packages of medicines and minor medical supplies to 26/uni00A0destinations. In addition, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Flying Blue loyalty program enables Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res  to benefit from numerous miles, thereby reducing the transportation costs incurred in accompanying sick children. There are many active and retired Air/uni00A0 France employees amongst the Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res teams of volunteers.\n\nFor many years, Air/uni00A0France has been involved in promoting sustainable and responsible tourism within the travel profession ecosystem, and particularly the most proactive like Agir pour un Tourisme Responsable (ATR). Air/uni00A0France also acts as an information conduit on the devastation caused by child sex tourism, by financing ECPAT International's prevention campaign and handing out literature on the airline's long-haul flights.\n\nTwenty-four years ago, Transavia created the Peter Pan Holiday Club. This initiative, supported by Transavia employees, organizes holidays for young people between the ages of 13 and 20/uni00A0years who are unable to enjoy a 'normal' holiday due to illness or di/fficult circumstances. Transavia also works closely with JINC, an organization that arranges activities for children from economically-disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nTransavia employees are invited and encouraged to actively participate in these initiatives during which children notably visit companies to gain valuable insight into the working world and its functioning, and become familiar with the concept of networking. These initiatives illustrate the Transavia conviction that 'Everybody deserves to be seen' and contribute to a more inclusive society.\n\nFor over a decade, Transavia France has been supporting the Louis Carlesimo association, enabling sick children to travel on its flights. Every year, between 50 and 80/uni00A0children have the opportunity to travel to Lapland and meet Father Christmas on the outbound flight as part of a magical and unforgettable experience with the airline. In 2021, once again, the magic worked and 42/uni00A0children, accompanied by 11/uni00A0employees, were able to explore Lapland and visit Father Christmas.\n\nTransavia also supports the men and women combating diseases via its commitment to associations like Les H\u00f4tesses de l'Air Contre le Cancer  and Les Hommes de l'Air. In 2021, special flights were organized to raise customer awareness and highlight the two associations. In partnership with Les Hommes de l'Air, limited edition key rings were sold on board the aircraft and to employees. All proceeds were donated to the association.\n\nSince 2019, Transavia has fostered diversity by supporting Personn'Ailes, Air/uni00A0France's LGBT and gay-friendly association. Each year, special flights are organized in the colors of the rainbow to share our common vision of diversity and inclusion. On December/uni00A01, 2021, Transavia organized special flights to raise awareness of the fight against AIDS.\n\nKLM works together with selected partners to protect the environment and preserve cultural heritage. In addition, KLM supports a number of large institutions that assist people in need. One of these is Wings of Support, which was founded by KLM and Martinair sta/ff and runs projects that provide shelter, education and medical care for children in need worldwide. In 2021, the partnership with Wings of Support was extended for a further three years. KLM is also engaged in several partnerships that aim to preserve cultural heritage and, more generally, o/ffer support to arts and cultural initiatives. Examples include the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and various leading museums and theatres in the Netherlands.\n\nLastly, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM customers who are members of the Flying Blue loyalty program are o/ffered the opportunity to donate their Miles to 18/uni00A0NGOs selected by Air/uni00A0France and KLM: WWF, the Ocean Cleanup, Close the Gap, the Red Cross, UNICEF, Wings of Support and Giro555. In 2021, more than 31/uni00A0million Miles were donated to NGOs.\n\n## A solidarity chain linked to the public health crisis\n\nIn 2021, the Group also actively participated in the transportation of vaccines, notably on its cargo flights.\n\n## Results and performance\n\n## National and regional economic impact\n\nIn France:\n\nEconomic impact in France, according to an EM Strasbourg research report published in early 2020 on the basis of 2019 figures (pre-Covid-19):\n\n- -  \u20ac40/uni00A0billion positive economic impact attributable to the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's activity, representing 1.6% of French GDP;\n- -  475,000/uni00A0FTE jobs depend on the Group's activity;\n- -  for every job created by the Group, 8.7/uni00A0jobs are created in the French economy;\n- -  for every euro invested, the Group generates two euros in the national economy;\n- -  the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's activity directly generates \u20ac3.6/uni00A0billion (including the taxes and social contributions paid by the Group and its employees);\n- -  Air France is a leading private sector employer in the \u00cele-deFrance.\n\nIn the Netherlands:\n\n- -  at the end of 2021, KLM was one of the five largest private sector employers in the Netherlands. The KLM Group accounted for more than 29,000/uni00A0jobs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Within the framework of this agreement, one of the commitments concerns rea/ffirmed support for the sheltered and adapted sector.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France also cooperates with associations and companies in the sheltered sector on multiple projects representing, in 2021, approximately \u20ac8/uni00A0million of the Group's procurement (e.g. the upkeep of green spaces at some sites, shipment of packages of uniforms, packaging of headphones used on board, laundering of on-board linen). Air/uni00A0France maintains long-term partnership relations, thus enabling these companies to develop in a sustainable context.\n\n## 4.6.2/emspace Sustainable  procurement\n\n## Context and strategy\n\nAs a service company, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's business activity is heavily dependent on procurement which represents around \u20ac10/uni00A0billion per year. Note that this figure was still down in 2021 owing to the Covid-19 public health crisis and the sharp decline in air tra/ffic. Fuel purchasing amounts to some 40% of this expenditure, followed by aircraft maintenance and components, airport and navigation fees, and airport handling.\n\nGiven the significant proportion of external expenses relative to total revenues, optimizing, innovating and making the supply chain more sustainable are priorities for the Group, and contribute to improving profitability. The Procurement department deploys an ambitious policy and encourages the adoption of responsible practices within its processes. For a number of years, this responsible procurement policy has aimed to factor societal responsibility principles into relationships with suppliers by reinforcing control over ethical, social, environmental and supply chain risks. In its Flight Plan, the Procurement Department includes Corporate Social Responsibility as a pillar of its actions. A transformation plan is underway within the department, seeking to go even further on this topic and dedicating resources that will support the overall purchasing actions to respond to the Horizon 2030 corporate strategy. In 2021, we launched the Escalation process to monitor high-risk suppliers' compliance and to mitigate the risks.\n\n## Measures and action plan\n\n## Pursing a responsible procurement policy throughout the process\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM pursues a responsible procurement policy throughout the process:\n\n- -  during the supplier referencing process, the Group sends suppliers a questionnaire, addressing a number of themes such as safety, environmental management, HR policy;\n\nSince the 2000s, Air/uni00A0France has been developing one of the most important support initiatives in the national territory for workers with disabilities by using the STPA (Secteur du Travail Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 et Adapt\u00e9) for multiple projects (e.g the upkeep of green spaces at some sites, shipment of packages of uniforms, packaging of headphones used on board, laundering of on-board linen). The IT department is constantly looking for new projects in sectors where the STPA innovates and branches out into new areas of human expertise (four companies in the protected sector work for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's IT department).\n\n## Contribution to community projects\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM allocated \u20ac4.7/uni00A0million to supporting NGOs and other social and environmental initiatives. A key performance indicator to measure the impact of the sums allocated is in the development phase.\n\n- -  suppliers are invited to sign the Sustainable Development Charter for Suppliers based on the principles of the UN Global Compact or provide their own equivalent document, which can be approved following analysis. Since 2015, this Charter has been supplemented by a Supplier Code of Conduct;\n- -  the tender documents frequently list the criteria enabling the evaluation of the environmental impact of the product or service, which are then taken into account during the evaluation of the di/fferent supplier proposals. This is an integral part of the assessment of the total cost of ownership and the life cycle analysis.\n\nTo supplement the existing process, the Procurement function uses the services of EcoVadis, a company specialized in the evaluation of suppliers based on Corporate Social Responsibility criteria;\n\nThe risk mapping process, which takes place at the beginning of the procurement process, takes into account the di/fferent sectors of procurement and the countries in which the suppliers are based:\n\n- -  buyers must systematically verify the positioning of each supplier in the risk map. There are six levels of risk;\n- -  in the event of an elevated or severe level of risk, suppliers are contacted so that they can be evaluated by EcoVadis or an equivalent organization on the following four themes: environment, social, ethics and sustainable procurement (as defined in the EcoVadis system);\n- -  if the risk category of the supplier is lower than 'high risk', buyers are advised to encourage their supplier to be evaluated in order to improve their weak points. The suppliers can then share their scores with other companies, which may prove to be a competitive advantage in terms of winning bids and contracts.\n\nSince March/uni00A02020, through two risk managers, the Procurement department support has monitored suppliers to guarantee the financial health of its partners.

        "page_content": "requires the Group to secure its supply chain and take into account the specific situations being traversed by its suppliers, particularly the smallest. The local Small & Medium Enterprises (SME) and companies from the Adapted and Protected Sector (STPA) purchasing mindset was a focus of concern this year.\n\nThe KLM Fuel Procurement function has made a decade-long commitment to developing and purchasing 75,000/uni00A0tons of sustainable aviation fuel per year. To this end, KLM is contributing, alongside SkyNRG, the world leader in sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), to the development of the first European plant dedicated to the production of SAF in Delfzijl. The construction of this facility, scheduled to open in 2024, is a concrete step towards achieving KLM's ambitions for sustainable development and contributes to the broader 'Smart and Sustainable' industrial plan. As of 2023, the plant will produce 100,000/uni00A0tons of SAF annually, as well as 15,000/uni00A0tons of bio LPG, as a by-product. This will mean an annual/uni00A0CO2 reduction of 270,000/uni00A0tons for the aviation sector. This is an important milestone for the industry in its quest to reduce carbon emissions and meet the growing demand for sustainable fuel for aviation.\n\n## Empowering the buyers\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM buyers are committed to respecting the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility commitments. On their first day in the o/ffice, they sign a Code of Ethics outlining the ethical rules to follow when dealing with suppliers. In the light of the Anti-Bribery legislation, a reminder of the Code of Ethics is sent to the prescribers. These documents, the Sustainability Charter for Suppliers and the Code of Ethics are available on the Procurement website. This year, the Group worked on the updating of these documents and a new Code of Conduct will be gradually rolled out.\n\nAn internal process has also been established to develop the buyers' skills, with training modules, seminars and web links providing more information on best environmental practices. All Procurement staff have completed an anti-corruption e-learning module. All new buyers receive training on the department's CSR commitments, the duty of vigilance and the anti-bribery processes, and on how to use a scoring tool (EcoVadis). EcoVadis training was provided in October/uni00A02021 and all relevant information is available in the Sharepoint tool under 'Procurement and Sustainability'.\n\nThe Procurement function encourages the maintenance of a watching brief on information relating to CSR (news, legislation, events, conferences, webinars,/uni00A0etc.) and the sharing of experience. Relevant CSR news is communicated in Sharepoint or by mail.\n\nThe Procurement Action Plan sets out the CSR undertakings as a strategic lever; this Plan has been distributed to the teams and forms part of the on-boarding documentation for new recruits. More than ever, CSR is a focus for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, which places sustainable development at the heart of its priorities and projects: the buyers seek suppliers who can help the Group make progress on this issue and contribute suggestions and innovative ideas. EcoVadis training is proposed and an EcoVadis kit for new buyers is also available.\n\n## Mobilizing and innovating with suppliers\n\nSupplier Relations Management (SRM) is based on building long-term relationships between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and its strategic suppliers. This SRM process enables issues like Corporate Social Responsibility to be central to discussions and to move forward together on these issues.\n\nThe Procurement function sees its suppliers as bona fide partners in mutually beneficial growth. In this capacity, it supports their quest for innovative solutions and analysis of the environmental impact of products. During the drafting of a product specification, the prescriber and buyer work together to identify the environmental and societal characteristics, thereby encouraging the supplier to not only develop the environmental performance of its products but also make a wider commitment to sustainability.\n\nKLM works with its suppliers on the recycling of plastic waste, transforming this waste into a material for 3D printing. KLM thus collects tons of plastic bottles on flights and then sorts and recycles them to obtain recycled plastic pellets. This recycled plastic is used, for example, to print tools for the maintenance of aircraft.\n\nFor its part, Air/uni00A0France has put in place measures to recycle and upcycle its waste, and minimize the utilization of single-use-plastic. The Procurement teams have made a significant contribution to the quest for new innovative partnerships.\n\n## Taking into account social and environmental priorities\n\nThe obligations of suppliers in terms of the environment and vocational health and safety are stipulated in the product or service specifications. To prevent the risks linked to joint-activity during interventions, the establishment of prevention plans is systematic. This approach is the subject of a General Occupational Health and Safety Procedure. Air/uni00A0France tracks the accident record for sub-contractors in the Company's annual social reporting.\n\nFurthermore, an environmental clause figures in Air/uni00A0France's catering contracts which includes measures to reduce the environmental footprint, such as the sorting and recycling of waste and the use of seasonal products.\n\n## Measures in favor of responsible catering\n\nOne of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's priorities is to develop an ever-more-eco-responsible onboard product. Air/uni00A0France is thus working on the development of responsible catering, in terms of both the food services and tableware used.\n\nFor instance, it favors locally-sourced products that are seasonal and sustainable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Furthermore, to guarantee passengers a balanced meal, since May/uni00A02021 all hot dishes served in Economy class have had an A or B Nutriscore.\n\nFor on-board tableware, multiple criteria are considered: weight of the articles, materials used, place of manufacturing, mode of transportation, management of the material's end of life. Environmental labels and certifications like FSC or PEFC are prioritized. The selection of new articles is made in cooperation with the suppliers to envisage products with the lowest-possible environmental impact from a long-term perspective.\n\nReducing single-use plastic is a major objective for Air/uni00A0France: the target is to eliminate 80% of this material by 2025. Many projects are underway to remove it or replace it with renewable materials. The implementation on board of certain plastic-free items was delayed during the year due to the decrease in activity. Indeed, in order to limit waste, Air/uni00A0France wants to run down its inventories before launching new items. During 2021, the collaboration between the Solar Impulse Foundation and Air/uni00A0France continued to find innovative ways to substitute plastics.\n\nWhenever feasible, to contribute to the overall objective of attaining the Sustainable Development Goals, KLM chooses products and partners that share its values. KLM's responsible catering policy mainly focuses on environmental preservation in production areas, Human Rights, working conditions and animal\n\nwelfare. The catering policy applies to all flights departing from Schiphol Airport and elsewhere in Europe and, where possible, responsible products are included in the catering products on board flights on departure from other countries. For KLM, it is important that the ingredients used in meals, such as fish, chocolate, palm oil and soy, are sourced responsibly. To this end, KLM is a member of the Responsible Soy (RTRS) and Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Round Table and o/ffers certified products on board its aircraft such as MSC and ASC-certified fish, 'better life' eggs, chicken and veal, and UTZ-certified co/ffee, tea and chocolate.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nThrough its 'Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Procurement' website, the Group maintains an ongoing dialogue with suppliers, informing them, amongst other things, of its policy and commitment to sustainable development. Right from the inception of the procurement process, suppliers thus become aware of these issues and are invited to sign the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nIn 2021, 52% of suppliers signed the Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nIn 2021, the total number of companies evaluated and actively assessed by EcoVadis or an equivalent body stood at 291. Suppliers considered are those with a score of 35 or higher over the last three years. As part of a continuous-improvement process, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM aims to evaluate 90/uni00A0additional suppliers in 2022.\n\n## 4.6.3/emspace Monitoring of Act No. 2017-399/uni00A0known as the Duty of Vigilance Law\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is subject to the obligations introduced by the Act of March/uni00A027, 2017 relating to the duty of vigilance for parent companies and ordering companies.\n\nSince 2018, in response to the regulatory requirements, the Group has implemented a vigilance plan in compliance with the legal provisions, it being understood that the Group already had processes in place enabling it to comply directly or indirectly with the requirements of the 2017 Act for Duty of Vigilance. In particular, having established verification processes in the areas required to be covered by the vigilance plan, the Group has ensured that it is in a position to benefit, as e/ffectively as possible, from the contributions of its various entities through a questionnaire to be completed by the entities of the Group. In 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also focused on its contracting partners - as requested by the Act - by updating the template of the questionnaire to be sent to suppliers (this process is still ongoing between Procurement (Center of Expertise) and the Compliance team).\n\n## Identification and regular risk evaluation procedures\n\nThe identification and evaluation of the various risks relating to the duty of vigilance are part of the overall risk management\n\nprocess established within the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. As a facilitator of risk management, Group Internal Audit regularly evaluates the risk management process and its conclusions are the subject of presentations to the Group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's overall sub-contracting management system applies to all risk areas. It is based on contract reviews, compliance monitoring and supervision acts such as audits, inspections and checks, carried out by the sub-contractors themselves where appropriate or with external providers (as part of the EcoVadis screening on social rights, environment and sustainable procurement).\n\nEvery year, the Group conducts a review of the non-financial risks generated by its activities. This analysis verifies the relevance and comprehensiveness of the measures and action plans aimed at the e/ffective prevention, control and mitigation of the non-financial risks deemed to be the most material.\n\nSee chapter/uni00A03 'Risks and risk management' and section/uni00A04.1.2 'Identification of the key priorities in building long-term relationships'.",

This undertaking is rea/ffirmed each year by the Group's top management.\n\nThe duty of vigilance is a multi-risk approach. The management of risks is at the heart of the steering of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's business activities, based on a rational of prevention and homogeneous management via  common methods and tools.\n\n## Human Rights and fundamental liberties\n\nIn 2019, the Social Rights and Ethics Charter was reviewed by a working group bringing together the relevant Group entities and the European Works Council, to develop its content and formalize of a set of principles fostering the respect of Human Rights. This new document, intended for both internal and external use, and entitled The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles, was published in 2020.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles a/ffirm the Group's commitment to fostering a climate of mutual trust and respect amongst sta/ff, and ensuring a safe working environment. The Group undertakes to apply the labor legislation of the European Union and its Member States and all national collective agreements, and to respect the exercise of trade union rights in all the relevant countries. The Group also undertakes to scrupulously respect Human Rights, oppose child and forced labor, apply laws and ask its service providers and suppliers to uphold these principles.\n\nIn view of its organization, the Group delegates to its subsidiaries the responsibility of respecting and promoting the content of these commitments locally, in the respect of the national provisions and legislation specific to each country.\n\nSee sections 4.2 'Human Resources' and 4.5.2 'Respect of Human Rights'.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the health and safety of both customers and sta/ff is an absolute priority.\n\nFlight Safety is paramount for the Group. It is key to retaining the trust of customers and imperative for the long-term viability of its operations. All the Group's activities are the subject of multiple checks and certifications, and comply with extremely strict norms and the highest standards in the industry.\n\nEach Group airline deploys a Safety Management System, which is integral to their business organizations, processes and corporate cultures.\n\nSee chapter/uni00A03 'Risks and risk management' and section/uni00A04.4 'Customer trust'.\n\nSafeguarding health and safety in the work place is a human priority to which the Group responds by preventing vocational risks and improving the quality of life in the workplace.\n\nSee section/uni00A04.2 'Human resources'.\n\nThe Group must guarantee its customers and flight crew safe catering services and, to this end, has implemented a Food Hygiene and Safety process to respond to the regulatory requirements linked to the preparation and supply of meals.\n\nSee section/uni00A04.4 'Customer trust'.\n\n## Environment\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Climate Action Plan embodies the Group's strategy and main priorities for reducing its impact on climate change. In November/uni00A02019, the Group unveiled its global strategy through to 2025, based on environmental sustainability.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France and KLM Environmental Management Systems (EMS) aim to prevent and mitigate the environmental impacts of their operations. These Environmental Management Systems have ISO/uni00A014001/uni00A0certification and internal and external audits enable the verification of their e/ffective deployment.\n\nIn 2019, the Group adopted the format recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) for the management of financial risks linked to climate change (TCFD concordance table, section/uni00A04.3.2).\n\nSee section/uni00A04.3 'Environment'.\n\n## Supply chain\n\nIn its relations with sub-contractors and suppliers, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM ensures that the fundamental social rights and principles, and environmental protection provisions, are properly respected everywhere in the world.\n\nA supplier selection process was implemented to respond to the duty of vigilance requirements. To this end, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Procurement function provides awareness training on these risks for its buyers.\n\nA risk-mapping process is in place with, for each segment and procurement domain, an evaluation of the environmental, social and ethical risks. Risks are also evaluated by country.\n\nFor all new contracts or contract renewals, the signature of the Code of Conduct or an equivalent commitment covering the four areas (environment, social, ethical and supply chain) is mandatory and is included in the contract's appendix.\n\nIn the segments most exposed to risks, suppliers are asked to submit an evaluation of their sustainability performance, carried out by a specialized organization or the equivalent. This evaluation must address four areas: environment, social, ethics, supply chain. The 'Supplier supply chain' section provides visibility for tier 2/uni00A0suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Independent in-situ audits may also be triggered.\n\nIndependently of the level of risk, all suppliers are encouraged to carry out evaluations of their CSR performance.\n\nIn 2021, at the Group's request, 291/uni00A0suppliers had their sustainability performance evaluated.\n\n## Listening to stakeholders and whistle blower mechanism\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM realized a new materiality analysis by questioning a representative panel of internal and external stakeholders. The comparison of these results with those of the analysis carried out in 2019 enabled confirmation of the relevance of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's strategic choices in the light of the issues deemed to be priorities for its activities and the expectations of its stakeholders.\n\nSeveral processes enable the Group to regularly evaluate the perception of its stakeholders and to understand the related risks. The Group also has a number of feedback channels in place enabling stakeholders (particularly employees, customers and local residents around airports) to communicate any complaints.\n\nSee section/uni00A04.1.2 'Identification of the key priorities in building long-term relationships'.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has updated the scope of its internal whistle-blower procedures to enable employees to report any situations arising within the scope of the Act of March/uni00A027, 2017 relating to the duty of vigilance of parent companies and ordering companies. For reporting under the Whistle-blower procedure see section/uni00A04.5.3 'Business ethics'.",

Our firm maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with applicable legal, regulatory and ethical requirements and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors relating to this engagement.\n\n## Means and resources\n\nOur work was carried out by a team of eight people between October/uni00A02021 and February/uni00A02022 and took a total of ten weeks.\n\nWe were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development and Corporate Social Responsibility. We conducted approximatively twelve interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement.\n\n## Nature and scope of our work\n\nWe planned and performed our work to address the areas where we identified that a material misstatement of the Information was likely to arise.\n\nWe believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgement, is sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion:\n\n- -  we obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities' activities and the description of the principal risks associated;\n- -  we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices, where appropriate;\n- -  we verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in Article L./uni00A0225/uni00A0102/uni00A01/uni00A0III as well as information regarding compliance with Human Rights and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation;\n- -  we verified that the Statement provides the information required under Article R./uni00A0225-105/uni00A0II of the French Commercial Code, where relevant with respect to the principal risks, and includes, where applicable, an explanation for the absence of the information required under Article L./uni00A0225-102-1/uni00A0III, paragraph 2/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code;\n- -  we verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of the principal risks associated with all the consolidated entities' activities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with their business relationships, their products or services, as well as their policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the principal risks;\n- -  we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:\n- -  assess the process used to identify and confirm the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented, and\n- -  corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important presented in the appendices. Concerning certain risks (2) , our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for the other risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities (3) ;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities (1) and covers between 29% and 100% of the consolidated data selected for these tests;\n- -  we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement performed in accordance with the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\n## Reasonable assurance report on a selection of non-financial information\n\n## Nature and scope of our work\n\nWith regard to the information selected by the entity presented in the appendices and identified by the symbol \u221a in the Statement, we conducted the same work as described in the paragraph 'Nature and scope of our work' above for the Information considered to be the most important, but in a more in-depth manner, in particular with regard to the number of tests.\n\nThe selected sample accounts for 93% of the information identified by the symbol \u221a .\n\nWe believe that our work is su/fficient to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion on the information selected by the entity and identified by the symbol \u221a .\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February/uni00A018 th /uni00A02022\n\n## KPMG S.A.\n\nFanny Houlliot Partner Sustainability Services\n\n\u00c9ric Dupr\u00e9 Partner",

The rise in the oil price was mitigated by hedging. The fuel bill before hedging increased by \u20ac1,046/uni00A0million, partially o/ffset by the \u20ac691/uni00A0million change in fuel hedge e/ffects;\n- -chartering costs : the costs incurred in leasing aircraft capacity from other airlines. Their increase in 2021 is explained by higher aircraft chartering;\n- -landing fees and en route charges : these costs are incurred for air navigation services and the use of airports;\n- -catering costs : these costs comprise the services supplied on board the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's own aircraft;\n- -handling charges and other operating costs: principally cover aircraft handling on the ground and the cost of passenger care for the Group and, to a lesser extent, third-party customers. The increase in these costs is mainly explained by the increase in capacity;\n- -aircraft maintenance costs : they include maintenance procurement and consumption for the Group's aircraft and for the third-party activity; their increase is linked to the increase in activity;\n- -commercial and distribution costs : these costs increased by less than capacity due to cost-saving measures;\n- -other external expenses principally comprise rental charges, telecommunications costs, insurance and fees.\n\nSalaries and related costs were up by 0.6 % to \u20ac5.34/uni00A0billion versus \u20ac5.31/uni00A0billion in 2020. The stabilization in these costs was mostly due to ongoing State allowances and restructuring, despite the capacity increase.\n\nTaxes other than income taxes stood at \u20ac116/uni00A0million in 2021 versus \u20ac137/uni00A0million in 2020, down by 15.3 %.\n\nOther current income and expenses stood at net income of \u20ac715/uni00A0million in 2021 versus net income of \u20ac640/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020. They included:\n\n- -  capitalized production amounting to \u20ac728/uni00A0million in 2021 versus \u20ac610/uni00A0million in 2020;\n- -  a result from joint-ventures of \u20ac8/uni00A0million in 2021 versus \u20ac(7) million in 2020;\n- -  \u20ac16/uni00A0million from currency hedges in 2021 versus \u20ac79/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020;\n- -  a \u20ac(36) million expense booked in respect of/uni00A0CO2 quotas versus \u20ac(32) million in the previous financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Proceeds on disposals of tangible and intangible assets amounted to \u20ac899/uni00A0million versus \u20ac204/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\nAfter taking into account net capital expenditure on tangible and intangible assets, operating free cash flow stood at \u20ac0.23/uni00A0billion (versus \u20ac(4.72) billion in 2020). After the reimbursement of lease debt, adjusted operating free cash flow was \u20ac(0.63) billion in 2021 (\u20ac(5.66) billion in 2020).\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2021, the Group had \u20ac7.70/uni00A0billion of net cash, of which \u20ac6.66/uni00A0billion in cash and cash equivalents.

The\n\ncapital employed for the year is obtained by taking the average of the capital employed on every quarterly balance sheet;\n\n- -  the adjusted result after tax corresponds to the sum of the operating result adjusted for dividends received and the share of profits/(losses) of associates.\n\n| (in \u20ac million)                                                                                             | December/uni00A031,  2021   | September/uni00A030,  2021 restated   | June/uni00A030,   2021 restated   | March/uni00A031,   2021 restated   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Goodwill and intangible assets                                                                             | 1,457                       | 1,456                                 | 1,464                             | 1,479                              |\n| Flight equipment                                                                                           | 10,466                      | 10,478                                | 10,645                            | 10,800                             |\n| Other property, plant and equipment                                                                        | 1,402                       | 1,418                                 | 1,453                             | 1,476                              |\n| Right-of-use assets                                                                                        | 5,148                       | 5,061                                 | 5,033                             | 4,795                              |\n| Investments in equity associates                                                                           | 109                         | 172                                   | 166                               | 223                                |\n| Other financial assets excluding shares available for sale,   marketable securities and financial deposits | 157                         | 147                                   | 147                               | 146                                |\n| Provisions excluding pension, cargo litigation and restructuring                                           | (4,173)                     | (4,180)                               | (4,033)                           | (4,083)                            |\n| WCR, excluding market value of derivatives                                                                 | (8,262)                     | (7,995)                               | (7,745)                           | (6,410)                            |\n| Capital employed                                                                                           | 6,304                       | 6,557                                 | 7,130                             | 8,426                              |\n| Average capital employed (A)                                                                               |                             | 7,104                                 |                                   |                                    |\n| Adjusted result from current operations                                                                    |                             | (1,626)                               |                                   |                                    |\n| Dividends received                                                                                         |                             | -                                     |                                   |                                    |\n| Share of profits/(losses) of associates                                                                    |                             | (27)                                  |                                   |                                    |\n| Normative income tax                                                                                       |                             | 462                                   |                                   |                                    |\n| Adjusted result from current operations after tax (B)                                                      |                             | (1,191)                               |                                   |                                    |\n| ROCE (B/A)                                                                                                 |                             | N/A                                   |                                   |                                    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5",

To analyze the company's overall cost performance, the Group uses the net cost per ASK. This net cost is obtained by dividing the total net cost\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nby the capacity produced expressed in available seat-kilometers (ASK). The net cost is calculated by subtracting the revenues other than those generated by the three transportation activities (passenger, cargo and Transavia) from total operating expenses.

The term 'Group' is represented by the economic definition of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and its subsidiaries. The Group is headquartered in France and is one of the largest airlines in the world.\n\nThe Group's core business is network activities which includes passenger transportation on scheduled flights and cargo activities. The Group's activities also include aeronautics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmaintenance, leisure passenger transportation (Transavia) and other air-transport-related activities.\n\nThe limited company Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, domiciled at 2, rue Robert Esnault-Pelterie, 75007/uni00A0Paris, France, is the parent company of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is listed for trading in Paris (Euronext) and Amsterdam (Euronext).\n\nThe presentation currency used in the Group's financial statements is the Euro, which is also Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's functional currency.\n\n## NOTE 2/emspace SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE\n\nClimate change is a major concern for the airline industry and for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group in particular. Attitudes towards the acceptability of air transportation growth are changing at both political level and in terms of wider society. Both France and the Netherlands have implemented policies to ensure the transition to a Net Zero Carbon society by 2050.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group intends to be a player in the transformation of its sector of activity, and aims to occupy a leading role and influence.\n\nPlaying an active role in advancing the goal of Net Zero emissions by 2050 as an industry, and committing to setting science-based targets in line with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) criteria and the Paris agreement, were crucial milestones in 2021 and a strong marker for the Group, reflecting people's changing perceptions of travel and calls for more responsible use of aviation. The Group's environmental e/fforts are summarized in a Climate Action Plan.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM assesses its extra-financial performance on a regular basis through the ratings of RobecoSAM, Ecovadis, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), Vigeo Eiris, MSCI Sustainalytics and\n\nISS-ESG. In 2021, for the seventeenth year running, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM figured in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI World and DJSI Europe) and, for the second consecutive year, the Ecovadis sustainability rating agency awarded Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group the Platinum Medal (highest recognition for the top 1% highest label) while CDP rated AFKL group with a score of C (awareness level) for the Climate Change rating questionnaire.\n\nFurthermore, to objectify its ESG performance and improve its strategy and practices, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM proactively requested an independent ESG rating from Standard and Poor's, becoming the first airline group to be evaluated through a requested ESG rating. In 2021, Standard & Poor's (S&P) Global Ratings thus assigned to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM an ESG rating of 64/100. With this rating, the Group is well positioned among the players in the airline industry with regard to the management of its significant exposure to environmental challenges. S&P underlined that the Group were well prepared to manage the ESG risks faced by airlines in the short and medium term.\n\nThe Group's financial statements integrate climate change and sustainability issues in various items as described below.\n\n## 2.1/emspace Valuation of assets and consideration of environmental risks\n\nThe impact of climate change in the short to medium term has been taken into account in the preparation of the Group's financial statements for the year ending December/uni00A031, 2021. However, the risks identified have not been considered material to the Group's operational continuity, given the operation of a balanced network between the di/fferent continents and the flexibility of the fleet to minimize the economic consequences of extreme weather events that may occur.\n\nThe impacts related to the expected or probable changes in the regulations (increase in carbon credit prices,/uni00A0CO2 compensation and development of sustainable aviation fuel - 'SAF') are included in the five-year plan and consequently in the tested recoverable value of assets (see Note/uni00A023 'Impairment').\n\nIn 2021, the Group's environmental objectives have not led to the recognition of any impairment or accelerated depreciation of assets.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2/emspace Sustainable  investments\n\n## 2.2.1/emspace Fleet  modernization\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is committed to reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to 2005. Currently, the most impactful way to reduce the carbon footprint is to invest in a more fuel-e/fficient fleet. The Group is focusing on simplifying and rationalizing its fleet to make it more competitive. The transformation of the Group is therefore continuing with the arrival of more modern, high-performance aircraft with a significantly lower environmental impact and a reduced noise footprint.\n\n## 2.2.2/emspace Ground  equipment\n\nIn order to reach the objective of carbon neutrality in ground operations by 2030, the Group is investing in fully electric ramp equipment (vehicles, pushbacks and loaders in particular). These sustainable investments represented \u20ac0,1/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac3/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nThe renewal of the Group's airline fleet resulted in capital expenditures on aircraft equipment amounting to \u20ac1,047/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac808/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020) (see Note/uni00A019 'Capital expenditures').\n\nPursuing its fleet renewal plan, the Group will continue to receive new generation aircraft over the next few years (see Note/uni00A040 'Flight equipment orders').\n\nThese investments are included in the indicators related to sustainable capital expenditures according to the European green taxonomy.\n\n## 2.3/emspace Greenhouse gas emission rights -/uni00A0CO 2 compensation\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2012, airlines have been subject to the ETS (Emission Trading Scheme) regulations for all flights to or from the European Economic Area, as described in Note/uni00A05.22. and the paragraphs 'Carbon credit risks' in Notes/uni00A039.1. and 39.2.4. As such, the Group must purchase/uni00A0CO2 allowances to o/ffset its emissions. The Group accounts for the/uni00A0CO2 quotas as intangible assets. These assets are non-depreciable.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the value of the/uni00A0CO2 quotas related to ETS program in the Group's balance sheet represented \u20ac74/uni00A0million (\u20ac21/uni00A0million euros as of December/uni00A031, 2020) (see Note/uni00A017 'Intangible assets'). To meet its obligation to surrender the rights corresponding to its emissions, the Group has booked a net expense of \u20ac36/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac32/uni00A0million\n\nas of December/uni00A031, 2020) corresponding to the best estimates of its emissions for the year 2021 (see Note/uni00A010 'Other current operating income and expenses'). Finally, the Group held/uni00A0CO2 quota hedging instruments for an amount of \u20ac143/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac31/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020) (see Note/uni00A030.6 'Derivatives instruments reserves').\n\nAdditionally, since January/uni00A01, 2020, Air/uni00A0France has compensated t h e /uni00A0C O 2 emissions of its customers on the French domestic routes. The purchase of credits representing the carbon compensation are accounted for as intangible assets, for an amount of \u20ac2/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (\u20ac2/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020) (see Note/uni00A017. Intangible assets).\n\n## 2.4/emspace Other expenses and commitments\n\nThe criteria taken into account for the calculation of long-term variable management compensation (see Note/uni00A042.1 'Transactions with the principal executives') include items linked with sustainability targets, especially a targeted level of sustainability measured by the DJSI index and the reduction of/uni00A0CO2 emissions.\n\nIn addition, KLM has committed to becoming more sustainable as part of the conditions associated with the direct loan granted by the Dutch State (see Note/uni00A033.3/uni00A0'Financial support from the French and Dutch States').",

The very stringent conditions on global travel adopted by many countries as of March/uni00A02020 resulted in a drastic reduction in air tra/ffic in 2020. In the first half of 2021, new measures have been put in place by the French and Dutch governments to slow the spread of the virus and travel restrictions have been tightened globally following the emergence of new variants of the virus, again limiting air tra/ffic.\n\nHowever, the second half of 2021 was marked by a recovery in tra/ffic over the summer and, in particular, during the Christmas holiday period, thanks to the gradual reopening of borders. Capacity in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 stood at a respective 66% and 72% relative to its level in the third and fourth quarters of 2019.\n\nThe strong measures taken by the Group to mitigate the e/ffect of Covid-19 on its business since the beginning of the pandemic are continuing. These actions include, amongst others, adapting capacity to the demand trends, structural changes to the fleet, cash preservation and salary measures.\n\nThe Group continues to closely monitor and evaluate the situation.\n\n## Reduction in capacity and costs\n\nAvailable seat-kilometers for the Passenger network and Transavia were 62% higher in the second half of 2021 compared to the second half of 2020, in response to the easing of travel restrictions in a number of countries. Tra/ffic in terms of passenger-kilometers jumped by 155% in the second half of the year compared to 2020 driven by a dynamic recovery in demand. For the full year, capacity thus increased by 30% compared to its 2020 level, while tra/ffic rose by 28%. The cargo business continued to benefit from a buoyant environment with available ton-kilometers up 13% compared to 2020 and a positive yield trend. As a result, total revenues increased by 29% compared to last year and amounted to \u20ac14,315/uni00A0million.\n\nIn parallel, specific cost initiatives, in particular sta/ff reduction and salary measures, enabled the Group to control external costs despite the significant increases in capacity. Since the beginning of the year, external expenses amounted to \u20ac8,829/uni00A0million, an increase of 11% compared to 2020, comfortably below the capacity increase.",

        "page_content": "Within external expenses, fuel costs amounted \u20ac2,748/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 against \u20ac2,392/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020, an increase of 15% due to the increase in capacity and the higher fuel price.\n\nIn addition, the continuation of the partial activity mechanisms in France, implemented from March/uni00A023, 2020, the 'Temporary Emergency Bridging Measures for Sustained Employment' (NOW) program in the Netherlands, applicable from March/uni00A01, 2020, as well as the implementation of restructuring plans and the reduction in the workforce (see Note/uni00A02.2. 'Significant events occurring during the period' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020) continued to contribute to limiting salaries and related costs. The total salaries and related costs amounts to \u20ac(5,340) million as of December/uni00A031, 2021 compared to \u20ac(5,306) million as of December/uni00A031, 2020 and \u20ac(8,139) million as of December/uni00A031, 2019 before Covid.\n\n## Liquidity position\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the Group's total liquidity amounted to \u20ac10.16/uni00A0billion, of which \u20ac7.7/uni00A0billion in net cash excluding undrawn credit lines (see Note 35 'Net debt') and \u20ac2.46/uni00A0billion in undrawn credit lines (see Note/uni00A033.3/uni00A0'Financial support from the French and Dutch States' and 33.7/uni00A0'Credit lines').\n\nIn April/uni00A02021 and July/uni00A02021 respectively, the Group's liquidity position was strengthened by \u20ac1/uni00A0billion via a capital increase by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and by \u20ac800/uni00A0million raised via a bond issue (see Note/uni00A04.2. 'Significant events occurring during the period').\n\nThe Group reimbursed \u20ac500/uni00A0million of the loan guaranteed by the French State on December/uni00A010, 2021 and negotiated an amendment to the repayment profile with the final maturity extended from May/uni00A06, 2023 to May/uni00A06, 2025 (see Note/uni00A033.3/uni00A0'Financial support from the French and Dutch States').\n\nIn addition, the Group is continuing the measures initiated in 2020 to defer non-core capital expenditure and internal projects and to spread the payment of payroll tax and social security contributions.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn determining the appropriate basis for preparing the financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021, the Board of Directors considered the Group going concern by evaluating the financial forecasts over a time horizon of at least one year and by analyzing, in particular, the trading position of the Group within the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic and taking into account the following elements.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Group had total cash at hand of \u20ac10.16/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2021 (see the 'Liquidity position' paragraph).\n\nThe deployment of vaccines is allowing for the gradual lifting of tra/ffic restrictions, including the reopening of the US border to Europeans on November/uni00A08, 2021. Despite the rapid spread of the Omicron variant at the end of the year, tra/ffic in the last quarter of 2021 was maintained at budgeted capacity of 74%, EBITDA in the last quarter of 2021 stood at almost the same level as in the last quarter of 2019 and operating income was higher than in 2019.\n\nThe activity forecast for the first quarter of 2022 is 73% to 78% of the first quarter of 2019.\n\nIn addition, the Group is carrying out an ambitious transformation plan which has already generated savings by the end of 2021. These savings have already enabled the company to return to its 2019 unit cost level by the fourth quarter of 2021, despite having less capacity. The progress of the transformation plan is an essential asset for achieving the operating profit targets for 2022.\n\nCombined with the capital increase, the \u20ac800/uni00A0million bond issue and the EMTN program available for the Group (see Note/uni00A04.2 'Significant events occurring during the period'), the cash flow projections over an horizon of more than 12/uni00A0months ensure a level of liquidity considered to be su/fficient.\n\nThe assumptions take notably into account:\n\n- -  the adjustment of the flight schedule and capacity to the expected demand in order to operate only flights having a positive incremental impact in terms of operating cash flow;\n- -  the continued specific mechanisms from the French and Dutch governments to partially cover sta/ff costs through the Long-Term Partial Activity ('APLD') in France until the end of 2022 for Air/uni00A0France and the 'NOW' program in the Netherlands for the first quarter of 2022;\n- -  a deferral of the payment of social contributions and taxes on salaries over a period of 4/uni00A0to 5/uni00A0years;\n- -  a high level of variable costs linked to a reduction in capacity;\n- -  the limitation of non-aeronautical investments;\n- -  the systematic refinancing of new aircrafts delivered during the period.\n\nBased on these financial forecasts, the banking covenants applicable in 2022, including the \u20ac2.46/uni00A0billion Revolving Credit Facility at the level of KLM (see Note/uni00A033.3/uni00A0'Financial support from the French and Dutch governments'), are met. Concerning the non-financial commitment as included in the Framework Agreement related to the State Aid between the Dutch State, KLM and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the Dutch State agent assessed that KLM does not comply with a non-financial indicator, regarding termination of facilitation of possible tax avoidance by employees. KLM is currently discussing this topic with the Dutch State agent to arrive at an acceptable solution.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is also working on various additional options to restore Air/uni00A0France's equity to the legally required level.\n\nIn addition, at the end of October/uni00A02021, an 'ESG rating' ('Environmental Social and Governance') was secured to provide access to sustainable financing (see Note/uni00A02/uni00A0'Sustainable development and climate').\n\nThe Group is actively managing its debt profile. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM repaid \u20ac500/uni00A0million of the guaranteed loan from the French State on December/uni00A010, 2021 and negotiated an amendment to the repayment profile extending the final maturity from May/uni00A06, 2023 to May/uni00A06, 2025 (see Note/uni00A033.3/uni00A0'Financial support from the French and Dutch States').\n\nIn this context of the fifth wave of the Covid-19 crisis and the spread of the Omicron variant, the Board of Directors also considered three scenarios for the year 2022 with recovery paths deferred for up to one year. Even the most degraded and highly unlikely scenario does not call into question the going concern assumption.\n\nThe Group is likely to face various uncertainties on its financial trajectory, in particular the pace of recovery of activity and the\n\nlifting of restrictions notably in Asia, the potentially negative evolution of certain behaviors relating to air transport, the possible impact of an imposed restriction on airport slots especially in Schipol, the lack of available financing, notably alternative financing for the fleet renewal, the increase in the fuel price, and the ability to Pass on in the ticket prices the potentially increasing costs linked notably to airport taxes, fuel and the carbon transition. In addition, the Air/uni00A0France company has a legal obligation to restore its equity by December/uni00A031, 2023.\n\nWere this scenario to materialize, the Management may implement additional mitigating actions:\n\n- -  further optimization and reduction of the network and capacity;\n- -  asset disposals;\n- -  further sta/ff restructuring;\n- -  other cost-saving measures; and\n- -  deferral of capital expenditure and charges.\n\nAccordingly, having reviewed the cash position and the financial forecasts, and taking into account the uncertainties described above, the committed financing facilities and possible mitigating actions, the Board of Directors considers it appropriate to prepare the yearly-consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis without retaining the concept of 'significant uncertainty' introduced in December/uni00A02020.\n\n## 4.2/emspace Significant events occurring during the period\n\n## Long-Term Partial Activity agreement\n\nIn the first half of 2021, Air/uni00A0France and some of its subsidiaries finalized the signature of all the agreements with the representative trade unions allowing the use of the Long Term Partial activity (LTPA) for a maximum period of 24/uni00A0months.\n\n## Approval of Hop! departure plan\n\nAs part of its restructuring, HOP! has launched a departure plan ('PDV-PSE') (see Note/uni00A02.2/uni00A0'Significant events occurring during the period' in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020). On February/uni00A016, 2021, HOP! received a request from the French Labor Ministry (DREETS, formerly DIRECCTE) to amend some measures of the plan concerning flight crew. The amended departure plan was finally approved on June/uni00A016, 2021. An additional allocation of \u20ac28/uni00A0million was made to this provision for the financial year ending December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n## Measures to strengthen the capital and liquidity of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group\n\nOn April/uni00A06, 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group announced a plan of measures concerning Air/uni00A0France, which was approved by the European Commission in its decision to authorize the \u20ac4/uni00A0billion transaction by the French State to recapitalize Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. Subsequent to this authorization, the following transactions were carried out:\n\n## \u20ac1,036/uni00A0million capital increase\n\nOn April/uni00A019, 2021, the Group realized a capital increase without shareholders' preferential subscription rights, by way of a public o/ffering and with a priority subscription period on an irreducible and reducible basis granted to existing shareholders, for an amount of \u20ac1,036/uni00A0million, or \u20ac1,024/uni00A0million net of issuance fees. This operation improves the Group's shareholders' equity, and brings the same amount of new money to the Group for the benefit of Air/uni00A0France.\n\nThe capital increase resulted in the issuance of 213,999,999/uni00A0new shares (the 'New Shares') at a price per share of \u20ac4.84, representing approximately 50% of the Company's existing share capital. Following the completion of the capital increase, the Company's share capital increased to \u20ac642,634,034/uni00A0divided into 642,634,034/uni00A0shares, each with a nominal value of \u20ac1.\n\nAs per their subscription commitments, and given the allotment scale of the reducible orders, the French State and China Eastern Airlines subscribed within the context of the priority period to respectively 122,560,251/uni00A0New Shares (i.e. 57% of the total amount of the Capital Increase) and 23,944,689/uni00A0New Shares (i.e. 11% of the total amount of the Capital Increase). The Dutch State did not subscribe to this capital increase. Neither did Delta Airlines due to the current framework of the CARES Act in force in the United States at the time of the operation.",

        "page_content": "## Conversion of the fully drawn \u20ac3/uni00A0billion French State loan into perpetual hybrid bond instruments ('Super Subordinated Notes')\n\nOn April/uni00A020, 2021, the \u20ac3/uni00A0billion direct loan granted by the French State to Air/uni00A0France via Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in late May/uni00A02020 was converted into Super-Subordinated Notes in the same nominal amount, improving the Group's equity by \u20ac3/uni00A0billion with no cash impact, while increasing the flexibility of the Group's debt redemption profile. This issue is composed of three tranches with perpetual maturities and each in a nominal amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, respectively bearing a coupon of 7%, 7,25% and 7,5%, and with first redemption options (call) at 4, 5 and 6/uni00A0years respectively.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of IAS/uni00A032 - Financial instruments, as the redemption of perpetual bonds and the payment of coupons are only at the sole initiative of the Group, these issuances have been accounted for in Equity.\n\n## Reimbursement of \u20ac500/uni00A0million of the loan guaranteed by the French State and extension of the maturity of the outstanding capital\n\nIn addition, on December/uni00A010, 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group repaid \u20ac500/uni00A0million of the state guaranteed loan and negotiated an amendment to the repayment profile extending the final maturity date from May/uni00A06, 2023 to May/uni00A06, 2025, as follows:\n\n- -  May 2023: partial repayment of \u20ac800/uni00A0million, leaving \u20ac2.7/uni00A0billion outstanding,\n- -  May 2024: partial repayment of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion, leaving \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion outstanding,\n- -  May 2025: final repayment of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion, (there will be no outstanding balance after this date).\n\nThe remaining amount outstanding is therefore \u20ac3.5/uni00A0billion as of December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nThese factors make it possible to smooth the debt repayment profile of the Group, with a gradual extension of the maturity profile.\n\nThe Dutch State also approved this package and has indicated that it is continuing discussions with the European Commission on possible capital-strengthening measures for KLM.\n\n## \u20ac800/uni00A0million bond issue\n\nOn June/uni00A024, 2021, the Group announced the successful realization of a senior bond issue for a total of \u20ac800/uni00A0million in two tranches:\n\n- -  a first tranche of bonds for \u20ac300/uni00A0million, with a maturity of 3/uni00A0years and a coupon of 3% per year.\n- -  a second tranche of bonds for \u20ac500/uni00A0million, with a maturity of 5/uni00A0years and a coupon of 3.875% per year.\n\nSettlement and delivery of the bonds took place on July/uni00A01, 2021. The debt has been accounted for in the balance sheet as of that date under 'non-current financial liabilities'.\n\n## Launch of an EMTN ('European Medium-Term Note') program\n\nOn July/uni00A08, 2021, the Group launched an EMTN program with an initial term of 12/uni00A0months to maximize the use of potential market windows for bond issuance.\n\n## Sale of Servair shares\n\nIn early 2021, the terms under which Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM could sell a 30% shareholding in Servair to Gategroup (see Note/uni00A038.2 'Commitments received', in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2020) were re-negotiated. This resulted in the sale by Air/uni00A0France Finance, on May/uni00A031, 2021, of 15% of Servair for \u20ac71/uni00A0million. A second payment in respect of a further 15% shareholding should be received in December/uni00A02022.\n\nThis sale led to the recognition of a disposal gain of \u20ac26/uni00A0million in 'Other non-current income and expenses' in the consolidated income statement. The proceeds from the sale are included in the line 'Income from loss of control of subsidiaries or disposal of shares in non-controlled companies' in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Agreement on the KLM Ground Sta/ff pension plan\n\nOn June/uni00A014, 2021, KLM and the five Dutch Ground Sta/ff unions signed an agreement enabling a change in the Ground Sta/ff pension plan e/ffective from January/uni00A02021. As provided for by this agreement, the KLM Ground Sta/ff pension fund now qualifies as a defined contribution plan under IFRS rules. The pension assets, based on the actuarial assumptions as of May/uni00A031, 2021, amounted to \u20ac875/uni00A0million (before tax). Under this agreement, KLM has paid an additional pension premium covering the period January-May/uni00A02021, as well as a one-o/ff contribution representing the savings realized since 2014 following changes in the Dutch law. These contributions amount to \u20ac63/uni00A0million.\n\nThe total impact of the de-recognition of the pension assets together with the additional contributions has been booked in 'Other non-current income and expenses' in the amount of \u20ac938/uni00A0million (\u20ac704/uni00A0million net of tax).\n\n## Additional restructuring plan at KLM\n\nAn additional restructuring plan had been announced on January/uni00A021, 2021 for between 800 and 1,000/uni00A0employees. Following agreements signed with the KLM unions to avoid additional departures and the expected scale-up of activity, KLM decided to withdraw this additional restructuring plan.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has, however, determined that the financial information for the periods presented would not di/ffer substantially if the Group had applied IFRS as published by the IASB.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on February/uni00A016, 2022.\n\n## Change in accounting principles\n\n## IFRS standards which are applicable on a mandatory basis to the 2021 financial statements\n\nAmendments to IFRS/uni00A09 'Financial instruments', IAS/uni00A039 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement', IFRS/uni00A07 'Financial instruments: Disclosures' and IFRS/uni00A016 'Leases'\n\nFrom January/uni00A01, 2021, the Group has applied the amendments to IFRS/uni00A09, IFRS/uni00A07 and IFRS/uni00A016 in connection with 'Phase 2' of the interest rate benchmark. These amendments stipulate in particular the accounting treatment to be applied when an old benchmark interest rate is replaced by a new benchmark in a given contract, as well as the impact of this change on hedging relationships a/ffected by the IBOR reform. The Group has little exposure to the indices a/ffected by the reform. The application of these amendments has no impact on the Group's financial statements as of December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nWith the disappearance of the EUR LIBOR rates at the end of 2021, during the year the Group amended the financing contracts (aircraft debt) indexed on this reference and restructured the related interest rate derivatives to re-index them on Euribor.\n\nWith regard to the disappearance of the USD LIBOR rates, scheduled for June/uni00A02023, the Group does not anticipate any particular risk relating to the transition to the new reference index and which will concern its debt and derivative contracts.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS/uni00A016 'Leases'\n\nThis amendment extends the simplification whereby lessees can account for lease relief related to the Covid-19 pandemic as if it were not a contract amendment. This is tantamount to recognizing the impact of the rent relief in the profit or loss for the period and to not smoothing it over the remaining term of the contract. The application of this amendment has no significant impact on the Group's financial statements at December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\n## IFRS IC decision on IAS/uni00A019 'Employee Benefits'\n\nThis IFRS IC decision deals with the methods for allocating over time the expense related to defined benefit plans that meet the following three conditions:\n\n- -  the definitive acquisition of the benefits is conditional on presence in the company at the time of retirement;\n- -  the amount of the benefits depends on the length of service;\n- -  the amount of the benefits is capped at a number of consecutive years of service in the company.\n\nFor these schemes, the rights must be spread in a linear manner, no longer over the entire career of the employee in the company, but, for individual employee, over the last years of his or her career giving rise to the acquisition of new rights.\n\nThe application of this IFRS IC decision is accounted for as a change in accounting policy with application from the opening date of the first comparative period presented in the first-time adoption financial statements, i.e. from 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02020 (see Note/uni00A031/uni00A0'Retirement benefits').\n\n## IFRS IC decision on 'Configuration or customization costs in a SaaS arrangement' (Software as a Service)\n\nThis IFRS IC decision aims to clarify whether an intangible asset should be recognized in accordance with IAS/uni00A038 in respect of these software configuration and customization costs. If this is not the case, the IFRS IC decision indicates the other accounting principles that should be applied to account for these costs.\n\nCloud migration projects are underway within the Group. As at December/uni00A031, 2021, no applications have been migrated to the cloud.\n\nThe application of this IFRS IC decision in the Group's financial statements as at December/uni00A031, 2021 has no impact on the Group's financial statements as at December/uni00A031, 2021.",

The companies over which the Group exercises control are fully consolidated. An entity is controlled when the Group has power over it, is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement in this entity, and has the ability to use its power to influence the amounts of these returns. The determination of control takes into account the existence of potential voting rights if they are substantive, meaning they can be exercised in time when decisions about the relevant activities of the entity need to be taken.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control begins until the date this control ceases.\n\nNon-controlling interests are presented within equity and on the income statement separately from Group stockholders' equity and the Group's net income, under the line 'non-controlling interests'.\n\nThe e/ffects of a buyout of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary already controlled by the Group and divestment of a percentage interest without loss of control are recognized in equity.\n\nIn a partial disposal resulting in loss of control, the retained equity interest is re-measured at fair value at the date of loss of control. The gain or loss on the disposal will include the e/ffect of this re-measurement and the gain or loss on the sale of the equity interest, including all the items initially recognized in equity and reclassified to profit and loss.\n\n## Interest in associates and joint ventures\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A011 'Joint Arrangements', the Group applies the equity method to partnerships over which it exercises control jointly with one or more partners (joint-venture). Control is considered to be joint when decisions about the relevant activities of the partnership require the unanimous consent of the Group and the other parties with whom control is shared.\n\nThese accounting estimates are based on the most-recently available, reliable information.\n\nThe actual results could di/ffer from these estimates depending on changes in the assumptions used or di/fferent conditions.\n\nIn cases of a joint activity (joint operation), the Group recognizes assets and liabilities in proportion to its rights and obligations regarding the entity.\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A028 'Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures', companies in which the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence over financial and operating policy decisions are also accounted for using the equity method. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds more than 20% of the voting rights.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Group's share in the net result of associates and joint ventures from the date the ability to exercise significant influence begins until the date it ceases, adjusted for any impairment loss.\n\nThe Group's share of losses of an associate exceeding the value of the Group's interest and net investment (long-term receivables for which no reimbursement is scheduled or likely) in this entity are not accounted for, unless the Group has:\n\n- -  incurred contractual obligations to recover losses, or\n- -  made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\nAny surplus in investment cost over the Group's share in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate company on the date of acquisition is accounted for as goodwill and included in the book value of the investment accounted for using the equity method.\n\nInvestments in which the Group has ceased to exercise significant influence or joint control are no longer accounted for by the equity method and are accounted at their fair value as other financial assets on the date of loss of significant influence or joint control.\n\n## Intra-Group operations\n\nAll intra-Group balances and transactions, including income, expenses and dividends, are fully eliminated. Profits and losses resulting from intra-Group transactions are also eliminated.\n\nGains and losses realized on internal sales with associates and jointly-controlled entities are eliminated, to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity, providing there is no impairment.",

In accordance with this standard, for a first consolidation, all assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. The time period for adjustments to goodwill/negative goodwill is limited to 12/uni00A0months from the date of acquisition (except for non-current assets classified as assets held for sale which are measured at fair value less costs to sell).\n\nGoodwill corresponding, at the acquisition date, to the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree minus the net amounts (usually at fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The previously held equity interest in the acquiree at fair value at the date of acquisition is also revalued and any gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nCosts other than those related to the issuance of debt or equity securities are recognized immediately as an expense when incurred.\n\nFor individual acquisitions, the Group has the option of using the 'full' goodwill method, where goodwill is calculated by taking into account the fair value of non-controlling interests at the\n\n## Translation of foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate in e/ffect at the closing date.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies assessed on an historical cost basis are translated using the rate in e/ffect at the transaction date or the hedging rate, when applicable.\n\nThe corresponding exchange rate di/fferences are recorded in the income statement.

In all other cases, they are recognized in liabilities related to business combinations. Contingent payments or earn-outs are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. This initial measurement is subsequently adjusted through goodwill only when additional information is obtained after the acquisition date about facts and circumstances existing on that date. Such adjustments are made only during the 12-month measurement period that follows the acquisition date and insofar as the initial measurement had still been presented as provisional. Any other subsequent adjustments which do not meet these criteria are recorded as receivables or payables through the income statement.\n\nIn a step acquisition, the previously-held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured at its acquisition-date fair value. The di/fference between the fair value and the net book value must be accounted in profit or loss as well as elements previously recognized in other comprehensive income.",

        "page_content": "## 5.6/emspace Sales\n\n## Passenger and freight transportation\n\nSales related to air transportation operations, which consist of passenger and freight transportation, are recognized as revenue when the transportation service is provided, net of any discounts granted. The transportation service is also the trigger for the recognition as external expenses of the commissions paid to agents (e.g. credit card companies and travel agencies) and the booking fees.\n\nBoth passenger tickets and freight airway bills are consequently recorded as 'Deferred revenue upon issuance date'. The recognition of the revenue known as 'ticket breakage' is deferred until the transportation date initially foreseen. This revenue is calculated by applying statistical rates on tickets issued and unused. These rates are regularly updated and adjusted for non-recurring and specific events that may have an impact on passengers' behaviour.\n\nThe Group applies the exemption provided by IFRS/uni00A015/uni00A0which allows the balance of the outstanding transactions to remain unspecified as well as their planned recognition date for the performance obligations related to contracts with an initial term set at one year or less. If the tickets are not used, the performance obligations related to passenger and freight transportation e/ffectively expire within one year.\n\nPursuant to the European Union's Regulation EC 261, the Group compensates passengers in the event of denied boarding and for flight cancellations or long delays. This compensation is booked as contra revenue. The Group recognizes a corresponding amount in liabilities for future refunds to passengers. The determination of this liability for future refunds relies on a statistical approach.\n\nPassenger ticket taxes calculated on ticket sales are collected by the Group to be paid to the airport authorities. Therefore, they do not correspond to revenue. Taxes are recorded as a liability until such time as they are paid to the relevant airport authority as a function of the chargeability conditions (on ticket issuance or transportation).\n\nThe Group considers that the company that issues the airway bill acts as principal since the latter has control over the achievement of the performance obligation. When the Group issues freight airway bills for its goods carried by another carrier (airline company or road carrier), the Group acts as principal. Therefore, at the time of transportation the Group recognizes as revenue the amount invoiced to the customer in its entirety as well as the chartering costs invoiced by the other carrier for the service provision.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThe main types of contracts with customers identified within the Group are mainly:\n\n## Sales of maintenance and support contracts - Power by the hour contracts\n\nSome maintenance and support contracts cover the airworthiness of engines, equipment or airframes, an airframe being an aircraft without engines and equipment. The invoicing of these contracts is based on the number of flight hours or landings of the goods concerned by these contracts.\n\nThe di/fferent services included within each of these contracts consist of a unique performance obligation due to the existing interdependence between the services within the execution of these contracts.\n\nRevenue from maintenance and support services is recognized progressively. Revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis, based on the costs incurred, if they can be reliably measured, plus the expected margin.\n\nAs there is a continuous transfer of the control of these services, the revenue from these contracts is recognized as the costs are incurred. As long as the margin on the contract cannot be measured in a reliable manner, the revenue will only be recognized at the level of the costs incurred.\n\nForecast margins on the contracts are assessed through the forecast future cash flows that take into account the obligations and factors inherent to the contracts as well as other internal parameters to the contract selected using historical and/or forecast data.\n\nThese forecast margins are regularly reviewed. If necessary, provisions are recorded as soon as any losses on completion of contracts are identified.\n\nAmounts invoiced to customers, and therefore mostly collected, which are not yet recognized as revenue, are recorded as liabilities on contracts (deferred revenue) at the accounting year end. Inversely, any revenue that has been recognized but not yet invoiced is recorded under assets on the balance sheet at the accounting year end.\n\n## Sales of spare parts repair and labor - Time & Material contracts\n\nThese services which relate to engines, equipment or airframes, an airframe being an aircraft without engines and equipment, are generally short term.\n\nThey consist of a unique performance obligation. The revenue is recognized as costs are incurred.",

This program enables members to acquire Miles as they fly with Air/uni00A0France, KLM and airline partners and from transactions with non-airline partners (credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies). These Miles entitle members to a range of benefits such as free flights with Air/uni00A0France, KLM and their airline partners or other free services with non-airline partners.\n\nMiles are considered as separate elements of a sale of a ticket with multiple elements and one part of the price of the initial sale of the ticket is allocated to these Miles and deferred until the Group's commitments relating to these Miles have been met.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe deferred amount due in relation to the acquisition of Miles by members is estimated:\n\n- -  according to the fair value of the Miles, defined as the amount for which the benefits could be sold separately;\n- -  after taking into account the redemption rate, corresponding to the probability that the Miles will be used by members, using a statistical method.\n\nWith regard to the re-invoicing of Miles between the partners in the program, the margins realized on sales of these Miles are recorded immediately in the income statement.\n\n## 5.8/emspace Distinction between income from current operations and income from operating activities\n\nThe Group considers it relevant to the understanding of its financial performance to present in the income statement a subtotal within the 'income from operating activities'. This subtotal, entitled 'Income from current operations', excludes unusual elements that do not have predictive value due to their nature, frequency and/or materiality, as defined in recommendation No. 2020-01/uni00A0from the France's accounting standards authority.\n\nSuch elements are as follows:\n\n- -  sales of aircraft equipment and significant disposals of other assets;\n- -  accelerated aircraft phase-out;\n- -  income from the disposal of subsidiaries and a/ffiliates;\n- -  restructuring costs when they are significant;\n- -  modification of pension plans;\n- -  significant and infrequent elements such as the recognition of badwill in the income statement, the recording of an impairment loss on goodwill and significant provisions for litigation.\n\n## 5.9/emspace Aggregates used within the framework of financial communication\n\nEBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization): by excluding the main line of the income statement which does not involve cash disbursement ('Amortization, depreciation and provision') from income from current operations, EBITDA provides a simple indicator of the cash generated by the Group's current operational activities. It is thus commonly used for the calculation of the financial coverage and enterprise value ratios (see 'Consolidated income statement').\n\nOperating free cash flow : this corresponds to the net cash flow from operating activities net of the purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, plus the proceeds on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. It does not include the other cash flows linked to investment operations, particularly investments in subsidiaries and other financial assets and net cash flow from the operating activities of discontinued operations (see 43.2 'Operating free cash flow').\n\nOperating free cash flow adjusted : this corresponds to operating free cash flow net of the payment of lease debts (see Note 43.2 'Operating free cash flow').",

The average number of shares outstanding does not include treasury shares.\n\nDiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to the equity holders of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, adjusted for the effects of dilutive instrument exercise, by the average number of shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the e/ffect of all potentially-dilutive ordinary shares.\n\n## 5.11/emspace Financial  instruments\n\n## Valuation of trade receivables and non-current financial assets\n\nTrade receivables, loans and other non-current financial assets are considered to be assets issued by the Group and are initially recorded at fair value. They are subsequently valued using the amortized cost method. In addition, they are written o/ff based on the expected loss.\n\nRegarding the impairment of trade receivables, the Group has chosen the simplified method approach in that the automated customer invoicing and settlement processes for the Network business significantly limit the credit risk. The Group also uses credit insurance to reduce the risk of potential default regarding trade receivables concerning the clients of the Maintenance activity.\n\nThe Group considers that the change in credit risk on the non-current financial assets since their initial recognition is limited due to the current selection criteria (e.g. type of instrument, counterparty rating, maturity). The impairment recorded by the Group consists of the expect credit loss over the 12/uni00A0months following the closing date.\n\nPurchases and sales of financial assets are booked as of the transaction date.\n\n## Investments in equity instruments\n\nInvestments in equity securities qualifying as equity instruments are recorded at fair value in the Group's balance sheet. For publicly-traded securities, the fair value is considered to be the market price at the closing date. For non-quoted securities, the valuation is made on the basis of the financial statements of the entity.\n\nThe valuation of equity instruments is either in fair value through the income statement or in fair value through other comprehensive income:\n\n- -  when the instrument is deemed to be a cash investment, i.e. it is held for the purposes of monetary transactions, its revaluations are recorded in 'Other financial income and expenses';\n- -  when the instrument is deemed to be a business investment, i.e. it is held for strategic reasons (as it mainly consists of investments in companies whose activity is very close to that of the Group), its revaluations are recorded in 'Other comprehensive income' non-recyclable. Dividends are recorded in the income statement.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group uses various derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to the risks incurred on shares, exchange rates, changes in interest rates or fuel prices and the ETS (Emission Trading Scheme).\n\nForward currency contracts and options are used to hedge exposure to exchange rates.\n\nThe Group also uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Most of the swaps traded convert floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt.\n\nThe exposure to fuel risk is hedged by swaps or options on jet fuel, diesel or Brent.\n\nFinally, the risk related to the ETS is hedged by forwards.\n\nMost of these derivatives are classified as hedging instruments if the derivative is eligible as a hedging instrument and if the hedging relationships are documented as required by IFRS/uni00A09 'Financial Instruments'.\n\nThese derivative instruments are recorded on the Group's consolidated balance sheet at their fair value adjusted for the market value of the Group's credit risk (DVA) and the credit risk of the counterparty (CVA). The calculation of the credit risk follows a common model based on default probabilities from CDS counterparties. The method of accounting for changes in fair value depends on the classification of the derivative instruments.\n\nThere are three classifications:\n\n## Derivatives classified as fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative are recorded through the income statement and o/ffset within the limit of its e/ffective portion against the changes in the fair value of the underlying item (asset, liability or firm commitment), which are also recognized through the income statement.\n\n## Derivatives classified as cash flow hedge\n\nThe changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income for the effective portion and are reclassified as income when the hedged element a/ffects earnings. The ine/ffective portion is recorded as financial income or losses until the termination of the derivative. When the termination occurs, the residual ine/ffective portion is recycled on the hedged item.",

        "page_content": "## Derivatives classified as trading\n\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as financial income or losses.\n\nFor options, only the intrinsic risk can be hedged. The time value is excluded as it is considered as a cost of hedging. The change in fair value of the option time value is recognized in other comprehensive income in so far as it relates to the hedged item. When the latter occurs (if the hedged item is transaction related), the change in fair value is then recycled and impacts the hedged item or is amortized over the hedging period (if the hedged item is time-related).\n\nThe di/fference in time value between non-aligned structured options and the related 'vanilla' ('aligned') options is recognized in the profit and loss account.\n\nRegarding forward contracts, only the spot component is considered as a hedging instrument, since the forward element is considered as a hedging cost and accounted for similarly to the option time value.\n\nThe currency swap basis spread is also excluded from the hedging instrument and considered to be a hedging cost.\n\n## Convertible bonds\n\nConvertible bonds are deemed to be financial instruments comprising two components: a bond component recorded as debt and a stock component recorded in equity. The bond component is equal to the discounted value of all the coupons due on the bond at the rate of a simple bond that would have been issued at the same time as the convertible bond. The value of the stock component recorded in the Group's equity is calculated by the di/fference between this value and the bond's nominal value at issuance.\n\nThe di/fference between the financial expense recorded and the amounts e/ffectively paid out is added, at each closing date, to the amount of the debt component so that, at maturity, the amount to be repaid if there is no conversion equals the redemption price.\n\n## Financial assets, cash and cash equivalents\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss\n\nFinancial assets include financial assets at fair value through profit and loss (French mutual funds such as SICAVs and FCPs, certificates,/uni00A0etc.) that the Group intends to sell in the near term to realize a capital gain, or that are part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments managed collectively and for which there is evidence of a practice of short-term profit taking. They are classified in the balance sheet as current financial assets.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly-liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value. Subsequent to the initial measurement, financial liabilities are recorded:\n\n- -  at their net book value for bonds;\n- -  based on amortized cost calculated using the e/ffective interest rate for the other financial liabilities. Under this principle, any redemption and issue premiums, as well as issue costs, are recorded as debt in the balance sheet and amortized as financial income or expense over the life of the loans using the e/ffective interest method.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy of the financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe table presenting a breakdown of financial assets and liabilities categorized by value (see Note/uni00A039.4/uni00A0'Valuation methods for financial assets and liabilities at their fair value') meets the amended requirements of IFRS/uni00A07 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'. The fair values are classified using a scale which reflects the nature of the market data used to make the valuations.\n\nThis scale has three levels of fair value:\n\nLevel/uni00A01: Fair value calculated from the exchange rate/price quoted on an active market for identical instruments,\n\nLevel/uni00A02: Fair value calculated from valuation methods based on observable data such as the prices of similar assets and liabilities or scopes quoted on an active market,\n\nLevel/uni00A03: Fair value calculated from valuation methods which rely completely or in part on non-observable data such as prices on an inactive market or multiple-based valuation for non-quoted securities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations taking place prior to April/uni00A01, 2004 were not modified at the time international standards were adopted, on April/uni00A01, 2004, in accordance with IFRS/uni00A01 'First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards'.\n\n## 5.13/emspace Intangible  assets\n\nIntangible assets are recorded at initial cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIT development costs are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives. The Group has the tools required to enable the tracking by project of all the stages of development, and, in particular, the internal and external costs directly related to each project during its development phase.\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets acquired with a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives from the date they are available for use.\n\nThe KLM and Transavia brands and slots (takeo/ff and landing) acquired by the Group as part of the acquisition of KLM are identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. They are not amortized but tested annually for impairment or whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. If necessary, impairment as described in Note/uni00A05.16/uni00A0is recorded.\n\nGoodwill is valued in the functional currency of the entity acquired. It is recorded as an asset in the balance sheet.\n\nIt is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually and at any point during the year when an indicator of impairment exists. As discussed in Note/uni00A05.16, once recorded the impairment may not subsequently be reversed.\n\nWhen the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired exceeds the consideration transferred, there is negative goodwill which is recognized and immediately reversed in the Group's income statement.\n\nAt the time of the sale of a subsidiary or an equity a/ffiliate, the amount of the goodwill attributable to the entity sold is included in the calculation of the income from the sale.\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2012, airlines have been subject to the ETS (Emission Trading Scheme) market regulations as described in Note/uni00A05.22 and the 'Risks on carbon credit' paragraph in Note/uni00A039.2.4. As such, the Group is required to purchase/uni00A0CO2 quotas to o/ffset its emissions. The Group records the/uni00A0CO2 quotas as intangible assets. These assets are not depreciable.\n\nIntangible assets with a definite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following periods:\n\n| Software                            | 1/uni00A0to 5/uni00A0years          |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Licenses                            | Duration of contract                |\n| Information Technology developments | Up to 20/uni00A0years/thinspace (1) |\n\n- (1) IT developments are amortized over the same useful life as the underlying software. In some cases, they can be amortized over a longer period. This duration must be documented.\n\n## 5.14/emspace Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Principles applicable\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at their acquisition or manufacturing cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nPursuant to IAS/uni00A023, the financial interest attributed to advance payments made on account of investments in aircraft and other significant assets under construction is capitalized and added to the cost of the asset concerned. As prepayments on investments are not financed by specific loans, the Group uses the average interest rate on the current unallocated loans of the period.\n\nMaintenance costs are recorded as expenses during the period when incurred, with the exception of programs that extend the useful life of the asset or increase its value, which are then capitalized (e.g. maintenance on aircraft airframes and engines including parts with limited useful lives).\n\n## Flight equipment\n\nThe purchase price of aircraft equipment is denominated in foreign currencies. It is translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction or, if applicable, at the hedging price assigned to it. Manufacturers' discounts, if any, are deducted from the value of the related asset.",

These are incremental costs which would not have been incurred if the contract had not been concluded;\n- -  estimated costs for the restoration and dismantling of the leased asset according to the terms of the contract. At the date of the initial recognition of the right-of-use asset, the lessee adds to these costs, the discounted amount of the restoration and dismantling costs through a return obligation\n\non a straight-line basis over the estimated residual lifetime of the aircraft/engine type on the world market. The useful life is limited to a maximum of 30/uni00A0years.\n\n## Other property, plant and equipment\n\nOther property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful lives as follows:\n\nBuildings\n\n20/uni00A0to 50/uni00A0years\n\nFixtures and fittings\n\n8/uni00A0to 20/uni00A0years\n\nFlight simulators\n\n10/uni00A0to 20/uni00A0years\n\nEquipment and tooling\n\n3/uni00A0to 15/uni00A0years\n\nliability or provision as described in Note/uni00A05.20. These costs also include maintenance obligations with regard to the engines and airframes.\n\nFollowing the initial recognition, the right-of-use asset must be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying assets (lease term for the rental component, flight hours for the component relating to engine maintenance or on a straight-line basis for the component relating to the airframe until the date of the next major overhaul).\n\n## Measurement of the lease liability\n\nAt the commencement date, the lease liability is recognized for an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments over the lease term.\n\nAmounts involved in the measurement of the lease liability are:\n\n- -  fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments; meaning that even if they are variable in form, they are in-substance unavoidable);\n- -  variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or the rate in force at the lease commencement date;\n- -  amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n- -  payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured based on a process similar to the amortized cost method using the discount rate:\n\n- -  the liability is increased by the accrued interests resulting from the discounting of the lease liability, at the beginning of the lease period;\n- -  less payments made.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe interest cost for the period as well as variable payments, not taken into account in the initial measurement of the lease liability and incurred over the relevant period, are recognized as costs.\n\nIn addition, the lease liability may be remeasured in the following situations:\n\n- -  change in the lease term;\n- -  modification related to the assessment of the reasonably certain nature (or not) of the exercise of an option;\n- -  remeasurement linked to the residual value guarantees;\n- -  adjustment to the rates and indices according to which the rents are calculated when rent adjustments occur.\n\n## Types of capitalized lease contracts\n\n## 'Aircraft' lease contracts\n\nFor the aircraft lease contracts fulfilling the capitalization criteria defined by IFRS/uni00A016, the lease term corresponds to the non-terminable period of each contract except in cases where the Group is reasonably certain of exercising the renewal options contractually foreseen. For example, this may be the case if substantial cabin customization has taken place whereas the residual lease term is significantly shorter than the useful life of the cabins. The accounting treatment of the maintenance obligations related to leased aircraft is outlined in Note/uni00A05.20.\n\nAircraft lease contracts concluded by the Group do not include guaranteed value clauses for leased assets.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease debt corresponds, for each aircraft, to the implicit interest rate induced by the contractual elements and residual market values. This rate is easy to calculate due to the availability of current and future data concerning the value of aircraft. It is recalculated on each contract renewal (prolongation). The implied rate of the contract is the discount rate that gives the aggregated present value of the minimum lease payments and the unguaranteed residual value. This present value should be equal to the sum of the fair value of the leased asset and any initial direct costs of the lessor.\n\nSince most of the aircraft lease contracts are denominated in US dollars, starting from January/uni00A01, 2018 the Group put in place a cash flow hedge for its US dollar revenues via the lease debt in US dollars. Consequently, the revaluation of the Group's debt at the closing rate is accounted for in 'Other comprehensive income'.\n\n## 'Real-estate' lease contracts\n\nBased on its analysis, the Group has identified lease contracts according to the standard concerning surface areas rented in its hubs, lease contracts on buildings dedicated to the maintenance business, customized lounges in airports other than hubs and lease contracts on o/ffice buildings. The lease term corresponds to the non-terminable period, with most of the contracts not including renewal options.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease debt is determined, for each asset, according to the incremental borrowing rate at the signature date. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate that the lessee would pay to borrow the required funds to purchase the asset over a similar term, with a similar security and in a similar economic environment. This rate is achieved by the addition of the interest rate on government bonds and the credit spread. The coupon on government bonds is specific to the location, currency, period and maturity. The definition of the spread curve is based upon reference points, each point consisting of asset financing on assets other than aircraft.\n\n## 'Other-assets' lease contracts\n\nThe main lease contracts identified correspond to company cars, pools of spare parts and engines. The lease term corresponds to the non-terminable period. Most of the contracts do not provide renewal options. The discount rate used to calculate the lease debt is determined, for each asset, according to the incremental borrowing rate at the signature debt. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate that the lessee would pay to borrow the required funds to purchase the asset over a similar term, with a similar security and in a similar economic environment (for the method used to determine the incremental borrowing rate, see the 'Real estate lease contracts' paragraph above).\n\n## Types of non-capitalized lease contracts\n\nThe Group uses the two exemptions foreseen by IFRS/uni00A016/uni00A0allowing for non-recognition in the balance sheet: short-term lease contracts and lease contracts for which the underlying assets have a low value.\n\n## Short duration lease contracts\n\nThese are contracts whose duration is equal to or less than 12/uni00A0months. Within the Group, they mainly relate to leases of:\n\n- -  surface areas in our hubs with a reciprocal notice-period equal to or less than 12/uni00A0months;\n- -  accommodations for expatriates with a notice period equal to or less than 12/uni00A0months;\n- -  spare engines for a duration equal to or less than 12/uni00A0months.\n\n## Low value lease contracts\n\nLow-value lease contracts concern assets with a value equal to or less than US$5,000. Within the Group, these include, notably, lease contracts on printers, tablets, laptops and mobile phones.\n\n## Sale and leaseback transactions\n\nThe Group qualifies as sale and leaseback transactions, operations which lead to a sale according to IFRS/uni00A015. More specifically, a sale is considered as such if there is no repurchase option on the goods at the end of the lease term.",

The latter is determined according to the discounted future cash flow method, estimated based on budgetary assumptions approved by management, using an actuarial rate which corresponds to the weighted average cost of the Group's capital and a growth rate which reflects the market hypotheses for the appropriate activity.\n\n## 5.17/emspace Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of their cost and net realizable value.\n\nThe cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present condition and location. These costs include the direct and indirect production costs incurred under normal operating conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transaction not deemed to be a sale\n\nIf the sale by the vendor-lessee is not qualified as a sale according to IFRS/uni00A015, the vendor-lessee maintains the goods transferred on its balance sheet and recognizes a financial liability equal to the disposal price (received from the buyer-lessor).\n\nThe depreciation tests are carried out individually for each asset, except for those assets to which it is not possible to attach independent cash flows. In this case, these assets are regrouped within the CGU to which they belong and it is this which is tested. The CGUs correspond to the Group's business segments: network, maintenance, leisure and others which are homogeneous asset groups whose use generates identifiable cash inflows.\n\nWhen the recoverable value of an asset or CGU is inferior to its net book value, an impairment is recognized. The impairment of a CGU is charged in the first instance to goodwill, the remainder being charged to the other assets which comprise the CGU, prorated to their net book value.\n\nInventories are valued on a weighted average basis.\n\nThe net realizable value of the inventories is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\n## 5.18/emspace Treasury  shares\n\nAir-France-KLM shares held by the Group are recorded as a deduction from the Group's consolidated equity at the acquisition cost. Subsequent sales are recorded directly in equity. No gains or losses are recognized in the Group's income statement.\n\n## 5.19/emspace Employee  benefits\n\nThe Group's obligations in respect of defined benefit pension plans, including termination indemnities, are calculated in accordance with IAS/uni00A019/uni00A0Revised 'Employee Benefits', using the projected units of credit method based on actuarial assumptions and considering the specific economic conditions in each country concerned. The commitments are covered either by insurance or pension funds or by provisions recorded on the balance sheet as and when rights are acquired by employees.\n\nThe Group recognizes in 'other comprehensive income' all the actuarial gains or losses relating to post-employment plans, the di/fferential between the actual return and the expected return on the pension assets, and the impact of any asset ceiling.\n\nWhen a defined benefit pension plan is converted into a defined contribution pension plan or closed, the amounts recorded in other comprehensive income will be reclassified in other reserves.",

The constitution of these return obligation liabilities and provisions depends on the type of maintenance obligations to fulfill before returning these aircraft to the lessors: overhaul and restoration work, airframe and engine potential reconstitution as well as the replacement of limited life parts.\n\n## Overhaul and restoration works (not depending on aircraft utilization)\n\nCosts resulting from work required to be performed just before returning aircraft to the lessors, such as painting of the shell or aircraft overhaul ('C Check') are recognized as provisions as of the inception of the contract. The counterpart of these provisions is booked as a complement through the initial book value of the aircraft right-of-use assets. This complement to the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term.\n\n## 5.21/emspace Other  provisions\n\nThe Group recognizes a provision in the balance sheet when it has an existing legal or implicit obligation to a third party as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. The amounts recorded as provisions are discounted when the e/ffect of the passage of time is material.

In the absence of IFRS standards or interpretations governing ETS accounting, the Group has adopted the accounting treatment known as the 'netting approach'.\n\n## Airframe and engine potentials reconstitution (depending on the utilization of the aircraft and its engines)\n\nThe airframe and the engine potentials as well as the limited life parts are recognized as a complement to the right-of-use assets since they are considered as fully-fledged components, as distinct from the physical components which are the engine and the airframe. These components are the counterparts of the return obligation liability, recognized in its totality at the inception of the contract. When maintenance events aimed at reconstituting these potentials or replacing the limited life parts take place, the costs incurred are capitalized. These potentials and the limited life parts are depreciated over the period of use of the underlying assets (flight hours for the engine potentials component, straight-line for the airframe potentials component and cycles for the limited life parts).\n\nvalue of money is presented as a component of 'Other financial income and expenses'.\n\nRestructuring provisions are recognized once the Group has established a detailed and formalized restructuring plan which has been announced to the parties concerned.\n\nAccording to this approach, the quotas are recognized as intangible assets in the following way:\n\n- -  free quotas allocated by the State are valued at nil; and\n- -  quotas purchased on the market are accounted at their acquisition cost.",

As the added value is a net amount of income and expenses, the CAVE meets the definition of a tax on profits as set out in IAS/uni00A012.2. Consequently, the expense relating to the CAVE is presented under the line 'Income taxes'.\n\n## 5.25/emspace Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nAssets or groups of assets held for sale meet the criteria for this classification if their carrying amount is recovered principally through a sale rather than through their continuing use. This condition is considered to be met when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or group of assets intended for sale) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to a plan to sell, with the expectation that the sale will be realized within a period of twelve months from the date on which the asset or group of assets were classified as assets held for sale.\n\nThe Group determines on each closing date whether any assets or groups of assets meet the above criteria and presents such assets, if any, as 'non-current assets held for sale'.\n\nAny liabilities related to these assets are also presented on a separate line in liabilities on the balance sheet.\n\nAssets and groups of assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their book value or their fair value minus exit costs. As of the date of such a classification, the asset is no longer depreciated.\n\nThe results from discontinued operations are presented separately from the results from continuing operations in the income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other cargo revenues are derived principally from the sale of cargo capacity to third parties and the transportation of shipments on behalf of the Group by other airlines.\n\nMaintenance: Maintenance operating revenues are generated through maintenance services provided to other airlines and customers worldwide.\n\nTransavia: The revenues from this segment come from the 'leisure' activity realized by Transavia.\n\nOther: The revenues from this segment come from various services provided by the Group and not covered by the four segments mentioned above.\n\nThe results of the business segments are those that are either directly attributable or that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to these business segments. Amounts allocated to business segments mainly correspond to the EBITDA, current operating income and to the income from operating activities. Other elements of the income statement are presented in the 'non-allocated' column.\n\nInter-segment transactions are evaluated based on normal market conditions.\n\n## Geographical segments\n\n## Activity by origin of sales area\n\nGroup activities by origin of sale are broken down into four geographical areas:\n\n- -  Metropolitan France;\n- -  Benelux;\n- -  Europe (excluding France and Benelux);\n- -  Rest of the world.\n\nThe format for presenting activities by zone of origin of sales has been revised to take into account the Group's new commercial organization.\n\nOnly segment revenue is allocated by geographical sales area.\n\n## Activity by destination\n\nGroup activities by destination are broken down into seven geographical areas:\n\n- -  Metropolitan France;\n- -  Europe (excluding France) and North Africa;\n- -  Caribbean, West Indies, French Guyana and Indian Ocean;\n- -  Africa (excluding North Africa), Middle East;\n- -  North America, Mexico;\n- -  South America (excluding Mexico);\n- -  Asia and New Caledonia.",

The French Finance Act 2018 provides for a gradual reduction in the French corporate tax rate to 25.83% in 2022. Tax losses can be carried forward for an unlimited period. However, the amount of fiscal loss recoverable each year is limited to 50% of the profit for the period beyond the first million euros. The Group limits its recoverability horizon on the deferred tax losses of the French fiscal group to a period of five years, consistent with its strategic plan.\n\nThe deferred tax asset position on tax losses remains stable versus December/uni00A031, 2020 at \u20ac285/uni00A0million resulting from the medium and long term uncertainty arising from the current public health context leading the Group to keep its deferred tax asset recognition policy unchanged.\n\nSubsequently, an amount of \u20ac492/uni00A0million of deferred tax assets related to tax losses and temporary di/fferences has not been recognized for the period ended December/uni00A031, 2021 (including \u20ac453/uni00A0million through the income statement).\n\n## Dutch fiscal group\n\nIn the Netherlands, the tax rate is 25% in 2021. As from 2022, the Dutch corporate tax rate will be 25.8%. Under income tax law in the Netherlands, the maximum future period for utilising tax losses carried forward is currently six years. As from January/uni00A01, 2022, this period will become indefinite for tax losses.\n\nHowever, the amount of fiscal loss recoverable each year is limited to 50% of the profit for the period beyond the first million euros.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the Dutch fiscal group has deferred taxes assets on fiscal losses in the balance sheet amounting to \u20ac57/uni00A0million, relating to an interest deduction allowance which can be carried forward indefinitely (\u20ac10/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2020).\n\nIn addition, an amount of \u20ac234/uni00A0million of deferred tax liabilities has been derecognized following the changes in the ground sta/ff pension plan into a defined contribution plan (see Note/uni00A04.2. 'Significant events occurring during the period').\n\nIn view of the medium and long term uncertainty surrounding the business outlook due to the health situation, the Dutch fiscal group has limited the recognition of deferred tax assets for additional tax losses in the period. Consequently, \u20ac156/uni00A0million of deferred tax assets have not been recognized for the period ended December/uni00A031, 2021, in addition of the \u20ac270/uni00A0millions not recognized at the end of December/uni00A031, 2020.",

These partnerships, whose country localizations and percentages of interest are presented in Note/uni00A045.2, have been concluded either with airlines or with independent players in the maintenance market.\n\n## Servair Group\n\nThe Servair Group is the French number one in aviation catering. With about 36/uni00A0establishments in 19/uni00A0countries and approximately 10,500/uni00A0employees, Servair has a leading position in Paris and Africa. Servair numbers more than a hundred air carrier customers worldwide and proposes a series of services regrouped around three core businesses: On-Board Services, Airports Services and Out-of-Home Catering.\n\n<!-- image -->",

On conclusion of this transaction, the operational control of Servair was transferred to gategroup in application of the governance planned in the agreements between Air/uni00A0France and gategroup.\n\nIn early 2021, the terms under which Air/uni00A0France could sell a 30% shareholding in Servair to Gategroup were re-negotiated. This resulted in the sale by Air/uni00A0France Finance, on May/uni00A031, 2021, of 15% of Servair shares for \u20ac71/uni00A0million. A second instalment for a further 15% shareholding should be paid in December/uni00A02022. These 15% are classified in assets held for sale (see Note/uni00A025 'Assets held for sale') and the remaining 20% were revalued accordingly to the IFRS/uni00A010/uni00A0standard at their fair value based on the transaction value for an amount of \u20ac62/uni00A0million in the lign 'equity a/ffiliates'.\n\n## NOTE 22/emspace PENSION  ASSETS\n\n## As of December/uni00A031 (in \u20ac millions)\n\n|                                                     | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Opening balance                                     | 211    | 420    |\n| Net periodic pension (cost)/income                  | (77)   | (175)  |\n| Payments of benefits and contributions to the funds | (833)  | 119    |\n| Reclassification                                    | 28     | (28)   |\n| Fair value revaluation                              | 671    | (125)  |\n| Closing balance                                     | -      | 211    |\n\nThe analysis of these pension assets including the impacts related to the modification of the KLM Ground sta/ff pension\n\nplan is presented in Note/uni00A031 (see Note/uni00A031.1/uni00A0'Characteristics of the main defined benefit plans').\n\n## NOTE 23/emspace IMPAIRMENT\n\n## Year ended December/uni00A031, 2021\n\nConcerning the methodology followed for impairment tests, the Group has allocated each item of goodwill and each intangible fixed asset with an indefinite useful life to Cash Generating Units (CGUs), corresponding to its business segments (see Note/uni00A05 'Accounting Policies').\n\nThe recoverable value of the CGU assets has been determined by reference to their value in use as of September/uni00A030, 2021. The tests were realized for all the CGUs on the basis of a five-year Group plan, presented by the management to the Board in early December/uni00A02021.\n\nRevenues (network, leisure and maintenance), costs and investments forecasts are based on reasonable hypotheses and are the management's best estimates. They are subject to the\n\nuncertainties related to the current situation. They forecast a return to the level of 2019 activity in 2024 and savings linked to the pursuit of the reorganization/restructuring plans implemented by the Group.\n\nThe discount rate used for the test corresponds to the Group's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This stood at 6.7% as at December/uni00A031, 2021 versus 6.3% as at December/uni00A031, 2020. The revenue growth rate varies between 2% and 5% depending on the CGU over the interim period (2027-33).

As provided for by this agreement, the KLM Ground Sta/ff pension fund now qualifies as a defined contribution plan under IFRS rules. The pension assets, based on the actuarial assumptions as of May/uni00A031, 2021, amounted to \u20ac875/uni00A0million (before tax). Under this agreement, KLM has paid an additional pension premium covering the period January-May/uni00A02021, as well as a one-o/ff contribution representing the savings realized since 2014 following changes in the Dutch law. These contributions amount to \u20ac63/uni00A0million.\n\nThe total impact of the de-recognition of the pension assets together with the additional contributions has been booked in 'Other non-current income and expenses' in the consolidated statement of income for an amount of \u20ac938/uni00A0million (\u20ac704/uni00A0million net of tax).\n\n## Air/uni00A0France pension plan (CRAF) - France\n\nThe employees covered by this plan are the Air/uni00A0France Ground Sta/ff a/ffiliated to the CRAF until December/uni00A031, 1992.\n\nThe participants receive, or will receive on retirement, an additional pension paid monthly or a lump sum based on the monthly annuity and definitively calculated based on the data known as of December/uni00A031, 1992 and expressed in the form of points. The value of each point is adjusted every year based on the weighted increases seen in the CNAV and AGIRC-ARRCO schemes over the last twelve months.",

        "page_content": "Until 2009, the CRAF had the legal form of a supplementary pension institution (pursuant to the 'Code de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sociale'). With this status, the CRAF was responsible, on behalf of the Air/uni00A0France ground sta/ff employed in France, for managing the pension plan resulting from the merging of the Air/uni00A0France ground sta/ff plan with the mandatory pension plan for the private sector.\n\nFollowing the 2003 law on pension reform foreseeing the disappearance of supplementary pension institutions as of December/uni00A031, 2009, the CRAF's Board of Directors opted to transform it into an institution managing supplementary pensions. The CRAF is now responsible for the administrative functions linked to the plan. The pension rights were not amended by this reform. Air/uni00A0France is directly responsible for the pension obligations.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2009, all the funds managed by the CRAF had been transferred to two insurance companies. On December/uni00A031, 2012, one of the insurance contracts was terminated and its funds were transferred to the other, which thus became the only insurer.\n\nThis guarantees a capital of 17% equal to the amount of capital invested in units of account in its collective fund, this percentage being automatically set to increase over time. The annual payments made by Air/uni00A0France to the insurance company are governed by the agreement signed with the employee representative bodies on December/uni00A014, 2009. The minimum annual payment defined by this agreement amounts to \u20ac32.5/uni00A0million as long as the life annuity guaranteed by the insurer does not reach 85% of the benefits payments for this plan without future revaluations. If the value of the funds falls below 50% of the total obligations calculated for funding purposes, Air/uni00A0France is required to make an additional payment to achieve a minimum 50% coverage rate.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the coverage of liabilities by reserves is 53%.\n\nThe funds are invested in bonds, equities and general assets of the insurance company. Studies of assets/liabilities allocation are carried out regularly, to verify the relevance of the investment strategy.\n\nAs from October/uni00A01, 2021, the thresholds for the payment of small capital annuities have been raised, leading to a decrease in liabilities towards active and deferred members of \u20ac16/uni00A0million.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France end of service benefit plan (ICS) - France\n\nPursuant to French regulations and the company agreements, every employee receives an end of service indemnity on retirement.\n\nIn France, this indemnity depends on the number of years of service, the professional category of the employee (flight deck crew, cabin crew, ground sta/ff, agent, technician and executive) and, in some cases, on the age of the employee at retirement.\n\nOn retirement, employees consequently receive an end of service indemnity based on their final salaries over the last twelve-months and on their seniority. The indemnity is only payable to employees on their retirement date. There is no mandatory minimum funding requirement for this scheme.\n\nAir/uni00A0France has nevertheless signed contracts with three insurance companies to partly pre-finance the plan. Air/uni00A0France has sole responsibility for payment of the indemnities, but remains free to make payments to these insurance companies.\n\nThe relevant outsourced funds are invested in bonds and equities.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the liabilities have been valued by changing the valuation method in accordance with the IFRIC advice of May/uni00A02021 (see Note/uni00A03 'Restatement of the 2020 financial statements').\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, following the transformation of the KLM Ground Sta/ff pension plan into a defined contribution plan, the two French plans presented above represented a respective 61% of the Group's defined benefit obligation and 42% of the Group's pension plan assets.\n\n## 31.2/emspace Description of the actuarial assumptions and related sensitivities\n\nActuarial valuations of the Group's benefit obligation were made as of December/uni00A031, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThese calculations include:\n\n- -  assumptions on sta/ff turnover and the life expectancy of the plan beneficiaries;\n- -  assumptions on salary and pension increases;\n- -  assumptions on retirement ages varying from 50/uni00A0to 68/uni00A0years depending on the localization and applicable laws;\n- -  inflation rates determined with reference to the inflation swaps applied to the Group's cash flows and based on the duration of the schemes:\n\n| As of December/uni00A031                          | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Euro zone - Duration 10/uni00A0to 15/uni00A0years | 2.15%  | 1.25%  |\n| Euro zone - Duration 15/uni00A0years   and beyond | N/A    | 1.35%  |\n\n- -  d iscount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As a result of this agreement, the KLM Ground Sta/ff pension fund is now classified as a defined contribution\n\nplan under IFRS rules. The overall impact of the de-recognition of the pension asset as well as these additional payments has been recognized in 'other non-current income and expenses' in the consolidated income statement for an amount of \u20ac938/uni00A0million (\u20ac704/uni00A0million net of tax) (see Note/uni00A031.1/uni00A0'Characteristics of the main defined benefit plans').\n\n## -As of December/uni00A031, 2020\n\nA curtailment of the pension plan at Air/uni00A0France and its regional subsidiaries was accounted for, amounting to a \u20ac226/uni00A0million gain as of December/uni00A031, 2020, within the framework of the Voluntary Departure Plan and collective mutual agreement on termination of contract ('Rupture Conventionnelle Collective') for pilots and flight attendants.\n\nA curtailment of the KLM Ground Sta/ff in The Netherlands was made, amounting to a profit of \u20ac16/uni00A0million, within the framework of the 2020 Voluntary Departure Plan for ground sta/ff.\n\n## 31.4/emspace Asset  allocation\n\nThe weighted average allocation of the funds invested in the Group's pension and other long-term benefit plans is as follows:\n\n|             | Funds invested as of  December/uni00A031, 2021   | Funds invested as of  December/uni00A031, 2021   | Funds invested as of  December/uni00A031, 2020   | Funds invested as of  December/uni00A031, 2020   |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| (in %)      | France                                           | The  Netherlands                                 | France                                           | The  Netherlands                                 |\n| Equities    | 23                                               | -                                                | 25                                               | 40                                               |\n| Bonds       | 54                                               | -                                                | 51                                               | 47                                               |\n| Real estate | -                                                | -                                                | -                                                | 9                                                |\n| Others      | 23                                               | -                                                | 24                                               | 4                                                |\n| Total       | 100                                              | -                                                | 100                                              | 100                                              |\n\nThe equity portion is mainly invested in active markets in Europe, the United States and emerging countries.\n\nThe bonds primarily comprise government bonds, rated at least BBB, and invested in Europe, the United States and emerging countries.\n\nThe real estate assets are mainly located in Europe and the United States.\n\nThe Group's pension assets do not include assets occupied or used by the Group.\n\n## 31.5/emspace Expected cash outflows and risks linked to the pension obligations\n\nThe employer contributions relating to the defined benefit pension plans amount to \u20ac51/uni00A0million for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2022.

Such provisions are set up when the Group considers that the tax authorities, within the framework of tax audits, could\n\nreasonably challenge a tax position adopted by the Group or one of its subsidiaries.\n\nIn the normal course of its activities, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, its subsidiaries Air/uni00A0France and KLM (and their subsidiaries) are involved in litigation cases, some of which may be significant.\n\n## 32.1.4/emspace Litigation concerning anti-trust laws in the air-freight industry\n\nAir/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, a wholly-owned subsidiary of KLM since January/uni00A01, 2009, have been involved, since February/uni00A02006, with up to twenty-five other airlines in investigations initiated by the antitrust authorities in several countries, with respect to allegations of anti-competitive agreements or concerted actions in the air freight industry.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, most of these investigations had been terminated following the entry into plea agreements between the three companies of the Group and the appropriate competition authorities, providing for the payment of settlement amounts or fines, with the exception of the proceedings initiated by the European Commission, and by the Swiss antitrust authority, which are still pending.\n\nIn Europe, the decision of the European Commission of 2010 against eleven air cargo carriers, including the companies of the Group, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, was annulled by the General Court of the European Union on December/uni00A016, 2015 because it contained a contradiction regarding the exact scope\n\nof the practices sanctioned. On March/uni00A017, 2017, the European Commission issued a new decision against the aforementioned cargo carriers, including Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair. The total amount of fines imposed in respect of this decision at the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group level was \u20ac339/uni00A0million. This amount was slightly reduced by \u20ac15.4/uni00A0million as compared to the initial decision owing to a lower fine for Martinair due to technical reasons. On May/uni00A029 and 30, 2017, the Group companies filed an appeal against this decision before the General Court of the European Union. The Group has maintained a provision covering the total amount of these fines.\n\nIn Switzerland, Air/uni00A0France and KLM filed an appeal before the Federal Administrative Court against the decision of the competition authority to impose a fine of \u20ac4/uni00A0million. The Group has provisioned the totality of this fine.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the total provisions in connection with proceedings which have not yet resulted in definitive decisions amounts to \u20ac350.6/uni00A0million.\n\n## 32.1.5/emspace Case brought against KLM by (former) Martinair pilots\n\nA case was brought against KLM by a number of (former) Martinair airline pilots on the basis that the cargo department of Martinair was transferred to KLM and that all former cockpit crew are entitled to remuneration from KLM, taking into account their Martinair seniority.\n\nAfter several court cases the supreme court ruled that the judgment of the court of appeal lacked su/fficient motivation and referred the case to another court of appeal in November/uni00A02019. On June/uni00A08, 2021 the Dutch court ruled against KLM in the\n\nproceeding brought by the former Martinair pilots. The pilots were recruited by KLM on January/uni00A01, 2014 and KLM is obliged to o/ffer to reinstate the pilots in their former positions at Martinair. KLM is executing the court ruling and thus has o/ffered the former Martinair pilots new positions. Furthermore, the court ruled that KLM must pay any damages caused by non-respect of the laws of 'transfer of undertaking'. KLM is investigating the judgement and related impact and has decided to record a legal provision of \u20ac22/uni00A0million in 2021.",

Indeed, with respect to\n\nmost cases the Group is not in a position at this stage in these procedures, to give a reliable estimate of the potential loss that could be incurred in connection with these disputes.\n\n## 32.2.7/emspace Litigations concerning anti-trust laws in the air-freight industry\n\nFollowing the initiation of various investigations by the competition authorities in 2006 and the European Commission decision in 2010, several collective and individual actions were brought by forwarders and air-freight shippers in the civil courts against Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, and other cargo operators, in a number of jurisdictions.\n\nUnder these civil lawsuits, shippers and freight forwarders are claiming for damages to compensate alleged higher prices due to alleged competition law infringement.\n\nAlthough significant amounts have been reported by the media, plainti/ffs are mostly claiming for unspecified and/or insu/fficiently substantiated damages against defendants taken as a whole (and not individually) and the EU decision to which the plainti/ffs refer to is still not definitive.\n\nThe Group companies and the other airlines involved in these lawsuits continue to vigorously oppose all such civil claims. For Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair the main civil claims still pending are those in the Netherlands and in Norway.\n\n## 32.2.8/emspace Litigations concerning anti-trust laws in the passenger sector\n\n## Canada\n\nA civil class action was reinitiated in 2013 by claimants in Ontario against seven airlines including Air/uni00A0France and KLM. The plainti/ffs\n\n## 32.2.9/emspace Other  litigations\n\n## Rio-Paris AF447 flight\n\nOn March/uni00A028, 2011 Air/uni00A0France and Airbus were indicted for manslaughter of the 228/uni00A0victims who died in the crash of the AF 447/uni00A0Rio-Paris flight on June/uni00A01, 2009.\n\nThe investigating judges of the Court of First Instance ruled in favor of Air/uni00A0France and Airbus, by issuing an order dismissing the case on September/uni00A04, 2019.\n\nallege that the defendants participated in a conspiracy in the passenger air transport service from Canada on the crossAtlantic routes, for which they are claiming damages. Air/uni00A0France and KLM strongly deny any participation in such a conspiracy.\n\nThe Public Prosecutor's O/ffice and most of the civil parties (including the Pilots' associations and unions) appealed this decision. The Paris Court of Appeals ruled on May/uni00A012, 2021, referring Airbus and Air/uni00A0France to the Criminal Court. Further to the rejection of the appeal introduced by Air/uni00A0France and Airbus ('pourvoi en cassation') by the Court of Cassation on August/uni00A026, 2021 the case is now before the Criminal Court.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In September/uni00A02016, a Civil Information Demand from the DoJ has been received seeking certain information relating to these contracts.

Since this date, the interests rate applicable on the residual nominal amount has been reset at a fixed rate of 4% per annum.\n\nThe residual nominal amount of these perpetual notes can be redeemed at KLM's discretion on each fifth anniversary of the first interest payment date, August/uni00A028, 1999. The next option date for redemption at Par is thus August/uni00A028, 2024. Note that an indemnity is due if the JPY loan is redeemed in a currency other than the JPY.\n\nThis debt is subordinated to all other existing and future debt at KLM.\n\n## 33.1.2/emspace KLM perpetual subordinated debt in Swiss Francs\n\nThe perpetual subordinated bond debt in Swiss Francs (CHF) was issued by KLM in two tranches, one in 1985 and one in 1986. The initial nominal amount for these two perpetual bonds combined was CHF 500/uni00A0million.\n\nOver the years, KLM has proceeded with several partial buy back transactions to partially redeem the debt. As a result, the total amount now outstanding is CHF 375/uni00A0million, i.e. \u20ac363/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nConcerning the tranche issued in 1985, KLM is entitled to early redeem at Par the then-prevailing outstanding residual amount on each tenth anniversary of the interest payment date. The next 'call date' is February/uni00A012, 2025. The coupon reset date is fully aligned with the above mentioned frequency. If the call option is\n\nnot exercized, the next coupon reset date is February/uni00A012, 2025. The current outstanding coupon is 0.75% per annum.\n\nConcerning the tranche issued in 1986, the KLM Group is entitled to early redeem the outstanding residual nominal amount at Par on each fifth anniversary of the interest payment date. The next 'call date' is May/uni00A015, 2026. The call price amount in 2001 was 101.75% of the notional face value, and thereafter with a premium declining by 0.25% on each fifth anniversary of the interest payment date. From May/uni00A015, 2036, the amount of early redemption will thus be set at 100% of the residual Par. The debt is subject to the payment of a coupon of 5.75% per annum.\n\nThe two CHF perpetual bond debts are ranked 'pari passu' with the JPY perpetual loan debt and are subordinated to all other existing and future debt at KLM.\n\n## 33.2/emspace Bonds\n\n## 33.2.1/emspace Perpetual subordinated notes\n\nIn 2020, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM decided to redeem all of the outstanding perpetual subordinated notes issued in 2015 representing a total nominal amount of \u20ac403.3/uni00A0million (see Note/uni00A030.4/uni00A0'Perpetual').",

Each bond has a nominal value of \u20ac17.92. The annual coupon amounts to 0.125%. The conversion period of these bonds runs from May/uni00A04, 2019 to the seventh working day preceding the normal or early reimbursement date. The conversion ratio is one share for one bond.\n\nRepayment at par, plus accrued interest, will be possible on March/uni00A025, 2024 at the request of the bond holders. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM\n\ncan enforce the cash reimbursement of these bonds by exercising a call option running from April/uni00A015, 2022 if the share price exceeds 130% of the nominal, i.e. \u20ac23.29, encouraging OCEANE bond holders to convert their bonds into Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares.\n\nUpon issue of these convertible bonds, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM recorded a debt of \u20ac446/uni00A0million, corresponding to the present value of future payments of interest and nominal discounted at the rate of a similar bond without a conversion option. The option value, calculated by deducting this debt value from the total nominal amount of the issue (i.e. \u20ac500/uni00A0million), was recorded in equity.\n\nAs of 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02020, the debt value amount to \u20ac476/uni00A0million.\n\n## 33.3/emspace Financial support from the French and Dutch States\n\n## Financial support package of \u20ac7.0/uni00A0billion backed from the French State\n\nOn May/uni00A06, 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group signed the legal documentation relating to the financing for a total amount of \u20ac7/uni00A0billion including two loans:\n\n- -  a loan of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion, provided by nine French and foreign financial institutions, 90% guaranteed by the French State, with an initial 12-month maturity and a one-year or two-year extension option exercisable at its sole discretion, by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. The loan has a coupon at an annual rate equal to EURIBOR (floored at zero) plus a margin of 0.75% in the first year, 1.50% in the second year and 2.75% in the third year. The cost of the French State guarantee initially equals 0.5% of the total amount of the loan and will step up to 1% for each of the second and third years.\n\nThe loan includes a mandatory partial early repayment of 75% of any net new money raised by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or Air/uni00A0France from financial institutions or through debt capital markets, subject to some exceptions and a mandatory total early repayment notably in case of change of control of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or Air/uni00A0France.\n\nOf this \u20ac4/uni00A0billion, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group repaid \u20ac500/uni00A0million on December/uni00A010, 2021 and negotiated a change in the repayment profile with the final maturity date being extended from May/uni00A06, 2023 to May/uni00A06, 2025, breaking down as follows:\n\n- -  May 2023: partial repayment of \u20ac800/uni00A0million, i.e. an outstanding balance of \u20ac2.7/uni00A0billion,\n- -  May 2024: partial repayment of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion, i.e. an outstanding balance of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion,\n- -  May 2025: final repayment of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion.\n\nThe outstanding balance is therefore \u20ac3.5/uni00A0billion as at 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This loan has a coupon payable annually or capitalizable at the discretion of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM at a rate equal to EURIBOR 12/uni00A0months (floored at zero) plus a margin of 7% for the first four years, 7.5% for the fifth year and 7.75% for the sixth year.\n\nThe rate for this shareholder loan should have increased by a 5.5% step up in case (i)/uni00A0the Shareholders' Meeting would not approve a capital increase proposed by the Board of Directors that would enable incorporation in the company's shareholder equity of all or part of the outstanding shareholder loan, (ii)/uni00A0the Shareholders' Meeting would approve, without the approval from the French State, a capital increase which would not enable the incorporation of all or part the outstanding shareholder loan in the company's shareholder equity or (iii)/uni00A0a third party, not acting in concert with the French State, would exceed, alone or in concert, the threshold of 20% of the capital of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\nThis loan is subordinated to the bank loan guaranteed by the French State and, in the event of receivership or liquidation, to all the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM senior bond and bank debt, without prejudice of an incorporation of all or part of the outstanding shareholder loan in the company's shareholder equity.\n\nThe company has undertaken not to pay dividends until these two loans have been repaid in full.\n\nThe European Commission approved the French State's aid mechanism on May/uni00A04, 2020.\n\nOn April/uni00A020, 2021, the \u20ac3/uni00A0billion direct loan granted by the French State to Air/uni00A0France via Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM at the end of May/uni00A02020, was converted into super subordinated notes of the same nominal amount, allowing the Group to improve its equity by \u20ac3/uni00A0billion without impacting cash flow, while increasing the flexibility of its debt repayment profile. This issue is made up of three tranches with perpetual maturities of a nominal amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion each, each with a first redemption option (call) at 4, 5 and 6/uni00A0years respectively.\n\n## Financial support package of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion backed by the Dutch State\n\nOn June/uni00A025, 2020, the Dutch State, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and KLM have finalized an agreement on a financial support mechanism supported by the Dutch State for an amount of\n\n\u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion. This financial support package includes two loans for KLM and its subsidiaries:\n\n- -  a revolving credit facility of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion, 90% guaranteed by the Dutch State and with a maturity of 5/uni00A0years. This revolving credit facility incurring interest at EURIBOR (floored at zero) plus a margin of 1.35%. The cost of the associated Dutch State guarantee equals 0.50% in year 1, 1.00% in year 2 and 3 and 2.00% after year 3;\n- -  a direct loan of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, granted by the Dutch State to KLM, with a maturity of 5.5/uni00A0years and incurring interest at EURIBOR 12/uni00A0months (floored at zero) plus a margin of 6.25% for year 1, 6.75% for year 2 and 3, and 7.75% for year 4 and 5. This loan is subordinated to the new revolving credit facility.\n\nBoth the revolving credit facility and the direct loan are drawn simultaneously on a pro rata basis.\n\nKLM's first drawdown under the new revolving credit facility amounted to \u20ac665/uni00A0million, drawn on August/uni00A026, 2020. It replaced the existing revolving credit facility drawn on March/uni00A019, 2020 (see Note/uni00A033.7/uni00A0'Credit lines'). KLM's first drawdown under the Dutch State loan, amounting to \u20ac277/uni00A0million, was made on the same day.\n\nThe main conditions associated with the direct State loan are linked to manageable cost improvements, the airline becoming more sustainable and the restored performance and competitiveness of KLM, including a comprehensive restructuring plan and contributions made by employees.\n\nKLM has undertaken to suspend dividend payments to its shareholders until these two loans have been repaid in full.\n\nThe European Commission approved the Dutch State Aid on July/uni00A013, 2020. On November/uni00A03, 2020, approval was obtained from the Dutch Ministry of Finance for the restructuring plan. Following this, KLM has the possibility to draw additional amounts under the financial support package.\n\nThere was no new draw on 2021.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, KLM has drawn down \u20ac942/uni00A0million of the financial support package (\u20ac665/uni00A0million of the revolving credit facility and \u20ac277/uni00A0million of the direct State loan). The loans have been recorded at amortized cost based on a 5 and 5.5/uni00A0years drawn down assumptions with the E/ffective Interest Rate method (3.95% for the revolving credit facility and 7.05% for the direct State loan).\n\nThe review of future cash flow projections on the credit line guaranteed by the Dutch government generated an adjustment of \u20ac(20) million recognized in net cost of financial debt (see Note 13/uni00A0'Net cost of financial debt and other financial income and expenses').\n\nBoth the revolving credit facility and the direct State loan are presented as non-current liabilities based on IAS/uni00A01 (presentation of financial statements). As per December/uni00A031, 2021 the revolving credit facility has a remaining contractual maturity of 4/uni00A0years and the direct State loan has a remaining contractual maturity of 4.5/uni00A0years. With that, the loans are not due for settlement in the coming 12/uni00A0months after balance sheet date.",

The RMC decides on the hedging policies to be implemented, the targets for hedging ratios and the periods and instrument types. Formalized RMC decisions are then implemented by the respective Treasury Management departments within each sub-group, in compliance with the procedures governing the delegation of powers. Each sub-group centralizes the management of the market risks of its subsidiaries. Regular meetings are organized between the Treasury Management departments on hedging instruments, strategies to consider and counterparties.\n\nTo implement the strategy most appropriate to each circumstance, any type of instrument may be used provided it qualifies as hedging within IFRS. As a general rule, no trading or speculation is allowed. Any exception to this rule must be approved by the Risk Management Committee.\n\nThe treasury management departments of each sub-group circulate weekly information on the level of cash and cash equivalents to their respective General Managements. The level of the Group's consolidated cash is communicated every week and, at the end of the month to the Group's General Management.\n\nEvery month, a complete report including the interest rate and currency positions, the portfolio of hedging instruments, a summary of investments and financing by currency and the monitoring of risk by counterparty is sent to the General Managements.\n\nThe Treasury Management departments have full responsibility for the hedging strategy on fuel and carbon credits. The General Managements receive a weekly fuel report, mainly covering the transactions carried out during the week, the valuation of all the positions, the percentages hedged as well as the breakdown of the instruments and underlying used, the average hedge levels and the resulting net prices. All this data covers a rolling 12/uni00A0months. Furthermore, a weekly Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group report (known as the Fuel Hedge report) consolidates the figures from the two sub-groups relating to fuel hedging and carries out a budget update.\n\n## Fuel price risk\n\nThe fuel bill is one of the largest cost items for airlines, making oil price volatility a risk for the air transport industry. A sharp increase in the oil price can have a very material negative impact on the profitability of airlines, particularly if the economic environment does not enable them to adjust their pricing strategies. Similarly, a sharp decline in fuel prices is favorable for airline profitability. However, the way in which airlines pass on a sharp fall in the fuel price in their fares is a factor of significant uncertainty.\n\nRisks linked to the jet fuel price are hedged within the framework of a hedging strategy defined by the RMC for the whole of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group.\n\nCompared with the previous policy, since February/uni00A017, 2021, the revised hedging strategy approved by the Board of Directors has reduced, the time span from a rolling 24/uni00A0months to a rolling 12/uni00A0months and reduced the hedge amount from an equivalent of 80% to 50% of the annual volume consumed. In addition, it uses instruments that may be fixed forwards or options. These instruments are treated in such a way as to qualify as hedging instruments under the provision of IFRS/uni00A09/uni00A0rule.\n\nWith the application of IFRS/uni00A09 as of January/uni00A01, 2018, the hedging strategy of the Group has evolved and now includes components (crude oil and gasoil oil are specified as components of jet fuel prices). These components are considered as separately identifiable and reliably measurable as required by IFRS/uni00A09.\n\n## Main characteristics of the hedging strategy\n\nHedge horizon: 12/uni00A0months rolling\n\n## Minimum hedge percentage, to reach at the end of the current quarter:\n\n- -  quarter underway: 70% of the volumes consumed;\n- -  quarter 1: 70% of the volumes consumed;\n- -  quarter 2: 55% of the volumes consumed;\n- -  quarter 3: 40% of the volumes consumed;\n- -  quarter 4: 25% of the volumes consumed.\n\nIncrement of coverage ratios: 15% by quarter\n\nUnderlyings: Brent, Gas Oil and Jet Fuel\n\nInstruments: Swap, call, call spread, three ways, four ways and collar.\n\n## Implementation of monitoring indicators on positions:\n\nTo ensure more e/ffective monitoring of the marked-to-market positions and dynamic management of its exposure, the Group uses the VAR (Value at Risk) metric to help measure the risk incurred by its portfolio. This monitoring is also reinforced by taking into account the maximum loss and maximum gain which limit the scale of variation of this same portfolio and enable the appropriate reaction.",

        "page_content": "## Currency risk\n\nMost of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's revenues are generated in euros. However, because of its international activities, the Group incurs a foreign exchange risk. The management of the currency risk for the subsidiaries of the two sub-groups is centralized by each sub-group. The principal exposure relates to the US dollar. Since the expenditure on items such as fuel and components exceeds the amount of revenues in dollars not covered by the lease debt, the Group is a net buyer of US dollars. As a result, any significant appreciation in the dollar against the euro could result in a negative impact on the Group's activity and financial results.\n\nOn the other hand, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is a net seller of other currencies, the level of revenues in these currencies exceeding its expenditure. This exposure is far less significant than with the US dollar. As a result, any significant decline in these currencies against the euro would have a negative e/ffect on the Group's financial results.\n\nThe management of the Group's exchange rate risk is carried out based on the forecasted net exposure for each currency. Currencies which are highly correlated to the US dollar are aggregated with the US dollar exposure.\n\nFor each currency hedged, the time span of the hedging is a rolling 12/uni00A0to 24-month period, the first four quarters having more hedging than the following four. The RMC sets the hedging targets for the dollar, sterling pound and the yen.\n\nAir/uni00A0France uses some zero-cost structured options, as hedging instruments. These generate volatility in the financial result because of their non-aligned time value, unlike vanilla options whose time value is aligned. Changes in aligned time values are recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS/uni00A09.\n\nAircrafts are mostly paid for in US dollars, meaning that the Group is exposed to an appreciation in the dollar relative to the euro in terms of its investments in flight equipment. The hedging strategy provides for the implementation of a systematic and graduated level of hedging between the date aircrafts are ordered and their delivery.\n\nThe exchange rate risk on the Group's financial debt is limited. At December/uni00A031, 2021, 86% of the Group's debt, after taking into account derivative instruments, was euro-denominated, thereby significantly reducing the risk of currency fluctuation on the debt. The exchange rate risk on debt denominated in other currencies mostly concerns the Yen for 6%, the US dollar for 5% and the Swiss franc for 3%.\n\nAs of January/uni00A01, 2018, the Group has applied IFRS/uni00A016/uni00A0meaning that aircraft leases mostly denominated in US dollars are accounted for in the Group's debt. These loans have been requalified as hedging for the network's future revenues in US dollars. Consequently, the impact of foreign exchange di/fferences in US dollars is accounted in other comprehensive income. For both Transavia and KLM Cityhopper, which have no US dollar\n\nrevenues, hedging programs specific to these commitments have been defined.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nA portion of the financial liabilities is contracted at floating rates. However, to limit its volatility, Air/uni00A0France and KLM have used option and swap strategies involving the use of derivatives to convert a significant proportion of their floating-rate debt into fixed rates; after hedging, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's debt contracted at fixed rates represents 50% of the overall total. The interest rate on the Group's gross debt after swaps stood at 2.23% at December/uni00A031, 2021 versus 2.55% at December/uni00A031, 2020.\n\n## Risks on carbon credit\n\nTo meet its regulatory obligations, the/uni00A0CO2 emission quota acquisition strategy has been monitored and reviewed during every RMC meeting since October/uni00A02011. Its implementation led to the progressive hedging of the future requirement through the use of forward contracts meaning that the 2022 requirement and a portion of the 2023 requirement are hedged.\n\nUnderlyings: EUA, EUAA and CER quotas\n\nInstruments: Forwards, delivery and payment during the quarter preceding the compliance application date.\n\n## Investment risks\n\nThe cash resources of Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM are currently invested over a short-term time horizon, primarily in deposits, money market mutual funds and certificates with high-rated banks.\n\nLastly, in order to reduce the currency risk on the debt, a portion of KLM's liquid assets is invested in high-quality foreign-currency denominated bonds.\n\n## Equity risks\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group holds a limited number of shares which are listed for trading. The value of these investments may vary during their period of ownership. These investments are accounted for using either the equity method (associates) if the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence, or at their fair value. If the fair value cannot be determined from a practical point of view, the value of the investment is measured at its acquisition cost.\n\nThe treasury shares held by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM are not deemed to be investments. Furthermore, the treasury shares are not deemed to be exposed to risk, since any variation in the value of these shares is only recognized directly in equity when they are sold in the market, with no impact on the net result.\n\n## Counterparty risk management\n\nThe rules concerning the management of counterparty risk are established by the RMC and applied by the sub-groups.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The maximum commitments by counterparty are determined based on the quality of their rating. The RMC also monitors the trend in the respective proportion each counterparty represents of the overall hedging portfolio (fuel, currency and interest rate) and investments. The positions of both Air/uni00A0France and KLM, together with those of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM parent company, are taken into account in the assessment of the overall exposure. A monthly report is established and circulated to the members of the General Management in the two sub-groups. It is supplemented by real time information in the event of any real risk of a rating downgrade for counterparties.\n\nThe transactions involving potential counterparty risk are as follows:\n\n- -  financial  investments;\n- -  derivative  instruments;\n- -  trade  receivables.\n\nCounterparty risk linked to financial investments and derivative instruments is managed by the Risk Management Committee which establishes limits by counterparty, for all instruments except investments in money market funds (OPCVM) for which the counterparty risk is deemed to be insignificant. The Group's counterparty-risk reporting is circulated each month to the General Management, the risk being measured at the fair market value of the various instruments. Any exceeding of a limit immediately results in the implementation of corrective measures.\n\nCounterparty risk linked to derivative instruments is taken into account in the valuation of their market value as described in Note/uni00A05.11. Derivative instruments are governed by the ISDA and FBF compensation master agreements. Within the framework of these agreements, compensation (in the event of default) must be made by counterparty for all the derivatives governed by each type of agreement.\n\nCounterparty risk relating to trade receivables is limited due to the large number and geographical diversity of the customers.\n\nThe Group has identified the following exposure to counterparty risk:\n\n| LT Rating   (Standard & Poors)   | As of  December/uni00A031,  2021   | As of  December/uni00A031,  2020   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| AAA                              | 246                                | 257                                |\n| AA                               | 322                                | 66                                 |\n| A                                | 1,893                              | 898                                |\n| BBB                              | 140                                | -                                  |\n| Total                            | 2,601                              | 1,221                              |\n\nThis presentation does not include money market funds (OPCVM) and current accounts.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe liquidity risk relates to the credit lines held by the Group, as described in Note/uni00A033.7.\n\n## 39.2/emspace Derivative  instruments\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the fair value of the Group's derivative instruments and their expected maturities are as follows:\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                      |           | Total   | Y+1   | Y+2   | Y+3   | Y+4   | Y+5   | > Y+5   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|\n| Commodities derivative instruments   | Asset     | 166     | 166   | -     | -     | -     | -     | -       |\n|                                      | Liability | (16)    | (16)  | -     | -     | -     | -     | -       |\n| Interest rate derivative instruments | Asset     | 23      | 3     | 4     | 3     | 4     | 1     | 8       |\n|                                      | Liability | (22)    | (8)   | (2)   | (3)   | (3)   | (3)   | (3)     |\n| Currency exchange derivative         | Asset     | 242     | 159   | 63    | 20    | -     | -     | -       |\n| instruments                          | Liability | (33)    | (22)  | (2)   | -     | (1)   | (8)   | -       |\n| Carbon credit derivative instruments | Asset     | 143     | 141   | 2     | -     | -     | -     | -       |\n|                                      | Liability | -       | -     | -     | -     | -     | -     | -       |\n| Other derivative instruments         | Asset     | 38      | -     | 38    | -     | -     | -     | -       |\n|                                      | Liability | -       | -     | -     | -     | -     | -     | -       |\n| Total                                | Asset     | 612     | 469   | 107   | 23    | 4     | 1     | 8       |\n|                                      | Liability | (71)    | (46)  | (4)   | (3)   | (4)   | (11)  | (3)     |",

However, the methods and assumptions used to provide the information set out below are theoretical in nature.\n\nThey include the following inherent limitations:\n\n- -  the estimated market values of financial instruments are estimated on the basis of the market price as of December/uni00A031, 2021 and December/uni00A031, 2020.\n- -  the estimated amounts as of December/uni00A031, 2021 and December/uni00A031, 2020 are not indicative of gains and/or losses potentially arising on maturity or in the event of cancellation of a financial instrument.\n\nThe application of alternative methods and assumptions may, therefore, have a significant impact on the estimated market values.\n\nThe methods used are as follows:\n\n- -  Cash, trade receivables, other receivables, short-term bank facilities, trade payables and other payables:\n- -  Marketable securities, investments and other securities:\n- The market value of securities is determined based mainly on the market price or the prices available on other similar securities. Securities classified under equity instruments are recorded at their stock market value.\n\nWhere no market comparable exists, the Group uses their book value, which is deemed a reasonable approximation of their market value in this instance.\n\n- - Borrowings, other financial liabilities and loans:\n- The market value of fixed and floating-rate loans and financial liabilities is determined based on discounted future cash flows at market interest rates for instruments with similar features.\n- -  Derivative instruments:\n\nThe market value of derivative instruments corresponds to the amounts that would be payable or receivable were the positions to be closed out as of December/uni00A031, 2021 and December/uni00A031, 2020, calculated using the year-end market rate.\n\n- The Group considers that, due to their short-term nature, net book value can be deemed a reasonable approximation of their market value.\n\nOnly the financial assets and liabilities whose fair values di/ffers from their net book values are presented in the following table:\n\n|                                            | 2021            | 2021                     | 2020            | 2020                      |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|\n| As of December/uni00A031   (in \u20ac millions) | Net book  value | Estimated  market  value | Net book  value | Estimated  market   value |\n| Financial assets                           |                 |                          |                 |                           |\n| Loans                                      | 533             | 533                      | 636             | 518                       |\n| Financial liabilities                      |                 |                          |                 |                           |\n| Bonds                                      | 2,515           | 2,428                    | 1,983           | 1,831                     |\n| OCEANE 2019                                | 476             | 448                      | 465             | 370                       |\n| Bond 2014                                  | -               | -                        | 289             | 289                       |\n| Bond \u20ac2016                                 | 361             | 366                      | 361             | 361                       |\n| Bond $2016                                 | 128             | 139                      | 118             | 138                       |\n| Bond \u20ac2020                                 | 750             | 696                      | 750             | 673                       |\n| Bond \u20ac2021-2024                            | 300             | 295                      |                 |                           |\n| Bond \u20ac2021-2026                            | 500             | 484                      |                 |                           |\n| Perpetual subordinated loans               | 548             | 466                      | 537             | 489                       |\n| Other borrowings and financial liabilities | 2,111           | 2,609                    | 2,278           | 2,530                     |",

This Statutory Auditors' report includes information required by European Regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors or verification of the information concerning the Group presented in the management report. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## For the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021\n\nTo Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0S.A. Shareholders,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meetings, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0S.A. for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\n## Emphasis of matter\n\nWe draw your attention to the change in accounting method described in Notes 3 'Restatement of the 2020 financial statements' and 5.1 'Accounting principles - Changes in accounting principles' to the consolidated financial statements,\n\nrelated to the consequences of the application of the IFRS IC decision on IAS/uni00A019 'Employee Benefits' to the methods of allocating over time the expense relating to certain defined benefit plans. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L./uni00A0823-9 and R./uni00A0823-7/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nposition of the Group as at December/uni00A031, 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for Statutory Auditors for the period from January/uni00A01, 2021 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5/thinspace (1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.",

Even though the deployment of vaccination campaigns throughout the world has enabled a recovery in summer tra/ffic due to the gradual lifting of tra/ffic restrictions and the reopening of certain borders, in particular those of the United States, in November/uni00A02021, tra/ffic in the second half of 2021 has remained below the level of activity in 2019. In addition, some countries, particularly in Asia, are not expected to reopen their borders until the second half of 2022.\n\nIn this context, Group Management continued during the financial year the measures implemented as of March/uni00A02020 to secure available liquidity.\n\nIn addition, several recapitalization and refinancing operations were implemented during the financial year 2021.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the Group's total liquidity amounted to \u20ac10.2/uni00A0billion for negative consolidated shareholders' equity of \u20ac3.8/uni00A0billion.\n\nAs indicated in Note/uni00A04.1/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors approved the financial statements on a going concern basis. The application of this principle is based on cash flow forecasts which have been developed according to three scenarios, with the pace of business recovery deferred for up to one year, and the observation that even in the worst case scenario, the Group's liquidity over more than twelve months would su/ffice to meet its obligations.\n\nThese forecasts do not take into account the additional recapitalization and/or financing projects that Management may implement in the context of the extraordinary resolutions voted at the Annual General Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021, which will allow for the provision of new liquidity when they are realized.\n\nWe therefore considered the assessment of the going concern principle as a key audit matter as it relies on the assumptions and judgment of Management and presents an inherent risk related to the achievement of cash flow forecasts, which remains uncertain by nature, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWe considered the uncertainties associated with the Covid-19 pandemic when planning and performing our audit.\n\n## Our work included:\n\n- -  analyzing Management's risk assessment with regard to the Group's operations and financial resources as compared to our own understanding of the risks associated with the Covid-19 crisis. We assessed and discussed Management's plans to mitigate these risks;\n- -  understanding the procedures used to prepare the cash flow forecasts;\n- -  performing a critical analysis of the main assumptions used in the preparation of the twelve-month cash flow forecasts derived from operations, investments and financing, based on our knowledge of the Group and Management's intentions;\n- -  assessing the consistency of the business plan used to evaluate going concern with that used for impairment tests;\n- -  reviewing the sensitivity analyses performed by Management on changes in forecasts in the event of a delay in the recovery of tra/ffic and assessing their impact on the Group's cash position over a twelve-month period;\n- -  conducting interviews with Management about the status of additional recapitalization and financing projects designed to improve existing cash flow forecasts;\n- -  conducting interviews with Management about any other events or circumstances subsequent to December/uni00A031, 2021 that could a/ffect the cash flow forecasts;\n- -  assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures on liquidity and going concern provided in Note/uni00A04.1/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Assets that cannot be directly linked to independent cash flows are grouped together into Cash Generating Units (CGU) to perform the impairment test.\n\nThe Group concluded that the CGUs correspond to the Group's business segments - the network, Maintenance and Transavia activities - which represent the smallest independent groups of assets whose use generates identifiable cash inflows.\n\nTheir value in use is determined based on particularly sensitive forward-looking assumptions, given the current health and economic situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic, including the calculation of discounted cash flows estimated from 5-year budget assumptions validated by Management and communicated to the Board of Directors, the discount rate corresponding to the weighted average cost of capital, and growth rates reflecting assumptions relating to mid- and long-term business development. The 5-year budget assumptions include the impacts of expected or probable environmental regulatory changes (increase in the cost of carbon credits,/uni00A0CO2 o/ffsetting, development of sustainable aviation fuel).\n\nWe considered the valuation of those non-current assets to be a key audit matter in light of the high degree of judgment and estimates required by Management to determine the value of its assets in a context characterized by economic uncertainty.\n\nWe assessed the procedures and controls implemented by the Group to identify indications of impairment, calculate the book value of non-current assets by CGU and determine their recoverable amount. We tested the key controls used by the Group that were in our opinion the most relevant in the design process of the asset impairment test.\n\n## Our work included:\n\n- -  assessing whether the methodology used by Management complies with current accounting standards (IAS/uni00A036), including validating the CGU independence and consistency criteria as well as the frequency of impairment tests;\n- -  reconciling the book value of the non-current assets of each tested CGU with the accounting balances and the corresponding analyses;\n- -  corroborating (i)/uni00A0the cash flow projections with the Management-approved 5-year plans, (ii)/uni00A0the intermediate period and perpetual growth rates, as well as (iii)/uni00A0profit margin rates used;\n- -  verifying the consistency of discount rate calculation assumptions such as risk-free rate, industry gearing, financing spread and specific risk premium with external market data;\n- -  evaluating assumptions used to estimate the impacts of expected or probable environmental regulatory changes;\n- -  assessing the sensitivity scenarios retained by Management by verifying arithmetic accuracy and re-performing sensitivity calculations based on WACC, the perpetual growth rate and long-term profitability;\n- -  calculating enterprise value from Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's market capitalization to corroborate the impairment test based on value in use.\n- -  assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in Notes/uni00A02, 5.16, 16 and 18/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.",

As of December/uni00A031, 2021, a net amount of \u20ac278/uni00A0million in deferred tax assets was recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for the global scope. The amount comprised \u20ac285/uni00A0million in deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards for the French tax consolidation group as presented in Note/uni00A014.4/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements. These deferred tax assets are recognized based on their likelihood of recovery pursuant to the medium-term budgets and plans prepared by the Group. As presented in Note/uni00A014.4/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements, the recovery period for these deferred tax assets of the French tax consolidation group is five years. Unrecognized deferred tax assets relating to the tax losses of the French tax consolidation group amounted to \u20ac3,514/uni00A0million as presented in Note/uni00A014.5/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe identified this issue as a key audit matter due to the significant amount of French tax loss carryforwards and the high degree of judgments and estimates made by the Group to assess the validity of the related deferred tax assets recognized.\n\nOur audit approach consisted in examining the compliance of the Group's approach with IAS/uni00A012 and assessing the probability of the Company making future use of the tax loss carryforwards generated to date, particularly with regard to:\n\n- -  deferred tax liabilities in the same tax jurisdiction, where the base could be o/ffset against deferred tax assets with the same maturity; and\n- -  the Group's ability to generate future taxable profits in the French tax jurisdiction in order to use prior-year tax losses recognized as deferred tax assets.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the methodology adopted by the Group to identify existing tax loss carryforwards that will be utilized, either through deferred tax liabilities or future taxable profits.\n\nTo determine future taxable profits, we assessed the forecasting process by:\n\n- -  examining the procedure for preparing the most recent taxable income forecasts used as a basis for estimates;\n- -  comparing prior year income forecasts with actual results;\n- -  comparing the assumptions used by Management to prepare taxable income forecasts used to assess deferred taxes with those adopted for non-current asset impairment tests.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in Notes/uni00A05.24 and 14/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The revenue related to passenger transportation is recognized when the transportation service is provided and, consequently, passenger tickets are recorded when issued as 'Deferred revenue on ticket sales' for a liability amounting to \u20ac2,644/uni00A0million as at December/uni00A031, 2021. However, a portion of these sales, relating to tickets that have been issued but which will never be used, is recognized as revenue at the theoretical date of transport, based on statistical rates that are regularly updated. These rates are determined by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group based on historical data taken from the information systems and adjusted for non-recurring events that could impact passenger behavior.\n\nWe considered the recognition of deferred revenue on ticket sales to be a key audit matter due to the importance of the Group judgment in determining the recognition assumptions.\n\nWe assessed the procedures and controls implemented by the Group to determine the statistical rates for 'Deferred revenue on ticket sales.'\n\nOur procedures primarily consisted in:\n\n- -  assessing the appropriateness of the methodology adopted by the Group;\n- -  corroborating the historical database with the databases used;\n- -  corroborating the statistical rate calculations;\n- -  evaluating and analyzing the impact of adjustments made for non-recurring and specific events related to the health crisis;\n- -  analyzing the age of deferred revenue on ticket sales presented in liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet to assess the appropriateness of the revenue recognized in the period.\n\n## Provisions for litigations and contingent liabilities (Notes/uni00A05.21, 32.1 and 32.2/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements)\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is involved in several governmental, judicial or arbitration procedures and litigations, particularly concerning anti-trust laws, as specified in Notes/uni00A032.1 and 32.2/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements. The outcome of these procedures and litigations depends on future events, and the Company's estimates are inherently based on the use of Group assumptions and assessments.\n\nWe considered the measurement of the provisions for litigation and contingent liabilities to be a key audit matter due to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of current proceedings, the high degree of Group estimates and judgment and the potentially material nature of the impact of provision amounts on consolidated net income and equity should these estimates change.\n\nWe specifically assessed the estimates and assumptions adopted by the Group in determining the need to recognize a provision and, where applicable, its amount.\n\nBased on discussions with the Group, we assessed the analysis of the risks done by the management and status of each significant litigation, whether reported or potential.\n\nWe assessed the items justifying the recognition or not of a provision. We analyzed the lawyers' replies to management's enquiries, the exchanges between the Company, its lawyers and other parties to the suits and considered any new developments up to the issue date of our report.\n\nBased on these items, we conducted a critical review of the estimates and positions adopted by the Group.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Notes/uni00A05.21, 32.1 and 32.2/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.",

This information should be reported on by an Independent Third Party.\n\n## Other Legal and Regulatory Verifications or Information\n\n## Format of presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L./uni00A0451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (code mon\u00e9taire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of Chief Executive O/fficer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No. 2019/815/uni00A0of December/uni00A017, 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended\n\nto be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0S.A. by the Annual General Meetings held on September/uni00A025, 1998 for Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and on September/uni00A025, 2002 for KPMG Audit, department of KPMG/uni00A0S.A.\n\nAs at December/uni00A031, 2021, Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s was in the 24 th /uni00A0 year of total uninterrupted engagement and KPMG Audit, department of KPMG/uni00A0S.A. was in the 20 th /uni00A0 year of total uninterrupted engagement, which are the 23 rd /uni00A0year and 20 th /uni00A0y ear since securities of the Company were admitted to trading on a regulated market, respectively.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going\n\nconcern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the e/ffectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its Internal Audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L./uni00A0823-10-1/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code, our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ffairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- -  identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- -  obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the internal control;\n- -  evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- -  assesses the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This\n\nassessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n\n- -  evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- -  obtains su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6/uni00A0of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L./uni00A0 822-10/uni00A0to L./uni00A0822-14/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February/uni00A018, 2022\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\n## KPMG Audit\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nDepartment of KPMG S.A.\n\nVal\u00e9rie Besson Partner\n\n\u00c9ric Dupr\u00e9 Partner\n\nPascal Colin Partner\n\nGuillaume Crunelle Partner",

It is listed for trading in Paris (Euronext) and Amsterdam (Euronext).\n\n## 1./emspace Accounting policies and procedures\n\nGenerally accepted accounting policies have been applied, consistent with the prudence principle and in accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions applicable in France and to the base assumptions whose aim is to provide a true and faithful representation of the company:\n\n- -  going  concern;\n- -  consistent accounting methods from year to year;\n- -  independence of financial periods;\n\nand in accordance with the general rules for establishing and presenting annual financial statements.\n\nThe basic method used to value items recorded in the financial statements is the historical cost method.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn determining the appropriate basis for preparing the financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021, the Board of Directors considered the Group as a going concern by evaluating the financial forecasts over a time horizon of at least one year and by analyzing, in particular, the trading position of the Group in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic and taking into account the following elements:\n\nThe Group had total cash of \u20ac10/uni00A0billion at December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nThe 2022 budget, as modelled by the management and approved by the Board of Directors, assumes a gradual ramp-up in passenger demand.\n\nThis plan will ensure a level of liquidity considered to be adequate thanks to the following elements:\n\n- -  the adjustment of the flight schedule and capacity to the expected demand in order to operate only flights having a positive incremental impact in terms of operating cash flow;\n- -  the continued specific mechanisms from the French and Dutch governments to partially cover sta/ff costs through the 'NOW' program in the Netherlands and the Long-Term Partial Activity ('APLD') in France;\n- -  a high level of variable costs linked to a reduction in capacity;\n- -  the reduction in the capital expenditure plans;\n- -  the systematic refinancing secured by assets of new aircraft delivered from manufacturers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on these financial forecasts, the banking covenants applicable in 2022, including the \u20ac2.46/uni00A0billion Revolving Credit Facility at the level of KLM, are met.\n\nIn addition, the Group is working on financing projects, pursuant to the European Regulation, which would increase the stockholders' equity and provide further liquidity and secure access to additional financing secured by assets.\n\nLastly, and more generally, the French and Dutch States have shown their support to enable Air/uni00A0France and KLM to weather the current di/fficulties.\n\nConsidering these elements, the Board of Directors thus considers it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the basis of the going concern principle.\n\n## Value in use of its equity investments\n\nIn the current context, the company has paid particular attention to the value in use of its equity investments.\n\n## The main accounting methods used are the following:\n\n## Long-term investments\n\nInvestments in equity securities are presented on the balance sheet at their acquisition cost net of impairment, if any. A provision for impairment is recorded as soon as the fair value, which corresponds to the value in use, falls below the acquisition value. The fair value of securities is determined by taking into account the share of shareholders' equity, the outlook for profitability and the stock market values that can be used as a reference.\n\nTransfer taxes, fees or commissions and legal fees related to the acquisition of securities are expensed, according to the option o/ffered by the regulations.\n\nTreasury shares not allocated to employees or to a capital decrease are booked in long-term investments. They are shown at the lower of their acquisition cost or fair value. The fair value is determined based on the average market price for the last month of the financial year.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are valued at their nominal value. They are valued on a case-by-case basis and a provision is set up as required based on the assessed risks.\n\n## Marketable securities\n\nMarketable securities are shown on the balance sheet at the lower of their acquisition cost and their market value. In the case of listed shares, this market value is determined based on the market price at the end of the financial year.",

Interest is booked as financial income, on a-prorata temporis basis.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nOperating expense and income transactions in foreign currencies are recognized at the average exchange rate for each relevant month.\n\nTrade payable and receivable in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate in e/ffect at end year closing.\n\nUnrealized losses and gains are recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. Provisions are established for unrealized losses, except for the following cases:\n\n- -  transactions where the currency and the term contribute to an overall positive currency position and;\n- -  currency hedging contracts concerning the payment of future investment deliveries.\n\n## Debts\n\nDebts are valued at their nominal amount. The debt in foreign currency is valued at the closing rate Euro/Dollar.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial derivative instruments are used to reduce exposure to interest rates risk and to foreign exchange. They are over the counter instruments with first class counterpart.

To this end, the Dutch government had to sell its cumulative preferred shares to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or to a Dutch foundation in the name of and on behalf of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, if the transfer had occurred during the first three years following the business combination.\n\nIn the latter case, the foundation would have issue, to the benefit of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, share certificates corresponding to the cumulative A preferred shares transferred to the foundation. These share certificates would have conferred to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM all of the economic rights attached to the said shares, the voting rights attached to the said shares being exercised by the foundation until Air/uni00A0France exchanges the share certificates against the said shares.\n\nAt the end of the initial three-year period, Air/uni00A0France-KM had the option to exchange the share certificates against the cumulative A preferred shares, which it could hold directly. As Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM decided in 2007 to maintain SAK I and SAK II foundations, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM did not carry out this exchange. Furthermore, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM can decide to dissolute the foundations at any time and at its sole discretion.\n\nMoreover, the Dutch government has the right to sell to Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM at any time as many cumulative A preferred shares as it wants.\n\nAfter the sale of 5,103,885/uni00A0shares to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in April/uni00A02005 for \u20ac11.6/uni00A0million, the acquisition price of the 3,708,615/uni00A0cumulative A preferred shares still held by the Dutch government amounts to \u20ac8.4/uni00A0million (i.e. a unit price of \u20ac2.27/uni00A0per cumulative A preferred share, which has to be paid pro rata during any sale or transfer under the conditions above).\n\n## Hedges\n\nThe December/uni00A018, 2016, $145/uni00A0million bond is fully hedged by a cross currency swap. As of December/uni00A031, 2021, the fair value of this derivative instrument is \u20ac (8) million (see Note/uni00A012.2).\n\n## Other\n\nSince January/uni00A02009, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has acted as a guarantor for Air/uni00A0France Company within the framework of its commitments to A\u00e9roport de Paris in respect of civil leases. This guarantee has been renewed in July/uni00A02014 and more recently on 23/uni00A0September/uni00A02019 for a period of 5/uni00A0years. The guarantee is now expressly limited to \u20ac19/uni00A0million (and, cumulatively, at a maximum of 3/uni00A0months' rent per contract).\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM guarantees a debt that KLM holds on the Airline GOL for an amount of $50/uni00A0million. This guarantee expired on 30/uni00A0June/uni00A02021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

On 17/uni00A0March/uni00A02017, the European Commission issued a new decision against eleven air cargo carriers, including Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair. The total amount of fines imposed on the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is \u20ac339/uni00A0million. This amount has been reduced by \u20ac15/uni00A0million as compared to the initial decision owing to a lower fine for Martinair due to technical reasons. On 29 and 30/uni00A0May/uni00A02017, the Group companies filed an appeal against this decision before the General Court of the European Union. The Group has maintained a provision covering these fines.\n\nIn Switzerland, Air/uni00A0France and KLM are challenging a decision imposing a \u20ac4/uni00A0million fine before the relevant court. The subsidiaries of the Group have provisioned the totality of this fine.\n\nThose provisions are booked by each airlines and do not have any impact in the financial statements of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\n## 18./emspace Contingent  liabilities\n\nFollowing the initiation of various investigations by the competition authorities in 2006 and the European Commission decision in 2010, several collective and individual actions were brought by forwarders and airfreight shippers in the civil courts against Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, and other cargo operators, in a number of jurisdictions.\n\nUnder these civil lawsuits, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is involved as the parent company of the airlines. Shippers and freight forwarders are claiming for damages to compensate alleged higher prices due to alleged competition law infringement.\n\nAir/uni00A0France, KLM and/or Martinair remain defendants, either as main defendants (in particular in The Netherlands, Norway) or as third party interveners brought in these cases by other main defendants under 'contribution proceedings'. Where Air/uni00A0France, KLM and/or Martinair are the main defendants, they have also initiated contribution proceedings against other airlines.\n\nAlthough significant amounts have been reported by the media, plainti/ffs are mostly claiming for unspecified and/or insu/fficiently substantiated damages against defendants taken as a whole (and not individually) and the EU decision to which the plainti/ffs refer to is still not definitive.\n\nThe Group companies and the other airlines involved in these lawsuits continue to vigorously oppose all such civil claims.\n\nExcept for the matters specified under the paragraphs 17 and 18, the company is not aware of any governmental, judicial and arbitration dispute or proceedings (including any proceedings of which the issuer is aware, or that are pending or threatened against it) that could have a significant impact on the company's financial position, earnings, assets, liabilities or profitability, for a period covering at least the past twelve months.\n\n## 19./emspace Subsequent  events\n\nThere were no post-closing events.",

This Statutory Auditors' report includes information required by European Regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## Year ended December/uni00A031, 2021\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meetings, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0S.A. for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\nthe Company as of December/uni00A031, 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for Statutory Auditors for the period from January/uni00A01, 2021 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5/thinspace (1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L./uni00A0823-9 and R./uni00A0823-7/uni00A0of the\n\nFrench Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the annual financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.",

Even though the deployment of vaccination campaigns throughout the world has enabled a recovery in summer tra/ffic due to the gradual lifting of tra/ffic restrictions and the reopening of certain borders, in particular those of the United States, in November/uni00A02021, tra/ffic in the second half of 2021 has remained below the level of activity in 2019. In addition, some countries, particularly in Asia, are not expected to reopen their borders until the second half of 2022.\n\nIn this context, Group Management continued during the financial year the measures implemented as of March/uni00A02020 to secure available liquidity.\n\nIn addition, several recapitalization and refinancing operations were implemented during the financial year 2021.\n\nAs shown in Note/uni00A01/uni00A0to the financial statements, the Board of Directors approved the financial statements on a going concern basis by assessing cash flow forecasts over a period of at least one year.\n\nWe therefore considered the impact of the health crisis on liquidity and going concern to be a key audit matter as it relies on the assumptions and judgment of Management and presents an inherent risk related to the achievement of cash flow forecasts, which remains uncertain by nature, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWe considered the uncertainties associated with the Covid-19 pandemic when planning and performing our audit.\n\n## Our work included:\n\n- -  analyzing Management's risk assessment with regard to the Group's operations and financial resources as compared to our own understanding of the risks associated with the Covid-19 crisis. We assessed and discussed Management's plans to mitigate these risks;\n- -  understanding the procedures used to prepare the cash flow forecasts;\n- -  performing a critical analysis of the main assumptions used in the preparation of the twelve-month cash flow forecasts derived from operations, investments and financing, based on our knowledge of the Group and Management's intentions;\n- -  assessing the consistency of the business plan used to evaluate going concern with that used for impairment tests;\n- -  reviewing the sensitivity analyses performed by Management on changes in forecasts in the event of a delay in the recovery of tra/ffic and assessing their impact on the Group's cash position over a twelve-month period;\n- -  conducting interviews with Management about the status of additional recapitalization and financing projects designed to improve existing cash flow forecasts;\n- -  conducting interviews with Management about any other events or circumstances subsequent to December/uni00A031, 2021 that could a/ffect the cash flow forecasts;\n- -  assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures on liquidity and going concern provided in Note/uni00A01/uni00A0to the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are recorded as of their entry date at acquisition cost and impaired based on their fair value, which corresponds to their value in use, by taking into account the share of equity or cash flow or profitability outlooks.\n\nThe value in use estimate of these long-term investments requires Management to exercise judgment in its choice of items to consider according to the nature of the investments concerned. Such items may correspond, as the case may be, to historical items (equity) or forecast items (cash flow and profitability outlooks and economic situation in the countries considered).\n\nWe considered the measurement of equity securities (and the related receivables) to be a key audit matter because of i) the uncertainties inherent to certain assumptions and specifically the probability that forecasts will be realized in the Covid-19 pandemic health crisis and ii) the potential importance of an impairment provision charge or reversal for these securities in the Company's accounts.\n\nTo assess the reasonableness of the value in use estimate of equity securities, based on the information communicated us, our work mainly consisted in verifying that the estimate of these values, as determined by Management, is based an appropriate justification of the valuation method and the figures used, and according to the securities concerned, in:\n\n- -  for valuations based on historical data: verifying that the equity retained is consistent with the accounts of the entities that were the subject of an audit or analytical procedures and that any equity adjustments are based on probative documentation;\n- -  for valuations based on historical items:\n- -  obtaining the valuations of the relevant entities based on their discounted future cash flows;\n- -  verifying the consistency of the assumptions adopted with the economic environment on the dates the accounts were prepared and closed;\n- -  comparing the forecasts adopted for preceding periods with the corresponding realizations in order to assess the achievement of past objectives;\n- -  verifying that the value resulting from cash flow forecasts was adjusted for the debt of the entity considered;\n- -  verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the value in use calculations performed.\n\nIn addition to assessing the realizable value of equity securities, our work also consisted in assessing the recoverability of the related receivables based on analyses of the equity securities.\n\n## Measurement of provisions and contingent liabilities concerning anti-trust laws (Notes/uni00A017 and 18/uni00A0to the financial statements)\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is involved in several governmental, judicial or arbitration procedures and litigations, particularly concerning anti-trust laws.The outcome of these procedures and litigations depends on future events, and the Company's estimates are inherently based on the use of Management assumptions and assessments.\n\nWe considered the measurement of the provisions for litigation and contingent liabilities concerning anti-trust laws to be a key audit matter due to the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of current proceedings, the high degree of Management estimates and judgment and the potentially material nature of the impact of provision amounts on net income and equity should these estimates change.\n\nBased on discussions with the Company, we assessed the analysis of the risks done by management and the status of each significant litigation, whether reported or potential.\n\nWe assessed the items justifying the recognition or not of a provision and performed a critical analysis of Management's estimates and positions. We analyzed the lawyers' replies to Management's enquiries, the exchanges between the Company, its lawyers and other parties to the suits and considered any new developments up to the issue date of our report.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in Notes/uni00A017 and 18/uni00A0to the financial statements.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L./uni00A0823-10-1/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ffairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- -  identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- -  obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the internal control;\n\n- -  evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the financial statements;\n- -  assesses the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- -  evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Risk Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as significant audit findings. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. It should be understood that the agreements and commitments reported on are only those provided for by the French Commercial Code and that the report does not apply to those related-party transactions described in IAS/uni00A024 or other equivalent accounting standards.\n\n## General Meeting of Shareholders held to approve the financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021\n\nTo the Shareholders of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0S.A.,\n\nAs Statutory Auditors of your company, we hereby present our special report on related-party agreements.\n\nWe are required to inform you, on the basis of the information provided to us, of the terms and conditions, the purpose, and the benefits to the Company of the agreements of which we were informed or became aware of during our engagement. It is not our role to determine whether they are beneficial or appropriate or to ascertain whether any other agreements exist. It is your responsibility, in accordance with Article R./uni00A0225-31/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), to assess the relevance of these agreements with a view to approving them.\n\nIn addition, we are required to inform you, where appropriate, in accordance with Article R./uni00A0225-31/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code, of the agreements already approved at the General Meeting of Shareholders.\n\nWe performed the procedures that we deemed necessary in accordance with the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) applicable to this engagement. Our work entailed verifying that the information provided is consistent with the documents from which it was derived.\n\n## Agreements submitted for approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders\n\n## Agreements authorized and/or concluded during the year\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article L./uni00A0225-40/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce), we have been informed of the following agreements which have been subject to prior authorization by your Board of Directors throughout the year.\n\nConclusion of a commitment to subscribe to a capital increase, a subscription contract for the issuance of Super-Subordinated Securities of Indefinite Duration and an amendment to the Shareholder Loan agreement between the Company and the French State\n\n## Directors concerned\n\n- -  French State, shareholder with a fraction of the voting rights greater than 10%;\n- -  Mr. Martin Vial, director representing the French State appointed by ministerial decree.\n- -  Ms. Astrid Panosyan and Mr. Jean-Dominique Comolli, directors appointed at the General Meeting of Shareholders upon the proposal of the French State.\n\n## Nature, purpose, terms and conditions\n\nYour Board of Directors, gathered on April/uni00A05, 2021 previously authorized the conclusion of the following two agreements and involving, directly or indirectly, the French State, which is a shareholder currently holding 14.3% of the Company's share capital:\n\n- (i) on April/uni00A012, 2021, a subscription commitment from the French State for 65.86% of the increase in the Company's\n\ncapital (excluding the exercise of the extension clause) with the cancellation of the preferential subscription right and with a period of priority for profit shareholders, with a maximum total number of 213,999,999/uni00A0new shares (the 'Subscription Commitment of the French State to the Capital Increase').\n\nPayment/delivery of 122/uni00A0560/uni00A0251/uni00A0new shares subscribed by the French State intervened on April/uni00A022, 2021 for a price of \u20ac4.84/uni00A0per share;\n\n- (ii) on 20/uni00A0April/uni00A02021, a subscription contract relating to the issue by the Company and the subscription by the French State of super-subordinated securities of indefinite duration (the 'Super-Subordinated Securities') for a total amount of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion by o/ffsetting the claims it held on the Company under the Shareholder Loan agreement dated 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02020 concluded between the French State and the Company (the 'Shareholder Loan') and fully drawn for a total of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion (the 'Super-Subordinated Securities Subscription Agreement').",

        "page_content": "The issue of Super-Subordinated Securities consists of three perpetual maturity instalments with a nominal amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0 billion each, each with a first repayment option (call) at 4, 5 and 6/uni00A0years and then repayable on each interest payment date, bearing interest at the initial rate of 7.00%, 7.25% and 7.50% respectively. These initial interest rates for each instalment will increase to 8.50%, 8.00% and 8.00% respectively, on the first respective prepayment date and at the Company's option, of the relevant instalment. These interest rates will then be revised annually from 20/uni00A0 April/uni00A0 2028, based on the 12-month Euribor rate plus a margin of 10.40%, it being specified that the applicable 12-month Euribor rate will not be less than -0.45%. The Company will have the option to defer payment of interest at its discretion, in whole or in part. Deferred interest on the Super-Subordinated Securities will be accumulated and capitalized.\n\nThe payment of interest will nevertheless become mandatory in the event of a dividend payment or the repurchase of equity securities, subject to certain usual exceptions.\n\nThese Super-Subordinated Securities may be converted by o/ffsetting receivables in the context of future issues of quasi-equity securities or capital increases.\n\nYour Board of Directors meeting on April/uni00A06, 2021 also previously authorized the conclusion, which took place on April/uni00A020, 2021, an amendment to the Shareholder Loan concluded between the Company and the French State on May/uni00A06, 2020, after the prior authorization of your Board of Directors on April/uni00A024, 2020. The purpose of this amendment is to modify certain stipulations of the Shareholder Loan, in order to allow the repayment of the Shareholder Loan by way of conversion into Super-Subordinated Securities issued by the Company.\n\nThe financial expenses incurred by the Company over the first twelve-month period, considering that the Company does not use the possibility of deferring interest payments at its\n\ndiscretion, would amount to approximately \u20ac217.5/uni00A0million for Super-Subordinated Securities.\n\nFor the year ended 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02021, the amount of interest recognized as an expense was \u20ac151/uni00A0million for Super-Subordinated Securities and \u20ac63/uni00A0million for the Shareholder Loan (until 20/uni00A0April/uni00A02021).\n\n## Reasons justifying the interest of the agreements for the Company\n\nYour Board of Directors considered that:\n\n- -  the French State's Subscription Commitment to the Capital Increase and the Subscription Contract for SuperSubordinated Securities were to be concluded in order to enable the Group to strengthen its own funds in the context of the Covid-19 crisis;\n- -  the capital increase referred to in the French State's Subscription Commitment to the Capital Increase was thus expected to improve the Group's equity by one (1) billion euros in IFRS and French accounting standards, and to provide the Group with the same amount of cash for the benefit of Air/uni00A0France;\n- -  the issuance of the Super-Subordinated Securities covered by the Super-Subordinated Securities Subscription Agreement was thus expected to improve the Group's equity by \u20ac3/uni00A0billion in IFRS accounting standards, without impact on cash, while increasing the Group's flexibility in its mandatory debt repayment profile spread over time (with a Non-call period ranging from 4/uni00A0to 6/uni00A0years). The Amendment to the Shareholder Loan was to make it possible to repay the Shareholder Loan by conversion into Super-Subordinated Securities;\n- -  as this crisis has had a considerable impact on the Company's activity, its financial situation will not allow for a sustainable recovery of activity. Therefore, the conclusion of these agreements appeared necessary for the sustainability of the Company.\n\n## Extension of the cooperation agreement concluded with China Eastern Airlines Co. Ltd\n\n## Persons concerned\n\n- -  China Eastern Airlines Co. Ltd, shareholder with a fraction of the voting rights greater than 10%;\n- -  Mr. Jian Wang, director appointed by the general meeting on the proposal of China Eastern Airlines Co. Ltd.\n\n## Nature, purpose, terms and conditions\n\nAs part of the Group's recapitalization plan announced on April/uni00A06, 2021, your Board of Directors meeting on April/uni00A05, 2021, previously authorized the conclusion, on June/uni00A023, 2021, of an agreement with China Eastern to accelerate their e/fforts to deepen and expand existing and future cooperation and further strengthen their partnership for transport services between China and Europe (the 'CEA Trade Agreement').\n\nThe CEA Trade Agreement sets out the ambitions to increase cooperation between China Eastern, the Company, Air/uni00A0France\n\nand Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. (KLM). The Parties intend to strengthen their commercial cooperation (exclusive partnership from 1 er /uni00A0January/uni00A02022 for air passenger transport between Europe and China, improvement of the codeshare o/ffer, reinforced alignment of fares and sales policy,/uni00A0etc.) and expand cooperation.\n\nIn particular, the parties undertake to:\n\n- -  integrate the Paris-Beijing and Amsterdam-Beijing routes into the CEA Trade Agreement, subject to compliance with the agreed terms;\n- -  accelerate their e/fforts to deepen existing cooperation on trade, operational, marketing and innovation policy aspects, in particular through sta/ff exchanges;\n- -  explore new opportunities for cooperation in the field of passenger transport on the aspects of competition rules, alliances and technologies;\n\n<!-- image -->",

These ambitions will therefore have to be defined and will subsequently be implemented\n\nseparately in the exclusive partnership agreement between the parties for air passenger transport between Europe and China.\n\n## Reasons justifying the interest of the agreement for the Company\n\nYour Board of Directors considered that this agreement should be concluded in the context of equity strengthening operations and with the aim of enabling the Group to strengthen its commercial cooperation with China Eastern, as well as its position on the Chinese market.\n\n## Conclusion of an amendment to the Loan Guaranteed by the French State\n\n## Directors concerned\n\n- -  French State, shareholder with a fraction of the voting rights greater than 10%;\n- -  Mr. Martin Vial, director representing the French State appointed by ministerial decree.\n- -  Ms. Astrid Panosyan and Mr. Jean-Dominique Comolli, directors appointed at the General Meeting of Shareholders upon the proposal of the French State.\n\n## Nature, purpose, terms and conditions\n\nTo cope with the impacts of the Covid crisis on the Group's cash flow level, your Board of Directors meeting on 24/uni00A0April/uni00A02020 had previously authorized the conclusion, on 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02020, of a \u20ac4/uni00A0billion loan granted by a consortium of banks and guaranteed 90% by the French State under the regime set up by Law No. 2020.-280/uni00A0of 23/uni00A0March/uni00A02020 (the 'State-Guaranteed Loan'). The French State was a shareholder of the Company to the tune of 14.3% of its share capital at the time of the conclusion of the agreement.\n\nIn order to smooth the repayment profile of the State-Guaranteed Loan beyond its 2023 maturity, your Board of Directors meeting on 11/uni00A0October/uni00A02021 has previously authorized the conclusion, reached on December/uni00A010, 2021, with the consortium of banks and the French State and after approval by the European Commission, of an amendment to the State-Guaranteed Loan (the 'Amendment').\n\nThe maturity of the State-Guaranteed Loan, initially planned at one year, renewable once for a period of one or two years by hand of the borrower, was contractually set at May/uni00A07, 2023, after exercise by the Company, in February/uni00A02021, of the two-year extension option.\n\nThe Amendment amended the following stipulations of the State-Guaranteed Loan:\n\n- -  the final maturity date of the State-Guaranteed Loan is extended by a further two years and is therefore set at 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02025;\n- -  the State-Guaranteed Loan will now be reimbursed by amortization according to the following schedule:\n\n- -  \u20ac500/uni00A0million on the date of signature of the Amendment. The funds to make this early repayment came from the proceeds of the bond issues of 24/uni00A0June/uni00A02021;\n- -  \u20ac800/uni00A0million as at 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02023;\n- -  \u20ac1.350/uni00A0billion as at 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02024;\n- -  \u20ac1.350/uni00A0billion as at 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02025;\n- -  the State-Guaranteed Loan will bear interest at the rate of: Euribor 3/uni00A0months (with a floor at zero) with an annual margin between 0.75% and 2.75%, it being specified that this margin will now apply according to the following schedule: 1.50% from 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02021 (inclusive) until 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02022 (excluded) and 2.75% from 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02022;\n- -  the guarantee commission will apply according to the following schedule: 1.0% from 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02021 (inclusive) until 6/uni00A0 May/uni00A0 2023 (excluded) and 2.0% from 6/uni00A0May/uni00A02023. Until 6/uni00A0 May/uni00A0 2023 (excluding), it will be calculated on the basis of the initial amount of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion. Subsequently, the basis of calculation will be deducted from the reimbursements provided for and mentioned above.\n\nMandatory reimbursement clauses (' Mandatory Prepayments') are provided for in the contract, in particular in the case of debt issues resulting from capital market on the bond market up to a limit of 75% of the amounts raised, excluding hybrid instruments, convertible bonds or quasi-equity repayments to be made under bond and convertible lines existing on the date of signature of the Addendum and whose maturity falls during the term of the State-Guaranteed Loan thus extended.\n\nFor the year ended 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02021, the amount of the guarantee fee recognized as an expense was \u20ac33/uni00A0million.\n\n## Reasons justifying the interest of the agreement for the Company\n\nYour Board of Directors considered that the conclusion of the Amendment allowed the Company to smooth its repayment profile over time and thus balance the schedule of the Group's consolidated debt.",

This last decision, authorized by your Board of Directors meeting on October/uni00A030, 2019, led to the modification of the agreements relating to the Partnership that had been concluded on May/uni00A015, 2018 and authorized by your Board of Directors at its meetings of March/uni00A014 and May/uni00A015, 2018, without this impacting the Company's position in the commercial joint-venture associating Delta, Virgin and the Company.\n\nGiven the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the implementation of joint-existing ventures of the Air/uni00A0France group-KLM, your Board of Directors meeting on 4/uni00A0December/uni00A02020 authorized, following the review of the financial conditions of the agreements by the various partners, the temporary adjustment of the provisions relating to the 'Settlement' (financial mechanism to allocate revenues and costs generated by the joint-venture) provided for in the Joint Venture Agreement (Joint Venture Agreement). The other provisions of this agreement remain unchanged.\n\nOn December/uni00A018, 2020, the 'waiver' between the Company, Delta and Virgin was signed regarding the adjustment of the financial provisions relating to the 'settlement' for the calendar year 2020. In this context, each party waived all rights it could\n\nhave in respect of the amounts due to it under the Joint Venture Agreement for the calendar year 2020, and agreed to waive them permanently. In accordance with the waiver conditions, the duration of the waiver may be extended to the financial years of 2021 and 2022 by mutual agreement of the parties due to the length of the repercussions of the Covid-19 epidemic on the operations of the joint-venture.\n\nThe Partnership agreements that were in e/ffect in fiscal year 2021 were as follows:\n\n- -  Joint Venture Agreement (Joint Venture Agreement) between Delta, Virgin, the Company, KLM and Air/uni00A0France, to set up a joint commercial venture between these companies, concluded on 30/uni00A0January/uni00A02020 with e/ffect from 1 er /uni00A0 January/uni00A02020).

To this end, the Dutch State will sell its cumulative preferential A shares to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or to SAK I on behalf of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as long as this foundation is maintained. In such case, SAK I will issue share certificates to the benefit of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM corresponding to the cumulative preferential A shares transferred to SAK I. These share certificates confer to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM the economic right attached to the transferred cumulative preferential A shares, i.e. a right to a dividend, the corresponding voting rights being exercised by SAK I until the share certificates have been exchanged by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM against the said shares.\n\nIn March/uni00A02005, pursuant to the agreement, 5,103,885/uni00A0cumulative preference A shares were transferred by the Dutch State to SAK I on behalf of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, which received, in return, SAK I share certificates.\n\nAt the end of the initial three-year period (2004 to 2007), Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM had the option to exchange the share certificates against cumulative preferential A shares, and to directly hold the cumulative preferential A shares. Having decided, in 2007, to maintain the SAK I and SAK II foundations, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM did not proceed with this exchange but could still do so at any time, in whole or in part. In addition, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is free to decide to dissolve the foundations at any time and at its sole discretion.\n\nFurthermore, the Dutch State benefits from the right to transfer, at any time, as many cumulative preferential A shares as it wishes to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\nThese agreements relating to the cumulative preferential A shares remain in force.\n\n## Option for the Dutch State to subscribe for preferential KLM B shares\n\nThis option granted to the Dutch State lapsed in May/uni00A02010.\n\n## Assurances given to the Dutch State\n\n## Nature and duration of the assurances - unilateral termination option\n\nWithin the framework of the 2004 business combination, Air/uni00A0 France and KLM granted the Dutch State, for an initial eight-year period starting from the completion of the business combination (i.e. expiring in 2012), various assurances as to KLM's airline status, its air services and the scale of its passenger and cargo operations at Schiphol airport with a view to maintaining the quality of KLM's network at Schiphol which, according to the Dutch State, is of public interest, while at the same time taking into account the interests of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and its shareholders (the 'Assurances').\n\nIn return for these Assurances, the Dutch State undertook to take the importance of KLM's activities at Schiphol into consideration when defining its civil aviation policy. Furthermore, the Dutch State agreed to:\n\n- -  maintain the existing portfolio of tra/ffic rights granted to KLM, other than those that have not been used by KLM over a cumulative period of twelve months;\n- -  continue to review any future request submitted by KLM for the allocation of new tra/ffic rights on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.\n\nPursuant to an agreement entered into on May/uni00A025, 2010, the Dutch State, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and KLM agreed to extend the Assurances given to the Dutch State, with the exclusion, however, of an assurance foreseeing that the combined growth should not negatively impact KLM's operations in the passenger and cargo segment, beyond May/uni00A05, 2012 for an indefinite period, subject to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's right to terminate these Assurances, at its sole discretion, with prior notice of nine months. This agreement was confirmed by a meeting between, inter alia, the Minister for Transportation of the Netherlands, the Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and the President of the Management Board of KLM which took place on March/uni00A012, 2015.\n\n## Mechanism to ensure compliance with the Assurances\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM set up a Dutch foundation, known as the KLM Assurances Foundation (Stichting Assurances KLM - duration extended in 2010) to facilitate the provision of binding advice (bindend advise) on the interpretation of the Assurances granted to the Dutch State (the 'Advice'). These advices are issued by a KLM Assurances Foundation Committee in the event that a decision taken by the KLM Supervisory Board, KLM Management Board or Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors is considered to be in conflict with the Assurances given to the Dutch State.",

The Committee's decisions are adopted by majority vote of its members.\n\nAs at December/uni00A031, 2021, no Advice had been rendered by the KLM Assurances Foundation Committee.\n\n## 6.3.3/emspace Assurances given to KLM\n\nThe assurances granted to KLM have been null and void since May/uni00A06, 2009.\n\n## 6.4/emspace LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR THE AIR TRANSPORT INDUSTRY\n\nCommercial air transport is governed by eight freedoms, national and supranational legislation, and various international conventions that each State undertakes to apply in its air space after their ratification.\n\n## 6.4.1/emspace Freedoms of the air and international conventions\n\nIn addition to the eight freedoms of the air established by the Chicago Agreements relating to transit and transport (1944), three main treaties establish the legal and regulatory framework for commercial aviation: the Chicago Convention (1944), the Montreal Convention (1999) and the Tokyo Convention (1963). A fourth treaty, the Rome Convention (1952), covers damage caused to third parties on the ground.\n\n## Freedoms of the air\n\nUnder a bilateral treaty, an air carrier has freedoms that allow it to operate in the air space and the territory of a State other than its State of origin. These eight freedoms are as follows:\n\n- -  1 st /uni00A0f reedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to overfly the air space of a foreign State;\n- -  2 nd /uni00A0 freedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to make a technical layover without unloading or loading passengers in a foreign State. This freedom is the 'transit right';\n- -  3 rd /uni00A0 freedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to unload passengers from its State of origin in a foreign State;\n- -  4 th /uni00A0freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has the right to load passengers in this foreign State and unload them in its State of origin;\n- -  5 th /uni00A0f reedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to unload and load passengers in two successive foreign States;\n- -  6 th /uni00A0freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has the right to load passengers in that State and unload them in its State of origin, then in another foreign State;\n- -  7 th /uni00A0freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has the right to load passengers in that State to unload them in another foreign State, without going through its State of origin;\n- -  8 th /uni00A0 freedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to load passengers in a foreign State, to unload them in another city in this same foreign State.\n\n## The Chicago Convention (1944)\n\nThe Convention relating to international civil aviation, known as the Chicago Convention, sets out the legal, regulatory and technical rules governing commercial aviation and its Member State signatories are required to implement a common legal framework governing their domestic air space and their relations with one another.\n\nSigned on December/uni00A07, 1944, the Chicago Convention established the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as the instrument of cooperation between the 193/uni00A0signatory States in all areas of civil aviation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This convention entered into force on June/uni00A028, 2004. It is based on several fundamental provisions, notably the principle of the unlimited liability of air transport companies in the event of physical injury with the implementation of a two-tier system:\n\n- -  a first tier that sets an objective liability for the air transport company of up to 128,821/uni00A0Special Drawing Rights (SDR);\n- -  a second tier, based on a presumption of fault for the air transport company, for which the airline may be exempt if it proves that it or its agents or o/fficials have not been negligent in any way or that the damages result exclusively from the acts of a third party.\n\n## The Rome Convention (1952)\n\nThe Rome Convention, signed in 1952, covers damages caused to third parties on the ground by foreign aircraft. This convention has not been ratified by France, the Netherlands or the United States. The ICAO's legal commission is currently involved in a major initiative to redraft the wording which would facilitate its ratification by making a distinction between everyday risk and terrorist risk.\n\nThe Convention intended to replace the Rome Convention, relating to compensation for damage caused to third parties following acts of unlawful interference with aircraft, signed in Montreal on May 2, 2009 by thirteen States, for the most part African, is still not applicable. It has only been ratified by three of the 35 States required for its entry into force.\n\n## 6.4.2/emspace European  legislation\n\n## Single European air space\n\nWithin the European Union, these eight freedoms have been supplemented, since April/uni00A01, 1997, by common legislation that creates a homogeneous regulatory situation for all European carriers. All European airlines may freely operate and, in particular, perform cabotage operations within a single European air space. Furthermore, any resident of an EU Member State may hold a stake in the shares of any EU-registered airline, without limit, provided that the shareholder is not acting as a front for a beneficial owner who is not a citizen of an EU Member State. The existence of this legislation eliminates the need for bilateral agreements between EU Member States and does not prevent them from participating in the ICAO, nor does it conflict with the principles and regulations of the Chicago Convention.\n\n## The Tokyo Convention (1963)\n\nThe Tokyo Convention, in force since December/uni00A04, 1969, sets out the principles and establishes the procedures for handling o/ffences against penal law (except those of a political nature and based on racial or religious discrimination) and acts endangering the safety of the aircraft or that of the persons and property on board.\n\nOne of the specific characteristics of this Tokyo Convention is that it recognizes certain powers and immunities of aircraft commanders, exonerating them, under certain conditions, from responsibility for any harm potentially caused to individuals committing such unlawful acts.\n\nThis Tokyo Convention (ratified by France in 1970) is currently the subject of a revision process within the ICAO.\n\nA Protocol to amend the Tokyo Convention was adopted in Montreal on April/uni00A04, 2014. It gathered the minimum of 22/uni00A0 ratifications required for its entry into force and is thus applicable in the States having ratified it. It was ratified by France at the beginning of 2021.\n\nThis Montreal Protocol expands the jurisdiction by recognizing, under certain conditions, the jurisdiction of the State of Landing and the State of the Operator over o/ffences and acts committed on board aircraft. The establishment of such jurisdiction over o/ffences is mandatory if the criteria stipulated in the Protocol are respected. Furthermore, the Protocol grants legal recognition and some protections to in-flight security o/fficers. It also contains provisions covering matters such as intra-State coordination, due process of law and fair treatment.\n\n## Open Skies agreements between Europe and third-party countries\n\nBased on mandates issued by the Council of Ministers, the European Union and its Member States have signed air transport agreements with the following third-party countries:\n\n- -United States : the agreement signed in April/uni00A02007 was amended by a protocol of June/uni00A02010 enabling, notably, European airlines to operate an unlimited number of flights, aircraft and routes to the United States from any European airport with the freedom to set prices, and to operate their services within the framework of cooperation agreements with partners of their choice. This agreement does not change the US rules on ownership and control and, similarly, cabotage remains forbidden;\n- -Canada : the agreement signed in December/uni00A02009 o/ffers EC carriers similar opportunities to those figuring in the agreement with the United States and also includes the same restrictions;",

These agreements foresee the liberalization of bilateral air relations subject to the relevant countries adopting the EU aviation-related acquis;\n- -Balkan States (Albania, Bosnia, Macedonia, UNMIK, Montenegro, Serbia): the agreement signed in June/uni00A02006 aims to create a common air space. At the end of transition periods that vary by country, the Balkan airlines will benefit in Europe from the same tra/ffic rights as EC airlines. At this stage, only the 3 rd /uni00A0and 4 th /uni00A0f reedom rights have been liberalized.\n- -Qatar : the agreement signed in November 2021 aims, by 2024 and at the end of transition periods that vary by country, to liberalize access to the EC market for Qatari carriers, in return for provisions aimed at guaranteeing the financial transparency of the relevant air carriers and establishing a fair competition framework. At this stage only the 3rd and 4th freedom rights have been liberalized.\n\nIn April/uni00A02002, the European Union also signed an air transport agreement with Switzerland giving Swiss carriers, which are assimilated with EU carriers, access to all the intra-Community rights with the exception of cabotage.\n\nAccess to the market between France and States other than those mentioned above for which there are existing agreements at European Community level remains governed by bilateral aviation agreements signed between France and these third-party States.\n\n## Community air transport policy\n\nThe regulation applicable to air transportation within the European Union is primarily of European Community origin. The aims as outlined in the work programs of the European Commission are to reinforce the competitiveness of European Community airlines while insisting on the need to reduce the air transport industry's environmental impact and offer a high degree of passenger protection (1) . The principal positive measures consist of establishing a legal framework favoring fairer competition between EU and third-party carriers, the\n\ne/ffective implementation of the Single European Sky and a commitment to developing biofuels. The European Commission also proposed a series of measures known as the 'Better Airports' package, aimed at reducing the cost of infrastructure use within the European Union. The latter initiatives have only come to very partial fruition due to persistent disagreements within the European institutions. A new European Commission Aviation Strategy was published on December/uni00A07, 2015 but the concrete consequences of the proposed measures remain to be evaluated. This strategy should notably be reflected in the adoption of a new EC commercial defense instrument aimed at protecting European airlines against competition from subsidized air carriers from third-party countries.\n\n## Management of airport time slots within the context of the pandemic\n\nThe regulation concerning the allocation of time slots at European Union airports sets the minimum threshold for slot use at 80%, failing which the airline loses the historic right to utilize these slots. Within the framework of the emergence of Covid-19, the European Commission obtained, by means of a delegated act by Member States, the option to define extraordinary thresholds. For the Summer 2021 Season, the threshold had been set at 50% and was maintained at this level for the 2021/22/uni00A0Winter season.\n\n## European Green Deal and 'Fit For 55' legislative package\n\nOn July/uni00A014, 2021, the European Commission presented a package of 15/uni00A0draft legislative proposals aimed at reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. These draft proposals include four which directly impact the aviation sector. REFUELEU aims to set a mandatory minimum percentage of sustainable aviation fuel for flights on departure from all EU airports. The revised EU-ETS Directive is targeting the phasing out of free quotas for airlines in the EU Carbon Market. The Energy Tax Directive aims to implement a tax on fuel, and the removal of the current exemption for aviation. Lastly, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is targeting the introduction of a Carbon Tari/ff on imported goods and services, and envisages its extension to airline operations over the medium term. All these legislative proposals will be debated in the European Parliament during 2022.\n\n## 6.4.3/emspace Other legal aspects of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's activities\n\nAccess to the main international airports is subject to the prior allocation of time slots. A European Regulation covers access to most so-called coordinated European airports (London, Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam, etc.). Elsewhere in the world, the allocation of slots is generally done on the basis of recommendations issued by IATA in a Worldwide Slot Guidelines reference document. Countries nonetheless retain sovereignty for defining the modalities of slot allocation and may apply rules that di/ffer slightly from the IATA recommendations (e.g. China, Japan, United States, Dubai, etc.).\n\nFor airports within the European Union, each Member State with coordinated airports under its responsibility, after consulting the airlines that regularly use the airports concerned, their representative organizations and the airport authorities, must designate a coordinator or an entity to be responsible for the allocation of slots and the monitoring of their use. Such individuals or entities must have specialized knowledge of coordinating aircraft routes for air transport companies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

On October/uni00A014, 2020, in view of the continuing public health crisis and the weak demand for air transportation in the coming months, the European Commission decided to extend this exception from the requirement to the whole Winter scheduling season, i.e. until March/uni00A027, 2021. A further amendment to the Regulation enabling the easing of the conditions relating to the operation of slots and covering a period extending until the IATA Summer 2022 Season was adopted on February 16, 2021 (see also paragraph 3.1.2.3 'Loss of flight slots or lack of access to flight slots').\n\n## Reinforcement of passenger compensation rights\n\nSee section/uni00A03.1.2.4.\n\n## Framework for State aid within the context of the public health crisis\n\nIn March/uni00A02020, the European Commission adopted a Temporary Framework to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State Aid rules to support the economy and companies facing the consequences of the public health crisis. Recapitalization measures for companies by Member States will be authorized within this framework until June/uni00A030, 2022. The implementation of measures to reinforce the Group's liquidity (guarantee by the State of a \u20ac4/uni00A0billion bank loan (PGE) and a \u20ac3/uni00A0billion loan from the French State, together with the guarantee by the Dutch State of a \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion revolving credit facility and a \u20ac1/uni00A0billion loan from the Dutch State) was submitted for prior approval to the European Commission pursuant to the rules on State Aid, applying the aforementioned Temporary Framework. Similarly, the capital-strengthening measures in which the French State participated during 2021 (\u20ac593/uni00A0million of shares subscribed during the capital increase and subscription to \u20ac3/uni00A0 billion of Deeply Subordinated Notes) were the subject of prior approval by the European Commission on April/uni00A04, 2021.\n\n## 6.5/emspace INFORMATION AND CONTROL\n\n## 6.5.1/emspace Person responsible for the Universal Registration Document and for the Annual Financial Report\n\nBenjamin Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.",

On January/uni00A020, 2016, at the European Aviation Summit, the five largest European airline groups - Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, easyJet, International Airlines Group, Lufthansa Group and Ryanair - announced the creation of the new association.\n\nThe five groups, which carry more than 50% of passengers in Europe, chose to join forces with the aim of influencing European aviation policy.\n\nA4E aims to replace the AEA in lobbying the European Commission e/ffectively on at least three major measures:\n\n- -  reducing European airport charges;\n- -  ensuring a safe and e/fficient air space by reducing the cost of air tra/ffic control (ATC);\n- -  stimulating increased economic activity and employment by creating an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\n## AEA\n\nAssociation of European Airlines. Created in 1952, notably by Air/uni00A0France and KLM, the AEA represents the interests of its members within the European Union institutions, the European Civil Aviation Conference and other organizations and associations.\n\n## Available seat-kilometers (ASK)\n\nTotal number of seats available for the transportation of passengers multiplied by the number of kilometers traveled.\n\n## Available ton-kilometers (ATK)\n\nTotal number of tons available for the transportation of cargo, multiplied by the number of kilometers traveled.\n\n## Biometry\n\nTechnique enabling the identity of an individual to be verified, while crossing a national border for example, through the automatic recognition of certain pre-recorded physical characteristics.\n\n## Coordinated airport\n\nAirport where a coordinator has been appointed to allocate landing and take-o/ff slots according to rules established in advance. All large European Union airports are coordinated.\n\n## Cabotage\n\nAirline cabotage is the carriage of air tra/ffic that originates and terminates within the boundaries of a given country by an air carrier of another country.\n\n## Capacity\n\nCapacity is measured in available seat-kilometers.\n\n## Catering\n\nIn-flight catering involves the planning and preparation of meals and the assembly of meal trays destined to be served on board an aircraft.\n\n## Codeshare\n\nIn accordance with a codeshare agreement, two partner airlines o/ffer services on the same aircraft, each under their own brand, their own IATA code and their own flight number. Codesharing may take two forms. In the first case, the two airlines purchase and sell seats to and from each other at an agreed price. The airline which has purchased the seats then markets them under its brand and at its fares. In the second case, under the system known as free flow, the two airlines are allowed to sell all the seats on the flights involved. Each airline retains the revenues generated on the flight it operates and remunerates the other airline for the number of seats the latter has sold on its aircraft.\n\n## Combi\n\nAircraft whose main deck is equipped for the transportation of both passengers and cargo. The freight is stored at the back of the aircraft and is accessed by a specially-fitted cargo door.\n\n## Connecting tra/ffic\n\nTra/ffic between two destinations which are not linked by a direct flight.\n\n## DGAC\n\nDirection G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Aviation Civile. Under the authority of the French Ministry of Transport, the DGAC is in charge of the security of air transport and of air space in France.\n\n## DGTL\n\nDirectoraat-Generaal Transport en Luchtvaart. Under the authority of the Dutch Ministry of Tra/ffic and Public Works, the DGTL is in charge of the security of air transport and of air space in the Netherlands.\n\n## E-services\n\nRange of ground services o/ffered by Air/uni00A0France and KLM to their passengers, based on the new information technologies. E-services notably enable passengers to check in using self-service kiosks or via the airlines' websites as well as the use of electronic tickets.\n\n## EASA\n\nEuropean Aviation Safety Agency. EASA develops safety and environmental protection expertise in civil aviation in order to assist the European institutions to establish legislation and implement measures regarding aircraft security, organizations and associated sta/ff.",

        "page_content": "## Electronic ticket\n\nAll the journey information for one or several passengers which, instead of being printed, is recorded in an airline's IT database, once the reservation has been made and paid for. An electronic or e-ticket replaces a traditional paper ticket.\n\n## FAA\n\nFederal Aviation Administration. Body responsible for civil aviation security in the United States.\n\n## Handling\n\nPreparation of the aircraft, involving loading and unloading, as well as the associated logistics such as management and storage of hotel products.\n\n## Hub\n\nTerm used for a transfer platform where departures and arrivals are scheduled to minimize transit times. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM disposes of two of the four major European hubs: Paris-CDG and Amsterdam-Schiphol. The Air/uni00A0France and KLM hubs are organized into successive waves for arrivals and departures each day in order to increase the transfer opportunities for customers.\n\n## IATA\n\nInternational Air Transport Association. Created in 1945, IATA establishes regulations for the air transport industry and provides its members with a framework for the coordination and proper implementation of tari/ffs, together with various commercial and financial support services.\n\n## ICAO\n\nThe International Civil Aviation Organisation, a UN Specialized Agency, promotes the safe, secure and sustainable development of civil aviation worldwide. It establishes the standards and regulations required to ensure the safety, security, e/fficiency and continuity of aviation operations as well as the protection of the environment.\n\n## Joint-venture\n\nJoint company with two partners, often held equally with 50% each. This type of shareholder structure notably allows the implementation of technological or industrial alliances in order to undertake specific projects common to both partner companies.\n\n## Load factor\n\nRevenue passenger-kilometers (RPK) divided by available seat-kilometers (ASK). In the cargo activity this is revenue ton-kilometers (RTK) divided by available ton-kilometers (ATK).\n\n## Multi-hub\n\nSystem linking several hubs, allowing customers to access the networks developed from each hub, thus multiplying the round-trip o/ffer to and from worldwide destinations.\n\nAir transport glossary\n\n## Premium\n\nFare classes corresponding to business or first class.\n\n## Over-reservation or over-booking\n\nOver-reservation or over-booking consists of accepting more bookings than seats available. Practiced by all airline companies and permitted by European legislation, over-booking enables management of the fact that some passengers cancel their trips but not their reservations. It thus allows many passengers to find a seat on board flights that could have departed with available seats. Airlines usually have a passenger compensation policy.\n\n## Point-to-point tra/ffic\n\nTra/ffic between two airports, excluding passengers prolonging their trip with a connecting flight.\n\n## Revenue management\n\nTechnique designed to optimize revenue on flights, by constantly seeking a better balance between the load factor and the fares o/ffered.\n\n## Revenue passenger-kilometer (RPK)\n\nTotal number of paying passengers carried multiplied by the number of kilometers traveled.\n\n## Revenue ton-kilometer (RTK)\n\nTotal number of tons of paid cargo multiplied by the number of kilometers that this cargo is carried.\n\n## Safety and security\n\nAirline safety includes all the measures implemented by air transport professionals aimed at ensuring the reliable operation and maintenance of aircraft.\n\nAirline security involves all the measures taken by air transport professionals to prevent any illicit or malicious act. Air transport is particularly exposed to terrorist acts due to the considerable media impact o/ffered by such activity. Airline security notably includes baggage screening, and the screening and questioning of passengers.\n\n## Self-service check-in kiosk\n\nSelf-service check-in kiosks, available in airport departure halls, allow passengers to check in and print their own boarding cards, without having to go to a check-in counter.\n\n## Segment\n\nSection of a flight between two destinations. The number of passengers is calculated by segment carried.\n\n## Slot\n\nA slot represents clearance given for a carrier to land at or take o/ff from an airport at a specified time and date.",
