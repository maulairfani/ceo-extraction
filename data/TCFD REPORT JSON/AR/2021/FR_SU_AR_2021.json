        "page_content": "## A statement from Chairman and CEO, Jean-Pascal Tricoire\n\nThe past two years have seen challenges, changes and uncertainties that few of us could have imagined back in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic, the multiple and diverse responses to it, the rapid restart of the economy, a host of climate change-linked disasters, and numerous other disruptions have shaken up supply chains and unsettled business plans the world over.\n\nMany of these developments will stay with us in 2022, and even beyond.\n\nBut the world has also had time to learn, to change, and to adapt. Climate action, efficiency, sustainability, digital innovation, and resilience to disruption, uncertainty and change are now top of the agenda for policy makers, businesses and even households around the globe, in a way that was simply not the case just two or three years ago.\n\nOf course, Schneider Electric hasn't been immune to these upheavals. But our efforts, over the past 15 years, to embrace sustainability, digitization and electrification, and to empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, have stood us in good stead.\n\nIn fact, if anything, our corporate purpose and positioning have been reinforced and vindicated by what the world has experienced since late 2019. It's never been more important to bridge progress and sustainability for all.\n\n## A business model built to support a sustainable future\n\nSchneider Electric received welcome, high-profile external recognition in January 2021, when Corporate Knights ranked us the world's most sustainable corporation for the year. The recognition is a testament to the commitment of our people, our customers, partners and suppliers, who have, year after year, raised the bar, to make a positive impact on our organization, our business and community ecosystem, and on the entire world.\n\nStill, the science is clear: humanity is not acting fast enough to avert climate catastrophe. We all need to do more, and much faster, to leverage the technologies that already exist, and develop new ones for the future.\n\nThat's why, also in January 2021, we announced the most ambitious set of sustainability commitments in our history, spanning 2021-2025: to show that even companies that are already sustainability leaders have a responsibility to do even more.\n\nIn late 2021, we also committed to being an Impact Company . We define that as a company that embraces environmental, social and governance (ESG) values into every dimension of its business. A company that aligns its mission to contribute these values, and that operates with a model that creates local impact, close to the communities it's supporting.\n\nOne of the guiding principles of this model is that acting on these principles, and on our purpose, also cements our financial performance. And that's what makes us confident in our long-term sustainable growth.\n\n## Accelerating core markets, and new pillars of growth\n\nTwo technologies underpin the global economy's transition to a sustainable, more resilient and lower-carbon future: digitization and electrification .\n\nIt's in these areas that we've built our expertise and leadership over the past years - and we're feeling the accelerating demand for these technologies across end-markets ranging from buildings and industry, to data centers and infrastructure.\n\nIn addition, to support future growth, we've supplemented this with three incremental growth drivers.\n\nOur services offer allows us to provide more value on our installed base, and to better serve our customers across the entire lifecycle.\n\nOur software portfolio provides unmatched capabilities in bridging the physical and digital world, allowing customers to reap the benefits of efficiency. Most recently, 2021 saw the finalization of our strategic acquisition of ETAP, as well as the closure of AVEVA's acquisition of OSIsoft. Our next step is the development of a new category of software, through integrating our full portfolio across two core dimensions: the lifecycle and the operational domains. This is the first offer of its kind and has huge potential to support our customers by removing common operational frictions.",

Companies all over the world are increasingly eager to become more sustainable, and to reduce their carbon footprints. Our expertise on these fronts has allowed us to develop a full-service offering, spanning ESG consulting services, right through to digital technologies that can bolster energy and operational efficiency, to support customers at all stages of their journey.\n\n## Unique operating model to support the transition\n\nAll of these growth opportunities are supported by our operating model.\n\nWe've strategically built and scaled this around four distinct characteristics: the integration of all aspects of our business operations, from sales, to supply chain, to marketing and software; the nurturing of the largest, open ecosystem of partners ; the principle of having ESG values at the heart of everything we do both by being leaders in our own ecosystem, and by helping our customers along their ESG journeys.\n\nAnd lastly, our multi-hub model . With four regional hubs around the world (North America, Europe, China and India), our local teams can adapt and respond quickly to changing circumstances. It also helps us to attract the best talent anywhere in the world.\n\nOf course, none of this would be possible without our SE Great People , who participate and believe in our purpose and mission. Throughout 2021, our 128,000 colleagues demonstrated their adaptability, and their openness to collaboration and innovation, as we all learned and grew in this new, hybrid-working world.\n\nThey're also central to the trust we've built with our entire ecosystem. This trust has ensured our resilience through tough times, and strengthened our relationships for the future. Trust is our highest value, reinforced by the establishment of our Trust Charter in 2021.\n\n## Integrated report\n\nStrategic Report\n\n' Two technologies underpin the global economy's transition to a sustainable, more resilient and lower-carbon future: digitization and electrification'\n\nJean-Pascal Tricoire\n\nChairman and CEO\n\n## A sustainable future built on trust\n\nInevitably, many of the challenges of 2020 and 2021 will continue in 2022. But our strategic positioning, our operating model, and our guiding principles make us confident in our future.\n\nAround the globe, companies, governments and people have realized that humanity needs to act fast to make the world both fairer and cleaner - that we need to avert the worst effects of the looming climate crisis. The tools to do so exist: digitization and electrification can help us get towards net-zero. What we need to do now is act.

        "page_content": "## An interview with Chief Financial Officer, Hilary Maxson\n\n## Schneider Electric delivered a strong performance in 2021, what were the highlights?\n\nIn 2021 the key theme was growth, driven both by strong market dynamics and our strategic choices and positioning. Our revenues of EUR 28.9 billion were an all-time high, up +12.7% organically. We delivered a strong improvement in our adjusted EBITA margin which increased by +1.4pts organically, reaching 17.3%, a new record, and surpassing our target of 'around 17%' one year early. We achieved this through good leverage on the higher volumes of 2021, a strong focus on price in the face of inflationary pressures, and continued progress on our operational efficiency plans. The strong operational performance coupled with a reduction in restructuring costs resulted in net income of EUR 3.2 billion, an increase of +51% over 2020.\n\nWe delivered Free Cash Flow of EUR 2.8 billion, reflecting strong operational cash flow but also increased working capital requirements at the end of the year due to the strong external demand environment and some supply chain shortages. We retain a strong focus on shareholder returns, and we continue our track-record of progressive dividends for a 12 th year, increasing our proposed dividend by +12% to EUR 2.90 per share.\n\n## What were the biggest challenges you faced in 2021 and what do you expect in 2022?\n\nGlobal supply chains came under pressure in 2021, impacting not just Schneider, but across multiple industries and geographies. While the heightened external demand is supportive of future growth, it did present some temporal challenges in customer deliveries for the year and came with associated higher costs both in freight and the sourcing of some components. Our unique global supply chain set-up helped us to navigate these challenges with agility, using lessons learned from 2020, and leveraging our multihub model. We also faced the ongoing challenge of a global health crisis, which limited our ability to access customer sites, impacting our Services organization. I want to take the opportunity to thank our customer facing teams, and those working in our factories and distribution centers, for all they did in putting our customers first in these challenging times.\n\nFor 2022, we expect these challenges to persist, with cost inflation the new reality and pressures on global supply chains not yet over. We endeavor to meet these challenges with agility, always putting customers at the forefront of our thinking.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What is the outlook for Schneider Electric in 2022?\n\nIn 2022, we start-out on the scalable growth journey outlined in our Capital Markets Day. We expect 2022 Adjusted EBITA growth of between +9% and +13% organic. This strong and sustainable performance would be achieved through a combination of topline organic growth, targeted at between +7% and +9%, and Adjusted EBITA margin up +30 bps to +60 bps organic. This implies Adjusted EBITA margin of around 17.6% to 17.9% for 2022.\n\n## You held a Capital Markets Day in 2021. What will drive shareholder value in the coming years?\n\nAt the CMD, we set our 2022-2024 targets and longer-term ambitions. Between 2022 and 2024 we expect organic revenue growth of between +5% to +8%, on average, and a continued improvement of our adjusted EBITA margin of between +30bps to +70bps organic, annually. We expect this to translate into a step-up in our Free Cash Flow, over-time, to around EUR 4 billion by 2024. We upgraded our longer-term ambitions to at least 5% organic growth in revenues on average across the economic cycle with an opportunity to further expand adjusted EBITA margin and Free Cash Flow beyond 2024.\n\nThese ambitions represent a step-change in performance from past years, driven by long-term trends of digitization for efficiency, and electrification for sustainability that are pervasive across the endmarkets we serve. We expect opportunities in these end-markets to remain dynamic, and for growth to be augmented by our focus on Software, Services and Sustainability. As we move into a period of scalable and sustainable growth, our revenue profile is shifting; becoming more digital and more resilient. We expect an evolution in contribution from our Digital Flywheel, moving towards c.60% of Group revenues by 2025, from c.50% today. Within this, our strategic focus on more Software & Services is expected to drive an increase of +5pts on these elements, to c.23% of Group revenues by 2025. Software & Services also presents an opportunity for revenues to be more sticky, more resilient and with a greater proportion to be recurring in nature, increasing by +15pts to c.45% recurring by 2025.\n\nAs CFO, I am excited with the opportunities that lie ahead of us, we have the portfolio, the technologies and the great people required to enable sustainable growth for years to come, as we remain committed to generating further value for all of our stakeholders.\n\nHilary Maxson,\n\nChief Financial Officer",

From massive cloud data centers enabling global peer-to-peer communications for billions of people, to the smallest micro data centers supporting expanding edge computing applications, data centers must be sustainable, resilient, efficient and adaptive.\n\n## Critical attributes of evolving data centers:\n\nSustainability - Sustainability is more than just reducing power consumption, it's about creating direct customer benefits. Beyond just tracking their company-based emissions, data centers must account for the emissions of their upstream and downstream supply chain. Robust data is the key to rounding out an organization's sustainability profile.\n\nResilience - By reducing exposure to hazards and associated risks, like unanticipated blackouts, data center owners can mitigate unplanned downtime. Through monitoring and data analysis, data center teams can proactively avoid uptime threats and support business continuity.\n\n## China International Intellectech Corporation (CIIC) boosts energy savings\n\nAs part of the Zhongzhi Group, CIIC is a leading human resources company in China, serving more than 20,000 customer companies across the country. By deploying Schneider Electric's low footprint Uniflair \u2122 InRow \u2122 Cooling and Hot-Aisle air containment system, CIIC succeeded in boosting energy efficiency and achieving a PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) of 1.5\u00b0C, while reducing the required system footprint space by 70 square meters.\n\n## Innovations introduced in 2021 include:\n\n- \u00b7 Galaxy VL: The new, energy-efficient Galaxy VL is designed to help data centers grow while minimizing footprint and cost of ownership. As a Green Premium \u2122 product, it delivers top performance, supports sustainability objectives, and fills a previous gap in the market for the midrange power segment.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and Dispatch Services: Designed for single-phase systems within edge environments, Monitoring and Dispatch Services provide both customers and partners with advanced remote troubleshooting and on-site support. End users can reduce OpEx, improve cost predictability, and reduce costly business interruptions.\n\n## 1-2%\n\nEstimated global energy consumption by data centers (1)\n\n50%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrowth in IT sector electricity demand by 2050 (2)\n\nEfficiency - Data center efficiencies, which often encompassed only process and hardware performance efficiencies, will soon include human resources, CapEx, and total cost of ownership (TCO) efficiencies. By equipping devices with intelligent sensors and adding more digital services and remote monitoring capabilities, data centers will drive more efficient operations.\n\nAdaptiveness - A new threshold for business success has emerged: deliver goods and services with speed and precision. As customers demands increase, data centers must also adjust. More agile designs now allow data center owners to pivot, quickly scaling up or down to handle changing consumer demands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Smart-UPS Ultra: The first of its kind, APC Smart-UPS Ultra is redefining the single-phase UPS, making it lighter and more powerful. It uses lithium-ion technology to power distributed IT and edge computing sites to ensure uptime and resilience.\n\n## Leading change in the data center industry\n\n- 'The data center industry has unique characteristics, such as high energy intensity, rapid growth, large power consumption, and water usage, that require specialized metrics. Standardizing these metrics will help with adoption, improve benchmarking, and progress sustainability within the industry.'\n\nSchneider Electric Energy Management Research Center, Guide to Environmental Sustainability Metrics for Data Centers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n50%\n\nReduction in carbon intensities of data centers by 2030 (2)\n\n- (1) https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aba3758\n- (2) https://www.se.com/ww/en/insights/tl/schneider-electric-sustainability-research-institute/digital-economy-and-climate-impact-2",

Executive compensation set by the Board of Directors is aligned with the Group's global strategy and is based on three pillars divided into seven principles:\n\n## Pay for Performance\n\n- 1. Prevalence of variable components: circa 80% for CEO (at target).\n- 2. Performance is evaluated via economic and measurable criteria.\n- 3. Financial and Sustainability objectives are fairly balanced and distributed between short-term (annual variable compensation) and medium-term (long-term incentive) components.\n\nAligned with those principles, the compensation of the Corporate Officer is made of the following components: for the variable component of the compensation, the Board upon recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, chooses the performance conditions directly linked to the Group's priorities. The Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) which includes a climate target (see section 2.1.2 of the Universal Registration Document) is used as a criterion in the annual variable compensation of the Corporate Officer and that of the 64,000 employees benefiting from such compensation. In the same way, the Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI) is used for the long-term incentive plan granted to 3,000+ employees including the Corporate Officer.\n\n## Group's strategic priorities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alignment with shareholders' interest\n\n- 4.

In 2020, the Group launched the stakeholder consultation process to update its materiality matrix and build the new Schneider Sustainability Impact. Almost 200 stakeholders - customers, suppliers, international organizations, trade associations, experts, shareholders, senior managers, and\n\nmembers of the Executive Committee - were invited to assess the importance of the challenges facing the Group.\n\nThe general consensus was that companies need to become more resilient in the face of growing environmental, social, political, and economic instability. What stakeholders most expect from the Group is genuine leadership in decarbonizing the economy through its businesses, products, and solutions. The four main trends were climate, circular economy, a fair and equitable transition, and digitized, cybersecure solutions. All 31 issues raised were deemed important, thus reinforcing our holistic vision of sustainability and the Company's extended responsibility to its ecosystem, in particular its supply chain.\n\n## Materiality matrix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more on our dialog with stakeholders page 75 \u01f0",

Schneider Electric is a people company where employees come to work for a meaningful purpose and feel empowered to have an impact.\n\n## New work paradigm\n\nAs we move towards a post-pandemic era, the nature of work, the workplace, and the relationships between companies, customers, and employees have dramatically changed. First, we need to strengthen trust through a meaningful purpose, ethics, fairness, health and safety (physical and psychological), wellbeing, and employee experience. Second, we must accelerate the transformation of our culture, leadership, and new ways of working. We believe these new ways of working - with a focus on digital, our multi-hub approach, hybrid work, and well-being - are here to stay. Third, there are up to five generations working side by side, and each generation has a varied set of expectations from their employer. This in turn is leading to a shift towards a highly personalized, digitized employee experience with choice and flexibility.\n\nOur people are also passionate about our meaningful purpose, to empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, bridging progress and sustainability. The energy transition and digitization require Schneider Electric to work closely in its different markets and to develop a shared vision with customers, supported by faster innovation, technology, and deep insights. As such, we need to shape our organizational culture to meet this challenge and motivate us all.\n\n## The most local of global companies\n\nGlobalization allows Schneider Electric to welcome more diverse teams and to ensure our local presence best supports our customers' specific needs with a true multi-market knowledge and culture. We prioritize how we develop and retain our employees to create an inclusive workplace that offers long-term career and development prospects and learning pathways.\n\n## 2021 People recognitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are the most local of global companies. Our multi-hub operating model is built across four decentralized hubs: Paris for Europe, Hong Kong for Asia, Boston for North America, and most recently, India. This model empowers employees and provides them with opportunities to grow within our organization, and we are continually championing diversity, equity, and inclusion to make a bigger impact on society.\n\n## Our People Vision\n\nAll this change influences how we work together and ultimately how we create value for our customers. We updated our People Vision to accelerate our business performance and transform our culture and leadership. At Schneider Electric, we are building for the future, in sync with the changes happening in our markets and with our customers.\n\nOur People Vision consists of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Our Employee Value Proposition (EVP) is our commitment to engage existing and future talent.

This means thinking about the world of tomorrow by empowering everyone, regardless of origin, gender, or socio-economic level to build a promising future for individuals and families worldwide.\n\n## Bringing access to green electricity\n\nToday, more than two billion people have little or no access to electricity, representing 25% of the world's population. At Schneider, we believe that access to energy is both a fundamental right and a means for social and economic development. The purpose of our Access to Energy social business is to bridge the energy gap by bringing a safe, affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy offer to populations in emerging markets.\n\nWe call this Electricity for Life and Electricity for Livelihood.\n\n'Electricity for Life' means delivering access to green electricity as a fundamental right, answering to essential needs (such as lighting, social connection, or education) for off-grid households, small businesses, and the humanitarian sector. There are almost 800 million people living in off-grid areas, and more than 80 million people forcibly displaced.\n\n'Electricity for Livelihood' means delivering access to green electricity as a driver of economic development and poverty reduction for households connected to an unreliable grid and for productive businesses. Around one billion people, and many farmers, schools, or health centers in rural areas, are dependent on an intermittent grid and need quality energy with back-up solutions based on solar energy.\n\nSchneider's access to energy solutions already benefited 30 million people between 2009 and 2020. Our ambition is to connect an additional 20 million people between 2021 and 2025, and 70 million by 2030.\n\n## 2021 highlights\n\n## 150,000\n\npeople have access to green electricity 24/7 in 5 remote cities in Chad through a partnership with the local enterprise ZIZ Energy.\n\n13,000\n\nMobiya solar lanterns distributed in Benin, Senegal and Cameroon in partnership with ADEME.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+4.2m\n\npeople connected to green electricity in 2021.\n\n## Educating the youth and populations in underserved areas\n\nFor more than 20 years, training and entrepreneurship have been the historical mission of the Schneider Electric Foundation, under the aegis of Fondation de France. With the support of NGO partners, more than 300,000 young people around the world have received professional training in energy-related professions. The Group's ambition is to train one million people by 2025. Passing on skills to young people and giving them the means to support their families will improve their quality of life and create sustainable jobs.\n\nTo do this, the Schneider Electric Foundation draws on a network of around 80 volunteer employees (or delegates) across 80 countries. Their role is to select local partners in vocational training and entrepreneurship in the energy sector and to raise sustainability awareness. The Foundation also leverages its VolunteerIn organization to empower employees to be actors and ambassadors of the Group's societal commitments wherever they are based. They are the link between Schneider, the Foundation and the supported organizations.\n\n- Read more about our social impact on page 188 \u01f0\n\n328,000\n\npeople trained in energy management since 2009.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvolunteering days since 2017.",

Convinced that its responsibility extends beyond compliance with local and international regulations, the Group is committed to doing business ethically, sustainably, and responsibly. Schneider's business actions and decisions run on trust.\n\n## Trust Charter, Schneider Electric's Code of Conduct\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric evolved its Principles of Responsibility to the Trust Charter, acting as the Group's Code of Conduct and demonstrating its commitment to ethics, safety, sustainability, quality, and cybersecurity. Schneider Electric believes that trust is a foundational value. It is earned. It serves as a compass, showing the true north in an ever more complex world and Schneider Electric considers it to be core to its environment, sustainability, and governance commitments.\n\nTrust powers all Schneider Electric's interactions with stakeholders and all relationships with customers, shareholders, employees, and the communities they serve, in a meaningful, inclusive and positive way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our Trust Charter on page 94 \u01f0\n\n## 2021 highlights\n\n## 96%\n\nemployees trained on Cybersecurity and Ethics.\n\n## 81%\n\nof our employees are confident to report unethical conduct.\n\n## Ethics & Compliance program\n\nDriven by and in complement to the Trust Charter, the Ethics & Compliance (E&C) program establishes the framework of policies, tools and processes related to E&C topics. By providing specific guidelines and practices, the program ensures the business is run with integrity, and employees are aware of potential risks. As part of this program, all employees have access to the Trust Line, Schneider's whistleblowing system, to speak up in case of unethical conduct, with the guarantee of the whistleblower protection.\n\nSchneider has built a strong governance to lead the Ethics & Compliance program to the highest standards, with responsibilities at board, executive, corporate, and operational levels.\n\n## Zero tolerance for corruption\n\nSchneider Electric has a zero tolerance policy with regard to corruption. This commitment is materialized through a strong and continuously developing Anti-Corruption Compliance program, which is part of the E&C program.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, a set of anti-corruption e-learnings was built to provide guidance on real life risk scenarios and to take into account the trainees' needs and expectations. This led to a curriculum of modules of e-learnings, deployed in 2020 and completed in 2021 with four additional modules about facilitation payments, conflict of interest, conditions that make people commit the wrongdoing, and how to raise concerns in Schneider Electric. The modules were supported by top leaders' videos demonstrating the 'tone at the top' on this crucial matter and are available in 14 languages.\n\n- Read more about our Ethics and Compliance program on page 95 \u01f0\n\n## 26%\n\nof confirmed cases raised via the Trust Line lead to actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEthisphere Institute - One of the 2021 World's Most Ethical Companies.",

When the country of origin is known to be in the conflict zone, 100% of the smelters and refiners were verified conformant.

Schneider Electric's sustainable purchasing strategy ensures risk management and commits to improvements. To achieve this, we have embedded sustainability at three levels:\n\n- \u00b7 Provision of a Supplier Code of Conduct with fundamental requirements that all suppliers delivering goods or services to Schneider Electric are expected to adhere\n- \u00b7 Integration of sustainability criteria in the day to day, operational procurement actions. The qualification process focuses on people, social responsibility, and environmental management. Sustainability criteria account for a significant part of the evaluation.\n- \u00b7 Deployment of strategic programs in thematic areas of climate change (The Zero Carbon Project), decent working conditions & human rights (Duty of Vigilance, ISO26000, Decent Work), circularity & resource conservation (green materials, sustainable packaging).\n\nIn 2021 we have begun a new five-year engagement with ambitious targets for each of the thematic areas.\n\n- Read more about our sustainable relations with suppliers page 117 \u01f0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontinuous increase of suppliers ISO2 6000 score.\n\n21%\n\ntotal packaging spend attributed to sustainable packaging.",

        "page_content": "## Our Stakeholders\n\n## Schneider Electric's vigilance plan\n\nIn 2017, Schneider started the implementation of a vigilance plan covering its business activities as well as those of its suppliers and subcontractors. Since then, this vigilance plan has been continuously reinforced, aiming to push further towards responsible corporate citizenship. In January 2021, the Group was awarded the Best Vigilance Plan by the Sustainable Investment Forum and A2 Consulting.\n\n## Duty of vigilance\n\nSchneider's ambition is to be an ethical company. Our values shape the way we do business with our many customers, partners, suppliers, and communities around the world. They inform the way we protect and foster human rights and guide our desire to make a positive impact on the planet and the environment.\n\nThe Group's vigilance plan reflects this ambition. It also complies with the provisions of the 2017 French law on Corporate duty of vigilance. The plan includes:\n\n- \u00b7 A risk analysis specific to vigilance: risks that Schneider Electric poses on the ecosystem and environment;\n- \u00b7 A review of the key actions implemented to remediate or mitigate these risks;\n- \u00b7 An alert system;\n- \u00b7 Governance specific to vigilance.\n\nThe plan is governed by the Duty of Vigilance Committee, set up in 2017. The steering committee meets twice a year in normal circumstances. Overall, since its inception, 13 Committee meetings have been held (five in 2017, two in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021). The Committee's objective is to provide a discussion on strategic orientation and prioritize initiatives and the resources allocated to their implementation. This Committee also reviews the actions in progress and their results and defines decisions on next steps for action.\n\nIn this Registration document, Schneider Electric reviews the risk matrix analysis and some of the actions to mitigate these risks are described. When necessary, the reader will be directed to other sections of the report to get relevant and detailed information. For more comprehensive and complete information, the full vigilance plan of the Group is available as a standalone document and can be downloaded from Schneider Electric's website at se.com.\n\n## 2021 highlights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#1\n\nVigilance Plan awarded in 2021 to Schneider Electric by the Sustainable Investment Forum and A2 Consulting.\n\n800+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsuppliers assessed under our Vigilance program in 2021.\n\nThe 2021 analysis has not revealed major changes or gaps that were not identified so far. The following evolutions are to be mentioned:\n\n- \u00b7 Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Schneider Electric's business: Actions implemented in 2020 such as working from home, increased sanitary measures, etc. were adapted in 2021 to respond to the fluctuating pandemic situation. Overall, employees have reacted positively to these measures, as demonstrated by the surveys conducted and the high level of engagement. However, the medium-term impact of the pandemic on morale is still to be monitored closely, as some signs of fatigue are visible among teams.\n- \u00b7 Ethical business conduct: This area has been under close monitoring, as the adverse business climate has put pressure on business. However, no significant deterioration has been noticed.\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity and data protection: they are a subject of permanent focus and attention, taken very seriously by the Group. It is addressed through training programs and measures to protect employees, customers, and stakeholders against threats.\n- \u00b7 Analysis of specific risks to communities residing near Schneider sites: In 2021, a specific review has been implemented to assess Schneider's main sites and customer projects. The assessment is still a work in progress at this point, but so far, no critical areas of concern have been detected.\n- Read more on our vigilance plan on page 112 \u01f0\n\n+64%\n\nsuppliers audited on-site in 2021 compared to the 2017-2020 yearly average.",

It described how our climate crisis requires critical decarbonization measures to stay within a global warming trajectory of 1.5\u00b0C. Schneider Electric advocates deploying proven digital technologies for energy efficiency, and an increased focus on electrification and sustainability to urgently decarbonize buildings, transport, and industry. There is a need for sustainability.\n\nThis has been further accelerated with stronger sustainability commitments from all stakeholders. First, governments have put in place unprecedented levels of green stimulus funding to build back better. More companies have set emission reduction targets aligned to the 1.5\u00b0C scenario and validated by the Science Based Targets initiative. Furthermore, investors now hold CEOs and their boards accountable for their companies' extra-financial performance, specifically related to carbon footprints.\n\nIn parallel, we have all faced enormous challenges due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past two years, lockdowns, industrial supply chain disruption, travel restrictions and ever-evolving changes to our day-to-day lives, have emphasized the need for robustness, agility and resiliency.\n\nThere is a need for resilience.\n\n## Being part of the solution\n\nAs part of its ambition to deliver a more sustainable future, Schneider Electric uses technologies to help customers in many sectors to build net-zero pathways. Our research shows that 70% of emission reduction is achievable with existing, proven and competitive technologies.\n\nSchneider's positioning for a sustainable future focuses on an all electric and all digital world .\n\n- \u00b7 Electricity for greener energy and decarbonization: electricity is the most efficient energy and the best vector of decarbonization.\n- \u00b7 Digitization builds a smart future : digital tools make the invisible visible, enabling more effective waste reduction and efficiency improvements.\n- \u00b7 Digitization creates resilience: data analytics and insights enable more agile operations and continuity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

All electric\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nElectrification will intensify in line with the energy transition, due to several factors:\n\n- \u00b7 More electric loads , namely:\n- - The electrification of road mobility as the yearly electricity consumption from electric vehicles is anticipated to grow by 21% p.a. from 2018 to 2050 (1) .\n- - Decoupling of industrial production versus access to goods, driving a new energy system: further electrification of industrial processes currently powered by coal or gas.\n- - Electricity in the industry energy mix is expected to reach ~80% in 2050 versus 25% in 2018 (1) .\n- - Increased electrification in homes and buildings, driven by the electrification of heating, cooking, and cooling, and new regulations to accelerate decarbonization. Electrification rate in buildings is anticipated to reach 81% in 2050 versus 33% in 2018 (1) .\n- \u00b7 Innovation that promotes more cost-effective electrification and power decentralization :\n- - Energy batteries are expected to provide up to five times more energy density by 2030 (2) .\n- - More renewables, with a variable capacity mix anticipated to reach up to 50% by 2040 (3) .\n- - More energy efficiency: the best energy is the one we do not consume.\n\n## Why these trends matter for Schneider Electric?\n\nSustainability is not just a part of Schneider Electric's business, sustainability is the core of our strategy. We integrate sustainability everywhere, in our model and culture to have a strong impact at both a global and local level.\n\nWe see many of our customers stepping up their efforts and investments in sustainability.

It has improved resiliency, agility, and proximity with our customers and our network of suppliers.\n\nAs today's world is increasingly divided by politics, trade and data regulations, and the ever-evolving health situation, this characteristic of Schneider Electric's model has shown its strategic importance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric's multi-hub strategy was reinforced and strengthened with the creation of the Indian hub, built when merging with Larsen & Toubro's Electrical & Automation division. India is one of the most promising regions in the world for electrification, digitization, urbanization and manufacturing, and is now one of Schneider Electric's major manufacturing and talent centers with 30,000 employees and 30 factories.\n\nFour hubs now serve the Group's different markets (Europe, North America, China & India). Each hub has its own capabilities, while operating and contributing together toward the same Group objectives.\n\n## Group objectives\n\nProducts and offers are adapted locally to the specificity and standards of local markets, leveraging global R&D platforms and architectures. This is key for compliance with local standards (e.g., NEMA North America, IEC Europe, and CCC Asia Pacific), regulations (e.g., data and cybersecurity), operating conditions, and design specificities.\n\nSchneider Electric's supply chain is organized by region, serving local customers with the support of local suppliers. As such, in 2020, 92% of Schneider's supplied goods come from the same region as its manufacturing sites, and 80% of Schneider's sales are produced in the same region as its customers.\n\nSchneider Electric's suppliers are becoming increasingly local as close relationships are built with manufacturers in the region, for better flexibility and resiliency.\n\n1.",

Coupled with Schneider's EcoStruxure \u2122 advisors, they deliver incremental value and support our customers in their every day operations. Additionally, Schneider Electric strives to continuously increase quality of its products to offer the highest level of safety and reliability. We are also committed to reduce the environmental impact of our products. Our Green Premium \u2122 label was created to provide our customers with more sustainable products and transparency with environmental information. In 2021, more than 75% of Schneider's product sales came from Green Premium \u2122 products. We expect this figure to reach 80% by 2025.\n\n## More Services\n\nServices are the incremental growth engine for the Group, delivering peace of mind to our customers along their life cycle with safety, resilience, efficiency, and sustainability. We will continue our efforts to accelerate tracking and servicing of existing assets installed at customers' sites.\n\n- \u00b7 We will leverage new value-added services offerings through our suite of EcoStruxure \u2122 Advisors\n- \u00b7 We will ensure a seamless end-to-end digital customer experience from CapEx to OpEx.\n\n## Better Systems\n\nThe EcoStruxure \u2122 platform is the foundational technology backbone to build and deliver Schneider Electric solutions. We will enrich the EcoStruxure \u2122 platform with more segment applications and expertise offering more value. We provide a unified customer experience through our open ecosystem and we upskill our people in digital technologies.\n\nWe continue to expand our natively connected equipment portfolio with digital tools, making condition-based maintenance and connected expert service available to customers for more productivity, safety, efficiency, and collaboration.\n\n## More Software\n\nSchneider Electric customers are looking for integration across phases from Design, Build to Operate and Maintain. With our software portfolio across EcoStruxure \u2122 , AVEVA, OSIsoft, RIB Software, ETAP, Planon, IGE+XAO, ALPI, and our partnerships, we already have outstanding coverage and a clear market-leading position when it comes to data platforms. Our approach is to standardize this software portfolio and the user experience to create unified data federation.\n\n## More Sustainability\n\nThe climate crisis is a significant risk to organizational continuity. In response, stakeholders are demanding urgent action from businesses. This pressure has driven more than 2,000 companies to join the Science-based Targets Initiative (SBTi), and in 2021, 13,000 companies reported their emissions to the CDP.\n\nWe aspire to both achieving our own aggressive climate targets and supporting our stakeholders in their  decarbonization through our solutions and influence. In 2021, we raised the ambitions of our 2021-2025 Schneider Sustainability Impact, launched new switchgear products that avoid using the potent greenhouse gas SF 6 , and we expanded our global sustainability consulting business.\n\nOver the past years, Schneider Electric has made significant investments in these strategic priorities. Services, software and sustainability continue to be high potential, incremental growth engines. Directly tied to Schneider Electric's core business, they are expected to deliver Schneider's indicative objectives for 2025 as the Group makes another step change on its path to becoming a hybrid digital company:\n\n- \u00b7 Group revenues from our digital flywheel of connectable products, edge control, software and services, will increase from ~50% today to ~60% in 2025 (+10pts).\n- \u00b7 Strong strategic focus on software and services, will increase from ~18% of Group revenues today to ~23% by 2025 (+5pts).\n- \u00b7 Recurring revenues as a percentage of software and services will step-up ~30% today to ~45% by 2025 (+15pts).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The expertise of this global business helps define strategy and drive action for our clients on their own decarbonization journeys.\n\nClimate action is no longer optional for leading organizations: it's imperative for business resilience. Limiting the temperature rise projected to 1.5\u00b0C by 2050 will require three times more CO 2 emissions reductions than currently pledged - but we believe this goal is still within reach if we can successfully transform our production and use of energy.\n\nFirst, we must decarbonize energy supply, transitioning our global energy system from carbon intensive energy sources to lower carbon ones. This transformation will allow us to achieve ~45% decarbonization. Second, we must increase electrification, achieving another ~30% decarbonization. Lastly, demand optimizations through resource efficiency, circularity, and other activities provide the remaining solution by enabling us to achieve more productivity while using less energy.\n\nDecarbonization commitments have grown rapidly in past years, as evidenced by the number of corporations that have joined the SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative), Climate Pledge, and others. Schneider Electric is the market leader in helping companies to both set and achieve these decarbonization commitments, providing consulting and managed services coupled with leading-edge digital tools to animate both strategy and action. Our Sustainability Business is already engaged with more than 30% of the Fortune 500 who have set climate targets.\n\nOur differentiated value proposition is to support our customers on climate, from strategy setting to execution\n\nStrategize : Define climate strategy to meet client ambitions. Decarbonization starts by quantifying environmental baselines and defining organizational ambitions. Our consultants help companies measure their environmental impacts, create a decarbonization roadmap, structure their program & governance and communicate on commitments.\n\nDigitize : Create a single-source-of-truth for energy and resource data management requires monitoring of resource usage and emissions, identifying saving opportunities and reporting on benchmark progress. This is achieved with Schneider's digital platform and services (EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor and NeoNetwork \u2122 ).\n\nDecarbonize : Execute decarbonization strategy using four key levers: electrification of operations, reduction of energy use, replacing energy source and engaging the whole value chain. Ultimately, decarbonization requires action. Schneider Electric's robust portfolio of end-to-end net-zero solutions supports clients to deliver those levers. Our global team of experts helps our customers deploy these solutions to systematically achieve their decarbonization aspirations.\n\n## Destination digital\n\nFor more than 15 years, our digital applications and trusted advisors have helped organizations around the world set strategy and execute action to enable their decarbonization journeys.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor, Schneider Electric's award-winning digital enterprise sustainability management application, complements the services delivered by its Sustainability Business.

        "page_content": "## An introduction by Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, Olivier Blum\n\n## World's Most Sustainable Corporation in 2021\n\nFor well over a decade, sustainability has been at the heart of what Schneider does. Still, 2021 was a standout year, in several respects.\n\nIn January, our continuous efforts to address climate change and social inequality received the highest profile of external recognitions when the Canadian media and research company Corporate Knights ranked us the World's Most Sustainable Corporation. This, along with numerous other ESG recognitions in 2021, is testimony to the valuable, long-term positive impact we have.\n\nThroughout the year, the need to address climate change and social inequality hit headlines seemingly every day. In November, governments and businesses made important commitments at the COP26 climate change conference, though talk must now translate into rapid, bold and comprehensive action if we're to prevent a potentially catastrophic rise in global temperatures.\n\nWe share the responsibility to act with governments and other institutions, and we believe that private-sector corporates like Schneider play a crucial role in leading the transition to a cleaner, more inclusive world.\n\n## Paving the way as an Impact Company\n\nAs an Impact company, we're determined to keep intensifying our meaningful and lasting impact across all dimensions of ESG (environmental, social, corporate governance and ethics), from employees to supply chain partners, customers, as well as local communities and institutions at local and global levels. By weaving sustainability and societal impact into all facets of our business, we create long-term value for all stakeholders and deliver profitable growth.\n\nDuring the course of the year, we moved forward with our 20212025 Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) targets. These are aligned to both our six long-term commitments related to climate, resources, equal opportunities, trust, all generations, and local communities, and to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. This latest program reinforces our ESG commitments through 11 global targets, plus a new local target to empower our country organizations to address their specific challenges and opportunities. The progress we make on these SSI targets is a true indicator of our company's transformation, both globally and on the ground.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our achievements to fight climate change and social inequality\n\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we kicked off a new initiative to help 1,000 of our top suppliers reduce their carbon emissions by 50% by 2025. With our supply chain community, we're working to evaluate, strategize and implement decarbonization actions suited to each supplier's specific maturity and scope. Furthermore, we've raised our ambitions when it comes to the environmental and social responsibility of our supply chain: we are well on our way to using more sustainable resources and materials in our products and packaging, and we audit our suppliers to ensure they comply with the highest ethical work standards and best practices.\n\nAs ever, we're committed to helping resolve social problems, and to promoting equal opportunities for all our employees. We live in a world for instance where 800 million people don't have access to energy, which is why we develop and deliver adapted solutions that supply clean, safe and reliable energy, hereby unlocking education and economic opportunity, and a better quality of life.\n\nWe also continue to prioritize learning, development and upskilling not only for Schneider's multi-generational workforce, but also through the work of the Schneider Electric Foundation in supporting local NGOs that run vocational training programs for young people. In 2021, we reached an impressive milestone in this field, with 300,000 people trained in energy management since we launched the program in 2009.\n\nAnd no less importantly, we seek to build trust with our stakeholders, living up to the highest standards of corporate governance, through initiatives that monitor and educate teams on ethics, cybersecurity, safety, and quality. Our 2021 Trust Charter, the evolution of our Principles of Responsibility, sets out the expectations of how we work at Schneider, and equips our teams to confront any unethical behavior they might encounter.\n\nThese are just some highlights of 2021. Looking ahead, as a leading Impact Company in 2022, we're committed to doing even more, even faster.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our performance on page 63 \u01f0",

It encompasses continuous improvement of environmental, social, and ethical dimensions across an organizations entire value chain and stakeholders.\n\nSchneider Electric's short-term roadmap (3 - 5 years) is built on a consultation process involving external and internal stakeholders, called a materiality assessment, as well as dedicated internal governance mechanisms involving the Strategy & Sustainability team, employees, experts in the Group, the Executive Committee, and the Board of Directors, under the leadership of the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer.\n\nIn the medium (5 - 10 years) and long term (10 - 30 years), Schneider Electric aligns its strategy on key issues under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and global climate scenarios in coherence with its business model and global footprint.\n\nThis holistic approach to sustainability allows the Group to greatly mitigate risks and also brings tangible value added through a greater attractivity to customers, new talents, and investors, while boosting innovation.\n\nThe numerous awards received each year (e.g., #1 Most Sustainable Corporation, Financial Times top 50 Diversity Leaders, Gartner Supply Chain Top 25, etc.) and the Group's leadership in the main ESG indices (e.g., Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, Euronext Vigeo Eiris World 120, etc.), confirms that Schneider Electric is headed in the right direction.\n\n## 2.1.1.2  A unique position to fight climate change and social inequality\n\nAs a global specialist in the digital transformation of energy management and automation, the Group places its expertise and solutions at the service of its customers to ensure that energy is safe, reliable, efficient, connected, and sustainable.\n\n## The Group's sustainability roadmap\n\n## 2021-2025\n\nProgress on our Climate Pledge to reach carbon neutrality in the Group's operations.\n\nReach the 11 global, and one local, objectives of the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) 2021 - 2025, as well as the 25 objectives of the Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) under our six long term commitments (climate, equal, resources, generations, trust, and local).\n\nThe Group proposes an integrated offering of technologies and market-leading solutions tailored to customer needs, promoting the transition towards more electric, digital, decarbonized, and decentralized/uni00A0energy. These solutions balance the need to reduce the planet's carbon footprint with the inalienable human right to quality energy and access to digital.\n\nIn fact, Schneider Electric is uniquely positioned among the 1,000+ companies taking action for climate change because it acts on both sides of the same equation:\n\n- \u00b7 The solutions Schneider Electric brings to the market are directly linked to activities to mitigate, adapt, and improve humanity's resilience to climate change;\n- \u00b7 At the same time, Schneider Electric acts to reduce its end-toend CO 2 footprint, aiming for a net-zero CO 2 supply chain by 2050, with precise steps for 2025, 2030, and 2040.\n\nThis positive contribution is measured as Impact revenues, which represent 71% of the Group's total revenues in 2021. In addition, to further contribute to a new electric and digital world, 100% of Schneider Electric's innovation projects are aligned with its purpose, more than 90% being either strictly green or neutral. On this journey for a better planet, the Group is convinced that no one should be left behind, and businesses should operate a just transition.\n\n## 2.1.1.3  A commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals\n\nSchneider Electric is committed to taking urgent action to cocreate a brighter future aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), consisting of 17 objectives and measuring its impact with transparency. The SDGs are about protecting the planet, alleviating poverty, and achieving worldwide peace and justice. By tracking its sustainability performance and publishing quarterly results, Schneider Electric uphold its commitments to the SDGs and industry leadership in corporate social responsibility.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.2 The Schneider Sustainability Impact, a unique transformation tool\n\n## 2.1.2.1 A continuous improvement process anchored in our practice since 2005\n\nTo demonstrate significant impacts and initiate lasting change, performance must be measured, in a relevant manner for a company and its stakeholders. That is why Schneider Electric defines specific Group objectives and measures its results each quarter (since 2005) in a dashboard commonly referred to as a 'barometer'. In 2018, this barometer was renamed Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI). Schneider uses this tool to address its sustainability challenges and to improve each of the pillars of its strategy identified through its materiality matrix. The SSI uses a scoring scale of 10 and provides an overall measure of the Group's progress. The tool also enables Schneider to anticipate and effectively manage its risks and opportunities by mobilizing key stakeholders around specific, measured objectives and reliable results. The SSI's performance and monitoring systems are audited annually by an external auditor (limited assurance). Each SSI seeks to:\n\n- \u00b7 Mobilize the whole Company around holistic sustainability goals impacting its ecosystem;\n- \u00b7 Share the Group's improvement plans with stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 Create system value .\n\nOn a daily basis, Schneider Electric proves that economic, environmental, and social interests are convergent.\n\n## 2.1.2.2  Two complementary sustainability performance dashboards to progress between 2021 and 2025\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric defined six new objectives for the 2021-2025 period:\n\n- 1. Act for a climate positive world, by continuously investing in and developing innovative solutions that deliver immediate and lasting decarbonization in line with our carbon pledge.\n- 2. Be efficient with resources, by behaving responsibly and making the most of digital technology to preserve our planet.\n- 3. Live up to our principles of Trust, by upholding ourselves and all around us to high social, governance, and ethical standards.\n\n## 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Reach net-zero operational emissions and reduction of Scope 3 emissions by 35% (versus 2017) as part of the Group's validated 1.5\u00b0C Science-Based Target (SBT)\n- \u00b7 Consume 100% renewable electricity (RE100)\n- \u00b7 Double energy productivity (versus 2005) (EP100)\n- \u00b7 Switch to 100% electric cars (EV100)\n- \u00b7 Provide access to energy to 100 million people\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n- 4. Create equal opportunities, by ensuring all employees are uniquely valued and work in an inclusive environment to develop and contribute their best.\n- 5. Harness the power of all generations, by fostering learning, upskilling, and development for each generation, paving the way for the next.\n- 6. Empower local communities, by promoting local initiatives and enabling individuals and partners to make sustainability a reality for all.\n\nThe execution of the Group's 2021 - 2025 sustainability strategy is tracked through quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs), under two complementary tools: the SSI and the new Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE).\n\nThe SSI is the translation of our six long-term commitments into a selection of 11 highly transformative and innovative programs. The programs will be tracked and published quarterly, audited annually, and linked to short-term incentive plans for more than 64,000 employees. A notable addition to the SSI in 2021 is the local aspect, aiming to deploy local actions in the 100+ markets where the Group operates in order to better empower all leaders and collaborators to unlock meaningful local impacts.\n\nThe SSE has been created to maintain a high level of commitment and transparency in the actions taken by the Group. This new tool brings balance between the innovative transformation plans of the SSI and the need to keep progressing on other long-lasting programs. In this spirit of continuous improvement, and in a holistic vision of sustainability, the SSE will track annual progress with 25 quantitative KPIs, and some additional qualitative programs.\n\nCollectively, the SSI 11 Global Impacts and its Local Impact, as well as the 25 SSE programs, are the Group's short-term sustainability roadmap and our contribution to the 17 United Nations SDGs.  More details on our contributions to each SDG are available online.\n\n## 2.1.2.3 A vision beyond 2025 for climate, biodiversity, and access to energy\n\nClimate change, biodiversity loss, rising inequalities, all those issues have long-term consequences and cannot be addressed with a short-term mindset only: solving these issues requires a combination of a long-term vision and concrete short-term action. The Group's meaningful purpose and its 2021-2025 SSI fit with Schneider's longer-term 2050 vision for a fair and decarbonized world, and key steps along the way in 2030 and 2040 that are presented below.\n\n## 2040\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBecome carbon neutral on full end-to-end footprint by 2040 (full Scopes 1, 2, and 3), 10 years ahead of 1.5\u00b0C climate trajectory. This means that all Schneider Electric products will be carbon neutral by 2040 (using quality offsets)\n\n## 2050\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEngage with suppliers towards a net-zero CO 2 supply chain\n\n2.",

This is achieved by converting each KPI's performance on a 10-point scale, considering that base year performance receives a 3/10 score and the 2025 objective translates to a 10/10 score. For each KPI, the relevant score is obtained by linear interpolation and rounded down to the second decimal. The overall score of the tool is the average of each KPI's score with equal weight excluding the local commitment (SSI #+1). As an exception, in 2021, two other KPIs are excluded: SSI #6, as the program is still in development, and SSI #7, because 2021 is the baseline year.\n- (2)  Generally, the 2020 performance serves as a baseline for SSI programs, except for two programs measured against a 2019 baseline to mitigate COVID-19 impacts (SSI #1 Impact revenues and SSI #10 opportunities for the next generation).\n- (3)  Each year, Schneider Electric obtains a 'limited' level of assurance on methodology and progress from an independent third party verifier for all of the SSI indicators (except for SSI #6, SSI #7 and SSI #+1), in accordance with ISAE 3000 assurance standard (see Independent verifier's report on page 224). Please refer to page 206 for the methodological presentation of each indicator. The 2021 performance is also discussed in more details in each section of this report.\n- (4)  For the reporting requirements under the European Taxonomy Regulation, please refer to page 68 and page 216.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

baseline for Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) programs, except for SSE/uni00A0#5, SSE #14 and SSE/uni00A0#20 measured against a 2019 baseline to mitigate COVID-19 impacts.\n- (2)  Each year, Schneider Electric obtains a 'limited' level of assurance on methodology and progress from an independent third party verifier for all of the SSE indicators (except SSE/uni00A0#12 and SSE #23), in accordance with ISAE 3000 assurance standard (see Independent verifier's report on page 224). Please refer to page 206 for the methodological presentation of each indicator. The 2021 performance is also discussed in more details in each section of this report.\n- (3)  SSE #12 'Social Excellence' program currently under development and will be deployed in 2023.\n- (4)  As of 31 st December 2021, 99.99% of eligible employees, i.e. all Schneider employees treated as permanent workforce, were paid the living wage. The few remaining gaps were closed early 2022 so that all in scope Schneider Electric employees are now paid the living wage. The final KPI result for 2021 was rounded to 100%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

Three allhands workshops took place, and the sustainability team organized individual follow up interviews with each member to define precise and measurable programs.\n\nFor the Group, it is a guarantee of strong mobilization in the field that is consistent with actual priorities; for teams, it is the assurance of having the necessary means and visibility to improve. In each new period, the barometer update takes into account results obtained, progress still expected, the emergence of new topics and new priorities, and the experience gained. Thus, it is a powerful tool to move the Group forward on its major challenges.\n\nFour scenarios may emerge from one SSI to the next:\n\n- \u00b7 Improvement plans are maintained in the barometer and their targets are renewed or increased.\n- \u00b7 Improvement plans change: new and more innovative or better-adapted indicators that cover the same subject are implemented; old indicators continue to be monitored internally if necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 SSI Pilots provide quarterly performance updates\n- \u00b7 The Sustainability Team coordinates quarterly publications, the annual audit and reporting in voluntary and regulatory publications\n- \u00b7 The Group Sustainability Committee evaluates progress and decides corrective actions\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Human Resources & CSR Committee, oversees progress and approves Reward plans\n- \u00b7 Improvement plans are removed from the barometer; this is also the case with indicators that have reached a threshold. They continue to be monitored internally if necessary.\n- \u00b7 Improvement plans to address new challenges are implemented.\n\n## Governance and validation of the SSI\n\nThe Sustainability department presents a draft version of the new SSI to the Human Resources & CSR Committee Committee, which reports on its work to the Board of Directors, and to the Group Sustainability Committee for validation. This latter Committee includes six members of the Executive Committee: the Chief Strategy and Sustainability Officer; Chief Human Resources Officer; Chief Global Supply Chain Officer; Chief Marketing Officer; Chief Governance Officer & Secretary General; and Chief Financial Officer.

        "page_content": "## 2.1  Sustainability at the heart of our strategy\n\n## 2.1.3  Measuring our contribution to a more sustainable world\n\nSchneider Electric has been an early adopter of transparent disclosures on sustainable revenues, and created its own methodology of 'Impact revenues' (1) in 2019, covering offers that bring environmental efficiency to its customers, while not generating any significant harmful impact to the environment, and excluding revenues from carbon intensive segments. Recently, the European Union (EU) has shown international leadership by being the first to develop a Regulation and Taxonomy aiming at driving investments towards environmentally sustainable activities, which the Group applauds. Both methodologies are somewhat aligned but currently differ in the scope of eligible activities, and in endsegments exclusions. The Group is supportive of a better alignment over the next years to provide its multinational stakeholders with standardized metrics and empower them to shape a more sustainable future for all.\n\n## 2.1.3.1  A purpose-led, Impact Company\n\nSchneider Electric's purpose is to empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, bridging progress and sustainability for all. The Group's differentiation lies in its complementary actions to demonstrate outstanding environmental, social, and ethical performance, and to support its customers in their Net-zero CO 2 journey. Schneider is the digital partner of its customers for sustainability and efficiency.\n\nThe Group proposes an integrated offering of technologies and market-leading solutions tailored to customer needs, promoting the transition towards more electric, digital, decarbonized, and decentralized energy. Those active energy efficiency solutions which consist of optimizing the entire energy cycle using energy control products, systems, services, and software - help mitigate, adapt, and improve humanity's resilience to climate change.\n\nSchneider Electric quantifies this climate impact as part of Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) and is committed to help its customers save and avoid 800 million tonnes of CO 2 by 2025 (cumulated since 2018). As of end 2021, the Group delivered 347 million tonnes of CO 2 e of this commitment. The methodology and results of this indicator are audited every year as part of the extra-financial audit.\n\n## 2.1.3.2  Early-adopter of transparent disclosures on sustainable revenues\n\nFor more than fifteen years, Schneider Electric has led by example and transparently presented its sustainability performance to its stakeholders, across all environmental, social and governance topics and tried to develop new market practices, such as its saved and avoided CO 2 methodology or biodiversity footprint.\n\nIn 2019, the Group was one of the first companies to proactively disclose information on the share of its revenue coming from offers that bring energy, climate, or resource efficiency to its customers, while not generating any significant harmful impact to the environment. Originally called 'Green Revenues' to match market standards, such sales were renamed 'Schneider Impact revenues' (1) to avoid any confusion with the new European\n\nTaxonomy coming into force. In 2021, the Group took a step further by committing that Schneider Impact revenues reach 80% of Group sales by 2025 as part of its SSI. It is worth noting that each year the performance of the SSI impacts short-term incentive plans for 64,000 employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Grow our Schneider Impact revenues to 80%\n\nThe Group supported the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) as part of its plan to deploy an integrated data center solution to provide effective operation and management, ensuring high reliability and 24/7 availability, as well as full visibility for day-to-day monitoring of all systems and processes. Schneider proposed EcoStruxure \u2122 for Data Center, an open, interoperable, IoT-enabled system architecture and platform. It leverages advancements in IoT, mobility, sensing, cloud and big data analytics technologies to bring unprecedented insight into data center operations through our connected products, edge control, apps, analytics and services. As a result, HKUST achieve significant energy saving and their power usage effectiveness (PUE) rating more than doubled.\n\nBaseline\n\n2025 target\n\n70%\n\n80%\n\n71%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider Impact revenues can be split into four categories:\n\n- 1. Energy efficiency architectures bringing energy and/or resource efficiency to customers.\n- 2. Grid reinforcement and smart grid architectures contributing to electrification and decarbonization.\n- 3. Products with differentiating green performance , flagged thanks to our Green Premium \u2122 program.\n- 4. Services that bring benefits for circularity (prolonged asset lifetime and uptime, optimized maintenance operations, repair, and refurbish) and energy efficiency (maintenance to maintain the operational performance of equipment and avoid a decrease of energy efficiency over time).\n\nAdditionally, revenues derived from activities with fossil sectors and others are systematically excluded, including Oil & Gas, coal mining, and fossil-power generation, in line with prevailing corporate responsibility reporting and sustainable finance practices, even though Schneider Electric's technologies deliver resource and carbon efficiency in such sectors as well. In line with Schneider Electric's strategy to phase out SF 6 from offers by 2025, SF 6 -containing switchgear for medium voltage applications are also excluded. In addition, neutral technologies such as signaling, racks and enclosures, access control, or emergency lighting are excluded.\n\n2021 Progress",

        "page_content": "Based on our assessment, which covers 100% of Schneider consolidated sales, the total share of Schneider Impact revenues is 71% in 2021 versus 70% in 2019.\n\nIn addition, to further contribute to a new electric and digital world, 100% of Schneider Electric's innovation projects are aligned with its purpose, more than 90% qualifying as impact innovation under Schneider's definition, or neutral. This concerns every innovation contributing to a decarbonized world, for instance energy and process efficiency, resource optimization, SF 6 -free projects, or Green Premium \u2122 offers. The methodology to calculate this figure is similar to the Schneider Impact Revenue methodology and should not be confused with OpEx and CapEx eligible under the EU Taxonomy.\n\n## 2.1.3.3  New reporting requirements under the European Taxonomy Regulation\n\nThe adoption of the Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852) in 2020 establishes a European Union-wide classification system to identify economic activities that are considered as environmentally sustainable as part of the European Union's longterm plan to connect finance with its sustainability goals. Dedicated Delegated Acts (DA) specify (or will specify), for each of the six environmental objectives identified, which activities are likely to make a substantial contribution to an objective (eligibility).\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nEnvironmental objectives with published DA (covered in this eligibility assessment and subject to evolutions):\n\n- 1. Climate change mitigation\n- 2. Climate change adaptation\n\nEnvironmental objectives for which DA are not published yet:\n\n- 3. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4. Transition to a circular economy\n- 5. Pollution prevention and control\n- 6. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nPursuant to Article 8 of the regulation and the delegated regulation published on 6 July 2021, the proportion of turnover, Capital (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx) resulting from products or services associated with economic activities considered sustainable is due to be reported progressively over the fiscal years 2021 to 2023. In FY 2021, large undertakings are required to disclose those three KPIs for activities eligible to climate objectives according to the EU Climate Delegated Act already published.\n\nEligible activities then need to be subjected to a series of screening tests, to determine if they are Taxonomy-aligned and can be reported as such, meaning that corporates will have to demonstrate that the eligible activities do not significantly harm any of the other five objectives ('Does Not Significantly Harm', DNSH criteria), and comply with minimum social safeguards (e.g. OECD, United Nations).\n\n## 2.1.3.4  Gradual inclusion of economic activities to the EU Taxonomy\n\nIn this report we focus on eligibility according to the current EU Climate DA published.

        "page_content": "## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\n## 2.1  Sustainability at the heart of our strategy\n\nImportantly, the phased application of reporting requirements, as well as the evolving nature of the regulatory framework means that the KPIs disclosed in this report may evolve as the regulation and its reporting requirements do. A complementary DA defining additional eligible activities for the climate change mitigation objective is also under public consultation at the time of writing, and DAs for the remaining four environmental objectives are expected in 2022. This means that more Schneider activities could be included in the EU Taxonomy reference framework gradually.\n\nFor instance this may concern Schneider's offers related to grid reinforcement and smart grid architectures contributing to electrification and decarbonization, products with differentiating green performance (flagged thanks to our Green Premium \u2122 program) or services that bring benefits for circularity and energy efficiency. Another example is the Group's industrial automation activities, which can have significant environmental benefits.\n\n## 2.1.3.5  Schneider Electric's support to the EU Taxonomy\n\nSchneider Electric has experienced both the value and the challenges of conducting a mapping of green business activities early on. The Group therefore welcomes the European Commission's work to define a common classification system for sustainable economic activities and believes that the taxonomy can bring greater transparency and reporting alignment among non-financial undertakings.\n\nThe Group is willing to share its experience in the measurement of revenues contributing to a sustainable world and work collaboratively and constructively with relevant stakeholders to advance the transition to a sustainable and low-carbon economy. In particular, Group experts are contributing to the Platform on Sustainable Finance, an expert group assisting the EU Commission in developing technical criteria.\n\n## 2.1.3.6  Turnover derived from Taxonomyeligible activities under the current EU Climate Delegated Act\n\nSchneider Electric identified several business activities that are eligible according to the current EU Climate DA. We provide the list of those activities in our methodological note on page 216.\n\n## Spotlight on Sustainability Consulting\n\nSchneider's sustainability consulting business brings together the full portfolio of Schneider Electric solutions to provide unparalleled, end-to-end support to our customers to achieve their net-zero, sustainable transformations, from formulating climate strategy to execution & deployment of sustainability offers.\n\nFor example, Schneider Electric is helping the VELUX Group, the world leader in roof windows and skylights, to develop a global program to successfully reduce their energy use and scale renewable capacity at each of the company's factories.\n\nIn 2021, the Taxonomy-eligible turnover amounts to 28%, representing EUR/uni00A08,032 million out of EUR 28,905 million total revenues. Non-eligible turnover therefore amounts to 72%.\n\nThis number is based on the first evaluation of the eligibility of Schneider Electric's activities using two combined approaches, including an offer-based approach (i.e. by nature of technology), whereby each line of business' products are reviewed against the definition of economic activities as defined in the EU Climate Delegated Acts, and an end-segment approach, whereby the amount of revenues generated from Taxonomy-eligible endsegments (Green Transport and Renewables mainly) for each product line is reviewed. Double-counting between offer-based approach and end-segment-based approaches are then removed before consolidation.\n\n## 2.1.3.7  Capital (CapEx) and Operational Expenditure (OpEx)\n\nIn 2021, Taxonomy-eligible CapEx amounts to 27%, representing EUR 757 million out of EUR 2,764 million. Therefore, the Taxonomynon-eligible CapEx amounts to 73%.\n\nAll costs based on IFRS 16 related to long-term leasing of buildings are considered eligible. CapEx related to assets or processes associated with Taxonomy-eligible activities, including Research & Development (R&D) CapEx, were calculated using allocation keys of eligible turnover per business and operations. In 2021, CapEx for eligible individual measures was not evaluated.\n\nIn 2021, Taxonomy-eligible OpEx amounts to 23%, representing EUR 291 million out of EUR 1,276 million total OpEx (R&D). Therefore, the Taxonomy non-eligible OpEx amounts to 77%.\n\nOnly non-capitalized costs related to R&D are reported. OpEx related to building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair and other expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets represent less than EUR 116 million and are therefore considered as non-material for Schneider Electric business and excluded from the KPI calculation.\n\n- Read more on our EU Taxonomy assessment methodology page 216 \u01f0\n\nThe project, which is designed to support VELUX Group in reaching its company carbon neutral goal by 2030 and accelerate its plan to be Lifetime Carbon Neutral, includes the energy assessment of all factory sites resulting in the development and implementation of Zero Carbon Action plans, support of its Energy Excellence program in accordance with ISO50001, improved energy efficiency, expansion of onsite renewable heating and electricity capacity to phase out fossil fuels, and implementation of a global monitoring system through Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor to measure and analyze energy usage.",

        "page_content": "Strategic Report\n\n## Spotlight on Building Management Systems (BMS)\n\nDue to their high energy use and the carbon generated during their manufacturing and construction process, buildings account for nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Decarbonizing buildings and ensuring their efficient energy usage requires the implementation of smarter solutions and thereby helps combat climate change. Such activities are qualified as 'Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings' (3.5) in the EU Climate DA.\n\nOur EcoStruxure \u2122 Building Operation solution is a scalable, open integration software platform at the heart of the building management system that facilitates control, monitoring, and management of building assets. It offers users a single pane of glass window for efficient monitoring and operations of building systems to enable improved building efficiency, asset utilization, uptime, and occupant comfort through integration of HVAC, electrical, lighting, security, fire, power, and other subsystems. By monitoring, controlling, organizing, and acting on disparate data from building assets to a single system through advanced connectivity and integration with heterogeneous building systems, our solution brings better visibility and decision-making processes, optimizes how and when energy is used, and enables proactive energy reduction.\n\nFor example, our solution for the Cinnamon Grand Colombo, Sri Lanka's largest hotel, helps save 4,000 metric tons of GHG emissions annually. Even though energy savings equipment had been previously installed, the operations staff was not able to identify specific areas where energy was being wasted. There was a need to gain visibility into the data to develop effective energy savings strategies. After conducting an initial energy audit, an upgrade of the hotel's existing BMS to Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure \u2122 Building Operation solution was recommended. At the Cinnamon Grand Colombo, the EcoStruxure \u2122 solution integrates the hotel's electrical and mechanical plants, which include building systems for air conditioning, exhaust, ventilation fans, pumps, steam and hot water boilers, energy meters, and high efficiency, magnetic bearing chillers from Smardt. The result provides efficient energy monitoring, management, and reporting that drives savings across the entire hotel.\n\n## Delivering environmental benefits through industrial automation\n\nSchneider Electric works hand in hand with industrial enterprises to automate their operations, and in doing so, helps them reduce or eliminate carbon emissions and optimize their use of resources. From smart sensors and connected devices to advanced process controllers with software analytics on the top, industrial automation systems enable better monitoring, control, and optimization strategies to directly improve energy performance, and indirectly, improve maintenance to prevent an increase in energy use due to plant downtime and resulting startup and shutdown processes, as well as defective products. Advanced supervision also enables to mitigate environmental pollution risks. As such, they are major enablers to mitigate climate change, pollution prevention and support the deployment of a circular economy\n\nTraditionally, industrial operators have been blamed for climate change, resource scarcity, and harm to the environment and the society around them. Today, industry contributes 32% of the world's CO 2 emissions. At the same time, many of the most energy intensive industries produce the essential building blocks for society and key components of our modern world. According to the BloombergNEF report, Digitalization: An Untapped Pathway to Sustainability, industrial digitization promotes decarbonization and circularity, reduces material waste, prolongs equipment lifetime, and enables better emissions monitoring. Schneider's teams have seen it firsthand with our industrial customers.\n\nFor example, Schneider Electric supported EastLink to improve the ventilation system of the EastLink freeway tunnels in Australia for better energy efficiency and a reduction in noise levels from the ventilation stacks:\n\n- \u00b7 Auditing the energy usage of the tunnel system, Schneider identified areas where significant energy savings could be made. Since the opening of EastLink, the speed of airflows within the tunnels and stacks was controlled in a traditional way - by switching individual fans on and off at pre-programmed times of the day. When switched on, a fan always operated at full speed. This was inefficient, using more electricity than necessary and producing high operating noise levels. It was also causing unnecessary wear and tear on components.\n- \u00b7 To address the energy usage and noise issues, Schneider worked with EastLink to upgrade ten large ventilation fans from fixed speed fully off / fully on operation to a much more efficient self-regulating or closed loop variable speed operation. An on demand ventilation system using Schneider Electric EcoStruxure \u2122 architecture, Modicon M580 PACs, Altivar Process variable speed drives and an AVEVA Plant SCADA system was implemented to bring together automation, connectivity and software for real time control and visibility.\n- \u00b7 The upgrade has reduced energy use by almost 70% and the carbon footprint reduction by 9,000 tonnes per annum. This is thanks to the use of the EcoStruxure \u2122 for Industry solution with the variable speed drives, and the control algorithms in the M580 PAC which means the fans are only ever operating at the speed that is required at the time. This reduction in fan usage will also see an increase in the fan life because of the lower stresses applied to the drive motor and impeller. The upgrade with Schneider Electric has contributed to EastLink being awarded the top 5-star GRESB sustainability rating. GRESB has ranked EastLink number 1 private entity road company in the world, and number 5 of 280 infrastructure assets of all types around the world.\n\n2.",

To manage these programs and to better answer the needs of Schneider's local stakeholders, a new model for sustainability governance in the company was created with a network of 40 Territory Sustainability Leaders. This new network will meet every two months and will work to further instill a culture of sustainability at every level of the company, to empower every employee to act, and to innovate with disruptive sustainability actions.\n\nA Group Sustainable Communities Taskforce, chaired by the Executive Vice-President International Operations, and composed of representatives of each of Schneider's five operational regions and the Sustainability department, has met twice in 2021 to monitor the deployment of the local programs and the creation of the Territory Leaders network. The Taskforce will meet annually going forward to review progress and opportunity for global deployment of local initiatives.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\n## 2.1 Sustainability at the heart of our strategy\n\n## 2.1.4.4 Internal governance model\n\nInternal policies create the backbone of an organization's compliance and security program. They ensure employees understand how to implement critical tasks and meet behavior expectations. Regulators have made clear the need for effective policy development and management programs. It is no longer enough to merely document the existence of policies and procedures.\n\nOrganizations must be able to demonstrate that employees know, understand and apply them. In other words, simply developing and publishing policies is no longer sufficient in the eyes of our stakeholders (NGOs, regulators, customers, financial partners, etc.). To that end, Schneider Electric has established a four tier form of documentation pyramid of norms, under the umbrella of its Code of Conduct called the Trust Charter, strengthened by policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines.\n\nPolicies consist of formal statements produced and supported by the leadership team, that state where the organization stands on important issues. Schneider has around 85 global policies. The Schneider Electric Global Policy Management Policy provides the rules to be followed for global policies.\n\nStandards defined in these internal policies assign quantifiable measures and define acceptable level of quality. They aim to make a policy more meaningful and effective. Procedures establish the proper steps to take to operationalize a policy and/or standard. Finally, guidelines provide additional guidance with a set of recommendations to clarify expectations in relation to a given procedure.\n\n## Trust Charter\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric evolved its Principles of Responsibility to the Trust Charter, acting as its Code of Conduct and demonstrating its commitment to ethics, safety, sustainability, quality, and cybersecurity. It is an executive summary of our policies and a guide on how we work. It is available publicly on our website in 30 languages. Further details are provided on page 94.\n\n## Human rights & corporate citizenship\n\nIn 2017, Schneider Electric drafted a specific Human Rights Policy as part of a broader program on duty of vigilance in its value chain and in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (see page 106).\n\n## Human resources and safety\n\nThe Group's Human Resources policies cover the following topics: diversity, equity and inclusion, health & well-being, safety, security and travel, employee engagement, family leave, anti-harassment, recruiting, international mobility, training, human capital development, talent identification, total remuneration, social benefits, and COVID-19. These apply to the Group and are accompanied by global processes.\n\n## Ethical business conduct\n\nIn addition to the Trust Charter, different policies bolster the Group's commitments in terms of business ethics and integrity. The Business Agents Policy specifies the rules to be followed when an external stakeholder is solicited to get a deal and integrates the approval process of business agents. The Internal Fraud Investigation directive indicates the commitment to whistleblower\n\nprotection. The Gifts & Hospitality Policy was approved by the Group's CEO in December 2015 and updated in 2021 before local deployment. It is supplemented by an anti-corruption Code of Conduct detailing related processes. Other policies cover social media management, competition law, conflict of interest, export control, etc.\n\n## Cybersecurity, data privacy and protection\n\nWith the acceleration of the digitalization, Schneider Electric developed many policies to reinforce its cybersecurity and respect personal data and privacy, such as IT asset management and usage, acceptable use of assets, general information security, data classification, global data privacy, user access management policy, email security policy, and many others. It is the pillar containing the most policies.\n\n## Climate and resources\n\nSchneider Electric's environmental policy aims to improve industrial processes, reinforce product EcoDesign and incorporate Group customers' concerns about environmental protection by providing them with product and service solutions. It is bolstered by the Energy and Environment policies. These policies apply to the Group and are accompanied by global action plans.\n\n## Responsible sourcing\n\nIn 2016, Schneider Electric renewed the charter for its suppliers, called the Supplier Guide Book. The first chapter of this book sets out the Group's sustainability expectations in five areas: environment, fair and ethical business practices, sustainable purchasing, working conditions, and human rights. These requirements are detailed in a dedicated document called the Supplier Code of Conduct. In 2018, the Group adopted the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct for suppliers. In October 2021, Schneider renewed its Supplier Code of Conduct whereby it requires all its suppliers to review their own operations, take ambitious targets, and initiate bold actions in the areas mentioned in this Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\n## Strive for high quality\n\nSchneider's priority is to delight its customers with an outstanding end-to-end experience. Quality is every customer's right and every employee's responsibility. Experience is the most important driver for customers, defining the business relationships they sustain with suppliers and partners. The Group's customers place trust in its resilient, highly personalized, multi-channel experience, and the superior quality of its products. To ensure this, the company acts with agility, discipline, and good business sense throughout the offer life cycle from creation to supply, manufacturing, delivery, when in operation and when being serviced. The Group has deployed a specific Quality Directive 'Managing Customer Safety Risks' and a Quality Procedure 'Offer Safety Review' to protect its customers. They are supported by a robust Quality Management System, which is improved continuously to fulfill expectations of all relevant parties. It is in full alignment with the Trust Charter as well as in compliance with ISO 9001 standard.",

Nearly 200 stakeholders have been consulted in total (143 through an internal survey, 54 interviewed in person).\n\nParticipants were first asked what they felt were the key worldwide trends most likely to impact Schneider Electric in the future, before being asked to assess the significance of 31 issues according to a quantitative scoring scale. Then, participants were interviewed for qualitative evaluation and justification of the given scores. Participants were guided to prioritize the most transformative issues.\n\nIssues were scored according to their importance as follows:\n\n- 1 Medium or low importance\n- 2 Important\n- 3 Critical\n- 4 Chosen in top three most critical topics\n\nThese surveys and interviews also enabled Schneider Electric to consolidate the relationship with its stakeholders and learn about their expectations. Beforehand, the challenges were defined using a study of the sector's stakes (analysis of the different CSR guidelines, sector benchmarks, etc.) and a comparison with the 2017 materiality analysis. With the help of consulting firm Utopies, the aim is to ensure that Schneider Electric reports on the most important economic, social, and environmental challenges; identifies current and future opportunities and risks for the business; and updates its sustainability agenda with key stakeholders' expectations. In particular, the materiality matrix was one of the sources used to design the 2021-2025 Schneider Sustainability Impact and Schneider Sustainability Essentials, and to confirm the topics to be addressed in the registration document.\n\n## Key learnings\n\nOverall, stakeholders point to growing instability - whether environmental, social, political, or economic. This creates uncertainties for businesses, which should work on building resilience:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate is the main trend identified externally and internally. It includes the trend for energy transition and electrification, on which external stakeholders expect Schneider Electric to take the lead.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and the need for a just transition covering the Company's extended responsibility to its ecosystem, in particular in the supply chain, to ensure the low-carbon transition equally benefits all. Stakeholders also mentioned the growing expectations in providing ethical and sustainable products.\n- \u00b7 Resilience, and the move towards more local supply chains, specifically post-COVID-19, can be a way to mitigate geopolitical uncertainty and a rise in protectionism.\n- \u00b7 Ethics in digital: the growth of digitalization and the need for stronger ethics represents both an opportunity and a risk for Schneider Electric. This covers topics such as the power of data and the ethical use required, the opportunities and dangers of Artificial Intelligence (AI), as well as people's well-being, or job security in a transitioning world.\n- \u00b7 Resource scarcity and circular economy showed very high expectations internally.\n\nDuring the discussions, some elements were often mentioned:\n\n- 1. The vision of the Group, endorsing the link between sustainability and digital, is complex and not always easy to understand for non-experts. Schneider Electric could be more pedagogic in its advocacy.\n- 2. There are high expectations for Schneider to become a globally recognized leader for a decarbonized world, with its products and solutions, and in terms of thought leadership.\n- 3. All 31 topics are deemed important, reinforcing our holistic vision of sustainability. Issues were prioritized based on three groups:\n- - Licence to operate - fundamental 'must have' topics such as product quality and safety, and cybersecurity.\n- - Standard issues - topics which are on track, and on which Schneider Electric must remain mobilized (e.g., health and security, environmental excellence, corruption).\n- - Key transformational topics - those which have the potential to transform markets and differentiate Schneider Electric from others (e.g., climate change engagement, circular economy, human engagement).\n- 4. The SSI is a renowned and transformative program which is a source of pride internally, and recognition externally, but which needs a new lease of life: simplified, with increased internal buy-in and awareness.",

CEN (European Standardization Committee), CENELEC (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) and ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) are the three official European standardization bodies.\n\nCEN-CENELEC-ETSI serve as a main contributor of the French electrotechnical institute, which is a founding member of international (IEC - International Electrotechnical Commission) and European (CENELEC) organizations.\n\n## CEN\n\nCEN is an association that brings together the National Standardization Bodies of 34 European countries. CEN provides a platform for the development of European Standards and other technical documents in relation to various kinds of products, materials, services and processes. CEN supports standardization activities in relation to a wide range of fields and sectors including: air and space, chemicals, construction, consumer products, defence and security, energy, the environment, food and feed, health and safety, healthcare, ICT, machinery, materials, pressure equipment, services, smart living, transport and packaging.\n\n## CENELEC\n\nCENELEC is an association that brings together the National Electrotechnical Committees of 34 European countries. CENELEC prepares voluntary standards in the electrotechnical field, which help facilitate trade between countries, create new markets, cut compliance costs and support the development of a Single European Market. CENELEC supports standardization activities in relation to a wide range of fields and sectors including: Electromagnetic compatibility, Accumulators, primary cells and primary batteries, Insulated wire and cable, Electrical equipment and apparatus, Electronic, electromechanical and electrotechnical supplies, Electric motors and transformers, Lighting equipment and electric lamps, Low Voltage electrical installations material, Electric vehicles railways, smart grid, smart metering, solar (photovoltaic) electricity systems, etc.\n\n## ETSI\n\nETSI creates globally applicable standards for information and communications technologies (ICT), including fixed, mobile, radio, converged, broadcast and internet technologies. Authorized by the European Union, ETSI implements legislation governing electronic use and other EU initiatives\n\n## IEC\n\nThe IEC is a global, not-for-profit membership organization that brings together more than 170 countries and coordinates the work of 20,000 experts globally. The IEC publishes around 10,000 IEC International Standards which together with conformity assessment provide the technical framework that allows governments to build national quality infrastructure and companies of all sizes to buy and sell consistently safe and reliable products in most countries of the world. IEC International Standards serve as the basis for risk and quality management and are used in testing and certification to verify that manufacturer promises are kept.\n\n## Smart grids and sustainable cities\n\nInvolved in IEC and CENELEC, at governance and technical levels, Schneider Electric participates actively in the standardization of smart grids, for which it leads the definition of standards and the standardization roadmap within the European smart grids coordination group, as well as the group in charge of standardizing the interfaces between smart buildings and smart grids.\n\n- \u00b7 Schneider co-chairs the Smart Energy Grid coordination group of the CEN-CENELEC-ETSI responsible for ensuring availability of an appropriate set of standards for the rollout of smart grids in Europe, as well as supporting the coming new legislative 'Clean Energy Package'.\n- \u00b7 It chairs the group at the IEC level in charge of defining the roadmap of international standards to support the rollout of the Smart Energy sector (smart grids, in addition to interfaces with other energies). This roadmap also includes cybersecurity and resilience, as well as the impact of the IoT.\n- \u00b7 It chairs and actively contributes to the definition of Prosumer's electrical installations, installations integrating local production such as PV, wind, storage to ensure they are designed and erected with a high level of safety and efficiency.\n- \u00b7 It chairs the IEC's Advisory Committee for Energy Efficiency (ACEE) and chairs the Advisory Committee on Safety (ACOS).\n\n## Circular economy and product environmental performance\n\nSchneider contributed to the European Commission's Circular Economy package, with CEN-CENELEC-ETSI developed a set of published standards assessing durability, reparability, reusability, recyclability, ability to be remanufactured, etc. which fall within the scope of the EcoDesign directive. Schneider has appointed active experts in each of the working groups.\n\nIt contributes to the terminology of circular economy being the first step of the digitalization of this topic, and also contributes to the material efficiency within environmentally conscious design, to the life cycle assessment product category rules and specific rules for high and low voltage equipment, and to greenhouse gas emission reduction quantification.\n\n## Standardization to accelerate environmental transformation\n\nSince February 2007, Schneider has represented France on the IEC's Advisory Committee for Environmental Aspects (ACEA). ACEA works to advise and coordinate the IEC's efforts to tackle environmental issues.",

More data, software and tools enabling virtual descriptions, defined in digital twins, creating new capabilities and services combined with Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nThat's why Schneider Electric is strongly involved in ISO and IEC technical committees, and association like Industrial Digital Twin Association to deep dive and deploy the Asset Administration Shell through industrial Use Cases of the standardized digital twin and in Universal Automation.Org, to address a more functional and distributed approach for the orchestration of industrial systems.\n\n## National committees\n\nSchneider Electric chairs many French standardization committees hosted by AFNOR (French standards organization) and in other national committees, such as the chair of the French and Swedish Committees for environmental standardization and the French Committee on Circular Economy. It was a major contributor to smart manufacturing initiatives such as the AIF in France. Notably, it is a member of the Council Board and of the IEC Conformity Assessment Board.\n\n## 2.1.6  Main ESG risks and opportunities\n\n## 2.1.6.1 Evaluation methodology\n\nAs part of its Extra-Financial Performance Declaration, the Group presents the main risks and opportunities identified with respect to major societal challenges in this section.\n\nIn order to compile the list of main extra-financial risks for the Group, a panel of both internal and external tools is used to address the expectations of its stakeholders as best as possible.\n\nThe Group Sustainability team leads the evaluation, working in close collaboration with the Group Risk Management function and with the Duty of Vigilance Committee.\n\nThe Group's corporate governance bodies supervise the development of internal control and risk management systems. The Audit & Risks Committee has particular responsibility for following up on the efficiency of internal control and risk management systems and reports to the Board of Directors.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nInternal tools:\n\n- \u00b7 A regular stakeholder consultation (materiality assessment and matrix), at least once every three years (last exercise done in 2020);\n- \u00b7 The Group risk matrix, led by the Group Risk Management function, updated every year;\n- \u00b7 Specific committees (Carbon, Human Resources, Ethics, etc.);\n- \u00b7 Vigilance risks matrix.\n\nContinuous monitoring of external signals and international frameworks:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulatory framework: the key topics listed under Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Extra-Financial Performance Declaration);\n- \u00b7 International institutions/organizations (United Nations Global Compact and SDGs);\n- \u00b7 Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) rating agencies;\n- \u00b7 Specific requests from investors and customers;\n- \u00b7 Recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and various frameworks (SASB, GRI, etc.).\n\nThe analysis covers the entire value chain of the Group and its stakeholders: suppliers and subcontractors, transactions, customers, as well as Schneider Electric's scope - extending to the activities at its Foundation - on cross-functional, environmental, social, and societal topics, human rights, and anti-corruption, with a double materiality approach.\n\nEach topic is monitored by the relevant departments and their management teams, or 'Risk Overseers', who are in charge of proper risk assessments and the implementation of mitigation and prevention actions. The main departments and managers are:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainability, Access to Energy, and Environment, and the Global Sustainability SVP and Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer;\n- \u00b7 Human Resources and the Chief Human Resources Officer;\n- \u00b7 Procurement and the Chief Procurement Officer;\n- \u00b7 Governance, Safety, and Ethics, and the Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Governance Officer.\n\nThe main identified risks are quantified on probability of occurrence and magnitude of impact by these departments to determine gross risks, and an assessment of current mitigation measures informs on potential net impacts. Extra-financial risks presented here are gross risks, i.e., absolute risks before a mitigation plan is implemented. The main net extra-financial risks are presented in 'Chapter 3, How we manage risks at Schneider Electric', page 243.\n\nOn this basis, the list of extra-financial risks is reviewed and validated by relevant SVPs, the Board of Directors' secretariat, Internal Audit team, Group Risk Management function and presented to the Human Resources & CSR Committee and to the Group Sustainability Committee at least every 3 years, in coherence with the SSI calendar.\n\nSeven main risk categories were identified and are presented in detail in the following pages:\n\n- \u00b7 Business conduct\n- \u00b7 Corporate governance\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity and data privacy\n- \u00b7 Environment\n- \u00b7 Product, projects, system quality and offer reliability\n- \u00b7 Human rights\n- \u00b7 Responsible workplace\n- \u00b7 Talent development and competencies\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.7  Key external frameworks and ESG ratings\n\n## 2.1.7.1 External guidelines\n\n## The United Nations Global Compact and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nThe Global Compact was launched in 1999 by United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan. It brings companies and nongovernmental organizations together under the aegis of the United Nations. Parties signing the Global Compact commit to 10 fundamental principles in four areas: human rights, labor rights, the environment, and anti-corruption. By signing the Global Compact in December 2002, Schneider Electric made a public commitment to these universal values. In line with the requirements of the Global Compact, Schneider publishes an annual Communication on Progress (COP) and meets the requirements of the Global Compact Advanced Level.\n\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future. At its heart are the 17 SDGs, which are an urgent call for action by all countries - developed and developing - in a global partnership. Schneider Electric is committed to contribute to the 17 SDGs through its sustainability programs.\n\n## International Organization for Standardization (ISO)\n\nIn 2010, the ISO published its guidelines on organizations' social responsibility (ISO standard 26000). This standard promotes a compromise involving different players from the public, private, and non-profit sectors from around 100 countries, and a vision of how an organization should view societal responsibility. This standard legitimizes the sustainability actions undertaken by the Group since the early 2000s and provides an educational support and framework for its actions in the field. The Group has worked since 2012 to promote the adoption of the ISO 26000 principles with its suppliers.\n\nSchneider also adopts other ISO guidelines or certifications: see ISO 14001 and ISO 50001, page 129; ISO 45001, page 109; ISO 9001, page 74; ISO 27000, page 105; and ISO 14025 and 14021, page 159.\n\n## The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n\nThe GRI was established in 1997 as a mission to develop globally applicable directives to report on economic, environmental, and social performances. Brought about by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (CERES) in association with the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), the GRI integrates the active participation of companies, NGOs, accounting bodies, business associations, and other stakeholders from across the globe. In 2016, Schneider integrated updates to the GRI Standards. Schneider Electric SE has reported in accordance with the GRI Standards for the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021. The Board of Directors has reviewed and approved the reported information, including the organization's material ESG topics, under Disclosure 2-14 in GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021. A reference table with its indicators and those proposed by the GRI is available on the Schneider Electric website.\n\n## The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)\n\nThe SASB Foundation was founded in 2011 as a not-for-profit, independent standards-setting organization. Schneider Electric provides information in alignment with SASB reporting guidelines for its sector (Electrical and Electronic Equipment). A correspondence table can be found in page 218.\n\n## The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nIn June 2017, the TCFD, a working group led by Michael Bloomberg under G20 Financial Stability Board's (FSB) mandate, published its recommendations for companies' climate action disclosure. CEOs from more than 100 companies signed a statement of support for the TCFD recommendations and Schneider Electric's CEO was among them. Detailed information can be found in Schneider Electric's CDP Climate Change public disclosure and in this report on page 220.\n\n## The Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi)\n\nScience-Based Targets (SBTs) specify how much and how quickly companies need to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in order to avoid a 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C global temperature increase, compared to pre-industrial levels. Schneider Electric is part of the 1,000+ companies globally that have committed to reduce GHG emissions in alignment with prevailing climate science through the SBTi. The Group's GHG footprint is calculated following the World Resources Institute (WRI) GHG Protocol (see page 130). The Group's target to achieve net-zero operational emissions and to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 35% by 2030 (versus 2017), was validated 1.5\u00b0C aligned by the SBTi in 2019.\n\n## Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n\nThe OECD is an international organization that works to build better policies for better lives. Schneider Electric is aligned with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Schneider Electric signed the OECD's Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, and established a 'Conflict Minerals Compliance program' based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from conflict affected and high-risk areas.\n\n## International Labour Organization (ILO)\n\nSchneider Electric is a Member of the ILO Global Business and Disability Network (GBDN) and adheres to the principles of the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The Group's Principles of Responsibility were inspired in part by the standards issued by the ILO.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2  Driving responsible conduct of business with the Trust Charter\n\n## 2.2.1  Trust Charter, Schneider Electric's Code of Conduct\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric evolved its Principles of Responsibility to the Trust Charter, acting as our Code of Conduct and demonstrating our commitment to ethics , safety , sustainability , quality , and cybersecurity . Schneider Electric believes that trust is a foundational value. It is earned, it serves as a compass, showing the true north in an ever more complex world and Schneider Electric considers it to be core to its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments.\n\nAs trust fuels empowerment, each section of the charter states clear do's and don'ts and provides clear references to relevant policies and procedures, which are adapted to meet local legal requirements when necessary. This Code of Conduct applies to everyone working at Schneider or any of Schneider's subsidiaries. It is both an individual and collective responsibility to comply and respect laws and regulations, to apply Schneider Electric policies, and to uphold strong ethical principles to earn trust at all times.\n\n## 2.2.1.1  Earning trust with people\n\nTrust powers all Schneider Electric's interactions with stakeholders and all relationships with customers, shareholders, employees, and the communities they serve, in a meaningful, inclusive, and positive way. With this in mind, the document is organized across four chapters:\n\n- \u00b7 Trusted Teams that are built thanks to leaders setting the tone and exemplifying Schneider Electric's culture, as well as through creating equal opportunities, harnessing the power of all generations, championing well-being and new ways of working, and being S.A.F.E. First;\n- \u00b7 Trust with Customers and Partners is earned by striving for high quality, resiliency, the highest standards for cybersecurity, data privacy and protection, as well as prohibiting any form of corruption, requiring third-party integrity, avoiding conflict of interest, upholding fair competition, abiding by export controls and sanctions, and selecting and managing suppliers responsibly;\n- \u00b7 Trust with Investors comes from preventing insider trading, delivering accurate financial statements, records, and tax information, delivering solutions in compliance with financial and risk management standards, and preserving our information technology and related intellectual property assets as well as Schneider Electric's reputation;\n- \u00b7 Trust with Communities is possible by acting for a climate positive world, being efficient with resources, upholding responsible lobbying and political activity, empowering local communities, not using 'conflict minerals', and acting as good corporate citizens.\n\n## 2.2.1.2  Communication and training for all employees\n\nSchneider Electric trains all its employees yearly on essential topics. 2021 was a transition year, and as such employees were assigned training on the Principles of Responsibility and informed, through this course, of the upcoming transition to the Trust Charter on September 30. The course was made available as e-learning for connected employees, and an in-class version for non-connected employees. The training completion rate for all Schneider Electric eligible employees at the end of the campaign was 99% (connected employees: 99% completion; non-connected employees: 98% completion). A new mandatory training for all employees dedicated to the Trust Charter will be part of the 2022 campaign.\n\nIn addition to the Trust Charter being available in 30 languages on se.com, a Trust Portal was made available to Schneider's employees to link them towards related content such as policies, useful contacts, sites, guidelines, templates, and reports for each section of the Trust Charter. In 2021, we saw an increase of global policy views of +61% compared with 2020.\n\nLeadership at every level of the organization was involved in the design, creation, and deployment of the Trust Charter to ensure that everyone at Schneider Electric is aware of the importance of trust and understands how to get the most out of our Code of Conduct.\n\nDiscover our Trust Charter with se.com \u01f0\n\n<!-- image -->",

Once a year, the Directors also review the Ethics & Compliance program's effectiveness and the allocation of resources to the program (human and financial). In addition, the Directors agree on the audit plan which covers several audits related to the Ethics & Compliance program, and the program's members are notified of their findings and related recommendations once finalized.\n\n## Group Ethics & Compliance Committee\n\nSchneider Electric has also put in place a dedicated governance to lead the Ethics & Compliance program to the best standards. The program is overseen by the Group Executive Committee, through the Group Ethics & Compliance Committee. This Committee is composed of nine permanent members in charge of defining the program's strategy and priorities: Chairman & CEO; Chief Governance Officer (Committee Chairperson); Chief Human Resources Officer; Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer; Chief Compliance Officer; Chief Legal Officer; Chief Corporate Citizenship Officer; Group Internal Audit & Control Officer; and Senior Vice-President, Sustainability Development. They ensure that the program is consistent with the Group's strategic goals. This Committee meets twice a year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

The GOCC is composed of the following members: Chief Compliance Officer (secretary of the Committee), Chief Legal Officer, Group Internal Audit & Control Officer, Group Compliance Director, Group HR Compliance Officer, and Head of Fraud Examination Team.\n\n## Group Disciplinary Committee\n\nThe Group Disciplinary Committee is in charge of levying sanctions and remediation actions on serious non-compliance cases upon request of the GOCC. The Group Disciplinary Committee is composed of the following members: Chief Governance Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Compliance Officer (secretary of the Committee), Chief Legal Officer, and one rotating member.\n\n## Ethics & Compliance department\n\nSchneider Electric has also created a standalone Ethics & Compliance department, chaired by a dedicated Chief Compliance Officer acting on behalf of the Group Ethics & Compliance Committee, and reporting to the Chief Governance Officer, to drive the strategy on the Ethics & Compliance program. The Ethics & Compliance department includes the following teams: Group Compliance, Group HR Compliance, Health & Safety, Fraud Examination, IT Assets Governance, Policy Management, Business Continuity Planning and Digital Transformation for Ethics & Compliance. It works closely with the Legal, Human Resources, Finance, and Strategy & Sustainability departments, as well as Internal Control and Audit. This cross-functional and integrated approach is central to the program's effectiveness.\n\n## 2.2.2.1.3  Operational level by geographic zone\n\nRegional Ethics & Compliance committees ensure implementation of the Ethics & Compliance program in alignment with risks identified. Operationally, they rely on Regional Compliance Officers who drive the implementation in the zone, with the support of Ethics Delegates and relevant subject matter experts at local levels.\n\n## 2.2.2.2  Pillars of the Ethics & Compliance program\n\nAll Schneider Electric employees are expected to comply with Schneider's Ethics & Compliance program. Its daily application helps them to act with integrity and transparency, and to comply with all international and local regulations.\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance program is based on management commitment (called 'tone from the top'), which makes its pillars effective. Top management sets the Ethics & Compliance standards and promotes a culture of integrity throughout the Group and its operations. In addition, middle management walks the talk by complying with rules, spreading the right message in their teams, and supports reporting of misconducts.\n\n## 2.2.2.2.1  Risk assessment at Zone level\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric carried out specific risk mapping dedicated to 'Ethics and Compliance' risks on the following risks: Corruption, Conflict of Interest, Human Rights & Labor Laws, and Sanctions & Export Control. The objective of this 'Ethics and Compliance' risk mapping is to capture operational risk exposure at zone level, based on local interviews led by the Regional Compliance Officers and the Legal teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe process at regional level was as follow:\n\n- \u00b7 step 1 - each region defined its local risk universe taking into account local specific risks,\n- \u00b7 step 2 - each region assessed its gross risks and effectiveness of its local mitigation measures, generating a mapping of regional net risks, and\n- \u00b7 step 3 - each region defined action plans (validated by the respective regional Ethics & Compliance committees) to reduce the risk exposure. In addition, a global gross and net risks mapping was consolidated at Group level, as well as a set of action plans to be taken at global level. All action plans will be monitored during the course of 2022.",

These global trainings are available in 18 different languages in our Learning Management System and each takes 30 mins to complete. In 2021, Schneider Essentials trainings were:\n\n- \u00b7 Trust Charter,\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity for Schneider Electric,\n- \u00b7 Building a culture of respect, and\n- \u00b7 Sustainability at the Core of our Purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 100% of employees trained every year on Cybersecurity and Ethics\n\nFeedback received from our employees confirm that our trainings efficiently help them to act as 'integrity ambassadors'.\n\nCybersecurity training: 'Very much anchored in real life both professional and personal.

At the end of 2021, SSE/uni00A0#13 reached 96% completion rate.\n\nA dedicated module on Ethics & Compliance was prepared for the induction path for Country Presidents. The module raises Country Presidents awareness about their role and responsibility in supporting the Ethics & Compliance program.\n\nBesides training of our employees, since 2020 and as part of the integration process of companies acquired, a specific training for leaders of the acquired company is organized through the Ethics & Compliance program. The training entails a specific focus on what is expected from the leadership teams, including endorsing the program and actively following up employees completion of mandatory trainings on Trust Charter and anti-corruption.\n\nIn November 2020, Schneider Electric organized its first global 'Ethics & Compliance Day' campaign in order to promote the Company's values on business ethics and to bring a focus on the need of a working environment that promotes a speak-up culture. A second 'Ethics & Compliance Day' took place in June 2021, focusing on raising awareness about biases of ethical thinking.\n\nFurthermore, in-person learnings were organized in sensitive geographic areas regarding ethics and compliance challenges (Brazil, India) or in locations where a specific risk is higher (such as the export control risk).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

For example, business agents can be used for many legitimate purposes, such as to perform tasks that Schneider Electric cannot perform as efficiently; however, experience has shown that using them can be very risky in terms of exposure to bribery or corruption. Schneider Electric Business Agent Policy sets out the rules under which we will determine whether there is a legitimate business purpose before engaging. We also need to ensure that we conduct an effective and efficient due diligence review to ultimately make the most informed decision and mitigate any risks to the best possible extent. We have adopted a risk-based approach to our due diligence enabling our teams to dedicate the most significant part of their time and energy to situations that represent the most risk exposure. Hence, we have various due diligence policies and processes depending on the type of third party subject to the due diligence.\n\nBusiness agents cover all third parties retained entirely or in part to assist Schneider Electric, directly or indirectly, in its business operations, including to obtain a sales order, contract award, permits, licenses, or other business advantage for Schneider Electric. They are subject to a due diligence and approval process, which was centralized with the Business Agent Policy in 2019 with digitization beginning in 2020. Several documents and information are gathered and sent to the Group Compliance team who will perform the due diligence and manage the approval process by analyzing risks of corruption, sanctions, and unethical practices. At the first level of assessment, the business agent could be approved based on the level of risk, or additional checks could be carried out if necessary. The Group Compliance team can request to also review and validate payments to a business agent based on this assessment.\n\nOur robust network of suppliers is the foundation of our supply chain, and we extend the same level of ethical control to them as we do to ourselves. For more information, please refer to section 2.2.11 'Sustainable relations with suppliers', page 117. Since 2021, the Group Compliance team has been working to further strengthen the controls carried out as well as understanding our risks when doing business with Schneider Electric customers in close collaboration with both digital and export control teams.\n\nM&A operations represent specific risks regarding ethics and compliance, specifically corruption and export control risks. With the support of the Group Ethics & Compliance Committee, a specific process and guidelines were put in place in 2020 to ensure full compliance of M&A operations with anti-corruption and export control regulations: this process was built by the Group Compliance Director, the Global Export Control Director, and the M&A team, ensuring a methodology that fit with M&A processes and ways of working. In 2021, this process was extended to the management of Human Rights risk.\n\n## 2.2.2.2.5  Specific accounting controls\n\nSchneider Electric has developed accounting control procedures to ensure that books, records, and accounts are not used to hide fraud. Since June 2021, work has been initiated to strengthen specific anti-corruption controls for a defined set of sensitivejudged accounts and transactions.\n\n## Seven steps to securing long-term value creation in acquisitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTiming depends on conditions precedents\n\n(such as clearance with Anti-trust Authorities)",

In addition, employees and external stakeholders (suppliers, subcontractors, customers, business agents, etc.) can directly access the whistleblowing system through the Trust Line portal, which provides support to people if they are a victim/witness to a potential violation of the Trust Charter. The Trust Line is available online globally, at all times, and protects the anonymity of the whistleblower (unless there is legislation to the contrary). Since December 2019, employees can better report their concerns, by selecting a type of concern and checking its definition. In compliance with local legislation, this system is provided by an external, impartial third-party company and proposes alert categories, a questionnaire, and an information exchange protocol between the person issuing the alert and the person responsible for the internal investigation.\n\nEach concern reported on the whistleblowing system is analyzed by the Group Operational Compliance Committee (GOCC) and relevant Regional Compliance Officer, and where considered necessary, investigated. Each year, a detailed report on the effectiveness of the system is presented to the Audit & Risks Committee, which reviews effectiveness of the alert system.\n\nUnless there are legal provisions to the contrary, the system can be used to send any concern in every country in which the Group operates, especially regarding health and safety, discrimination, harassment (including sexual harassment), unfair treatment, labor practices, favoritism, violation of our Anti-Corruption Policy, fraud, conflict of interest, and antitrust.\n\nIn 2021, 655 Ethics & Compliance concerns were received through our internal reporting mechanisms (585 internal and 70 external). After first analysis, 582 (89%) concerns were considered as valid alerts. After being investigated, and at the time of writing, 168 (26%) of those valid alerts were confirmed and led to 94 actions including for instance employment termination in 23 confirmed alerts and written warnings in 11 confirmed alerts. HR-related concerns represented most of confirmed alerts. As it may take several months to analyse and investigate some complex cases, evaluation of concerns received until 31 st December 2021 is still ongoing.\n\nFor HR related concerns, even if investigation does not allow to qualify the situation, actions may be taken, such as assigning obligation of coaching and/or training or improving internal processes.\n\nNumber of concerns received through our whistleblowing system per region\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNorth America\n\nRest of the World\n\nEurope\n\nChina\n\nFrance\n\nIndia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus of concerns received* through our whistleblowing system\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nIn 2021, to measure the effectiveness of the Trust Line, Schneider Electric has added to its annual employee engagement survey, OneVoice, a new question: 'I can report an instance of unethical conduct without fear'. 81% of employees surveyed answered 'yes', and the Group will work to increase this measurement by 10 points by 2025 as part of Schneider Sustainability Impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measure the level of confidence of our employees to report behaviors against our Principles of Trust\n\nA speak-up mindset exists when employees and stakeholders feel safe to speak out about issues, concerns, and ideas in good faith, respectfully, and without fear of retaliation. It helps protect Schneider Electric and its employees from the effects of misconduct, including legal liability, serious financial losses, and lasting reputational harm. It also fosters a corporate culture of trust and responsiveness.\n\n## Experience feedback from an employee in France in 2021\n\n'First it took me some time to understand that the situation I am facing is not in line with our policies. Then it took me some time to have enough courage to do it, we always have doubts. Finally, I decided to speak up. My manager listened to me and took the situation seriously. Today I feel safe and confident. This is very difficult to speak up and we feel uncomfortable to do it.

The relevant managers, or the Group Disciplinary Committee for the most sensitive alerts, take the appropriate measures in order to sanction the party or parties involved and to remediate consequences of the misconduct (such as launch a specific audit, review a process, perform training, etc.).\n\nA specific disciplinary regime is specified in the Anti-Corruption Policy, detailing the measures that Schneider Electric can take in the event of a misconduct. This disciplinary regime was implemented within the Group according to local disciplinary policies and law, when the policy was deployed in 2019 and 2020.\n\n## 2.2.2.2.  Monitoring and audit\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance program is an integral part of the Group's Key Internal Controls. In 2021, this Key Internal Control framework has been significantly reshaped and enhanced, which will allow for improved monitoring of key pillars of the Ethics & Compliance program. Whenever an evaluation indicates points of weakness, action plans must be set up and monitored by internal auditors. Also, Schneider Electric is working on additional second-level controls to monitor and assess the effectiveness of some of the recent evolutions of the Ethics & Compliance program.\n\nFurthermore, the Group's Internal Audit program includes specific tasks related to the Ethics & Compliance program, and to activities or subsidiaries for which an evaluation of the maturity and effectiveness of the program will be reviewed. Several internal audits were conducted in 2021 resulting in recommendations related to the improvement of the Ethics & Compliance program.\n\nFor more details on Key Internal Controls and the Group's Internal Audit, Please refer to page 247. \u01f0\n\n## 2.2.2.2.9  Ethics and compliance leadership in times of crisis\n\nThe focus on ethics and compliance has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with actions put into place such as global guidance for all Country Presidents on 'Ethics & Compliance considerations in the management of COVID-19', global riskmanagement live talks focusing on general compliance, HR compliance, and export control, and finally, meetings with subject matter experts to identify and manage the main risks related to COVID-19.\n\n## 2.2.2.2.10 External engagement\n\nSchneider Electric participates in the initiatives of many nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and professional associations, such as Transparency International France, a leading NGO that aims to stop corruption and promote transparency, responsibility, and integrity across all sectors.\n\nSchneider is also member of Le Cercle d'\u00c9thique des Affaires (The Ethical Business Circle), a professional association that facilitates co-operation between business leaders across France to share best practices.\n\nTo maintain innovation in its approach to ethics and compliance, Schneider became the eighth sponsor of the Master of Law and Business Ethics at CY Cergy Paris University in 2020 and benefits from the work of the Master's Chair, led by experts in France and in the United States, as well as from listening to the students and reviewing their work.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.3 Zero tolerance for corruption\n\nThe exposure of the Group to corruption risk has been increasing for several years, due to the expansion of the Group's activities in new economies, especially in Asia and Africa, through organic growth, and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe business model of the Group relies on a large ecosystem of partners. This ecosystem may represent a risk for the Group, being accountable for activities performed on its behalf, and in regards to potential conflicts of interest or unethical solicitations.\n\nIn addition, the Group is participating in complex projects involving a large range of partners in sectors at risk, such as oil and gas, and with end-users from the public sector in countries at risk.\n\nOver the past years, the increase of law enforcement by public authorities, higher press coverage of fines imposed on companies, and new regulations requiring a strong compliance program have significantly changed the potential impact of corruption risks.\n\nSchneider Electric has a zero tolerance policy with regard to corruption. This commitment materialized through a strong and continuously developing Anti-Corruption Compliance program, which is part of the Ethics & Compliance program.\n\n## 2.2.3.1 Risk assessment\n\nTo meet the legal obligations specified by the December 9, 2016 French law known as the Sapin II law, the Company launched a risk mapping exercise focusing on corruption risks, which was conducted in 2018 at global level and in 2019 at regional levels. In 2020, action plans were implemented in accordance with risks identified.\n\nIn 2021, this risk assessment was updated as part of the new Ethics & Compliance risk mapping, which focuses in particular on Corruption and Conflicts of Interest. Please refer to section 2.2.2 'Ethics & Compliance program', page 95.\n\n## 2.2.3.2 Risk management\n\n## 2.2.3.2.1 Anti-Corruption framework\n\nAs stated in our Trust Charter and Anti-Corruption Policy,  Schneider Electric is committed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, such as the OECD's Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA),\n\nthe UK Bribery Act, and the French Sapin II law.\n\nSchneider Electric applies a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption and other unethical business practices and considers that 'doing things right' is a key value-creation driver for all its stakeholders. We count on our employees and third parties to promote business integrity. For doing so, we must provide them with the tools to encourage them to act right.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of the French Sapin II law, the Group released an Anti-Corruption Policy. The Policy was reviewed in November 2019 to take into account results of the corruption risk mapping and to provide employees with examples illustrating situations they may face. The Anti-Corruption Policy shall serve as a handbook that anyone may consult when having doubts about appropriate business practices. It is not intended to address every issue one may encounter, but it provides appropriate examples of corruption risks and offers guidance to resolve many ethical dilemmas.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nThe Gifts & Hospitality Policy provides guidance to employees on the ethical handling of gifts and hospitality received and given by Schneider Electric employees.\n\nA new version of the Business Agent Policy was released in August 2019 to meet legal requirements and public authorities' guidance, especially regarding risk-based approach of the due diligence, as well as internal recommendations following several audits performed on applicability of the policy in 2018.\n\nThe risks associated with onboarding new acquisition targets are numerous and consequently, Merger and Acquisition (M&A) guidelines have been published to identify, manage, and mitigate those risks at the earliest stage possible. These guidelines aim to cover the very first steps of identifying potential targets (M&A strategy), what to look out for in data-rooms, and finally how we plan to integrate the acquired entity into our compliance organization. These same rules also apply when Schneider Electric decides to make a divestiture with a step-by-step approach to managing the transition.\n\nIn 2021, a Conflict of Interest Policy was published, in particular creating a procedure to disclose and manage any identified conflict of interest. A Donations Policy has also been published and implemented, which aims, among other things, to manage risks of unlawful use of money and then corruption.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.2 Empowering employees against corruption\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, a set of anti-corruption e-learnings was built, providing guidance on real life risk scenarios; it was designed taking into account the trainees' needs and expectations, and is mandatory for targeted employees exposed to corruption risks through their job codes, i.e. those identified as such by the corruption risk mapping. This led to a curriculum of modules of e-learnings, deployed in 2020: a general module on the 'zero tolerance' message against corruption and an explanation of the legal framework and risks, and two specific modules about third parties and gifts and invitations. In 2021, four additional modules were created about facilitation payments, conflict of interest, conditions that make people commit the wrongdoing, and how to raise concerns in Schneider Electric. The modules were supported by top leaders' videos demonstrating the 'tone at the top' on this crucial matter and are available in 14 languages. In 2021, the set of anti-corruption e-learnings has been assigned to more than 40,000 employees and 97% completed it.\n\n## 2.2.3.3 Focus on responsible lobbying, political activity, and donations\n\nIn its Trust Charter, Schneider Electric takes a clear stance with regards to responsible lobbying, political activity, and donations. As a Company, Schneider has a role to play in the public debate addressing leading issues with the global community. It is necessary that the Group states its positions clearly, participates in technical discussions, and supports responsible public policy development.\n\n2.",

In particular, Schneider Electric does not engage in political activity or political representation and does not make any payment to political parties in relation to its public representation. In 2021, Schneider Electric has not been involved in sponsoring local, regional, or national political campaigning.\n\nIn the US, political contributions can only be made by a corporation through a legally formed Political Action Committee (PAC) or Super Political Action Committee. Schneider Electric does not engage with Super PAC activity nor does it have a PAC in the US and therefore cannot make any political contributions in this country.\n\nDonations and lobbying activities are risks specifically addressed in the Anti-Corruption Policy.\n\nSchneider Electric presents information about its lobbying activities in the French High Authority for Transparency in Public Life, in the EU transparency register, and in the US Lobbying Disclosure Act Registration.\n\nFor 2017 to 2020, the Group discloses membership fees towards trade associations, business coalitions, and think-tanks to a large extent in the sense that many organizations' fees are not primarily focusing on political campaigns or legislative activities but rather on standardization activities and industry best practices. However, in an effort of transparency, those have been included as they could be referenced in policy development in the margin of their activities. The following geographies are covered: Europe, the US, China, and Russia, which are where the Group is mostly active when it comes to policy and legislation.\n\nTotal contributions to such groups globally amounted \u20ac3.2 million in 2017, \u20ac2.6 million in 2018, \u20ac5.2 million in 2019, \u20ac5.9 million in 2020. 2021 data is not available at the time of writing as reporting on these matters typically ends mid-year or end of year.\n\nLargest contributions and expenditures concern two main engagement topics:\n\n- \u00b7 The first is 'sustainable energy for all': Schneider Electric believes that energy management and energy efficiency are critical to move towards a new energy landscape and therefore supports a policy framework that unleashes the business and climate opportunities related to the new energy landscape. Contributions and expenditures on this topic amounted \u20ac0.51 million in 2020 (\u20ac0.52 million in 2019) globally;\n- \u00b7 The second is 'powering the digital economy': The Group supports the emergence of digital economy to bring new opportunities for businesses and people and therefore supports a policy framework that facilitates the digital transformation globally. Contributions and expenditures on this topic amounted \u20ac0.47 million in 2020 (\u20ac0.27 million in 2019) globally.\n\n## 2.2.4 Compliance with tax regulations\n\nSchneider Electric Group engages to comply with the international and local tax regulations applicable in each of the countries in which it operates, and to provide to the tax authorities with all the information necessary to enable them to carry out their mission. The tax policy of the Group can be consulted on our website at se.com\n\n## 2.2.5  High standards for the quality and safety of our products\n\nQuality is defined as 'conformance to requirements or fitness for use'. Constant customer satisfaction and quality change would allow more proactive engagement to maximize our organization's ability to successfully achieve our overall business strategy, purpose, and mission. Schneider Electric therefore understands that delivering superior quality is the foundation of an ultimate customer experience.\n\n## 2.2.5.1  Risks and opportunities\n\nSchneider Electric has more than 260,000 references produced in 191 factories, spread across 46 countries around the world. Operating in essential industries, product quality and safety is a critical topic for the Group as product malfunctions or failures could result in Schneider incurring liabilities for tangible, intangible damages, or personal injuries. The failure of a product, system, or solution may involve costs related to the product recall, result in new development expenditure, and consume technical and economic resources.\n\nSchneider Electric's products are also subject to multiple quality and safety controls and regulations and are governed by both national and supranational standards. New or more stringent standards or regulations could result in capital investment or costs of specific measures for compliance.\n\nThe above-mentioned costs could have a significant impact on the profitability and cash equivalent of the Group. The business reputation of Schneider Electric could also be negatively impacted. Indeed, the Group has been impacted by several recalls recently, more or less ranging from EUR 10 million to EUR 40 million, depending on the case.\n\nRisks identified by Schneider Electric in regard to product, project, system quality, and offer reliability can be:\n\n- \u00b7 Design quality concerns\n- \u00b7 Manufacturing and Logistic issues\n- \u00b7 Deficient product safety\n- \u00b7 Software quality\n- \u00b7 Brand labelling, Supplier & Supply mismanagement\n\nThe above risks have therefore convinced the Group to reinforce the focus on Quality, Reliability and Robustness of its offers and turn the above listed risks into opportunities for sustainability and efficiency such as:\n\n- \u00b7 More reliability and agility in our designs for sustainable offers\n- \u00b7 More robustness in our manufacturing and logistics processes\n- \u00b7 More digital in our partnerships and more circularity in our supply chain to reduce our carbon footprint\n\n## 2.2.5.2 Quality group policy\n\nSchneider Electric, thanks to its 'Issue to Prevention' process, systematically analyses the root causes of any failures in a continuous improvement approach. This process is split up into three clear steps:\n\n- 1 The resolution - to solve the issue fast and well\n- 2 The analysis - to identify severe and recurrent issues\n- 3 The prevention - to fix the systemic root causes for good\n\nFrom these analysis phases, Schneider Electric acknowledges that half of the failures come from the design stage and the other half from the manufacturing. Schneider has designed specific programs to address both ends of these failures.",

These processes are to be used for all offers sold or manufactured by Schneider Electric. The application of these directives is evaluated periodically, and when deemed.\n\nSchneider Electric's guiding principles are as follows:\n\n- 1 Customer First: Quality is the safety of our customers. Schneider Electric prioritizes their interests and anticipates their needs through customer journeys and customer personas deployment everywhere in the Group. Schneider Electric follows customer-centric rituals as quality is every customer's right.\n- 2 Offer Quality: Schneider Electric innovates with agility, discipline, and good business sense throughout the offer's lifecycle, from creation to supply, all the way through manufacturing, delivering, and operations and until services. Schneider Electric delivers safe, reliable, and cybersecure offers, for products, systems, and software, to secure customers' business continuity.\n- 3 Intelligence: Schneider Electric runs strong analytics to convert our customer experience data into actionable information, enabling us to anticipate customer failures, prevent customer complaints, and improve on all touch points. Schneider Electric propagates this customer intelligence in all teams.\n- 4 People: Schneider Electric empowers our teams to put customer first, and to look for superior customer driven skills. Schneider Electric removes internal barriers to always address customer issues first. Quality is every employee's responsibility.\n- 5 Ultimate experience: Schneider Electric deeply analyzes customer experience on all touch points, leverages it to prioritize the investments, and tailors the sales tactics accordingly.

This directive requires the application of Schneider Electric's systematic processes to properly address potential offer safety risks of Bodily Injury or Property Damage, discovered inside or outside Schneider Electric. These processes are to be used for all offers sold or manufactured by Schneider Electric.\n- \u00b7 Quality Procedure 'Offer Safety Review' . The overall objective of offer safety is to reduce the risk arising from the use of Schneider's products, solutions, or services throughout their life cycle. Offer safety reviews are conducted by Offer Safety Review Committees and are used to focus attention on safety and help ensure that our offers are safe when properly installed (based on safety manual), maintained and used for their intended purpose and other reasonably foreseeable use or misuse.\n\n## 2.2.5.3 Governance\n\nAt Schneider Electric, the customer satisfaction and quality network spreads all over the Group's layers and functions to cover our Global Supply Chain, our operations, and our lines of businesses.\n\nWithin such a complex organization, Schneider is engaged to include quality into the Group culture and spread the customer first mindset everywhere.\n\nIn this context, a new governance committee has been created gathering heads of businesses, the Head of Customer Satisfaction & Quality, the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, EVP, Global Supply Chain, and Schneider Digital to address the quality transformation journey.\n\nBy engaging everyone on quality and customer satisfaction topics, Schneider allows every employee to speak up for them, or have customers and partners speak up.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Group to ensure awareness-raising to customers on potential health safety impacts when it comes to product, services usage.\n\nCustomer Experience\n\n## Premium Quality and Reliability\n\n## Ultimate Experience\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

It is in full alignment with our Trust Charter, Schneider Electric's Code of Conduct, as well as in compliance with ISO 9001 standard. In 2021, 231 Schneider supply chain sites were certified to ISO 9001.\n\n## 2.2.5.4.1  Reliability as a signature of Schneider Electric\n\nTo ensure improvement in the area of design, the Group launched in mid-2020, a dedicated program, ReeD (Reliability End To End byDesign), to secure fundamentals and ensure full integration of new customer expectations (from Quality to Reliability). It is the obsession of the Group to ensure that 'Reliability' is a signature value of Schneider Electric branding:\n\n- \u00b7 To deliver an outstanding customer satisfaction on products/ systems robustness\n- \u00b7 To create and deploy an easy access to the relevant knowledge\n\nThis reliability program has been designed with R&D at its heart, with huge interactions with all functions and businesses of Schneider Electric:\n\n- \u00b7 By ensuring that new offers development is focused on customer promises.\n- \u00b7 By animating mitigation plan until deviation is fixed.\n- \u00b7 By ensuring Excellence in Offer Life Cycle changes.\n- \u00b7 By transitioning from product quality to systems reliability.\n- \u00b7 By combining people's competency with robust digital processes.\n- \u00b7 By leveraging more digital tools to detect issues early and reduce the number of bugs seen by customers.\n- \u00b7 Reinforce risk analysis to ensure proper usage of our systems, software, and products to prevent associated issues and risks.\n\n## 2.2.5.4.2  Towards a sustainable quality excellence for an ultimate customer experience\n\nThanks to the implementation of a robustness program, Schneider Electric fosters a quality culture by boosting the basics to secure cultural transformation towards Sustainable Quality Excellence for premium customer experience through solid foundations such as people, organization, robustness, and suppliers.\n\nFor full visibility all along the supply chain, the scope of action has been extended outside and inside Schneider Electric. It is the will of the group to move from a reactive to a predictive mode, leveraging digital and analytics, and building an integration layer that connects critical offers.\n\nSix digital streams have been designed to achieve defined goals:\n\n- \u00b7 Suppliers Process Monitoring to build with suppliers the capabilities of real time process control.\n- \u00b7 Manufacturing Process Monitoring to build with factories the capabilities of real time process control.\n- \u00b7 Logistics Process Monitoring to build the capability of real time process control in Schneider Electric's logistics operations.\n\n- \u00b7 End-to-End Traceability to serialize, track, and trace Schneider Electric's products.\n- \u00b7 Analytics & Optimization to leverage descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics on data generated to get actionable insights to improve industrial quality.\n- \u00b7 Digitization of Processes to digitize processes for simplification, transparency, and robustness while capturing data for analytics.\n\n## 2.2.5.4.3 Revalorising customer returns\n\nWhen sustainability supports Customer Satisfaction, it translates into new processes and policies to allow returns of adapted products for reuse, remanufacture and refurbishment. The strong collaboration between Sustainability, Global Supply Chain, Lines of Business and Customer Satisfaction and Quality teams imagine these new processes, enabling Schneider Electric to revalorize customers returns through reuse of components or remanufacture of new products in Local Adaptation Centers. The benefits can be seen at customer satisfaction level: by producing and delivering back order impacted by components in shortages, by serving new customers orders and on Sustainability level with anticipation of upcoming regulation compliance (Anti-Waste law), reducing carbon footprint of our supply chain and reducing cost of non quality due to product scrap.\n\nSchneider Electric has an Offer Safety Alert (OSA) process to alert the relevant Line of Business and other interested parties as soon as it is suspected that customers' health or property safety may be put at risk by Schneider products, solutions, or projects. The Offer Safety Alert Committee (OSAC) is a permanent corporate committee that oversees and regulates the management of OSA. Its mission is to ensure all OSA are managed with the due diligence and urgency to minimize safety risks to customers. Its independent, multi-discipline nature allows the OSAC to make decisions in our customers' best interest. As part of the Trust pillar of Schneider Sustainability Essentials 2021-2025, Schneider is committed to reduce by 50% the weight of scrap from safety units recalled by 2025 (SSE #15).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 50% reduction in scrap from safety units recalled\n\nIn 2021 the Group recalled 14 products as approved by the Offer Safety Alert Committee. The Customer Satisfaction & Quality team reaches out to customers impacted by the recall to arrange for product replacement. Investigation will be conducted on products returned to Schneider's premises to determine the final root cause of the safety issue. The returned product thereafter will be assessed on its reusability and parts which could not be reused will be scrapped according to the local environmental regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our commitment to Life is On begins with giving businesses and citizens trust in the New Electric World. Doing so requires that we not only help our customers to defend against these threats through our products and services, but also maintain a strong cybersecurity posture to avoid becoming a risk to them.\n\nThat is why cybersecurity and data protection are integral to Schneider Electric's business strategy and digital transformation journey and is at the core of our Trust Charter. At all levels of the Group, clear expectations for both individual and collective behaviors are defined in a cybersecurity 'Trust pillar.' In addition to corporate commitment, our executives play a crucial role in making cybersecurity a core tenet of our business and corporate culture through the sponsorship of the Executive Committee and oversight from the Board of Directors.\n\nOur vision as a digital leader in energy management and industrial automation is to raise the bar with our ecosystem. We seek to embark partners, customers, and suppliers in our security posture.\n\nThis approach can be summarized in four steps:\n\n- 1 Taking a risk-informed approach.\n- 2 Managing cyber risks in depth to protect our customers, our operations, and our critical infrastructures.\n- 3 Establishing a Group-wide cybersecurity culture.\n- 4 Partnering with our ecosystem across the value chain to build trust and raise the defense level of the industry at large.\n\n## 2.2.6.2  Reinforcing the Group's cybersecurity posture and that of its ecosystem of partners and customers\n\nSchneider Electric deploys several actions to reinforce its cyber posture and that of its ecosystem of partners and customers:\n\n- \u00b7 Holding a cyber-related business risk register to articulate potential vulnerabilities/attacks and define remediation activities.\n- \u00b7 Identifying and prioritizing high-value digital assets to the Company's operation.\n- \u00b7 Implementing cyber capabilities and digital locks around people, processes, and technologies.\n- \u00b7 Deploying general and dedicated awareness and training programs on cybersecurity and data protection, with a strong focus on high-risk population (customer-facing people, HR).\n- \u00b7 Monitoring, detecting, responding, and learning from cyber events.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n- \u00b7 Performing reality checks via metrics, internal and external reviews, cyber crisis drills, and vulnerability assessments to our extended enterprise (including our acquired companies).\n- \u00b7 Engaging cyber discussions with our customers, suppliers, and partners to improve the resilience across the value chain.\n- \u00b7 Partnering with leading companies, experts, and authorities in the field of cybersecurity.\n\n## 2.2.6.3  Proposing cybersecurity by design\n\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity Framework and other recognized standards, such as ISA/IEC 62443 and ISO 27000.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric IoT-enabled EcoStruxure \u2122 platform provides our customers with end-to-end cybersecurity solutions and services to protect a vast digital ecosystem.\n\nAs part of the Trust pillar of its 2021-2025 sustainability strategy, Schneider Electric commits to be in the top 25% in external ratings for Cybersecurity performance (SSE/uni00A0#16).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In the Top 25% in external ratings for Cybersecurity performance\n\nSchneider Electric continuously and consistently monitors its posture with the support of cyber scoring agencies. This scoring capability enables the Group to identify and address vulnerabilities and weaknesses (along with Intelligence-driven detections) around main risk categories like Compromised Systems, Diligence, User Behavior and Public Disclosures. Addressing findings that can negatively impact overall cybersecurity rating and benchmarking our performance against is aiding our maturity journey on cybersecurity, from a performance, risk, and communication perspective.\n\nWith this discipline, we measure the improvement of our posture over years: from a baseline of 520 in January 2018, we have now reached a score of 800 for the year 2021.

This training helps employees to understand what cyber threats they may face and how they should behave to be protected from the risks. At the end of 2021, 99% of Schneider Electric employees have completed this training. Specific employee categories received mandatory training for risks linked to their activity.\n\nSchneider Electric implemented the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements and specific training was launched to present the major challenges of this regulation. This training is mandatory for Schneider Electric employees in Europe and key functions.\n\n## 2.2.6.5  Data privacy and protection\n\nSchneider Electric believes that the global implementation of a digital strategy must reconcile economic objectives and respect for fundamental human rights, including the right to protection of personal data and privacy.\n\nSchneider Electric establishes an organization, work streams, policies, procedures, and controls required by the obligations stemming from GDPR and data privacy and protection regulations, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Internal data privacy policy and Binding Corporate Rules (BCR).\n- \u00b7 Training and awareness campaigns.\n- \u00b7 Processing registers.\n- \u00b7 Online privacy policy and privacy notices.\n- \u00b7 Digital assets privacy assessment process.\n- \u00b7 Data breach management and notification process.\n- \u00b7 Maturity assessment and audit controls.\n\nSchneider Electric has put in place a governance ecosystem including a Group Data Protection Officer, a DPO network, an implementation team, Data Privacy & Protection Champions and Steercos.\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric has strengthened its processes for data breach management, including specific training. It has deployed several awareness programs including on International Data Protection Day and on events management. Schneider Electric has also been rolling out its Global Data Privacy & Protection compliance approach beyond GDPR in China, the USA, and India and in globalizing its standards. A new data protection addendum has been deployed, including the new Standard Contractual Clauses of the European Commission.\n\n## 2.2.7 Human rights\n\n## 2.2.7.1  Risks and opportunities\n\nHuman rights, which have been a main priority of the Group for a long time, have been growing in terms of risk exposure, due to the increase of legal enforcement, geopolitical influence, and new challenges raised by social, economic, and digital disruptions such as forced labor, living wages, or migrant workers. Schneider Electric has consistently focused on human rights and has the ambition to remain an exemplary company on this subject.\n\nSchneider Electric's review of risks and opportunities related to human rights covers fundamental human rights, decent working conditions and equal opportunities.\n\n## Fundamental human rights\n\n- \u00b7 Respect and dignity: healthy and respectful relations at work between individuals and teams, and towards communities.\n- \u00b7 No Child labor: defined by the International Labour Organization (ILO) as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential, and their dignity, and that is harmful to their physical and mental development.\n- \u00b7 No Forced labor: defined by the ILO as all works or services for which a person has not offered themselves voluntarily or willingly.\n- \u00b7 Freedom of association: the right for workers to join professional organizations that can defend their interests.\n\n## Decent working conditions\n\n- \u00b7 Health and safety: potential incidents of various degrees of severity related to workplace conditions.\n- \u00b7 Security at work: physical or verbal violence that may originate from internal or external threats.\n- \u00b7 Working time and leave: ensuring employees work on a schedule that respects legal time frames, rest periods, and leave provisions, and are given the opportunity to balance personal and professional time.\n- \u00b7 Wages and benefits: paying employees a compensation that is fair in view of their profile, skills, and qualifications.\n- \u00b7 Harassment: continuous solicitation with the intention of exhausting a person or forcing that person into unwanted behavior.\n- \u00b7 Data privacy: securing the data that individuals are placing into the Company's hands so that their privacy and freedom remain safe and protected.\n\n## Equal opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 Discrimination: creating a situation of inequality based on an employee's personal characteristic, at work or when hiring.\n- \u00b7 Diversity and inclusion: risk of introducing several biases that would result in an unbalanced representation of the society inside the Company, and the exclusion of some groups or communities from the Company.\n- \u00b7 Development of competencies: giving employees the opportunity to learn, maintain, and develop their skills and abilities.",

        "page_content": "In accordance with the 2017 French duty of vigilance law and its ambition to behave as an exemplary company, Schneider Electric implemented a specific vigilance plan. In 2021, Schneider reviewed and updated its 'duty of vigilance risk matrix' which highlights human rights risks at its sites, as well as for suppliers, contractors, and local communities. Several actions are implemented to mitigate the highest identified risks in this matrix.\n\nFor more details, see section '2.2.9 Vigilance plan', page 112. \u01f0\n\n## 2.2.7.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric's human rights approach is articulated around three principles.\n\n- 1. Schneider is committed to fully respecting and applying laws and regulations in all countries where it operates.\n- 2. Schneider is committed to fostering and promoting human rights throughout all its operational sites and subsidiaries worldwide.\n- 3. Schneider wishes to support human rights beyond its borders, leveraging its large network of partners and stakeholders to promote the implementation of actions that will ensure the respect of people's rights.\n\n## Human rights in the Trust Charter\n\nThrough its Trust Charter, published in 2021, Schneider Electric is taking a strong position on what values it stands for. Human rights are fully embedded in this Trust Charter with guidance on the following challenges:\n\n- \u00b7 Create Equal Opportunities\n- \u00b7 Harness the Power of All Generations\n- \u00b7 Champion Well-Being and New Ways of Working\n- \u00b7 Be S.A.F.E.

It is applicable to all Schneider permanent or temporary employees working on Group premises. It also aims to inspire external stakeholders. For all human rights risks identified above, and based on the 'Protect, Respect, Remedy' principles, the policy provides a framework and gives guidance to employees and teams on how to behave in their daily operations or when facing a specific situation.\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric has started to work on the second version of its Global Human Rights Policy, providing an update notably with the Company's commitments regarding migrant workers and artificial intelligence. The full deployment is forecasted for the second quarter of 2022 including e-learnings and trainings modules.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Alignment with international standards and frameworks\n\nSchneider Electric adheres to the following principles or guidelines:\n\n- \u00b7 The ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\n- \u00b7 The international human rights principles encompassed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which sets out a common standard for all types of organization.\n- \u00b7 The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, which formulate recommendations for companies, including for the respect of human rights.\n- \u00b7 Since 2003, Schneider Electric is part of the United Nations Global Compact. In 2011, the United Nations issued the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights which precisely define the roles and responsibilities of States and businesses on these matters. Schneider Electric is committed to these Guiding Principles and to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\n## Specific policies\n\nIn addition to its Trust Charter and the Global Human Rights Policy, Schneider Electric has implemented specific global policies to provide guidance in the following areas:\n\n## Human resources\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity & Inclusion Policy: applies to the entire Company and covers all facets of diversity, as Schneider Electric wants to mirror the communities in which the Group operates. This policy is based on respect and dignity, which are the foundations for fairness and equity.\n- \u00b7 Family Leave Policy: provides a framework so that every employee, whatever the country of employment, can take some specific leave to enjoy some of life's special moments with their families.\n- \u00b7 Anti-Harassment Policy: states Schneider Electric's commitments to have zero-tolerance for any kind of harassment or offensive behavior.\n- \u00b7 Flexibility at Work Policy: defines global Flexibility at Work pathways, mandatory and recommended, to ensure consistency and equitable treatment in the application of flexible work arrangements across business units and countries for all eligible Schneider Electric employees.\n- \u00b7 Employee Benefits Policy: defines the global principles, standards, and governance for the provision of employee benefits at Schneider Electric.\n\n## Health and safety\n\n- \u00b7 Health & Safety Policy: states the rules and guidelines applicable to all Schneider Electric employees, and also to specific populations performing specialized tasks. It is supported by learning tools, and it is the subject of an annual 'Global Health & Safety Day'.\n- \u00b7 Travel Policy: defines the rules applicable to travelers, including the safety guidelines, procedures, and processes to ensure the safety of Schneider business travelers at all times.\n- \u00b7 Security Policy: defines the global scope of security applicable to all entities, locations, and activities.

These controls are designed in co-ordination with the Internal Audit team and consist in an annual self-assessment covering different operational topics. Human rights and health and safety controls are included in this annual review. The results of these assessments allow Schneider Electric to benchmark the entities and to prioritize mitigation plans when necessary.\n\nInternal actions regarding respect and dignity, freedom of association, health and safety, working time and leave, wages and benefits, harassment, discrimination, diversity and inclusion, and development of competencies are described in section '2.5 Great People making Schneider Electric a great company', page 164.\n\nSchneider Electric is implementing training programs that are specific to the policies listed above, to raise the level of awareness of employees and give them advice on how to react or behave in specific situations. Some of these trainings are mandatory, others are part of recommended training paths. Such programs cover a very wide area of topics, from anti-harassment to well-being, or how to overcome bias and develop an inclusive culture. For more details, see section 2.5.3 Talent attraction and development, page 177.\n\nSpecifically, for health and safety, the Group maintains a followup of safety metrics. Incidents are reviewed with management, corrective actions are implemented when necessary, and communications are sent to relevant teams throughout the Company. When needed, a global safety alert can be launched to draw all relevant employees' attention. Schneider Electric organizes a yearly 'Global Health & Safety Day', to inform all employees and keep the level of awareness high on this key topic. For more details, see section 'Employee health and safety', page 109.\n\n## 2.2.7.4  Deployment of actions towards suppliers\n\nHuman rights are included in the integration of the sustainable purchases approach in the selection of new suppliers. Schneider Electric uses a qualification process called Schneider Supplier Quality Management (SSQM) to select new suppliers. It is based on an evaluation questionnaire combined with on-site audits, which include human rights and health and safety assessments.\n\nSchneider Electric's Supplier Code of Conduct states the framework in which the Group wishes to operate with vendors. Schneider Electric expects suppliers to respect the fundamental principles on health, safety, people's protection, and development as defined in this document. Strategic suppliers are also assessed through Ecovadis 3 rd party, leveraging ISO26000 norm, where Labor and Human rights is one of the four pillars of the methodology.\n\nOther actions are implemented through the Group's vigilance plan. For more details, see section '2.2.9 Vigilance plan', page 112, and section '2.2.11 Sustainable relations with suppliers', page 117.\n\n## 2.2.7.5  Deployment of actions towards contractors\n\nSchneider Electric has developed specific actions to mitigate human rights risks related to project execution environment, anywhere co-ordination with project contractors is necessary.\n\nThe Group is working on the evolution of the project decisionmaking process to incorporate a risk assessment covering ESG topics including human rights. The aim is to better calibrate the mitigation measures and anticipate their implementation earlier in the project process.\n\nSchneider Electric is also conducting specific on-site audits for contractors included into the Vigilance Supplier Audit program. At the end of 2021, 13 subcontractors have been audited. For more details, see section '2.2.10 Relations with project execution contractors', page 116.\n\n## 2.2.7.6  Deployment of actions towards local communities\n\nLocal communities are integrated in the vigilance risk matrix on two types of locations: Schneider sites (factory or an office building) and customer project sites (where the Group is operating as a contractor or subcontractor for a customer). The risks for these locations were assessed for the first time in 2020 in the vigilance risk matrix and in 2021 Schneider Electric deepened the analysis with a specific segmentation to select potential risks that may have an impact on local communities. For more details, see section '2.2.12 Vigilance with local communities', page 124.\n\n## 2.2.7.7  Partnerships and working groups\n\nThe Group has joined Entreprises pour les droits de l'Homme (EDH - Businesses for Human Rights), a leading French association of businesses providing its members with tools and advice on implementing the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In 2018, Schneider Electric also joined the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a non-profit coalition of more than 120 companies from the electronic, retail, automobile, and leisure industries, for compliance with human rights and sharing the best practices with regards to on-site auditing and monitoring of suppliers' activity, including forced-labor issues.\n\nThe Group also joined the Global Compact LEAD working group 'Decent Work in Global Supply Chain'. Schneider Electric co-leads the G7 Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) coalition's 'Advancing human rights in direct operations and supply chains' and 'Building inclusive workplaces' working groups.\n\nAs a result of the working group on advancing human rights, in 2020, B4IG members adopted a collective statement supporting a European framework on mandatory human rights due diligence and providing suggestions to be considered in legislation. In 2021, the working group has implemented a toolbox gathering best practices from companies' members and put specific attention on migrant workers and fair recruitment.",

These plans include opportunities to reduce serious and fatal incidents, maintain legal compliance, provide safe working conditions, and encourage employee engagement in the safety processes throughout the organization.\n\nThe plans are built on the Top 5 Hazards found in every aspect of the Company, which include driving, electrical, falls, powered industrial trucks (PIT), and fixed powered machines (FPM).\n\n## Injuries based on the Top 5 Hazards since 2018\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.8.2 Group policy\n\n## 2.2.8.2.1  Safety is a value\n\nSafety is a value on which Schneider Electric will not compromise, and this applies to Schneider Electric employees, customers, partners, and those working on their behalf. Safety is a pillar of the Trust Charter and it reinforces the Group's commitment to provide a healthy and secure workplace for all. In addition, Schneider Electric's ambition is to achieve the highest standards of safety excellence. Schneider Electric is committed to invest in its people and its workplace as stated in its Group Safety and Occupational Health Policy, stating 'the ambition is to be the standard for safety excellence worldwide.'\n\nThe Safety and Occupational Health Policy establishes the commitment that Schneider Electric has made to maintaining safe and healthy working conditions, to fulfil legal obligations, to engage employees in safety processes, and to continually improve the health and safety program. It is the cornerstone of its certified Safety Management System. The policy includes the Group's Health and Safety Vision and Mission as such:\n\n## Vision:\n\n- \u2026to be the standard of excellence and the benchmark for health and safety within the industry.\n\n## Mission:\n\n- \u2026to protect occupational health and safety of employees, customers, contractors, and visitors, in the Group's locations, at offsite locations, and while travelling\u2026\n- \u2026to preserve Company license to operate through robust EHS compliance and risk management\u2026\n- \u2026to provide employees safe, pleasant, and efficient workplaces for enhanced well-being and effectiveness\u2026\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n- \u2026to enhance our brand image and contribute to world sustainability through employees' behavior and innovation.\n\nIn 2021, as part of its improvement efforts, Schneider Electric successfully achieved re-certification for ISO 45001 Safety Management System as part a fully integrated management system certified through Bureau Veritas. This certification is in place for over 200 locations, including 176 manufacturing and logistics sites and the central office.\n\n## 2.2.8.2.2 EHS strategy\n\nThe Schneider Electric global safety strategy includes 'S.A.F.E. First' at the core. Developed as a personal reminder to pause and reflect on safety before beginning any task, the program empowers employees to perform S.A.F.E. First checks and if 'Unsafe? We stop work'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo drive Sustainable Safety Results, four strategic priorities have been defined and embedded in the 'S.A.F.E. First' global safety strategy:\n\n- \u00b7 Leading as a role model\n- \u00b7 Technical qualifications and safe behaviors\n- \u00b7 Operational discipline and execution\n- \u00b7 Safe workplace for everyone\n\nThe Schneider Electric Top 5 Hazards are constantly being enhanced in terms of safety standards, training, and communication.\n\nThe global safety strategy also takes into consideration the five guiding principles that help to determine actions to be taken as part of a work task. They are:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring employees are qualified for the work task before performing work.\n- \u00b7 Empowering employees to stop work if unsafe.\n- \u00b7 Reporting opportunities for improvement.\n- \u00b7 Resolving and sharing solutions to problems.\n- \u00b7 Encouraging employees to care about their own safety and the safety of their co-workers and customers.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\n## 2.2  Driving responsible conduct of business with the Trust Charter\n\nContinuing from the efforts in 2020, Schneider Electric has taken further preventive measures to mitigate the risk of employee exposure to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), such as restrictions on business travel, and limiting local visitors. Schneider Electric has developed various Health and Safety guidance documents, such as dealing with suspected COVID-19 case, safe operating guidelines, vaccination guidance, and procedures to support our communities facing the challenge of setting a 'new normal' workplace.\n\n## 2.2.8.3  Due diligence and results\n\n## 2.2.8.3.1  Annual EHS Assessments\n\nTo ensure successful implementation of the strategy, annual Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Assessments are performed in industrial sites worldwide. The EHS Assessment is a global process in which a site is evaluated to identify opportunities and to recognize excellence. At regional and global levels, EHS teams consolidate site results to identify and prioritize actions to support site performance, training needs, and cross-site mentoring opportunities. The EHS Assessment uses the same structure as the Schneider Performance System (SPS) (Company performance standardization tool) for simplified user-adoption and to enable further alignment to the SPS.\n\n## 2.2.8.3.2  Global Safety Culture Survey\n\nAs part of our safety strategy, Schneider Electric has launched its first Global Safety Culture Survey in 2021 to measure employee safety engagement, identify further safety opportunities, and develop future safety initiatives. The response rate of 77% of employees surveyed, showed solid engagement. The survey results shows that 87% of employees are positive about the Safety Culture at their site.\n\n## 2.2.8.3.3  Safety awareness and communication\n\nCommunication is important to ensure coordinated and standardized program implementation. This is evident through quarterly safety campaigns, safety alerts, workplace standards, and employee engagement to identify safety opportunities.\n\nThese communication programs are deeply embedded into the safety culture at Schneider Electric. The Group also monitors proactive leading indicators, including safety employee engagement, which tracks the rate of employee participation in safety opportunities, and the effective application of the EHS Assessment tool. Safety opportunities reporting is well established with over 300,000 safety opportunities reported each year. The focus in 2022 will be to translate these opportunities into risk reduction actions.\n\nTraining on hazards and their associated risks is an important part of Schneider Electric employee expectations. There are 258 safety-related topics, housed in the My Learning Link database. Schneider Electric employees have completed an average of 4.76 hours of safety training in 2021.\n\nEach quarter, the Group focuses on a key safety subject to bring attention to both workplace and human factors, that have caused serious injuries at Schneider Electric. The campaign includes a dedicated web-portal to access tools, videos, training materials,\n\nposters, and leader-led topics to further promote the importance of safety worldwide. The four quarterly safety campaigns culminated with the annual 'Global Health & Safety Day' celebration held on October 18, 2021. During 'Global Health & Safety Day' we emphasized the importance of 'S.A.F.E. First, we all have a role to play', through webinars, and persona posters that each Schneider Electric employee can relate to. A special emphasis was placed on the importance of performing 'S.A.F.E. First Checks' to ensure that each employee is mentally focused and physically well before starting any new task.\n\n## 2.2.8.3.4 Results summary\n\nSchneider Electric has been very successful in meeting goals for the reduction of workplace injuries and illnesses, including those injuries resulting in lost time days. Over the past 10 years, the Group has reduced the frequency of incidents (Medical Incident Rate, MIR) by 81% and the severity of incidents (Lost Time Incident Rate, LTIR) by 77%. 2021 has shown an MIR increase of 12% versus 2020, with a corresponding LTIR performance increase by 6%. 2020 excellent performance aside, impacted positively by the pandemic, the 2021 overall safety performance remains very much aligned with the last 10 years improvement trend.\n\nThe MIR is the number of work incidents requiring medical treatment per million hours worked (i.e. average hours of 500 employees working for one calendar year). Work related injuries and occupational illnesses requiring medical treatment are included. The Occupational Illness Rate is tracked independently for benchmarking purposes and also to drive continuous improvement. The Occupational Illness Rate is 2.6% of our total medical incidents (MIR) in 2021.\n\n## 2.2.8.3.5  Recognition and awards\n\nSchneider Electric was the recipient of several awards for occupational health and safety programs in 2021. This includes 163 Occupational Excellence Achievement Awards from the National Safety Council (NSC) for safety performance that was 50% or better than their industry peer group. In addition, 5 Schneider Electric operations were recognized with the Industry Leader Awards in 2021 for outstanding safety achievements for the top 5% of companies that qualified for the NSC Occupational Excellence Achievement Award.\n\nIn Russia, Mari EI republic, Schneider Electric Potencial manufacturing site was awarded 1 st place in the governmental nomination 'prevention of working places injuries and occupational diseases'. Schneider Electric Egypt Distribution Center has been awarded a 'prestigious International Safety Award' from the British Safety Council.\n\nSchneider Electric UK&I received 3 RoSPA Awards (The Royal Society Health & Safety Performance Awards) during 2021: Gold award for demonstrating well developed occupational health and safety management systems, for managing occupational road risk and a winner award for demonstrating excellence in environmental as well as health and safety management.\n\nMultiple recognitions from different geographies were awarded to Schneider Electric for the pandemic COVID-19 management, highlighting Schneider Electric leadership and commitment towards employees Safety.",

Schneider Electric goals and initiatives are to be the standard in safety excellence worldwide. This pursuit begins with the Group employees, starting with leaders. Safety is leadership led, and the Group's ambition is to progress the entire community towards full empowerment as defined in the 'S.A.F.E. First' Human Factors training, Safety Culture Assessment, and leadership action plans, which were developed in 2020 and implemented in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, Safety Competency will be enhanced by strengthening our Health and Safety subject matter expert program 'EDISON' in each and every region. They will contribute to our 2022 Global Health & Safety program deployment.\n\nWhile our quarterly health and safety spotlights will re-enforce the 'S.A.F.E. First' pillars, our safety persona will be developed further to ensure employees understand and adopt 'S.A.F.E First, we all have a role to play'.\n\nIn 2020, Schneider set a 5 years safety target to reduce the Medical Incident rate to 0.38 based on 2019 MIR baseline performance. 2019 was selected as baseline year to mitigate COVID-19 impacts. The MIR performance has reduced from the baseline of 0.79 in 2019 to the result of 0.65 in 2021, which represents 34% of the 5-year target. 2021 shows an increase of MIR versus 2020, which was an exceptional performance, impacted positively by the pandemic. The employee safety engagement further improved in 2021 with 2.42 safety opportunities reported by employee, an increase by 23% versus 2020 and by 52% versus 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.9 Vigilance plan\n\n## 2.2.9.1 Context\n\nSchneider Electric seeks to be a role model in its interactions with customers, partners, suppliers, and communities when it comes to ethics and the respect and promotion of human rights. The Group strives to have a positive impact on the planet and the environment by contributing to finding solutions to limit climate change.\n\nThe Group's vigilance plan reflects this ambition. It also complies with the provisions of 2017 French law on Corporate duty of vigilance. The plan includes:\n\n- \u00b7 A risk analysis specific to vigilance: risks that Schneider Electric poses on the ecosystem and environment;\n- \u00b7 A review of the key actions implemented to remediate or mitigate these risks;\n- \u00b7 An alert system;\n- \u00b7 Governance specific to vigilance.\n\nIn this Registration document, Schneider Electric reviews the risk matrix analysis and some of the actions to mitigate these risks are described. When necessary, the reader will be directed to other sections of the report to get relevant and detailed information. For more comprehensive and complete information, the full vigilance plan of the Group is available as a standalone document and can be downloaded from Schneider Electric's website at se.com\n\n## 2.2.9.2  Evaluation of the main risks towards Schneider Electric's environment\n\n## 2.2.9.2.1 Methodology\n\nSchneider Electric developed a specific risk matrix for the implementation of its vigilance plan which is reviewed annually. The methodology is consistent with other risk evaluations maintained at Group level but focuses specifically on the risks posed by Schneider on its environment and ecosystem.\n\nIn order to enhance the existing risk matrix and cover a more comprehensive scope, in 2020, a review of the methodology for the risk matrix was done with an external consultant, Ksapa. This review led to a harmonization of the definitions, a sharper granularity of risk categories, a reorganization of the supplier categories, and a focus on local communities. In 2021, Schneider went further to deepen its analysis on local communities specifically. Other than this point, no further modifications were brought to the risk matrix or the methodology for its annual update.\n\nThe scope of work covered is Schneider Electric and its subsidiaries, joint ventures, suppliers, and subcontractors.\n\n## 2.2.9.2.2 Risk categories\n\nFour risk categories have been identified: human rights, environment, business conduct, and offer safety and cybersecurity. In order to be able to make a granular assessment of the risk level based on the nature of that risk and the magnitude of its impact on Schneider Electric's ecosystem, each category has been divided into specific risk areas.",

Employees with frequent travels (sales, field services, travelers, audit, top management) have been assessed separately;\n- \u00b7 Suppliers: the level of risk differs based on the type of process and technologies used, and the Group has therefore segmented the analysis by component category of purchase. The risk level is an average assessment. The geographical location is factored in when selecting suppliers for the audit plan;\n- \u00b7 Contractors: when implementing a customer project, like building a large electrical system at a customer's site, Schneider Electric is working with contractors, leveraging their expertise (civil work, electrical contracting, etc.). This 'off-site' project work generates a specific level of risk for contractors. A separate 'off-site and projects execution' category for contractors has therefore been defined for the assessment.\n- \u00b7 Local Communities: Schneider Electric has identified two distinct segments: communities located around Schneider Electric sites and communities located around customer projects sites. Communities have been assessed against three risk categories; human rights, environment, and business ethics.\n\n## 2.2.9.2.4  Risk evaluation and scale\n\nThe evaluation combines the probability of occurrence of the risk, with the seriousness of consequences from the risk. This is an evaluation of risk before impact of mitigation actions. After taking into consideration the impact of these mitigation actions, the level of risk may be significantly reduced. Risks are assessed on the following scale:\n\n- 1 - Non-existent; 2 - Low; 3 - Medium; 4 - High; 5 - Very high.\n\nIn this 2021 risk assessment, no 'Very high' risk levels were identified.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 2.2.9.2.5 Key findings\n\nIn 2021, the Group conducted an update of the risk mapping with key internal experts. No changes were brought to the methodology compared to last year, and the structure of our risk matrix, although it can be further improved and refined, allows to capture the main natures of risk from a Duty of Vigilance point of view.\n\nOverview of the main risks and their evolution:\n\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric sites: The COVID-19 pandemic, its social, business, and economic consequences has put significant pressure on teams and individuals. Although the first waves of the pandemic have been weathered, several countries like India or South Africa for example were severely hit. As a result, while some countries were going out of lockdowns and recovering 'normal' ways of working, some others were going into confinement and restrictions. Operations were thus disrupted, and the global supply chain had to deal with such complexity country by country. Teams have been resilient, and supported with the implementation of flexible and adaptive ways of working, but the overall long term impact of the situation, although complex to measure, is of fatigue. In this context, measuring the evolution of mental health and psycho-social risks over time is necessary.\n- \u00b7 Suppliers: Here also, the impact of COVID-19 is probably significant, but the measurement of its consequences over our supply chain will take longer. Our observations are that there has been an increase of pressure in fields such as health and safety (including mental health) due to tensions in the supply chain, and some deterioration of the human rights situation in some geographic areas.\n- \u00b7 Contractors: As in 2020, the 2021 assessment confirmed external off-site contractors as one area that needs special attention. This is due to the specific nature of project work (civil work, installation, etc.) that implies high labor activity on construction sites. Projects have been under specific pressure, as supply chain disruptions created some periods of slow-down, or even complete halt of on-site works, followed by intense periods of catch-up. This situation increased risks linked to health & safety and human rights, probably augmented by social consequences among the population of contracted workers, and workers working abroad from their own country.\n- \u00b7 Communities: the assessment work is still ongoing and therefore conclusions are still preliminary. Overall, it seems that communities located around Schneider Electric sites, at least for the largest sites, are not affected, or only marginally affected by Schneider Electric's presence. This is mostly due to the fact that Schneider Electric's sites are located in large, already structured industrial areas, or in cities. In regards to customer projects, the assessment shows that there may be some impact on communities. Schneider Electric is usually just one of the suppliers to the customer project, and the impacts are therefore highly variable and linked to the industrial profile of the endcustomer. A more detailed evaluation is in progress.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2  Driving responsible conduct of business with the Trust Charter\n\n## 2.2.10  Relations with project execution contractors\n\n## 2.2.10.1  Project execution environment\n\nSchneider Electric's products and solutions are usually combined into larger systems such as electricity distribution and energy management in a building, or production process automation in a factory. The build-up of such systems can be complex and typically involves several different parties before they are commissioned by end customers. For Schneider Electric, there are two options: to sell components through channel partners who take the responsibility to build and deliver the system; or to build and deliver the system directly for the end customer, as a project. This second option requires coordinating several project contractors (panel manufacturers, system integrators, building contractors, etc.), usually on the premises of the end customer. The common characteristics of these projects are that they happen primarily off-site (mostly on customer premises, existing or future), and they involve several different parties, global or local, bringing their specific added value. Each project is specific, in its size, duration, and location. Therefore, the relations with contractors are specific to a contract, and not necessarily recurrent. In 2021, Schneider Electric worked with more than 9,900 active solution suppliers in the Group's portfolio (with a spend of over \u20ac1B).\n\n## 2.2.10.2  Risks and opportunities\n\nIn the frame of the 'Duty of Vigilance' plan, specific risks have been identified. For more details, please refer to page 112.\n\nHuman Rights: as project sites are located in countries where Schneider may not be present, and involve independent subcontractors, there is a risk that the Schneider Electricrecommended policies in terms of health and safety, as well as decent workplace, may not be properly implemented. The main risks are physical accidents and injuries, or the improper treatment of employees (wages and salaries, resting time), especially temporary and/or foreign employees.\n\nBusiness Ethics: Projects that are conducted in countries where business ethics standards are insufficient may be subject to specific risks such as corruption, bribery, or pressures of a similar nature.\n\nCybersecurity: Some subcontractors may have digital interactions with the end customer and Schneider at the same time. Therefore, their level of cybersecurity and data protection may create some risks for the project and the final customer.\n\nA solid management of Schneider Electric's subcontractors allows to reduce the risks of incidents or accidents on site, and therefore protects workers, the communities living around the project site, and the final customer's employees and assets.\n\n## 2.2.10.3 Group policy\n\nAs part of its Duty of Vigilance program, Schneider Electric has deployed a policy of identification of risky subcontractors and implemented an on-site audit program. The results are described in the 'Due diligence and results' section below.\n\nIn 2021, to further anticipate and reinforce its risk mitigation measures, the Group introduced an evolution of its project decision-making process. The aim is to include a risk assessment of human rights and environmental impacts at all key milestones of the process, and to select the mitigation measures that will allow to reduce these risks. During the execution of the project, a regular review of the efficiency and effectiveness of these measures will be conducted. This process evolution will be effectively applied to project reviews from early 2022.\n\n## 2.2.10.4  Due diligence and results\n\nSchneider Electric operates with a pool of project contractors (or 'solution suppliers') from more than 9,900 companies. Not all of them may be active during a year. In the course of its supplier risk mapping exercise, Schneider Electric has identified approximately 200+ solution suppliers categorized as 'high risk'. Since 2018, 62 suppliers have already been audited, slightly below the ambition due to 2021 slow down as a consequence of COVID-19. The 13 audits on solution suppliers performed in 2021 have allowed Schneider to raise 157 non-conformities. Out of these nonconformances, 11 are assessed as 'top priority'.\n\nThe most recurring non-conformities with high risk solution contractors are: need of adequate and effective fire emergency evacuation and response drills, improvement of on-site security measures to protect workers (safety hazards, permit and testing reports for occupational injury and illness), identify correctly effective emergency.\n\nIn addition to these non-conformities, specific risks related to local contract negotiation and relations with local authorities may occur.\n\nActions following non-conformities are the same as with other suppliers (re-audits, trainings, workshops). Specific measures are implemented for this project environment: Schneider Electric implements regular reviews of safety incidents on customers' sites, involving the Global Safety team and the Project Management leadership. The Group also reinforced training on Anti-Corruption and Business Agent policies for its employees involved in commercial negotiations. The project follow-up with contractors and the selection processes for contractors has been adapted to ensure vigilance topics are considered early in the project stage.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.11 Sustainable relations with suppliers\n\n## 2.2.11.1  Risks and opportunities\n\nSchneider Electric has been involved in an ambitious approach to include sustainable development challenges in supplier selection and working processes. This approach is all the more important as Schneider Electric's procurement volume represents more than EUR 12 billion - and more than 52,000 suppliers.\n\nWith a complex global supply chain, there are some potential risks that Schneider Electric is committed to mitigating in the areas of health and safety, human rights, ethics, the environment, and sustainable development. Proactively managing upstream supplier risks, through Schneider Electric's Supplier Vigilance, but also driving ambitious Sustainable Development programs and processes, also improves the Group's reputation and shareholder value, and greatly lowers legislative and business risks.\n\nBy working closely with its suppliers to develop their maturity in integrating sustainability, Schneider Electric further de-risks and improves its competitive advantage by continually improving the global supply chain. Key opportunities of collaboration with our partners includes: climate action, circular supply chain models, and socially inclusive workplaces.\n\n## 2.2.11.2 Risk identification and management\n\nSchneider Electric has a risk management system to identify and manage critical suppliers, and uses a tool, Supplier Risk Management (SRIM), to capture risks and ensure the follow-up of identified cases with an extended source.\n\nThe Group has also been performing sustainability risk assessments with its own procurement specialists, supported by its Schneider Supplier Quality Management (SSQM) processes and ISO 26000 assessments for strategic suppliers.\n\nIn addition, Schneider Electric is reinforcing its sustainability risk assessment by geography and type of activity as part of its vigilance plan.\n\nSchneider Electric has launched the Trust Line, a professional alert system for stakeholders to escalate any violation of its Code of Conduct/ethics/responsible behavior along the Supply Chain.\n\n## 2.2.11.3 Group policy\n\nSince 2004, the Group has been encouraging its suppliers to commit to sustainable development initiatives. Since 2012, Schneider Electric has been continually improving as well mandating its strategic suppliers to make progress according to the ISO 26000 guidelines.\n\nThis approach is supported by the General Procurement Terms and Conditions which all suppliers must abide by: each supplier undertakes to apply the principles and guidelines of the ISO 26000, the rules defined in the ISO 14001 standard. Sustainability is considered as a key selection criteria.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nSuppliers also commit to respect all national legislation / regulations, REACH regulation, RoHS directives, and, more generally, the laws and regulations relating to the prohibition or restriction of use of certain products or substances. Lastly, suppliers are expected to report the presence and country of origin of any and all conflict minerals supplies in accordance with the requirements of the US Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 known as the 'Conflict Minerals' law. In this context, Schneider Electric has a 'conflict-free' objective.\n\nSchneider Electric publishes a charter for its suppliers, called the Supplier Guide Book, initially launched in 2016. The first section of this articulates expectations for suppliers on sustainable development in the following five areas: environment, fair and ethical business practices, sustainable procurement, labor practices, and human rights. In 2021, the Group adopted a new, revised Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC), which aligned with the new sustainability commitments of the Group and laid out the most fundamental requirements that need to be met by the suppliers. The key focal areas include environment (climate action, circularity), human rights and decent working conditions, occupational health and safety, fair business practices, grievance redressal, inspection and corrective actions, sustainable procurement, and access to remedy.\n\n## 2.2.11.4  Integration of sustainability criteria in the selection of new suppliers\n\nSchneider Electric uses a qualification process called Supplier Approval Module (SAM) to qualify new and legacy suppliers. It is based on an auto-evaluation questionnaire combined with on-site audits by Schneider Electric certified auditors.\n\nIn 2021, to reinforce the assessment on Labor, Ethics, Environment, and Health & Safety, a new auto-evaluation questionnaire has been introduced as part of the qualification process for new suppliers. This self-assessment is the first qualification process step, and only potential new suppliers with approved self-assessments can be chosen to complete the qualification process with the SAM functional audits.\n\nThe SAM functional audits include different sections on sustainability as a criterion of evaluation, and these sections represent about 15% of the supplier evaluation criteria. The most relevant areas identified are:\n\n- \u00b7 People and social responsibility: training, human rights, ISO 26000, and health and safety.\n- \u00b7 Environment: ISO 14001 and energy savings, REACH and RoHS, and conflict minerals.\n\nIn 2021 Schneider Electric included SAM in the global Schneider Supplier Portal - Supplier Relationship Management (SSP-SRM tool). Due to this capability, SAM results are available for the Global Supply Chain community, and all newly assessed suppliers have their action plan registered in a central database, available to all in real time, making supplier interactions more fluid. These are tracked by Schneider Electric supplier leaders on a monthly or pluri-annual basis depending on the severity of the risks and classification of the supplier.\n\nSchneider Electric completed 740 qualification processes in 2021, including new and legacy suppliers.\n\n2.",

Performance resulting from the EcoVadis evaluation is an important element of the sustainable development pillar.\n\nThe ISO26000 evaluation by EcoVadis remains one of the key aspects of Schneider Electric's supply chain and procurement-led sustainable development strategy. The elements of the assessment are an integral part of the business reviews scheduled between buyers and suppliers, on a quarterly to yearly basis, depending on the suppliers. This monitoring supposes an improvement from the supplier.\n\nThe Group has set out to engage all its strategic suppliers in a process of continuous improvement on this pillar. At the end of 2021, strategic suppliers represented c. 60% of Schneider Electric's purchases volume. Strategic suppliers who have passed the third-party evaluation process cover 70%+ of total strategic purchasing volume.\n\nIn 2018, the Group took on the ambitious target of achieving +5 points out of 100 in the average ISO 26000 assessment score of its strategic suppliers between 2018 and 2020 as part of the SSI. In 2019, this target was raised to +5.5 points. At the end of 2020, +6.3 points were achieved, with an average of 57.4 points.\n\n2021 target was set at +1 point minimum, and the end of year result was +1.3 points with an average of 58.7 points.\n\nThe new ambition for 2021 - 2025 is to raise the bar even higher to achieve an average of 65 points within 5 years.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.11.6  Vigilance plan for suppliers\n\n## Supplier risk categories and audit plan\n\nSchneider Electric is conducting a specific evaluation of suppliers. This evaluation covers all natures of risks identified and considers specific parameters such as the type of industrial process used by the suppliers, their technology, and the geographic location of those suppliers. This allows the Group to factor in risks that may arise from a country's specific situation (social, political, etc.). These parameters are compiled in a third-party independent database (Responsible Business Alliance methodology, RBA, ex-EICC, of which Schneider Electric has been a member since January 2018). Schneider's entire network of tier 1 suppliers (52,000) is processed through this methodology and is refreshed every year with the new supplier baseline.\n\nThe audit plan started in 2018. 2020 was the third year of implementation and Schneider Electric completed this schedule with 374 audits.\n\nFrom 2021 to 2025, Schneider Electric has defined new objectives as part of the sustainability strategy: expanding from the previous plan, the Group set an objective to conduct 1,000 on-site audits on high-risk suppliers and deploy 3,000 self-assessment audits for other suppliers. This audit plan is integrated into the Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE).\n\n## Overall plan\n\nFor our 2021 plan, the Group identified ~1,300 'high risk' suppliers; this number varies depending on the year.\n\nThe 2021 - 2025 overall ambition is to cover 1,000 suppliers through on-site audits, directly or through third parties, and 3,000 through a remote assessment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\nSSE #17 indicator: 4,000 suppliers assessed under Schneider Electric's 'Vigilance Program'\n\n## On-site audits\n\nSchneider Electric's audit questionnaire and audit methodology are fully aligned with the RBA framework. The RBA framework is linked to the Duty of Vigilance risk matrix categories as follow:\n\n- \u00b7 Human Rights: decent workplace: 36 questions, health and safety: 40 questions.\n- \u00b7 Environment: 21 questions.\n- \u00b7 Offer Safety: non-applicable in RBA framework.\n- \u00b7 Business Conduct: 11 questions.\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity: non-applicable in RBA framework.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nIn 2021, despite COVID-19 travel restrictions in first part of the year, the Group conducted 205 initial on-site audits with suppliers (audits conducted for the first time with a supplier). These audits allow Schneider Electric to identify non-conformances and request the supplier to implement corrective actions.\n\nRe-audits with suppliers already audited were also conducted to review the corrective actions implemented to remediate nonconformances identified during the initial audit.\n\nInformation and findings regarding on-site audits with new suppliers are described below.\n\nA major part of non-conformance in 2021 is related to health and safety, labor standards and management systems (36%, 29%, and 20% respectively). Graph 3 gives the breakdown of nonconformances by topic and graph 4 gives them by geography.\n\nTop priority are the most serious non-conformances. For each case, escalation is done at Chief Procurement Officer level. An analysis of the 249 'top priorities' raised in 2021 shows the following issues are the most recurring:\n\n- \u00b7 Labor standards (61% of top priority non-conformance issues): lack of respect of working time and resting days (time measurement systems are often insufficient); poor overtime reporting and payment; lack of formalization of working contracts\n- \u00b7 Health and safety (33% of top priority non-conformance issues): weak emergency procedures; insufficient emergency training issues and preparation drills; insufficient fire alarm and protection systems; lack of medical response equipment; and lack of training.\n- \u00b7 Environment and management systems (6% of top priorities): lack of administrative compliance, management tools, and systems; and insufficient waste management and pollution prevention systems.\n\n## Remote self-assessment\n\nFrom 2021 to 2025, Schneider Electric has defined new objectives as part of the sustainability strategy: conduct 1,000 on-site audits on high-risk suppliers and deploy 3,000 self-assessment audits for other suppliers.\n\nThis year, in 2021, a specific self-assessment questionnaire has been elaborated, building on the experiences of on-site audits performed during the past three years. Among the questions asked, the core ones aim at checking whether the suppliers are compliant on mandatory subjects of labor, human rights, environment, and health and safety. After an initial pilot test, a large-scale launch was made in second half of 2021. At the end of the year, 624 suppliers had submitted answers. Procurement teams are currently in the process of reviewing answers to identify which suppliers may be eligible, in a second phase, to an on-site audit.\n\n2.",

Schneider Electric's approach is to help suppliers remediate the issues by sharing good practices and providing them with guidance and training. When non-conformances are not remediated (mainly top priorities), escalation to the Chief Procurement Officer may lead to an end of the business relationship. In 2021, one relationship with a supplier has been terminated.\n\nIn order to reinforce the co-ordination between Schneider Electric teams and suppliers on vigilance topics, a specific training program has been implemented.\n\n% Risky suppliers identified in 2021 by geography - Graph 1\n\n% Audits carried out in 2021 by geography - Graph 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n% Non-conformances in 2021 by topic - Graph 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n% Non-conformances in 2021 by geography - Graph 4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * EAJP: East Asia Japan Pacific\n- ** EMEA: Europe Middle East Africa\n\n## Impact\n\nFrom the beginning of the program in 2017 to the end of 2021, 579 suppliers have been audited on site, and 7,000+ nonconformances were raised, and subsequently remediated. 37% were related to health and safety issues, and 25% were related to labor issues. Among the most serious ones are issues of fire safety, protection of workers from accidents and injuries, respect of a decent working time including proper resting periods and payment of overtime.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOverall, the resolution of these non-conformities has allowed to improve the working conditions for the employees of these suppliers. Although this is a rough estimate, we estimate that 185,000 employees have seen their working conditions positively impacted by the Supplier Vigilance program.\n\nThe primary target audience is the Schneider Electric Procurement team, and the training modules aim to increase their knowledge on the nature of risks, so they can integrate these topics early in the discussions with suppliers. At the end of 2021, ~580 employees have taken this training. These trainings combine in-class experience with e-learning sessions.\n\nTo raise suppliers' awareness, improve their ability to identify risks earlier, and implement mitigation solutions, Schneider Electric organized face-to-face workshops dedicated to vigilance subjects. At the end of 2021, ~500 supplier team members have attended these events. These sessions include in-class face-to-face workshops and digital webinars.",

Schneider Electric is well on track to reach the new target. The 205 initial on site audits performed in 2021 have allowed Schneider to raise 3,000+ non-conformances. Out of these non-conformances, 200+ are assessed as 'top priority' and are given very specific attention during the re-audits of the suppliers. Schneider Electric's objective is to close 100% of all types of non-conformances identified, whatever their priority level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.11.7  Conflict Minerals rule\n\nIn August 2012, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted the Conflict Minerals rule as part of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As defined by the legislation, 'conflict minerals' include the metals tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold, often called '3TG', which are the extracts of the minerals cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, and wolframite, respectively. The legislation focuses on the sourcing of these minerals to be 'DRC conflict free' - meaning when these minerals were extracted, they did not directly or indirectly benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. This rule requires companies to conduct a 'reasonable country of minerals' origin inquiry' and due diligence to determine whether 'conflict minerals', as defined in the rule, are used in their supply chain.\n\nAlthough the US SEC Conflict Minerals rule does not apply directly to Schneider Electric - since it is not registered with the US SEC it is deeply concerned about social and environmental conditions in some mines that could supply metals for its products. As part of the Group's sustainable business practices, it is committed to increasing its responsible metal sourcing efforts.\n\nIn working towards these commitments, Schneider Electric has taken numerous steps including:\n\n- \u00b7 Updating its Procurement Terms and Conditions to reflect its expectations from suppliers.\n- \u00b7 Establishing a 'Conflict Minerals Compliance program' supported and sponsored by its top leadership. This program was developed based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRA) and other appropriate international standards, which covers a wider scope of minerals and countries.\n- \u00b7 Identifying the use of conflict minerals in its products.\n- \u00b7 Engaging with its suppliers so that they respond in a timely manner to its requests for evidence of compliance.\n- \u00b7 Participating in smelter outreach program.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nSchneider Electric is working with an expert third party, collecting information from its suppliers to identify the source of the minerals in question and ensure they are recognized as 'conflict-free' within established international standards such as the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), and others. The Group is aware of the complexity of this task, and that it will take time to collect the required information, but it is committed to contributing to this responsible sourcing initiative as well as responding to its customers' potential concerns.\n\nAt the end of 2021, 85% of the smelters and refiners identified in our supply chain were designated as compliant with a recognized third-party validation scheme or actively engaging in same (equivalent to more than 87% of the relevant spend being compliant). The remainder are either from outside the conflict zone outlined in Section 1502 of the Dodd Frank Act, or solely using recycled and scrap materials. When the country of origin is known to be in the conflict zone, 100% of the smelters and refiners were verified conformant. Therefore, the Group has no reason to believe that any conflict minerals the Group sourced, have directly or indirectly financed or benefitted armed conflict in the covered countries.\n\n## 2.2.11.8 Cobalt program\n\nMid-2020, Schneider Electric added cobalt to its Conflict Minerals Compliance program. Cobalt sales have been identified as potentially funding or supporting inhumane treatment, including human trafficking, slavery, forced labor, child labor, torture, and war crimes in known CAHRA. These areas are identified by the presence of armed conflict, widespread violence, or other risks of harm to people. These areas are often characterized by widespread human rights abuses and violations of national or international law. The program, currently ramping up, is focusing on the responsible sourcing of cobalt used as a key element for lithium ion batteries in Schneider Electric's supply chain.\n\n## 2.2.11.9 Decent work\n\n## Background\n\nSupply chains power the economic engine of the world. On the one hand they help companies leverage the global capabilities and benefit from the collective genius; on the other hand, they help economies progress and engage in global commerce. However, the benefits of this global integration are often unequally distributed. One of the areas where this is prominent is working conditions and rights available to the workers in their workplace.\n\n## Working condition crisis\n\nStudies and research across the world have shown that mere involvement in global commerce is not sufficient to uplift underprivileged populations. According to the United Nations, over 700 million workers lived in extreme or moderate poverty in 2018 and as per estimates by civil society organizations, more than 40 million people are trapped in modern day slavery worldwide, with more than 70% being women and children. The recent onslaught of COVID-19 has had a negative impact on employment conditions. A survey by the United Nations Global Compact revealed that global labor income declined by an average of 10% in the first three quarters of 2020 compared with 2019. Widespread job losses and loss of earning members increase insecurity, making workers vulnerable to poor and exploitative working conditions. The scale of this challenge is too great to be handled by governments alone. Corporations need to take responsibility and do their part in ensuring that worker rights are respected universally.\n\n2.",

In case of any expense incurred by the worker towards obtaining  employment, the same should be reimbursed by the employer. The work should respect and uphold the  dignity of employees and proactively create an environment to resolve and remediate modern slavery,  forced labor, and bonded labor.

The gradual decline of  industrial wages and the COVID-19 crisis have severely impacted the economic outlook of the workforce,  globally. Companies should review the wage policies to ensure affordability of a dignified living by the  workers. Additionally, employment should equip the workforce to improve current skill set and knowledge  for future employability.                                                                         |\n| 3.    | Decent working hours                    | Excessive working hours is a legal violation, often accepted as 'necessary'. It is generally connected with  low industrial wages and used as an excuse to not provide appropriate wages. Companies should review  and remediate excessive hours and should align with the legal and/or international requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| 4.    | Stability and security of work          | Employment should be a source of economic stability and peace of mind. Uncertainty of job security  increases stress and makes the workforce vulnerable to abuse and hazardous working conditions.   The problem has been exacerbated due to COVID-19-related job losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| 5.    | Social dialogue and workplace relations | Employees should have the right to engage with management and collectively put across their concerns  and demands.

Differences in lifestyle, choices, etc., often become a source of discrimination, victimization, and  harassment. This curbs freedom of expression, hiding preferences, and creates mental health challenges.  Companies should ensure a workplace that accepts diversity and provides an inclusive work environment.                                                                                        |\n| 7. 8. | Safe work Social                        | Employment should result in economic independence and augment the ability to exercise a healthy   and prosperous life.

They influence the working  culture of the supplier organization to meet customer requirements. The power of procurement can be a  strong driver for positive change to include decent work conditions as a pre-requisite among the supply  chain partners, when balanced with other commercial criteria.                                                                                                                                          |\n| 10.   | Balancing work and family life          | Family responsibilities disproportionately impact genders and result in unequal participation in economic  activities. Workplaces should strive to create a level playing field and provide all possible opportunities to  employees to participate in economic activities without compromising the family responsibilities, which   may require periods away from work (e.g., maternity, family care, flexible hours, adequate child care).

These audits will be conducted by the trained Duty of Vigilance auditors.\n\n## 2.2.11.10  Supplier diversity program in the United States\n\nSchneider Electric US' supplier diversity program strives to identify, include, and engage qualified diverse suppliers to support the company's goals to foster equal opportunities.\n\nSchneider Electric US is in constant pursuit of qualified businesses that are certified as one, or more, of the following business classifications and provide quality products and services at competitive prices:\n\n- \u00b7 Small Business Enterprise (SBE);\n- \u00b7 Veteran (VET);\n- \u00b7 Minority-Owned Enterprise (MBE);\n- \u00b7 Women-Owned Enterprise (WBE);\n- \u00b7 Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone).\n\nAs of end of December 2021, 19,3% of Schneider Electric US' suppliers were diverse, aiming to demonstrate year to year improvement in utilization of diversely owned businesses.\n\n## 2.2.11.11 The Zero Carbon Project\n\nSchneider adopted a very ambitious target for 2050: to operate a net-zero carbon emission supply chain, meaning that all Schneider factories and transportation, and that of its suppliers in the entire upstream value chain would be operating without using any fossil fuel and run only on clean energy. To achieve this ambitious target of 2050, as the first step, Schneider has launched The Zero Carbon Project, which aims at reducing 50% of operational carbon emissions from its top 1,000 suppliers by 2025.\n\n- Read more details on The Zero Carbon Project in Chapter 2.3 'Acting for a climate positive world', page 126 , and in chapter 2.7 'Methodology and audit of indicators' page 206 . \u01f0\n\n## 2.2.11.12 Green materials and sustainable packaging\n\n## Sustainable Packaging (SSI #5)\n\nResource efficiency and conservation are the underlying principles that guide all actions at Schneider. During the period of 2018 2020 the Company implemented an initiative to successfully move to 99% of cardboard and pallets used in the transport of goods to be sourced from recycled or certified sources.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nIn 2021, this ambition was extended to use recycled cardboard in all primary and secondary packaging and remove all single use plastic from Schneider packaging by 2025 (SSI #5). To achieve this transformation, a two-pronged approach is deployed. On the one hand, a cross functional team is deployed to review the packaging design and explore and authorize the use of alternate materials for packaging; on the other hand, various procurement teams engage with suppliers across regions to ensure the deployment of the roadmap by the suppliers to meet the prescribed requirements.\n\nTo ensure streamlined actions, dedicated categories of packaging material were identified to be included in the transformation. As a result of concerted efforts by various teams, 21% of the packaging spend in scope was attributed to sustainable packaging.\n\n## Green Materials (SSI #4)\n\nSimilarly, another initiative has been launched to increase the proportion of green material in our products by 50% by 2025 (SSI/uni00A0#4).\n\nThe scope of this initiative currently includes:\n\n- \u00b7 thermoplastics (direct and indirect purchase);\n- \u00b7 steel (direct purchase); and\n- \u00b7 aluminum (direct purchase).\n\nOther kinds of materials like steel purchased as fabricated components, other non-ferrous metals (such as copper, silver or brass), and thermoset, both direct and indirect procurement, will be considered for next phases. At the end of 2021, 11% of materials in scope were qualified as 'Green'.\n\nFor thermoplastics, the 2021 performance was achieved mainly by embedding recycled plastics in products and by obtaining supplier proof for both recycled and green flame retardant.\n\nFor steel, a good progress was made notably thanks to the certification of large steel suppliers to Responsible Steel in 2021, as well as sourcing from suppliers using Electric Arc Furnace.\n\nFor aluminum a similar approach than the one for steel will be applied, focusing on building trust and transparency with suppliers.\n\n- Read more details on the Green materials and sustainable packaging in chapter 2.4 'Be efficient with resources', page 144 , and in chapter 2.7 'Methodology and audit of indicators' page 206 . \u01f0\n\n## 2.2.11.13  Rollout of eco-responsible initiatives\n\nSchneider Electric is rolling out several eco-responsible initiatives with its suppliers.\n\nFor example, Schneider has chosen to go further than the European REACH and RoHS regulations. The approach is rolled out in the Group over the whole product portfolio and to all suppliers, regardless of their geographic origin. To support the REACH and RoHS projects, Schneider has implemented a data collection process supported by a dedicated team to gather the required information from its suppliers. This has allowed it to significantly reduce its response time to collect such information and therefore be quicker to respond to its customers' inquiries. In addition to data collection, the Group put in place a review process for this data to guarantee its quality. Thanks to this process, the level of verification required for a given supplier can be adjusted in order to make the controls more stringent in cases where deviations have been detected.\n\nAnother example is Schneider's commitment to supporting the small and medium enterprises (SME) network. This support is given through an approach to work in an adapted manner with certain suppliers. In France, Schneider Electric is a major player in the International SME Pact.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\n## 2.2  Driving responsible conduct of business with the Trust Charter\n\nFinally, by the very nature of its activity, the Group continually encourages its ecosystem (including customers and suppliers) to implement energy efficient solutions.\n\n## 2.2.12  Vigilance with local communities\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric extended the scope of its risk analysis to communities. The notion of communities, here, corresponds to people living in a geographic proximity of Schneider's local operations. As a result of this proximity, their conditions of living could be affected by the Group's activity. Schneider's local operations can be of two types:\n\n- \u00b7 Local facilities, such as a factory or an office building.\n- \u00b7 Local project sites where Schneider is operating as a contractor or subcontractor for a customer.\n\n2020 was the first time Schneider Electric was formally addressing this risk analysis for communities, developing a framework with the help of an external consultant. In 2021, the Group deepened its analysis by selecting the sites that may present some risks for communities and conducting an analysis specifically for each of these sites.\n\n## 2.2.12.1  Communities living around Schneider's local sites\n\n## 2.2.12.1.1  Risk assessment for the 30 largest Schneider sites\n\nThis detailed risk evaluation covers the 30 largest sites by size and employees, both commercial and industrial.\n\n## Potential impacts analysis\n\nThe first step of this evaluation was to analyze the potential impact that a Schneider site may have on its surroundings. For that purpose, a comparison was made between the size of the site, and the size of the urban area surrounding it. To take a practical example, in Shanghai, a large Schneider Electric office site may be important at Schneider level (>2,000 employees) but will have very little impact on its immediate urban surrounding (Shanghai is a multi-million inhabitants city). On the opposite end, a smaller site may have a bigger impact on its rural surrounding in Africa or South Asia.\n\n## Risk nature and level\n\nThe second step was to qualify the natures of risk and their level, using public data available at country level on topics such as ethical standards (National Corruption Index), individual development (Human Development Index), or health and human rights (Human Right score). Using this data, a composite country risk index was built to reflect the risk level for countries where Schneider's main sites are located.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe third step was to combine Schneider's site impact level with the composite country risk index. The overall result shows that the level of risk on local communities living around Schneider Electric sites is\n\n'low' in most cases. This owes mainly to the fact that the Company is usually located in large, urban, or peri-urban areas, crowded with many similar or larger companies. In case of factories, they are mostly located in already existing dedicated industrial areas, with solid infrastructures and transportation networks, and Schneider Electric's presence does not have an impact on them.\n\nAmong the top 30 sites, the Group only identified a few that may have a 'moderate' impact on local communities and found no site where Schneider Electric could have a 'high' or 'very high' impact.\n\nIt is to be noted that although we speak about risks, the notion of impact can also be positive, as it is part of Schneider Electric's policy to include local parameters in its sourcing policy: providing employment; including a percentage of local companies and contractors for services (catering, maintenance, etc.).\n\n## 2.2.12.1.2  In depth evaluation of 5 sites\n\nThe management and safety officers of these sites are engaged with a dedicated questionnaire, covering environmental and human rights potential risks and opportunities for the local communities. The result of the evaluation shows that among the five sites reviewed, four have no significant impact and one may have some specific impacts.\n\nFour sites with low impact, well mitigated:\n\n- \u00b7 The four factories studied are located within dedicated industrial parks, with specific infrastructures including transportation and access. No competition for local resources (water, power, staple goods, etc.) were reported. Their impact on the urban surroundings is low, as they are either located next to a very large city, or in one case, in the countryside and at a reasonable distance from the nearest village.\n- \u00b7 These sites provide a significant source of employment for local people. Besides, these entities foster local development initiatives such as supporting schools, cultural programs, or local infrastructures (such as hospitals).\n- \u00b7 The industrial activities performed on these four sites are mostly the assembly of components. There are some marginal activities of plastic injection that are subject to local and national regulations, with regular compulsory reporting.\n- \u00b7 One of the sites is part of an industrial park, that includes housing facilities for workers (dormitories). These facilities have been recently enhanced, are compliant to local standards, and have not been subject to any specific alert report. However, they remain a point of attention and follow-up on Schneider's side.\n\nOne site with medium risk, mitigation actions in progress:\n\n- \u00b7 This specific site is hosting an industrial process that involves the use of chemicals. Although these are not critical and restricted substances, they are required to be monitored and processed specifically.\n- \u00b7 The site is located close to a small urban area, therefore risks of marginal pollution are present.\n- \u00b7 Several mitigation actions have been implemented by the local team. A specific review of the adequacy of these measures is in progress.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.12.2  Communities living around Schneider Electric's customer projects sites\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric has engaged into a review of risks for local communities residing close to the sites where the Group is implementing projects for customers. These projects can be, for example, the building of an electrical switchgear station to distribute electricity, either to the grid or to private large users (factories, professional buildings, etc.). Depending on the profile of the end-customer, these projects necessitate the on-site coordination of several types of contractors: civil engineering, industrial process experts, electricity specialists, communication infrastructure experts. Relations with local communities, when relevant, are usually handled by the main contractor, or by the end-customer.\n\n## 2.2.12.2.1  Characterizing the sites, ranking them by risk level, and selecting the ones for a deep dive\n\nTo identify the main sites presenting potential risks, Schneider Electric has pre-selected customer projects based on the combination of two criteria: country risk and customer activity. Country risk is a compound of several external publicly available indicators (transparency, human rights, etc.). Customer activity is based on the industrial process specific to the end-customer. For illustration, the top five risks are ranked as follows:\n\n| Country    | Customer activity           |\n|------------|-----------------------------|\n| Chad       | Mining, minerals and metals |\n| Mauritania | Oil, gas and petrochemicals |\n| Angola     | Power and grid              |\n| Nigeria    | Life sciences               |\n| Tanzania   | Water                       |\n\nBased on these criteria, the Group has established a list of 25 projects to be reviewed with their management team.\n\n## 2.2.12.2.2  Evaluating the impact for selected sites\n\nProjects reviewed can be grouped into three categories, each reflecting the type of involvement of Schneider Electric, and the mitigation capabilities of Schneider.\n\n- \u00b7 Type A: Schneider Electric is providing switchgear and/or industrial equipment, is also the main contractor for the project, and is present on site. Mitigation actions can be decided and implemented by Schneider.\n- \u00b7 Type B: Schneider Electric is providing switchgear and/or industrial equipment, but it is not the main contractor. Mitigation capabilities are limited.\n- \u00b7 Type C: Schneider Electric is providing software and control, and is mostly working remotely, being present on site only for final testing and commissioning. Mitigation capabilities are very low.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nAmong the projects reviewed, 2 were of type A, 6 of type B, and 6 of type C.\n\n- \u00b7 2 projects of type A: the study of these projects is showing the following risks and benefits on local populations:\n- - Temporary/brief disturbance in the transportation and mobility due to large materials and equipment delivery.\n- - Temporary and planned power outages.\n- - No environmental or pollution risk.\n- - Local security implemented by final customer, with no or little impact on the neighboring communities.\n- - The project is a source of employment for local companies.\n- \u00b7 12 projects of type B and C: among these projects, six are projects with significant impact on the local communities (petrochem, etc.) and six have no impact (desert or remote location). For these projects with significant impact, relations with local communities are handled by the end-user or the main contractor. Given the small size of Schneider Electric's contribution to the overall project investment, the capacity of Schneider to be a significant contributor to the mitigation measures is very limited. Specific policies that would increase this capacity, adapted to these project profiles, are currently studied.\n\n2.",

We know that we must go faster if we are to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Schneider Electric is part of the solution thanks to its existing technologies and products to achieve a climate positive impact.'\n\nXavier Denoly, SVP Sustainable Development\n\n## Context and goals\n\n2021 was a year of acceleration, building on the lessons learned from 2020. Acceleration of our collective realization of the fragility of the world's ecosystems, climate, resources, biodiversity, and even human lives. The magnitude of changes needed will not accept incremental year-on-year progress. What is now needed is to place a planet-first lens onto our collective development path: are we living under the limits of one planet? As science tells us this is not the case, let us instead work backwards and define what needs to be done to maintain climate under a 1.5\u00b0C global temperature increase and preserve biodiversity and resources.\n\nCompanies all over the world are accelerating to align business strategies with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory. Since 2018, the number of companies with targets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative has doubled every year, to reach over 1,000 companies in 2021, including Schneider Electric. Another 1,000 companies are committed to set such targets soon.\n\nBecause it strives to be an Impact Company, the Group's climate strategy addresses all its stakeholders, from employees to supply chain partners, customers, as well as local communities and institutions, and shows there are ways for companies to 'do good while doing well'.\n\nConcrete actions for the 2021-2025 period are monitored and shared transparently in Schneider Sustainability Impact and Essentials and are overseen by various dedicated Committees up to the Board of Directors. In the longer term, the Group is committed to net-zero CO 2 emissions in its operations by 2030, and took specific commitments for renewable electricity, energy efficiency and electric vehicles under the RE100, EP100, and EV100 initiatives. By 2040, the Group will be carbon neutral along the whole of its value chain, meaning all products will be carbon neutral. Importantly, beyond targeting excellence in reducing its own footprint, Schneider Electric also delivers about 100 million tonnes CO 2 gains to its customers each year with EcoStruxure \u2122 .",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\n## 2.3 Acting for a climate positive world\n\n## 2.3.1 Climate governance\n\n## 2.3.1.1 Governance\n\nSchneider Electric sees itself and reviews its progress as part of a broader ecosystem: firstly, how the Group as a company and in its supply chain delivers progress to align with a 1.5\u00b0C climate trajectory; secondly, how customers are helped to do the same through Schneider's offers; and thirdly, how Schneider helps communities accelerate climate action.\n\nThe process for designing a new SSI includes a sustainability risks and opportunities assessment (including climate), which leads to the design of concrete transformation programs to align the company on the challenges identified. Several governance bodies are involved in this process:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors and its Human Resources & CSR Committee;\n- \u00b7 The Executive Committee and its Group Sustainability Committee;\n- \u00b7 The SSI Steering Committee and the Sustainability department.\n- \u00b7 A Carbon Committee is in charge of continuously assessing climate-related risks and opportunities, to steer the Climate Pledge and to propose a strategy and management plan to the Group Sustainability Committee.\n\nAt Group level, the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer helps determine and enforce the Group's environmental goals and underlying transformations.\n\nAdditionally, environmental transformations are driven by a network of leading experts in various environmental fields (eco-design, energy efficiency, circular economy, CO 2 , etc.). On an annual basis, a process identifies and recognizes those individuals who own a specific expertise that the company is keen to maintain and grow. Various governance bodies enable these communities of experts and leaders within the Environmental function to meet every month or every quarter, depending on the topics and entities, to ensure consistent adoption of Environment policies and standards throughout the Group. To implement these policies, Environment leaders coordinate a network of more than 600 managers responsible for the environmental management of sites, countries, product design and marketing.\n\n## 2.3.1.2 Risks and opportunities\n\n## Climate-driven opportunities\n\nWhile the climate crisis is sobering, it is also stimulating significant action and innovation across businesses, industries, and governments. The combined challenge of the COVID-19 virus with increasing climate-related impacts has given rise to unprecedented financial flows for recovery tied to improvements in efficiency and emissions reduction, such as the EU's Green Taxonomy and the US infrastructure package.\n\nIncreasing awareness of the risks posed by climate change has also led thousands of businesses to make commitments to and act on decarbonization, energy efficiency, electrification, renewable energy procurement, and more. These existing solutions are only the beginning: the next decade will showcase the surge in 'clean technologies,' as entrepreneurs and corporations alike seek to imagine, realize and scale innovations in energy storage, carbon capture, nature-based solutions among others, further stimulating the global economy and creating a new class of clean, green jobs.\n\nThis growing demand for greener, low-carbon products and services creates a strong business opportunity for Schneider. Where appropriate, opportunities for growth are identified and translated into new products (for instance our unique SM AirSeT \u2122 switchgear to avoid using SF 6 , or the creation of the new Sustainability Business). The Group is uniquely positioned to seize these opportunities because it acts on both sides of the equation:\n\n- \u00b7 The energy management, industrial automation, and sustainability consulting solutions Schneider brings to the market are directly linked to activities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and improve humanity's resilience to climate change.\n- \u00b7 At the same time, Schneider acts to reduce its end-to-end CO 2 footprint, aiming for a carbon neutral value chain by 2040, with precise steps for 2025 and 2030.\n\nIn 2021, 71% of the Group revenues qualify as Impact revenues, following Schneider Electric's definition: revenues from offers that bring energy, climate, or resource efficiency to customers, while not generating any significant harmful impacts to the environment. The Group aims to grow its Impact revenues to 80% by 2025 (SSI #1). Additionally, more than 90% of Schneider's innovation projects contribute to solutions relating to climate change mitigation and environment protection.\n\n## Climate-driven risks\n\n## Failure to meet 1.5\u00b0C-aligned GHG reduction emissions targets\n\nMissing its decarbonization commitments could trigger greater financial costs than anticipated for Schneider due for instance to locked-in emissions of assets with long operating lifetime or long-term leases, or reputational impacts and loss of trust from customers, investors, and employees.\n\n## Inadapted evolution of the supply chain footprint\n\nVolatility of energy and commodity prices as well as regulation strengthening will generate increasing and volatile operating and investment costs along Schneider's value chain, impacting both Schneider's expenditures and those of its suppliers. This can translate into an increase of the cost of goods sold and reduced margins. This risk can be mitigated by securing low-carbon and resilient sources of energy supply, increasing resource-efficiency, and increasing resale prices along the value chain. Also, physical assets are retrofitted for resource-efficiency, as competition with newly built efficient infrastructure will increase. For instance, energy-efficient and digital buildings provide superior comfort to users while lowering operating costs, which translates into higher asset value.",

        "page_content": "## Transition risks\n\nSchneider considers the possible financial impacts of future CO 2 costs on its activities, by taking into consideration both operational and supply chain footprints. Given the relatively low level of the Group's Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, carbon pricing has indirect rather than direct impacts, resulting in increased supply chain costs, especially regarding the purchase of raw materials and manufactured components containing metals and plastics. A carbon tax at EUR 50/tonne of CO 2 is estimated to have an impact on the Group's industrial supply chain up to EUR 420 million globally (including direct and indirect impacts).\n\nClimate change mitigation will likely lead to regulation strengthening, which can disrupt markets. For instance, SF 6 -insulated switchgear can have a significant impact on climate change if SF 6 is mishandled at the end of life of the equipment and leaks into the atmosphere. Schneider Electric strives to anticipate regulation changes and launches innovative SF 6 -free solutions.\n\n## Workplace disruptions\n\nExtreme weather events, floods, droughts, and other climate impacts will increasingly put pressure onto supply chains. Shortages of all kinds can translate directly into revenue loss (missed orders), increased costs (urgent shipping), and increased working capital requirements (stock management). Extreme events can also cause damage to property and assets. This risk can be mitigated by adopting a flexible and resilient supply chain, with the ability to rebalance supply and manufacturing.\n\nTo further tie climate-related issues to financial planning, Schneider successfully launched the first-ever sustainability-linked convertible bonds in 2020. This bond has been linked to three SSI targets by including the objective to save and avoid 800 million tonnes of CO 2 on the customers' end by 2025.\n\n## 2.3.1.3 Risk management\n\nRisks are identified and assessed through specific internal and external metrics, but also through interviews with experts and leaders, run by the Internal Audit Department and the Group Risk Management Department, to update the list of general risks at Group level each year. In 2021, around 40 of the Group's top managers were interviewed in addition to Board members. Environment and climate-related risks are included in Schneider's unique risk taxonomy (more details in Chapter 3 'How we manage risk at Schneider Electric').\n\nEvery three years, a materiality analysis is conducted by the Sustainability department, leveraging an external consultant, and complements the risk analysis with a focus on environment, social, and governance (ESG) topics and longer-term risks and opportunities (more details in section 2.1.6 'Main ESG risks and opportunities').\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nOverall, the different governance bodies involved in the definition and monitoring of the sustainability commitments and programs (SSI and SSE), and in particular the Carbon Committee, are in charge of defining strategic mitigation programs in response to the risks and opportunities identified. Strategic programs defined at Group level are then cascaded into business divisions, down to the sites for implementation, and are monitored through the digital platform, EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor. Performance against those programs is published quarterly in the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI), and annually in the Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) and Universal Registration Document. Each program of the SSI has a dedicated pilot in charge of driving the transformation, and is sponsored at the Senior Vice-President and Executive levels to ensure management control and oversight.\n\nClimate adaptation risks are also studied and mitigated at site level for the industrial sites. The Group's Property Damage and Business Interruption program, inspired from ISO 22301 standard, maps substantive risks of financial impact on the business, including asset destruction (buildings, equipment, inventories) and profit loss due to business interruption. The program reviews annually the natural hazard exposures of our manufacturing and logistic locations. An example of a risk analyzed at site level is flooding risks.\n\nRisk analysis of industrial sites includes an analysis of interdependencies, study of alternative supply, and estimation of time to recover in case of damage, etc. Typically, all critical industrial sites are externally audited onsite at least every two years. In addition, starting 2021, Global Supply Chain has defined a resiliency index to assess and mitigate business interruption risks. This resiliency index covers several risks (such as physical security, political stability, etc.) and includes exposure to natural and climate-related hazards and mitigations.\n\nFinally, environmental risks (including climate) are assessed and mitigated at site level through the Group's Integrated Management System (IMS). The IMS covers the supply chain sites (plants, distribution centers, large offices) and hosts ISO 14001, ISO 50001, ISO 9001, and OSHAS 18000/ISO 45001 compliance management systems. Each site is audited periodically, either externally by Bureau Veritas (every three years), or internally. At present, the impact of climate-related matters is not material to the Group's financial statements.\n\nWith suppliers, sustainability risks (including natural and climaterelated hazards), are embedded into Supplier Risk Assessment. This process enables to define risk mitigation action plans with suppliers, as well as prioritize double sourcing strategies. Leveraging external data providers, the Group monitors events across 10,000 nodes (such as ports and critical supplier locations) to shorten reaction time when events occur and minimize business impact.\n\n2.",

The Group has been a leading contributor to the fight against climate change for the past 15 years by implementing its own energy management and industrial automation solutions across operations, by supporting its clients in achieving their low-carbon and efficiency objectives, and by allowing more than 30 million people to gain access to electricity. Schneider also takes an active role in a variety of multi-stakeholder organizations to promote solutions to climate change, call for a price to CO 2 , and strengthen CO 2 governance globally. Since 2011, the Group has also been contributing to the Livelihoods Funds, which proposes innovative investment models to simultaneously address environmental degradation, climate change, and rural poverty.\n\nThe Group aims to be a role model in the fight against climate change, by sharply decarbonizing its own operations and by delivering services and solutions that allow its customers to reduce more CO 2 emissions than those produced by the Group's activities. Ultimately Schneider aims to reduce the end-to-end emissions of its offers, by engaging suppliers and eco-designing offers for lifecycle climate and circular performance.\n\n## Short to medium-term targets\n\n- \u00b7 Before 2025, demonstrate that Schneider Electric is carbon positive together with its customers and partners, thanks to CO 2 savings delivered by EcoStruxure \u2122 .\n- \u00b7 On the Group's operations (scope 1&2): be carbon neutral by 2025 and net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2030.\n- \u00b7 On indirect emissions (scope 3) in its supply chain and with customers: reduce emissions by 35% by 2030 (vs 2017), by actively engaging suppliers to accelerate their climate strategy, by sourcing greener materials, and by proposing more efficient solutions to its customers.\n\nThe Group's 2030 targets (net-zero CO 2 emissions on scope 1 and 2, and -35% on scope 3) have been validated 1.5\u00b0C-aligned by the Science-Based Target initiative in 2019.\n\n## Long-term targets\n\n- \u00b7 Become carbon neutral on the Group's full end-to-end footprint by 2040 (scopes 1, 2 and 3), 10 years ahead of 1.5\u00b0C trajectory. This means that all Schneider's products will be carbon neutral in 2040.\n- \u00b7 Engage with suppliers towards a net-zero CO 2 supply chain by 2050.\n\nIn 2040, the Group commits that all Schneider Electric products will be carbon neutral. By connecting technology, business, and collaboration, Schneider joins the likes of global partners, such as Amazon, Infosys, and Daimler to help deliver carbon neutrality by 2040 as part of the Climate Pledge, a jointly created initiative between Global Optimism and Amazon. The Climate Pledge was founded on the conviction that global businesses are responsible and accountable for acting on the climate crisis, together. This milestone is set 10 years earlier than the pledge made in 2015 by all United Nations country members at Paris COP21, showing the Group's eagerness to accelerate the world economy decarbonization to respect the 1.5\u00b0C targets.\n\nBy 2050, achieving net-zero CO 2 emissions in its supply chain will require Schneider Electric to work transversally with all stakeholders, from product design, to sourcing, manufacturing and shipping.\n\n## 2.3.2.2 Concrete actions in our ecosystem\n\n## 2.3.2.2.1 Net-zero CO 2 emissions in operations by 2030\n\nTo deliver its Scope 1 and 2 targets, the Group has launched several transformations under the Climate and Resources pillars of Schneider Sustainability Impact:\n\n- \u00b7 Reach 150 Zero-CO 2 sites by 2025 (SSE #1),\n- \u00b7 Propose SF 6 -free alternatives for all medium voltage technologies by 2025 (SSE #2),\n- \u00b7 Source 90% of electricity from renewables by 2025 (SSE #3), and 100% by 2030,\n- \u00b7 Increase energy efficiency in our sites by 15% by 2025 (SSE #5) and double energy productivity by 2030 (vs 2005),\n- \u00b7 Shift one third of corporate vehicle fleet to electric vehicles by 2025 (SSE #7), and 100% by 2030.\n\nThe Group leverages its Power and Building EcoStruxure \u2122 IoT architectures to deliver these ambitions, monitor and optimize energy consumption, manage assets and grid infrastructure, manage distributed renewable energy resources and electricity load, monitor energy quality, and power electric vehicles. The initiatives to deliver those targets are described in section 2.3.4 Decarbonizing our operations by 2030, page 136.\n\nThis strategy has delivered an absolute reduction of 405,028 tonnes of CO 2 e emissions on Scope 1 and 2 (from 699,079 tCO 2 e in 2017), which is a 58% decrease.\n\n## 2.3.2.2.2 End-to-end carbon neutrality by 2040\n\nSchneider Electric is already taking concrete actions to engage its suppliers to decarbonize:\n\n- \u00b7 Engage 1,000 top suppliers to reduce their operational CO 2 emissions by 50% with The Zero Carbon project (SSI #3).\n- \u00b7 Reduce purchase-related CO 2 emissions with EcoDesign Way \u2122 to improve the end-to-end lifecycle environmental footprint of its offers, notably by reducing and substituting materials and components in products. The Group aims to source 50% green materials by 2025, favoring bio-sourced, recycled, and sustainable options (SSI #4).\n- \u00b7 Have 100% of its primary and secondary packaging free from single-use plastics and made from recycled cardboard (SSI #5).\n- \u00b7 Reduce CO 2 emissions from freight and logistics activities, by shifting from air to sea freight and optimizing fill rates and travel routes (SSE #4).\n- \u00b7 Reduce CO 2 emissions from waste management, with its 'Waste as Worth' program. In 2021, 126 sites achieved the 'Waste to Resources' designation as part of SSE #9.\n- \u00b7 Reduce CO 2 emissions from capital goods by optimizing real estate space occupancy as saved surfaces translate directly into lower CO 2 emissions, as well as spared natural habitats and agricultural land.\n- The initiatives to deliver those targets are described in section 2.3.5 Decarbonizing our supply chain by 2050, page 140 . \u01f0",

Scope 3 emissions represent more than 99% of the Group's carbon footprint, of which 90% are due to the use phase and the products' end of life, and around 10% result from the purchase of raw materials, equipment, and services.\n\nThe charts below represent Schneider's carbon footprint on Scopes 1, 2 and 3, including all greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), from the upstream activity of all its suppliers to the use and end of life of its offers sold to customers. During the use phase, emissions saved and avoided by customers thanks to energy efficiency and renewable technologies are represented as negative emissions.\n\nCoverage of reported emissions is 100% for energy, fugitive SF 6 emissions, waste, purchases, capital goods, commuting, travel, and freight (coverage is estimated using a relevant activity indicator for each source of emissions, such as spent for purchases and business travel, surface for energy and capital goods, headcount for commuting and waste). Schneider reports no GHG emissions on franchises, investments, or downstream-leased assets, because these emissions are not considered relevant for its activities.\n\n## 2.3.2.4 Internal CO 2 price\n\nTo lead the global transition to a zero-carbon economy, Schneider Electric calls for policymakers to define robust and predictable carbon pricing for companies, enabling companies to integrate collaterals on climate in their strategy. A high and stable price on carbon will strengthen incentives to invest in sustainable technologies and to change behaviors.\n\nAs part of its carbon pledge, Schneider is committed to take into consideration a carbon pricing of EUR 50 - 130/ton (depending on time horizons) to inform the Group's climate strategy. In line with the vision, an internal price on carbon is already used in several cases to include the cost of CO 2 externality in decision-making and strategy.\n\nAn internal CO 2 price is used to assess the performance and resiliency of operations. The cost of CO 2 is evaluated for industrial activities, taking into account CO 2 emissions from energy consumption and SF 6 leaks in industrial sites. CO 2 cost is also taken into consideration in industrial network modelling to account for future CO 2 prices in industrial decisions. This enables measurement of the potential impact of CO 2 pricing on the Group's supply chain. Schneider views internal CO 2 pricing as a useful tool to reinforce its governance and external commitments on CO 2 .\n\nSchneider Electric carbon footprint: 2017 to 2021 evolution\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Projection assuming that the -35% applies equally on all Scope 3 sources\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomers Saved & Avoided\n\nSaved & Avoided: 83.6 MtCO 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-125M",

Schneider has a dedicated Strategy Prospective & External Affairs Senior Vice-President in charge of climate and environment scenario analysis. That person is attached to the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer.\n\nSeveral scenarios to 2050 were developed in 2019. Those included critical reviews of the geopolitical landscape, commodity and resource availability, economic and financial evolutions, climate sensitivity and evolving policies, energy transition pathways, and technology developments, among others, with quantified consequences, taking into consideration 10 regions and a number of sectors individually, framing the business landscape in which Schneider operates. In 2020, these scenarios were further updated. Beyond impact for long-term analysis, the COVID-19 short-term impact assessment has also been reviewed in detail, including the importance and feasibility of climate-compatible recovery plans. Finally, in 2021, Schneider published a set of scenarios exploring the feasibility of a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nThe Group sees an acceleration of the dominant role of:\n\n- \u00b7 Electrification: the world is becoming more electric, with demand growing potentially up to 3x by 2050;\n- \u00b7 Digitization: with the increase in connectivity, complemented by real-time information and competitive computing capabilities, digital technologies play a major role in reaching decarbonization targets while augmenting economic productivity, notably around efficiency in energy and resource use and circularity, as well as increased resiliency and security.\n\nAll these findings, and their potential financial impact on our business have helped us fine-tune key development areas that will allow us to actively contribute to the low-carbon transition, enabling us notably to develop our sustainability portfolio of offers.\n\nKey findings are regularly cross-checked with new publications, particularly the ones from the International Energy Agency, BNEF, and the IRENA, among others. Governance is in place, under the leadership of the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, and both short- and long-term analysis are shared internally and used to inform strategic priorities across businesses and operations.\n\nThe scenarios developed by Schneider demonstrate that a net-zero carbon future, aligned with IPCC's 1.5\u00b0C scenarios, is still possible, and the Group is uniquely positioned to embark its ecosystem onto an inclusive, zero-carbon transition. The Group sees the energy and climate transition as an opportunity for companies who are 'part of the solution' to grow their revenues. Schneider Electric's Energy Management and Industrial Automation offers help customers deliver energy and resource efficiency and reduce CO 2 emissions. Furthermore, smart grid technologies unlock the potential to electrify energy usage, powered by renewable electricity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

To demonstrate this positive impact, a new indicator was launched in 2018 to quantify CO 2 savings delivered to customers using Schneider's offers. New technologies were added to expand the methodology coverage in 2021: SF 6 recovery services, SF 6 AirSet solutions, Field Services, Energy Management Systems (EMS for electrical network) and data center design. Overall, from 2018 to 2021, Schneider Electric helped customers save and avoid 347 million tonnes of CO 2 e.\n\nFrom 2021 onwards, Schneider is committed to extend the methodology to progressively include all relevant offers, to report both saved and avoided CO 2 emissions with customers and partners, and to help customers save and avoid 800 million tonnes of CO 2 by 2025, cumulatively since 2018 (SSI #2). This commitment is one of the three performance indicators of the first ever convertible Sustainability-Linked Bond launched by the Group at the end of 2020.\n\nThe innovative CO 2 accounting methodology to quantify CO 2 savings delivered to customers, created by Schneider, allows for the quantification of CO 2 induced and saved by the Group's solutions at its customers' premises. Detailed calculation rules are defined per offer, leveraging sales data, market expertise, and technical knowledge. The methodology is designed to become a shared industry standard, its principles are applicable across the capital goods and consumer durables sectors. Attention was given to define rigorous calculations, with conservative assumptions. The methodology is public and was developed with Carbone 4, an expert CO 2 accounting consulting company.\n\nSaved emissions are net emissions (savings are netted from use-phase induced emissions) and consider savings delivered on brownfield (retrofit) projects. Avoided emissions are defined with respect to greenfield sales (new infrastructures); they are defined as a limitation of emissions increase versus a reference scenario. Avoided emissions are net emissions. They represent the difference between emissions of a reference scenario and emissions with the implementation of Schneider Electric's offer.\n\nSchneider's methodology, 'Saved and avoided CO 2 : decarbonization creates value' is available for download on se.com; as well as the detailed methodology (and hypothesis) for all Schneider's solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.3.2 Deliver access to energy products and solutions\n\nToday, 25% of the world's population still has no or reduced access to energy, and only 17% of the total global energy consumption was renewable in 2017. Schneider Electric's products and solutions aim to address this 'energy paradox', balancing the need to reduce the planet's carbon footprint while ensuring the inalienable human right to quality energy and digital access.\n\nIn line with its carbon pledge towards net-zero CO 2 emissions, Schneider has committed to provide access to green electricity to 100 million people in underserved areas by 2030, both as a fundamental right and a means for social and economic development. Schneider's Access to Energy program bridges the energy gap by focusing on offerings and business models for village electrification and domestic energy needs, as well as investing in and supporting companies providing affordable, clean, and renewable energy.\n\nProducts and solutions address individual and collective needs across the energy chain, from solar lanterns and solar home systems to decentralized small power plants, water pumping systems, and street lighting. A great example of Schneider's products is the portable Mobiya solar powered lamp providing individual lighting and mobile charge for 48 hours. In emerging markets, this type of device helps extend the number of hours of activities and livelihoods, but also limits the use of kerosene lamps that have a significant environmental impact. Villaya is another great example of decarbonized energy solutions available for businesses and communities to ensure electrification in remote sites, either 100% solar or hybrid.\n\nAll of these social impact products and solutions complement the Group's offerings for its customers to be the digital partner for sustainability and efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its building management is operated by EcoStruxure \u2122 Building Operation (EBO). Energy consumptions are optimized thanks to EcoStruxure \u2122 Power Monitoring Expert (PME). Finally, IntenCity produces its own green and microgrid connected energy, managed by EcoStruxure \u2122 Microgrid Advisor (EMA).\n\nIntenCity is equipped with a heating and cooling system made of two thermorefrigerating pumps which enable the building to efficiently serve its very low power needs. The rooftops are covered with 4,000 square meters of solar panels complemented by two vertical wind turbines and backed by 300 kWh of battery storage capacity. Thanks to these energy production and storage systems, the full 970 kWh required to operate the building on an annual basis can be entirely compensated by its on-site green energy production.\n\nThe combination of those technologies enables IntenCity to drop its energy needs in operation to a staggeringly low level of 37 kWh/ sqm/year, and, according to the WGBC definition, to be net-zero carbon emission right from its commissioning date. IntenCity is currently in the process of gaining LEED Platinum certification with the ambition to achieve a score of 100/110, making it the most efficient and sustainable building in the world.\n\nSolar and wind-powered roof at IntenCity facility in Grenoble, France\n\n<!-- image -->",

EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor provides a data visualization and analysis application that aggregates volumes of raw energy data into actionable information. EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor is a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) model, it provides reduced solution costs, increased data storage capacity, and a flexible and mobile energy solution enhanced by Schneider Electric expert services.\n\nThe Group is a member of EP100 (Energy Productivity 100), a Climate Group initiative. Its target is to double energy productivity by 2030 against the 2005 baseline, meaning double the economic output from every unit of energy consumed within 25 years. In 2021, the Group achieved 76% energy productivity (against a 2030 target of 100%) compared against 2005.\n\nIn general, Schneider sites are low consumers of energy compared with other industries because industrial processes are discrete and assembled. The Schneider Energy Action program uses site energy experts along with Schneider's Sustainability Business consulting team to report and analyze energy consumption, to identify energy saving opportunities, and to deploy actions. Since 2005, the Group has fixed annual objectives for energy efficiency each year. Schneider met or exceeded its energy efficiency goals during the previous four Company programs (2009-2011, 20122014, 2015-2017, and 2018-2020), by achieving 10%, 13%, 10%, and 10%, respectively, totaling over 40% reduction from 2009 to 2021.\n\nThe 2021-2025 Company program aims to reduce energy consumption by a further 15% over five years compared to 2019 (SSE #5).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 15% energy efficiency in our sites\n\nThe Group measures energy efficiency in its 200+ largest energy-consuming sites, accounting for 85% of the total energy consumption of the Group. At the end of 2021, this program enabled the following achievements:\n\n- \u00b7 About EUR 5 million and 65 million kWh were saved in 2021 compared to 2019 baseline.\n- \u00b7 About EUR 5.2 million was invested, of which EUR 5 million was capital costs and EUR 0.2 million was operating costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nAnnual energy productivity progress against 2030 EP100 target (vs 2005)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnnual progress\n\nTarget\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.4.2 RE100: switch to 100% renewable electricity by 2030\n\nIn 2017, Schneider Electric joined RE100 and committed to source 100% of its electricity from renewables by 2030, with an intermediary target of 90% by 2025. In 2021, the Group sourced 82% of its electricity from renewable sources, up from a starting point of 2% in 2017. To deliver its target, the Group leverages four complementary tools: green tariffs, renewable certificates, power purchase agreements, and on-site generation.\n\nThis commitment entails many benefits. First and foremost, going green is deeply aligned with the Group's strategy. Schneider wants to be one of the corporate players who shape the future energy landscape, having its own sites producing and consuming renewable electricity. Second, renewable sourcing is an important pillar to drastically cut down CO 2 emissions from the Group's operations, following a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory in line with Science-Based Targets. Third, because it makes good business sense. In a lot of cases, renewable supply enables savings on electricity costs. It is also a way of diversifying energy supply risks and reduces exposure to the volatility of market prices. Also, in some developing countries, microgrid technologies coupled with renewables can enable the securing of power supply and reduce downtime risks. Fourth, because the Group wants to demonstrate the value add of its own technologies and solutions, by showcasing EcoStruxure \u2122 Microgrid IoT architecture on its own sites. Sites leverage Schneider Electric's connected inverters, Molded Case Circuit Breakers (MCCB), and transformers to connect on-site solar panels to the grid and use the energy and microgrid software to manage energy production and consumption. Schneider also leverages the expertise of the Sustainability Business consulting teams to deliver this transformation.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "## 2.3.4.4 Zero-CO 2 Sites\n\nThe path towards net-zero CO 2 emissions in operations by 2030 will require more than just renewable electricity. While many applications can be electrified, some applications do not, and may not in the near future, have electricity-based alternatives. As such, Schneider Electric has begun identifying applications on sites that currently have electrification alternatives as well as those which will require the use of fossil-free fuel solutions.\n\nThis effort has resulted in the Group newly embarking on its journey towards Zero-CO 2 Sites. The ambition is to source 150 sites with fossil-free energy (e.g., renewable electricity, biofuels) by 2025. But it's not enough to just use renewable energy; it remains critical to maintain energy efficiency. That's why the program also requires digital energy monitoring. For large sites in particular, this means installing connected meters on the site's significant energy uses and connecting them to systems like EcoStruxure \u2122 Power Monitoring Expert, EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor, or EcoStruxure \u2122 Building Operation to ensure real-time monitoring of energy which allows for active energy management and efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.4.5 Reduction of SF 6 emissions\n\nSF 6 gas has excellent insulating properties which have historically helped ensure the safety and quality of certain Schneider Electric products. However, SF 6 gas has a Global Warming Potential (GWP) 25,200 times higher than CO 2 , making it one of the highest GWP gasses. As such, Schneider is innovating its offers to move away from SF 6 gas (SSE #2: 100% substitution with SF 6 -Free medium voltage technologies by 2025). In 2021 the promises from Schneider to deliver new SF 6 -free medium voltage switchgear became a reality with the installation of innovative products on several customer sites. 2021 was the year of the industrialization of several new product lines, free of SF 6 , to prepare the full commercial launch of this new generation of products.\n\nIn the interim, all Schneider manufacturing plants and R&D laboratories handling SF 6 gas in their processes are actively reducing, as much as possible, SF 6 leaks and emissions during the different phases of their activities. A worldwide community of SF 6 experts are sharing best practices for processes, including procedures, equipment, and training.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nIn 2021 our advanced Emission Monitoring System was improved to become more digital, with centralized monitoring, but also more robust to any potential failure mode. This new kind of system will be deployed in 2022 on the biggest manufacturing site of the Group.\n\nThis technology allows for continuous measurement of SF 6 concentration in enclosures around devices and piping networks. In the event of any deviations, an alarm notification is automatically sent to maintenance teams. Additionally, the seal testing processes of the products are mainly done with helium instead of SF 6 . This method ensures that no emissions are coming from non-compliant enclosures during the production time.\n\nThanks to this global activity and to the commissioning of efficient equipment, Schneider has exceeded the 0.19% target set for 2021. The Group achieved 0.1% leakage rate globally in 2021, systematically decreasing from 4% in 2008. This SF 6 leakage reduction enabled savings of 11,400 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent in 2021 versus 2017.\n\n## Annual SF 6 leakage rate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 100% substitution with SF 6 -free medium voltage technologies\n\nMilan is in the process of powering a fleet of 1,200 eBuses not only with clean energy, but also with green power infrastructure.\n\nThe innovative SM AirSeT \u2122 MV switchgear, free of greenhouse gases, are deployed in Milan depots' charging infrastructure for its bus fleet, to be 100% electric by 2030.

Schneider Electric is committed to engaging its suppliers towards net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2050, and is already taking concrete action, through its Zero Carbon Project for the next 5 years.\n\nAchieving carbon neutrality in the Group's value chain will require Schneider to work transversally with all stakeholders, from product design, through sourcing and manufacturing, to shipping.\n\n## 2.3.5.1 The Zero Carbon Project\n\nThe Zero Carbon Project (TZCP) is the first step of this journey to galvanize the upstream supply chain and take coordinated actions to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from Schneider's suppliers.\n\nSchneider Electric's Executive leadership launched the initiative in April 2021, on the occasion of an all-digital global event, attended by the leadership of key supplier partners.\n\nThe ambition of TZCP is to collaborate with 1,000 suppliers and reduce their operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2025 (SSI #3).\n\nThe fundamental tenets of TZCP include:\n\n- \u00b7 Quantifying GHG emissions;\n- \u00b7 Targeting ambitious emission reductions;\n- \u00b7 Implementing an action plan to achieve the targets.\n\nThe participating suppliers will be required to make public commitments for their reduction targets and share the emission reduction progress with Schneider. The participating companies cover more than 60 procurement categories from various regions, and vary in terms of carbon maturity and size. To adapt to this diversity, the participating suppliers are allowed a certain flexibility to customize their reduction plans by defining their own base year and baseline and adopt adequate reduction targets and time frames.\n\nSo far, more than 1,000 suppliers have committed to participate in the program. An initial survey with those suppliers showed that more than 70% of them have not yet quantified their GHG emissions, so an important part of the journey will be for them to develop a robust GHG accounting tool.\n\n## Partnership and collaboration\n\nPartnership and collaboration are at the heart of The Zero Carbon Project. Over the past years, Schneider has implemented several decarbonization measures and successfully reduced its own operational GHG emissions by more than 50%. To ensure that Schneider's partners benefit from this experience and get a headstart in the journey, the Group conducted eight technical training sessions, spanning over 30 hours, for suppliers and partners across timezones and language proficiencies. Those sessions detailed the actions implemented at various Schneider locations, with leading decarbonization technologies and solutions, methodology for GHG footprint calculation, and case studies of successful implementation at other companies. Over 1,300 suppliers attended the sessions.\n\nTo ensure constant engagement with these partners, The Zero Carbon Project Forum Community Calls have been initiated on a monthly basis. Those calls provide a platform, a safe space, for experience sharing and brainstorming on decarbonization-related experiences shared by the suppliers, so that all parties can learn from collective intelligence.\n\nAs a support to those who are new to the decarbonization topic, 9 handholding sessions, in English and Mandarin were organized on the GHG footprint methodology in December 2021.\n\nAdditionally, to provide specific handholding during the quantification of GHG emissions, Quick Response Teams were constituted to clarify and support supplier actions at regional level.\n\nIn addition to the 'one-to-one' support extended to the suppliers, a dedicated web portal has been deployed. This web portal provides single-window access to all thought leadership, research, trainings, case studies, decarbonization levers, and tools for quantification of GHG emissions and decarbonization.\n\n## Calculating GHG emission reductions\n\nAs a result of the engagement described earlier and outreach, the suppliers are starting to focus on setting up strong governance within their organizations, which will help navigate their decarbonization journey in the years to come.\n\nThe GHG emission reduction reported in Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) #3, is measured as the average carbon intensity reduction of reporting suppliers, multiplied by the proportion of reporting companies among the 1,000 committed suppliers. This normalization is done to give a more adequate picture of the overall progress of all participating suppliers.\n\nThe initial efforts so far have resulted in about 1% reduction of the GHG for 1,000 suppliers, and Schneider remains committed to working together with its partners to strengthen their efforts for stronger decarbonization. The Group will continue to record its suppliers' GHG declarations on an annual basis to ensure the most accurate and updated information is available for reporting performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The related CO 2 emissions are part of the scope 3 emissions of the Group's carbon footprint, as this activity is performed by transport suppliers. From 2015 to 2017, CO 2 emissions intensity from transportation was reduced by 10%. The 2018-2020 Company program aimed to further reduce CO 2 intensity in transportation by 10% in 2020 compared to 2017. By the end of 2020, performance compared to 2017 regarding transport-related CO 2 emissions had decreased by 8.4%.\n\nWith Schneider Sustainability Essentials 2021-2025, the Group aims to further reduce CO 2 intensity in transportation by 15% compared to 2020, or a 3% reduction year on year (SSE #4).\n\nFor 2021, unprecedented shortage in materials and components sourcing, coupled with lower reliability and availability of transportation means, led to an absolute CO 2 emissions increase in freight paid by the Group of 24% (compared to 2020), yet a 1% increase in CO 2 intensity only.\n\nBuilding on the work done in prior years, Schneider will be further enhancing its CO 2 reporting capability in 2022 to not only report on freight CO 2 footprint but to facilitate engagement with transport suppliers on continuous improvement.\n\nCollaborative engagement with the Group's transportation suppliers will continue, focusing on the pillars of optimizing existing transport footprint, as well as supporting and piloting advanced low carbon transportation technologies across all transport modes air, sea and road freight.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nSome evidence of Schneider initiatives to mitigate the impact of transport-related CO 2 emissions include:\n\n- \u00b7 Implementation of container freight stations (CFS) in Schneider's sea shipping network to allow for origin consolidation and destination deconsolidation of ocean containers resulting in a reduction of the number of containers shipped.\n- \u00b7 Implementation in various South American countries of final customer delivery utilizing electric vehicles and bicycles. Additionally, piloting rail shipments from the regional ports to Schneider's facilities.\n- \u00b7 In North America, a strong focus on our trucking asset utilization with the implementation of multi-deck trailers on the MexicoUSA lane, significantly increasing fill-rate and reducing the number of trips required.\n- \u00b7 Exploring the use of smaller, faster, zero carbon sea transport options to connect our shorter, high-frequency lanes to potentially replace air freight and reduce traditional sea shipments.\n\n## 2.3.5.3 Green materials\n\nPurchases are responsible for the largest share of Schneider Electric upstream Scope 3 CO 2 emissions. Schneider has committed to increase green materials in products to 50% by 2025, and tracks progress quarterly under Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI #4). While this program does not focus on CO 2 only, but also mitigates other environmental impacts such as resources, biodiversity or toxicity, this initiative will contribute to reduce the Group's Scope 3 supply chain emissions, in line with its 1.5\u00b0C carbon pledge. To achieve this ambition, Schneider will participate actively with industry leaders in dedicated working groups to become a change agent of the low-carbon economy while enhancing the traceability of materials. At the end of 2021, 11% of materials in scope where qualified as 'Green'.\n\n- Read more details on the Green materials and sustainable packaging programs in chapter 2.4 'Being efficient with Resources', page 144 , and in chapter 2.7 'Methodology and audit of indicators' page 206 . \u01f0\n\n2.",

Today, recovery services are available in France and 10 other countries; the customer support is under development to propose a model adapted to the different markets in different countries all over the world.\n\nThe ambition is to offer recovery services to any SF 6 Schneider legacy by 2025.\n\nThe recovery service allows Schneider's customers to dispose correctly of their machinery, against a green disposal certificate, thus granting them peace of mind. The service consists in collecting the equipment and, together with our partners, dismantle and reuse, recycle or dispose of all the components (such as metals or thermoplastics) appropriately. Specifically, SF 6 is extracted from machines and sent to a specialist company for regeneration and destruction.\n\n## 2.3.5.5 Green information technology (IT)\n\nConsidering digital acceleration increases the utilization of IT services, a challenge arises to decouple rising demand from environmental degradation. Bearing that in mind, Schneider Digital's Green IT initiative prioritizes measuring and optimizing the environmental footprint of Schneider Electric's information systems.\n\nAn action plan has been implemented to optimize the environmental footprint of the various components of IT.\n\nThe Group IT Asset Management (ITAM) Policy and standards have been updated with a strong focus on standardization, sustainability, and circular economy enablement, creating a holistic approach to sustainability throughout the entire lifecycle of IT assets.\n\nThe consolidation and adjustment of the personal computer (PC) replacement lifecycle allowed Schneider to reduce its yearly PC carbon footprint by more than 15%.\n\nCarbon footprint reduction is an integrated requirement for the IT vendor selection processes. Consequently, new PCs are up to 40% more energy efficient and have a 50% lower carbon footprint than the corresponding end-of-life equipment to be replaced. Shifting demand to standardized PC models has resulted in an estimated 1,000 tonnes of avoided CO 2 /year in 2020. Setting ultra-small form factors as the default PC choice has also resulted in further CO 2 avoidance of more than 1,500 tonnes per year.\n\nAdditionally, upholding the Group's IT vendors to sustainability requirements, the annual 2021 CO 2 emission avoidance reached the level of 1,300 tCO 2 and 180 MWh of energy consumption.\n\nIT asset disposal is especially important from a sustainability and circular economy perspective. Therefore, the IT Asset Disposal approach has been designed taking into account sustainability and circular economy principles ensuring that Schneider Electric gives preference to Responsible Recycling (R2) or e-Steward compliant IT Asset Disposal vendors.\n\nBy using leasing services (mainly in Europe and North America), donations, and offering an Employee Purchase Scheme (mainly in Asia Pacific and China) a second life is made possible for retired PCs. Refurbishing IT devices to give them a second life can extend their lifespan by several years. Extended lifespan implies a decrease of the weighted yearly carbon footprint by over 50% through the amortization of embedded CO 2 emissions over time.\n\nA pilot was carried out in 2021 supporting green search engine practices. In one month, the Group financed the planting of approximately 387 trees. This not only aids in reversing biodiversity loss, but also contributes to carbon sequestration absorbing anthropogenic emissions as well.\n\nDuring the year 2020, Schneider developed and introduced a framework based on a data-driven approach to track sustainability KPIs for End User Group devices. In 2021, the Group framework was deployed to track sustainability KPIs with regards to IT onpremise infrastructures. In 2022, the aim is to enable the tracking of sustainability KPIs for cloud-based infrastructures as well.\n\nEmployee education on Green IT best practices was introduced in 2021, thus driving efficiency not only from the top-down but from the bottom-up as well. This was hosted through events such as Schneider Digital Open Days.\n\nOptimization of the Group data center footprint is achieved via its sustainable-first hybrid IT strategy. This was performed using two levers in 2021: the rationalization of on-premise servers and the move towards cloud. This switch has continued, partnering with providers who have made commitments in terms of sustainability and carbon neutrality. Thanks to that particular effort, the Company cloud infrastructure footprint increased by 25% in 2021, and over 80% of its server infrastructure has been virtualized. In addition to that, on-site servers were rationalized, thus saving about 1,300 tonnes of CO 2 in 2021.\n\nSchneider Electric has been utilizing Business Cloud Storage from a vendor which uses data centers that have achieved or have committed to achieve 100% renewable energy targets, therefore reducing its carbon footprint. In 2022, the aim is to migrate to a new solution which, through a data optimization approach, will allow a reduction of up to 40% of the size of used cloud storage data, thus further reducing corresponding carbon footprint emissions.",

In 2021, 'Earth Overshoot Day' fell on July 29, meaning that humanity consumes its natural capital budget of the year.\n\nThe decline recorded last year has been caught up due to an economic rebound with respect to 2020. Humanity's common goal is clear: push back the date of overshoot to December 31 and beyond to live within the limits of our one planet. Only by working hand-in-hand will businesses, finance, and governments be able to drive global systemic and transformative change, thus unlocking new opportunities and allowing everyone to live sustainably on a healthy planet.\n\nSchneider Electric's long-term commitment is to be efficient with resources, by protecting and restoring biodiversity and innovating towards circular business models.\n\nOn biodiversity, Schneider Electric is committed to fast-track the adoption of ambitious biodiversity strategies, leveraging best practices from climate Science-Based Targets: measuring impacts and aligning targets with science.\n\nWith Schneider Sustainabilty Impact and its concrete programs, the Group innovates towards a more circular economy, in industrial processes, product design, and business model innovation.",

Major biodiversity loss undermines nature's ability to support people and communities, a factor which strongly improves both quality of life and business prosperity. The fight against nature loss should be a business priority: nature is essential to global economic prosperity and individual business success.\n\nA sustainable future for people and economies will be possible if nature, climate, and people are addressed in an integrated way. Indeed, climate change is among the main drivers of biodiversity loss, and yet nature is part of the climate solutions. To engage in a transformative change, clear and measurable international targets, meaning counterparts to both the 1.5\u00b0C - 2\u00b0C increase climate limit and its associated carbon budget, must be defined. Schneider Electric supports the creation of ambitious biodiversity targets during the COP15 for Biodiversity.\n\nSchneider Electric calls for all companies to fast-track the adoption of ambitious biodiversity strategies, leveraging best practices from climate Science-Based Targets. In a joint effort with Marc Abadie, Chairman of CDC Biodiversit\u00e9 and Eva Zabey, CEO of Business for Nature, Schneider invites all companies to 'raise corporate biodiversity ambition and aim at no net loss'.\n\nIn addition to improving resource efficiency, it is also necessary in order to live within the limits of our planet to transform industrial processes and business models to move towards a circular economy. Circular economy is an obsession to avoid wastage and to reuse, repair, retrofit or recycle materials, maximizing environmental and financial value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA circular mindset also triggers process innovations and opens the door to new business models, enhancing customer intimacy and thus loyalty (e.g. take-back and modernization services). High hopes are placed on circularity as a state of mind, as it can transform multiple industries for the better.\n\nFrom a risk standpoint, some challenges may arise from a lack of stringent regulations or uncontrolled practices if used products come back into the loop without adequate controls and expertise, especially regarding life-critical products and electrical safety.\n\nSchneider Electric embraces circular principles all along the lifecycle of products and offers. The keystone of circularity is EcoDesignWay \u2122 , a process that is applied to the development of all new products. EcoDesignWay \u2122 enables the right trade-offs between the environmental impact along the lifecycle of products, allowing to coordinate the efforts over the whole value chain.\n\n## Product innovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Process innovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business model innovation\n\nOver the lifecycle of offers, Schneider commits to innovate with circular business models and services:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Support customers to optimise asset lifecycle management for increased durability and efficiency, with Asset Performance Management (APM) services\n- \u00b7 Give a second life to products (unsold or obsolete stock, commercial returns), with the 'circular certified' label launched in France in 2020\n- \u00b7 For specific product ranges such as products containing SF 6 , offer take-back and endof-life management services. The Group is committed to avoid 420,000 metric tons of primary resource consumption through 'take-back at end-of-use' from 2017 to 2025\n\nOn product design, Schneider has committed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Phase-out potentially harmful substances and provide transparent information on environmental performance of products\n- \u00b7 Design with a circular mindset with Green Premium \u2122 , for increased durability, repairability and recyclability\n- \u00b7 Provide public and transparent information for the proper dismantling and end-of-life management of products\n- \u00b7 Increase green material content in products to 50%\n- \u00b7 100% of its primary and secondary packaging is free from single-use plastic and uses recycled cardboard\n\nIn the manufacturing phase, the Group applies circularity principles in its operations and with customers:\n\n- \u00b7 Have 200 'Waste-to-Resource' sites by 2025 to optimise waste generation and recycling on the Group's sites\n- \u00b7 EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions help customers improve resource efficiency in industrial processes",

        "page_content": "In the image below, an overview of circular initiatives at Schneider Electric, over the whole value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.1.1 Governance\n\nAt Schneider Electric, environmental considerations are integrated in the Group's strategy, R&D, manufacturing, procurement, finance, human resources, transportation, sales, marketing, services, and the way value propositions to customers are spelt out. To deliver ambitions, environmental transformations are driven by a global network of over 600 managers and experts responsible for the environmental management of sites, countries, product design, and marketing. The network of leaders driving environmental transformations consists of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 For the design and development of new offers: Sustainable Offers Managers and leaders in each business are in charge of integrating key environmental considerations into the development of new products and producing expected environmental information for customers.\n- \u00b7 For the management of industrial, logistics, and large tertiary sites: Safety, Environment, and Real Estate VicePresidents are nominated in each region, with dedicated teams. They are responsible for implementing the Group's policies across all sites in their geographical remit. In each region, directors coordinate teams across a group of sites (clusters), as well as on site.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nThese environmental and safety leaders are in charge of reporting on performance as well as executing environmental progress plans in the field.\n\n- \u00b7 For logistics: the Logistics Senior Vice-President and his/ her teams within the Global Supply Chain department are in charge of reducing and measuring CO 2 emissions from freight at Group level.\n- \u00b7 For countries and commercial entities: environment and safety champions are appointed in each country and are responsible for local reporting actions where necessary; monitoring regulations, taxes, and national opportunities as applicable (e.g., national transcriptions of the WEEE in relation to end-of-life product management, and monitoring national substance regulation such as RoHS China); the proactive management of local environmental initiatives; and relations with local stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Edison experts: a process recognizes individuals who have a specific expertise that the Group is eager to maintain and grow. There are 10 specific domains in which Edisons are identified, one of them being environment. Each year, an environment Edison is expected to dedicate 10% to 20% of his/her time to lead a global initiative related to his/her expertise, such as the development of an e-learning course, a new standard, or an innovation.\n\nVarious governance bodies enable those communities to meet every month or quarter to ensure consistent adoption of environmental policies and standards throughout the Group. This network has access to a wide range of resources including standards, policies, best practices, benchmarks, and guidelines, all of which are shared on the dedicated intranet site and databases.\n\nEnvironmental performance is reported and discussed during leadership meetings of concerned entities, including Global Supply Chain leadership meetings, Sustainable Innovation Taskforce with business units, the Board Audit & Risks Committee, Board of Directors, Executive Committee, Human Resources & CSR Committee, and Group Sustainability Committee.\n\nTo educate all employees on sustainability, an Essential Sustainability e-learning training was rolled-out in 2021, including a presentation of the Group's carbon pledge and the roadmap for execution. In addition, various e-learning modules have been developed on topics such as climate and biodiversity. Additionally, an environment intranet site is accessible to all employees, informing them about the ongoing programs, best practices, results, goals, and upcoming deadlines.\n\nIn 2019, Schneider Electric launched a company-wide initiative named Act for Green whereby each of its employees can share their suggestions on how the Group can 'Green' its operations. In 2020, thanks to the suggestions of many employees, the #stopsingleuseplastic initiative to ban the single use of plastics was launched and integrated in 2021 as part of a biodiversity for sites program (SSE #8). Communities of passionate ambassadors facilitate e-learning and workshops (such as Climate Fresk) to increase awareness on climate change.\n\nOn June 5, 2021, on United Nations World Environment Day, as it has been the case for each year over the last eight years, Schneider organized its annual 'Global Environment Day' event involving tens of thousands of Group employees, inviting them to celebrate and to share innovations in the areas of climate and the circular economy, both internally to the Group and externally, in association with local communities. That year, a special focus was made on the importance of the ecosystem restoration.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\n## 2.4 Being efficient with Resources\n\n## 2.4.1.2 Biodiversity footprint\n\nTo drive change, companies need quantitative metrics to estimate, monitor, and pilot the impacts of their activities on biodiversity loss or demonstrate their contribution to biodiversity restoration. Creating aggregated and standardized biodiversity metrics and protocols is a much-needed step to ensure nature is truly placed at the heart of the business strategy.\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric was the first company to publish the end-to-end biodiversity footprint of its activities, using the 'Global Biodiversity Score' (GBS) tool developed by CDC Biodiversit\u00e9. By sharing its experience with other companies and choosing to publish results transparently, the Group aims to demonstrate that measuring biodiversity footprints is a key first step to help companies define relevant and impactful biodiversity strategies, across their entire value chain.\n\nThe GBS gives detailed and modular results which can be split by input line (for example, by raw materials such as metal, plastic, or timber); by pressures on biodiversity (such as land use, climate change, fragmentation, or encroachment); or it can be presented by scopes in Mean Species Abundance per square kilometer (MSA.km\u00b2) like a carbon footprint. The end-to-end assessment allowed Schneider to identify hotspots around which it is most effective to develop a biodiversity strategy and actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe bar chart below illustrates Schneider Electric's dynamic terrestrial impact, with detail by pressure. The pie chart highlights the weight of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which represent almost 70% of Schneider Electric's pressure on biodiversity. Land use accounts for almost 30% of 'cradle-to-gate' impacts.\n\n## Schneider Electric's biodiversity industrial footprint (in MSA.km\u00b2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cradle to gate terrestrial dynamic pressures on biodiversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe biodiversity footprint results are expressed in MSA.km\u00b2, a metric that has all the ingredients it needs to become the international standard: synthetic, easy to understand, and widely applicable. In 2018, the world average terrestrial MSA was only 66%, meaning that a significant part of the species abundance of ecosystem integrity has already been lost. Under a businessas-usual scenario, this number would fall below 60% MSA by 2050. That is far beyond the safe operating zone that respects the planetary boundary, which is estimated at 70% MSA (CDC Biodiversit\u00e9). Such a high biodiversity loss undermines nature's ability to provide its contribution to people, which is vital for human existence and a good quality of life.\n\n## 2.4.1.3 Taking action towards no net biodiversity loss\n\nClimate change is one of the major pressures on biodiversity globally and is the main Group's biodiversity impact. Therefore, Schneider's carbon pledge will have a significant impact on reducing the Group's pressure on biodiversity. Five main levers of actions have been identified and will be addressed through specific actions.\n\n## Quantify and regularly publish the assessment of impacts on biodiversity (MSA. km\u00b2)\n\nAs per the first step of the Group's main commitments, the ambition will be validated thanks to the results of the Biodiversity Footprint Assessment performed with the Global Biodiversity Score (GBS). Consequently, the Group is committed to updating it regularly.\n\n## Commit to reduce our impacts and align biodiversity objectives with science\n\nSchneider Electric recognizes the importance of nature and biodiversity for humankind to thrive; we are all dependent on natural resources and ecosystem services. The Group's purpose is to empower all to make the most of our energy and resources, bridging progress and sustainability for all. That is why, in 2021, Schneider stepped up its ambition and publicly committed, through act4nature international, to achieving no net biodiversity loss in its direct operations by 2030 (Scope 1) and to aligning with the recommendations of international bodies (Convention on Biological Diversity by the Science Based Targets Network).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Its EcoStruxure \u2122 technologies leverage digital solutions to conserve energy, water, and resources, reduce climate change pressure, optimize land usage, and build transparency, traceability, and circularity in value chains. The Group also contributes to the access to green electricity for millions of people each year thereby mitigating further climate change while providing economic opportunities to those people.\n\n## Engage and transform the value chain\n\nThe second largest share of the Group's biodiversity footprint lies in its upstream supply chain, mainly due to GHG emissions and land usage (due to wood and metal sourcing). The Group aspires to engage and transform its value chain and to source greener materials, which will require innovations both in terms of supply chain traceability and product design. Schneider Electric calls for the creation of raw material traceability and certification schemes to provide information all along the value chain as it is one of the most pressing issue to solve in order to engage in a more virtuous procurement practice.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Act locally, engaging employees and partners\n\nSchneider is engaged to act locally to preserve and restore biodiversity by joining forces with other stakeholders through coalitions and partnerships. Its Foundation also supports NGOs that raise the awareness of the public on nature protection (Global Footprint Network, WWF, etc.) and act for nature restoration with partnerships such as Livelihoods Funds. By 2025, Schneider is engaged towards 100% of sites with a local biodiversity conservation and restoration program (SSE #8), on top of water conservation plans for sites in water-stressed areas (SSE #11). To support the efforts at site level, a multi-site analysis has been performed with IBAT (Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool). IBAT integrates different biodiversity databases (such as Protected Areas, Key Biodiversity Areas, and IUCN Red List species) and enables a site level analysis within a buffer of 1 km. The top 30 sites, as per risk and exposure, have been selected to perform a deeper analysis called STAR (Species Threat Abatement and Restoration metric), to quantify the contribution of operating at specific locations and to reduce the threat of species extinction risk.\n\nAlong its journey, Schneider Electric will continue to leverage its partnerships with external organizations such as CDC Biodiversit\u00e9, Livelihoods Funds, and many of the VolunteerIn initiatives.\n\n- Read more about Livelihoods Funds on page 195. \u01f0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

For instance, the release of hazardous substances can be harmful for fauna, flora, and human health. It can also disrupt continuity of operations and tarnish reputation. In addition, with 183 factories and 94 distribution centers in our Global Supply Chain organization, spread across dozens of countries and different national environmental regulatory frameworks, risks of non-compliance exist. These risks include for instance effluent management, handling of waste, or greenhouse gases related expectations.\n\nA proactive approach towards site and property environmental risks and environmental compliance helps preserve the continuity of operations, reduce reputational and legal risks, and avoid expensive remediation steps. When Schneider runs projects for customers, its superior execution ability on environmental matters may trigger preference from its customers and give the Group an edge over the competition.\n\nResource and energy efficiency delivers not only financial savings, but also limits the Group's exposure to commodity-price volatility and shortage risks. The risk extends to the reliability of the energy on which a facility relies to maintain production. The Group's CO 2 emissions contribute to climate change and may also incur additional costs as carbon taxes become implemented worldwide. Facilities and industrial assets themselves are also at risk of acute and chronic climate events which can disrupt the supply chain and endanger lives.\n\nBy using lean and clean eco-efficient operations, Schneider can outperform competitors and mitigate risks. The Group believes environmental performance is a powerful tool to innovate towards a more efficient and resilient supply chain and generate bottom-line savings. By using its own EcoStruxure \u2122 architecture to achieve this ambition, the Group also showcases carbon efficient architectures to its customers.\n\n## Schneider Electric 2025 sustainable supply chain ambitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPreserve life and act responsibly\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAct for a climate positive world\n\nBe efficient with resources\n\n- 0 fatal and serious accident\n\n100% of applicable sites certified with ISO 14001, ISO 50001 and ISO 45001\n\n150 Zero-CO 2 sites\n\n90% of electricity comes from renewable sources\n\n100% of sites deliver energy savings, with EcoStruxure \u2122 Power and EcoStruxure \u2122 Resource Advisor\n\nTop 1,000 suppliers reduce operational CO 2 emissions by 50%\n\n15% CO 2 efficiency in transportation\n\n200 'Waste-to-Resource' sites\n\n100% of packaging is free from single-use plastic and uses recycled cardboard\n\n100% sites with Circular supply chain innovations\n\n100% sites with local biodiversity preservation programs & water efficiency\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.2.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric continuously works towards a greener supply chain to protect the environment, decouple its activity from the consumption of natural resources, and innovate to build a more circular supply chain.

Environmental regulatory compliance, environmental management systems, and continuous improvement are the foundation of the Group's environmental risk management and prevention program for current, former, and prospective operations.\n\nKey ongoing initiatives include:\n\n- \u00b7 The Integrated Management System (IMS) covers the Group's plants, distribution centers, and large offices, and hosts ISO 14001, ISO 50001, ISO 9001, and OHSAS 18000/ISO 45001 compliance management systems. Each site is audited periodically, either externally by Bureau Veritas (every three years), or internally.\n- \u00b7 The Company-wide Look at Environmental Assessment and Risk Review program (CLEARR) was continued, with additional and updated surveys of select manufacturing sites that focused on historical and current potential environmental risks.\n- \u00b7 Environmental risks and provisions are reviewed with local and corporate finance, as well as legal functions.\n- \u00b7 As part of mergers, acquisitions, and disposals, thorough environmental due diligence of sites is conducted where chemicals are or have been used. Any environmental risks or liabilities identified are addressed through proper risk management activities.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Risks and mitigation actions are presented to the Board Audit & Risks Committee.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric's global risk matrix takes into consideration the biggest environmental risks (on suppliers, products, sites, and customer projects).\n\nHistorical environmental liabilities are managed on a regional level to ensure local expertise, regulatory knowledge, and cultural awareness is applied. Using external consultants, known environmental issues are thoroughly investigated, and, if appropriate, remediated or otherwise managed through engineered or institutional controls to reduce potential risks to non-significant levels and in compliance with local regulations.\n\nAdditionally, Schneider uses third-party services to assess each of its key sites' risk profile, in relation to a certain number of external risks such as fires, earthquakes, flooding, and other natural disasters. Through this process and its business continuity planning efforts, Schneider endeavors to gauge related risks and anticipate possible steps which would be required. With around 244 ISO 14001 certified sites globally, the footprint is balanced geographically. Roughly 90 of the Group's plants are in areas classified as 'high' or 'extremely high' baseline water stress, as defined by World Resources Institute's (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. The nature of the Group's manufacturing processes (mainly assembly) allows for the rebalancing of manufacturing lines in a fairly prompt manner, if needed.\n\nDuring the year 2021, no new material environmental impacts were identified. Furthermore, no Schneider Electric sites are Seveso-classified.\n\n## 2.4.2.4  ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 certification\n\nISO 14001 certification allows Schneider Electric to define and sustain robust environment governance on its sites, supporting continuous improvement to deliver environmental performance. As soon as the ISO 14001 environmental management standard was published in 1996, Schneider decided to certify its sites. The Group certifies all industrial and logistics sites comprised of more than 50 employees within two years of their acquisition or creation, and all large tertiary sites of more than 500 employees. 244 sites are certified ISO 14001 as of the end of 2021, representing approximately 76% of the Group scope based on the share of site surfaces, 82% of the Group scope in terms of energy consumption, and over 85% of the Group scope in terms of water consumption, waste generation, and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions.\n\n-34%\n\nwater intensity since 2017\n\n96%\n\nwaste recovery in 2021\n\n2.",

ISO 50001 certification is complementary to ISO 14001 certification and enables us to define and sustain robust energy governance. With the support of this certification, the sites are equipped to understand and reduce their energy footprint. The Group aims to ISO 50001-certify all sites consuming over 5 GWh per year. By the end of 2021, 140 sites were certified ISO 50001.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.2.5 Waste to Resources\n\nIn 2021, global challenges with supply chains, material shortages, and increased visibility towards waste pollution such as ocean plastics have reaffirmed what Schneider Electric has known and strived towards for years: the depletion of the Earth's resources in the current linear take-make-dispose models of resource consumption are not economically or environmentally sustainable and must be replaced with circular economy models.\n\nIn its previous program, Towards Zero Waste to Landfill, the Group put a strong emphasis on diverting waste from the landfills through alternative solutions. The Group achieved 206 sites meeting its stringent requirements of 99% metal waste recovery, 97% nonmetal waste recovery, and 100% hazardous waste recovery using the best available handling/treatment options available locally. This helped the Group to achieve 96% waste recovery across its operations overall.\n\n## Waste Recovery Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn its new program, 'Waste-to-Resource', Schneider pushes even further with its waste recovery ambitions. Sites now must achieve 99% recovery for all non-hazardous waste and still achieve 100% hazardous waste recovery using the best available handling/ treatment options locally. Additionally, to promote and emphasize the importance of circular economy, 'Waste-to-Resource' sites will not be allowed to use waste-to-energy solutions for more than 10% of their waste. This provides an opportunity for sites to work collaboratively within their internal supply chains, along with external suppliers and waste management providers to find innovative reduce, reuse, and recycle solutions.\n\n'Waste-to-Resource' ambition at Schneider: maximising value recovered from waste in sites\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Schneider Electric generated around 135,000 tons of waste in 2021, most of it being solid waste. Continuous improvement plans have been deployed to manage this waste, in line with the ISO 14001 certification. In 2021, the Group recovered 96% of total waste reported (recovery ratio includes material and energy recovery) and a 91% recycling rate without energy recovery. The recovery ratio has increased from 81% to 96% since 2009, thanks to site-by-site waste management action plans.\n\nSchneider is committed to ensure that the potential adverse impacts of hazardous waste on environment and health are mitigated. Two main levers are investigated as part of the 'Waste-to-Resource' program: first, all sites generating hazardous waste ensure visibility of handling and end-of-life treatment paths. They also seek to add value to waste as much as possible (through material or energy recovery) while neutralizing its hazardous nature. Second, top hazardous waste-generating sites work to reduce the volumes of waste generated in the first place, notably by implementing 'Best Available Techniques' (BAT) in their industrial processes. Such BAT processes come along with superior performance from a resource efficiency perspective, and/ or chemical substances use, and/or emission reductions. By 2025, the ambition is to reduce hazardous waste intensity by 30% against the 2017 baseline.\n\nIn 2021, hazardous waste generation intensity was 0.3 tonnes/ million EUR of revenue, an evolution of -30% versus 2017.\n\nSchneider Electric's Benalla site, Australia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 2.4.2.6 Water consumption\n\nDue to the nature of most of its industrial processes (manual and automatic assembly), water consumption is not generally a critical resource for Schneider Electric, and the Group has a minimal impact on water quality. The topic was considered not very material by both internal and external stakeholders during the sustainability materiality analysis. In 2021, water management and performance information was disclosed in the CDP Water program, and Schneider was awarded a B rating.\n\nHowever, Schneider fully realizes the importance of water in local communities, especially those that are located in water-stressed areas. Having approximately 90 ISO 14001 sites in areas classified as 'high' or 'extremely high' baseline water stress, as defined by World Resources Institute's (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas, the Group has set the ambition that 100% of its sites in water-stressed areas have a water conservation strategy and related action plan by 2025 (SSE #11).\n\nUnder this program, three types of actions can be implemented:\n\n- \u00b7 Standard actions which apply to all sites;\n- \u00b7 Conditional actions which apply to certain sites based on their type and volume of water usage;\n- \u00b7 Site-specific actions.\n\nIn 2021, the Group achieved 9% of its 2025 target.\n\nIn addition, Schneider's aims to reduce water intensity (in m 3 of water consumption per euro of turnover) by 35% in 2025 versus 2017, with a focus on sites with high water consumption and within severely water-stressed areas. In 2021, water consumption intensity was 72 m 3 per million euro of revenue, an evolution of -34% against the 2017 baseline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 100% of sites in water-stressed areas have a water conservation strategy and action plan\n\nSchneider Electric has approximately 90 sites located in water-stressed areas all over the world. These include factories, distribution centers, and large offices, with water usages including process-based, HVAC, sanitary/canteen, and irrigation.\n\nFor instance, Schneider's Benalla site in Australia has installed 130,000 Liters of rainwater storage, which allows the site to source 60% of its water needs from rainwater.\n\nBaseline\n\n2025 target\n\n0\n\n2021 Progress\n\n100\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

At Group level, water is primarily used for cooling and sanitary purposes and, on a few selected sites, for processes such as surface treatment. Water drawn for the sole purpose of cooling and immediately released without alteration is also monitored separately. For industrial water use, water discharge is subject to appropriate treatments to reduce pollutant potential and subject to a monitoring plan.\n\nGlobal water intensity evolution (m 3 /million \u20ac)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.2.7 Biodiversity on sites\n\nBiodiversity is a local matter and actions are required at site level to reduce local impacts: the Group has committed to increase its biodiversity site actions and raise the awareness of employees. In fact, site activities such as energy and water consumption, building infrastructure, food, landscaping, waste generation, light, sound and other forms of pollution, exert a pressure on biodiversity that can be reduced. For example, manicured, non-native landscaping could potentially increase water consumption and promote invasive species that don't support native wildlife.\n\nThe objective is to achieve 100% of sites with a local biodiversity conservation and restoration program by 2025 (SSE #8). To meet this target, sites have to define and deploy a biodiversity program consisting of a ban of single-use plastics (related to office use) and at least one local action with significant ecological impact.\n\nThe program was launched in 2021 and many sites already started the journey, understanding the complexities of biodiversity, assessing their impact and identifying the right local stakeholders to involve in a preservation or restoration program.\n\nAs it takes time to build impactful and consistent biodiversity programs, a slow ramp up in terms of global performance of the indicator is expected, with an acceleration after 2023.\n\nWith the objective to get an overview on biodiversity priority sites, inform risk management, and address potential biodiversity impacts, the Group decided to run a multi-site report with the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT). Developed through a partnership with Bird Life International, Conservation International, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and United Nations Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), IBAT collects and enhances the underlying datasets and maintains that scientific information.\n\n*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe IBAT report enables users to assess the biodiversity-related features of multiple operational sites for corporate disclosure. In particular, the report is relevant for Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard GRI 304: Biodiversity.

None of the Group's businesses involve extraction or land farming. In 2021, Schneider manufacturing sites conducted their annual review of pollution risks as part of ISO 14001 monitoring. No significant spills or discharges were reported in 2021 with known harmful impacts regarding soil pollution.\n\nHazardous materials are stored, handled, and used in compliance with regulations and with appropriate pollution protection mechanisms. As part of the 'Waste-to-Resource' program, additional focus is brought on hazardous waste, with efforts to eliminate, substitute, or improve treatment (see section 2.4.2.5 Waste to Resources, on page 152).\n\n## 2.4.2.9  Discharge into the water and air\n\nBecause Schneider Electric is mainly an assembler, its discharge into the air and water is very limited. Schneider manufacturing sites are carefully monitored, as part of ISO 14001 certification. Discharges are locally tracked as required by current legislation. No significant spills or discharges were reported in 2021 with known harmful impacts in terms of water or air pollution.\n\nEmissions of NO X and SO X and particles into the air are monitored at site level in accordance with applicable legal requirements; monitoring of these emissions is verified via ISO 14001 audits. Those emissions are not consolidated at Group level.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nSchneider Electric is committed to preventing adverse health and environmental impacts from Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, and for this reason, the Group works to reduce VOC emissions from industrial activities by 10% every three years. VOC emissions are primarily linked to production. VOC emissions decreased from 29 kg/million EUR in 2017 to 17.4 kg/million Eur in 2021 (-40%). The Group engages with each of its industrial sites that contribute the most to VOC emissions, and which together concentrate over 90% of the Group's VOC emissions, in a Pareto law approach. For these sites, environment, health and safety, and industrialization teams, join hands and actively collaborate to ensure conditions of use are strictly adhered to and health and environmental risks are known and mitigated. Those top VOC-emitting sites also investigate opportunities to reduce and phase-out concerned chemicals from industrial processes wherever possible.\n\nFinally, CFC and HCFC emissions are monitored locally, in accordance with applicable regulations. These emissions are mainly due to the operation of air conditioning systems and are not directly linked to Schneider industrial activities. These emissions are not consolidated at Group level.\n\n## 2.4.2.10  Noise, odors, and light\n\nAll Schneider Electric sites comply with local regulations on noise and odor.

But because products also consume resources and energy, during their production and use, Schneider is committed to reducing their environmental impact.\n\nSince 2003, a Product stewardship team has been dedicated to providing high environmental performance products to the Group's customers as well as full transparency regarding environmental impact. Initially, efforts were focused on compliance with the most rigorous environmental regulations, then on data transparency (through Product Environmental Profiles and End of Life Instructions). Over the last few years, additional efforts have been made to develop a more customer-centric program, helping Schneider customers to better differentiate offers based on strong environmental value propositions.\n\nWith the Green Premium \u2122 program and the EcoDesign Way \u2122 process, Schneider reduces the environmental impact of its products using lower impact materials, drastically changing its packaging strategy as well as bringing circular value propositions to extend the durability of products.\n\n## 2.4.3.1  Risks and opportunities\n\nThe increasing complexity of environmental regulations could slow down the Group's innovation potential, and could phase out specific chemical substances or resources too quickly with no suitable alternative being found in a scalable manner. The complexity is directly linked to a 'regionalization' of environmental regulations (e.g., California Prop 65 and China RoHS) while global resources are limited.\n\nWith increasingly stringent environmental regulations year after year, there is a risk for Schneider Electric to have key materials and substances that could be utilized to deliver high performance to be regulated themselves. This would limit the innovation potential of products that would fall within the regulation radar with possible restrictions. There is also a risk to face contradictory recommendations due to regulations overlap (e.g., substances restriction versus circularity performance).\n\nBy its customers' side, Schneider has observed a multiplication of external repositories to leverage product environmental performance, some being specific to a single customer. As such, there is a risk for Schneider products not to be systematically referenced externally.\n\nTo circumvent the risks stated earlier, Schneider relies on the completeness of the Green Premium \u2122 program, enabling it to cover all relevant product-oriented environmental topics. Relying on the EcoDesign Way \u2122 process and tools is also key to include environmental performance as soon as possible in the new product development process. This enables Schneider product development teams to innovate while delivering more Green Premium \u2122 products that will differentiate themselves from those of competitors thanks to higher environmental performance.\n\nThe multiplication of environmental regulations requires a lot of information to be shared with the supply chain and updated regularly. Only the best-in-class suppliers will be able to answer this challenge. Also, it is an opportunity for the Group to put in place a strong interaction with those suppliers and ensure that future restrictions will be anticipated.\n\nSchneider reinforces a worldwide approach of environmental product stewardship directives fed by a regional and local environmental steward network, which strengthen its influence position towards regulators through Schneider professional associations.\n\nFrom the customers' perspective, Schneider relies on the 'Check a Product' platform, a public website (https://checkaproduct.se.com/CheckProduct. aspx?cskey=4b4b15ad9d8148759e39fcb1b346ad9f) providing  all relevant product environmental information. Thanks to 'Check a Product', the Group is in a good position to be well referenced  in external databases such as the SCIP (Substance of Concern\n\nin Products) database and in customers' prescription tools.\n\nIn a commitment to go one step further, Schneider takes the necessary steps to digitize the environmental information of offers. Within a fully digitized ecosystem, the Group can provide a streamlined and efficient process to share environmental data with external third-party databases or customers' own prescription tools.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGreen Premium introduced to provide transparent information on regulated substances and to share the environmental information of our products\n\nRoHS: Restriction of Hazardous Substances.

In response, the Industrial Automation Environmental Experts of the Group generated more than 75 new Product Environmental Profile (PEP) documents. This has enabled the certification of a larger amount of products through the Green Premium \u2122 program to deliver even more transparent information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.3.4 EcoDesign Way \u2122\n\nEcoDesign Way \u2122 is Schneider Electric's proprietary process, deployed on product development projects of more than EUR 300,000. It is fully integrated in the Group's Offer Creation Processes (OCP), mandatory deliverables, and encompasses all involved functions: Marketing, Quality, Design, Supply Chain, and Project Manager. EcoDesign Way \u2122 involves 3 steps:\n\n- 1 Identification of relevant environmental performance for customers with inputs from marketing\n- 2 Research and assessment of alternative solutions to target the selected environmental performance\n- 3 Once performance is reached, draft of a marketing pitch.\n\nThe EcoDesign Way \u2122 scorecard is fully aligned with all Green Premium \u2122 value propositions. Moreover, several initiatives have been launched to embed EcoDesign Way \u2122 earlier in the OCP with strong inputs from the Future Offer Manager to foster innovation and increase EcoDesign Way \u2122 's positive impact. For instance, a simplified Life Cycle Assessment tool was deployed to assess t he environmental potential of incubated projects.\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric initiated a revamp of the EcoDesign Way \u2122 process to better include the latest global sustainability programs such as Green Materials and Green Packaging. The new eco-design process is expected to be more integrated within the Agile framework Schneider is deploying globally. The process should also involve the assessment of CO 2 emissions at a very early stage in the creation of new offers in order to encourage oriented investments. Moreover, the new eco-design process will not be limited to products but will also include systems/architectures. Finally, the revamping of ecodesign will be the opportunity to enhance sustainable innovation DNA by developing training and coaching modules for the project teams.\n\n## 2.4.3.5 Green materials\n\nSchneider Electric has committed to increase green materials use in its products to 50% by 2025, as part of Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI #4). With that long-term commitment, the Group aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 Be a change agent to accelerate the transformation toward a low-carbon and circular economy of the material industry;\n- \u00b7 Reduce Scope 3 supply chain emissions, in line with the 1.5\u00b0C carbon pledge;\n- \u00b7 Differentiate Schneider products from those of competitors in the eyes of customers by using low CO 2 , circular, and safer materials in products.\n\nIn 2021, Cross-functional experts at Schneider (Procurement, R&D, Environment) have worked in close relationship with suppliers to define the Green attributes for each commodity in scope, based on existing international schemes and standards. A green material is:\n\n- \u00b7 A material with a lower environmental footprint; and/or\n- \u00b7 A material that is the output of an industrial technology which is a key enabler for a 1.5\u00b0C climate scenario and/or a more circular economy.\n\nConsidering this definition, Schneider has identified two levers of action:\n\n- \u00b7 Build traceability in the value chain. This is a priority for metals today, where visibility on the environmental impact and technology-origin of procured metals is low.\n- \u00b7 Select green materials based on a lower environmental footprint.\n\nThe lower environmental footprint attributes are defined for each commodity in scope, as the environmental performance of metal cannot be based on the same attributes as plastic. In 2021, the scope of green materials focused on three types of commodities covering about a third of purchased materials in volume:\n\n- \u00b7 Thermoplastics (including both direct and indirect procurement). Thermoplastics are qualified as 'Green' when the supplier is bringing evidence of a minimum recycled content, biobased content (minimum threshold depends on whether the compound is halogenated or not) or is using a green flame retardant.\n- \u00b7 Steel (direct purchases). Steel is qualified as 'Green' when the supplier is bringing evidence that the mill of origin is an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) or has a Green certificate such as the ones delivered by Responsible Steel.\n- \u00b7 Aluminum (direct purchases). Aluminum is qualified as 'Green' when the supplier is bringing evidence that the product carbon footprint is below 8 tonnes of CO 2 per ton of Aluminum, is using a minimum of 90% of recycled content in its product or that the mill of origin has a Green certificate such as the ones delivered by the Aluminum Stewardship Initiative.\n\nVolume and distribution of green materials (in kt)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Extending the Green materials scope to indirect procurement would allow to include new green criteria such as 'lead-free alloy', a substitution initiative Schneider Electric is working on to anticipate future regulation on lead.\n\nIn January 2022, Schneider became a member of Responsible Steel, the world's first global scheme for responsibly sourced and produced steel. Its mission is to enhance the responsible sourcing, production, use and recycling of steel. Schneider is one of the first steel products consumers outside of the automotive industry to join Responsible Steel. Being a member of Responsible Steel will allow the Group to have a voice to influence the scheme development while fostering opportunities to build strong partnerships with Steel manufacturers and consumers. In 2022, Responsible Steel will launch a standard for the certification of steel products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nSchneider Energy Management and Industrial Automation businesses are currently working on an implementation roadmap of the green materials in the projects portfolio.

Globally, a strengthening of the regulatory framework requires the development of new packaging alternatives to enhance recyclability and minimize the current and upcoming Polluter-Pays packaging taxes.\n\nBy 2025, Schneider has committed to make sure that:\n\n- \u00b7 100% of primary and secondary packaging uses recycled cardboard.\n- \u00b7 100% of our primary and secondary packaging is free of single-use plastic.\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric Green Packaging Experts released a new sustainable packaging guideline to define Schneider's requirements and best practices to foster improved environmental performance of packaging by minimizing waste generation and improving recyclability to make it an integrated part of a more circular economy.\n\nIn 2022, the focus will be put on:\n\n- \u00b7 Setting up partnerships with key suppliers to secure greener packaging options;\n- \u00b7 Building up traceability in the supply chain by collecting suppliers' declarations and strengthening procurement systems to better track single-use plastic packaging;\n- \u00b7 Accelerating the implementation of the 'green packaging' definition in the business projects portfolio to ensure new and legacy products switch to more sustainable packaging options.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n100% of our primary and secondary packaging is free from single-use plastic and uses recycled cardboard\n\nThe newly launched Wiser IP Camera is delivered without any plastics in the box and a cardboard made with 70% of recycled content. In addition, the in box user guide contains mandatory information only and remaining content is fully accessible online through a QR Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.3.7  Product Environmental Footprint\n\nMore and more customers, green building standards, distributors, and electricians prefer offers with green credentials and request environmental data. Many building standards and local regulations, demand or promote offers providing Environmental Product Declarations. There is clearly a growing premium assigned to transparency.\n\nAn environmental footprint is a product or solution-related content that provides quantitative information based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA, according to ISO 14040-44 standard). Environmental footprint enables the assessment of multiple environmental impact indicators, including the carbon footprint, for all product or solution lifecycle stages. The scope of this assessment is also referred as 'cradle-to-grave'. Environmental footprint is a mandatory requirement in the Green Premium \u2122 program.\n\nSchneider Electric relies on Product Environmental Profiles (PEP) to fulfill this requirement. A PEP is defined as a product-oriented 'summarized' version of a full LCA. It relies on Product Category Rules (PCR) or Product Specific Rules (PSR).\n\nAt Schneider, there are two types of PEP available:\n\n- \u00b7 Certified - a type III Environmental Declaration in compliance with ISO 14025. The certified PEP is externally reviewed by an accredited verifier and published by a program operator according to the rules provided by this operator (e.g., PEP Ecopassport). In 2021, 182 certified PEPs were published on the PEP Ecopassport association website.\n- \u00b7 Internal - the internal PEP follows the exact same rules as the certified one. However, an internal PEP is reviewed internally and therefore, cannot be registered through an independent program operator. A process of accreditation for internal verifiers guarantees the adequate level of internal PEP verifications. Verifiers check PEPs from other lines of business than their own, thus ensuring independence. Internal PEPs comply with the ISO 14021 self-completed declaration.\n\nIn 2019, 77.3% of Schneider's product revenue was covered by a PEP, including 33.9% of ISO 14025 type III declarations and 43.4% of ISO 14021 type II self-completed declarations.\n\n## Environmental configurators\n\nBeyond PEPs, Schneider Electric also relies on some offers' environmental configurators which are better suited to assess the environmental footprint of systems and solutions. A configurator makes it possible to assess a dynamic environmental footprint that better reflects the specific situation of customers or endusers. In 2021, a web configurator was developed to leverage the environmental benefits of the ECOFIT \u2122 service. Schneider aims at supporting the creation and use of such configurators since they allow the Group to provide better environmental inputs to customers, facilitate the discussion around the environmental footprint of offers, and therefore ease the identification of meaningful eco-designed solutions. In 2021, Schneider accelerated the digitization of the PEP process in order to encourage the use of the configurator.",

        "page_content": "## PEP Ecopassport PCRed4\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric strongly contributed to the development of the new Product Category Rules of the PEP Ecopassport association (PCRed4 issued in September 2021), which are:\n\n- \u00b7 Compliant with the EN 50693:2019 standard: Product category rules for life cycle assessments of electronic and electrical products and systems - currently being mirrored in the IEC/ TC111 Working Group 15 (IEC 63366);\n- \u00b7 Fully aligned with the EN 15804+A2 standard: Sustainability of construction works - Environmental product declarations Core rules for the product category of construction products;\n- \u00b7 Integrate key elements of the EU Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), such as mandatory impact indicators, end-of-life formulae, and quality ranking;\n- \u00b7 Aligned with ISO 14067:2018: Greenhouse gases Carbon footprint of products - Requirements and guidelines for quantification, integrating the latest requirements of the French regulatory texts from RE2020.\n\nThe application of PCRed4 enables electrical and electronic equipment manufacturers to produce product environmental declarations, in accordance with the best-known international standards, thus fostering cross-region and cross-industry recognition. Schneider aims at using this new PCR document to influence and strengthen the environmental footprint practices of the sector through standardization (TC111 Working Group, ZVEI initiative) and regulations (Sustainable Product Initiative of the European Commission, Green Taxonomy).\n\nBy relying on the PEP Ecopassport PCRed4 methodology on the one hand and on the acceleration of the environmental data digitization on the other hand, Schneider strives to provide systematically and seamlessly to customers quantified environmental footprint to differentiate the green offers, and therefore, be a change agent towards a low-carbon and circular economy.\n\n## 2.4.3.8 Substances strategy\n\nWith increasing chemical substances regulations, raising standards from a well-being perspective, especially in the building space, and a growing number of questions from B2C and B2B customers on health matters, the ability to ensure compliance of several hundreds of thousands of product references has never been so critical. When such product traceability is mastered at scale, with robust processes and systems in place, clear business opportunities emerge, as digitization of such data is more and more needed. Schneider Electric seamlessly captures underlying data from suppliers, aggregate it, and disseminate it swiftly to customers who need that information.\n\n## REACH and RoHS\n\nIn Europe, the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) directive are engaged in a refit process and Schneider actively participated in the public consultations through the professional organizations, by making some key proposals to improve efficiency and limit the administrative burden.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Substances of Concern in Products (SCIP)\n\nIn the frame of the Waste Framework Directive, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) was mandated by the EU commission to put in place the database for information on Substances of Concern In Products (SCIP), beginning in 2021. Since 2021, manufacturers and importers of products containing substances of very high concern (SVHC) above the 0.1% threshold, must register those products into this SCIP database. Despite the difficulties to manually register Schneider's products without any IT to IT systems, nor any easy solution provided by ECHA, the Group registered most of the relevant products by the end of 2021, being one of the top contributors, and reinforcing our transparency objective in this domain.\n\nThe environmental compliance IT system which allowed Schneider to have a competitive advantage in terms of transparency and substitution management, virtually throughout the last decade, must be replaced. 2021 was dedicated to specifying our needs in order to maintain and even improve this advantage at least for the next 10 years. This is a key element of our substance and regulation management strategy.\n\n## TSCA\n\nIn the US, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulation which restricts the use of chemicals was reinforced with the introduction of new substances. Schneider Electric worked hard to identify the use case of those substances and launch adequate actions. The TSCA restriction list will be fully integrated in Schneider Electric's global substances strategy soon.\n\n## IEC 62474\n\nSubstances information data sharing is key to target substitutions. Schneider is very active in the development of data exchange formats on substances through the IEC 62474 standard.\n\n## Other substances under investigation\n\nAmong the different subjects investigated in 2021, the Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) restriction proposal and Silver classification update were two points of focus. Lead substitution was also investigated in anticipation and will be promoted when possible.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\n## 2.4 Being efficient with Resources\n\n## 2.4.3.9  Circular business models\n\nThe risks that Schneider Electric sees are around the perception of 'one size fits all' for circularity, as well as the temptation to see it through a waste or recycling lens, and the focus on developing the related guidelines, governance, and standards based on this perception.\n\n- \u00b7 Product durability versus shorter-term waste loops: all resources are not equal in their thermal, mechanical, or electromagnetic profiles. For the industrial sector, the biggest impact of the circular economy will come from the promotion of reparability, upgradability, 'retrofitability', extension of lifespan, and of related 'product second- and third-life services'. Schneider's products are highly technical in nature with a long lifespan and are highly unlikely to end up as ocean plastic waste, yet a risk that the emerging regulations may be too 'resource/wastecentric' can be seen. To meet quality and safety expectations, and adhere to stringent electric and electronic equipment standards, recycled materials are sometimes not available in either quantity and/or quality. The Group actively advocates sector-specific approaches.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring the safety of people and assets through qualified and certified services. Indeed, while promoting services to extend the products' lifespan, Schneider grows the ranks of certified experts on its products (through thousands of Field Services Representatives). Leveraging the circular economy, there is a fantastic opportunity to enable more repair, retrofit, and recycling services, on condition that concerned product categories are adequately maintained and serviced by qualified and certified experts.\n\nThere are opportunities to leverage the circular economies, both externally with customers and internally in operations. Schneider's value propositions have long delivered resource efficiency, enabling customers to 'do more with less'.\n\nSchneider's deeply ingrained belief in the circular economy helps create a win-win-win-win ecosystem: good for the planet, good for customers (lower Total Cost of Ownership, lifespan of assets, etc.), good for the Company as a business (customer intimacy, stickiness, etc.), and good for its people (meaningful jobs, pride to take part in saving resources and energy, etc.).\n\nThrough circular capabilities such as local models of reuse, retrofit, repair, refurbish, and take-back, and by unleashing the potential of IoT, connecting and digitizing products (predictive maintenance, performance optimization, leasing, pay-per-use, performance contracting), Schneider creates shared value for its customers.\n\nMost of Schneider's new products are digital, connectable, ensure full product lifecycle management and predictive maintenance, and guarantee optimum performance, hence enabling the Group to move towards customer-intimate models like subscription, performance contracting, and leasing.\n\nThe first focus, before considering end-of-life, is to prolong the lifespan of products. Those solutions, using up to 60% less materials than using brand new equipment, enable pull-through and constant payback, increase customer stickiness, and longterm relationships.\n\n## Schneider's first circular distribution center\n\nSince 2020, the Schneider Electric site in Bourguebus, France has supported the Group's strategy to help accelerate its transformation towards the circular economy.\n\nBourguebus helps deliver on 4 key aspects of Schneider's circular economy strategy including:\n\n- \u00b7 Repack: repackaging of new Schneider products whose packaging has been damaged.\n- \u00b7 Reuse: sorting, selecting, redistributing never-energized Schneider products that are unsold and/or returned by our customers under the 'Circular Certified' label.\n- \u00b7 Refurbish: managing the supply chain for collecting used Schneider products and sending them to the Schneider Electric Privas, France partner site for repair and managing customer orders on our second-hand web platform.\n- \u00b7 Recycle: dismantling of products to recover and resell the valuable materials.\n\nSchneider Electric's Bourguebus site, France\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBourguebus's innovative circular economy transformation, along with the added value proposition of the 'Circular Certified' label, has led to saving 4M\u20ac of stock in 2021 and has avoided 950 tonnes of CO 2 e.\n\nIn 2022, the site will continue to grow circular industrial capabilities to support business innovation and differentiating offers to customers. This includes capabilities such as refurbish, remanufacture and reverse logistics. One particular customercentric project will include developing a website that will support the take-back of Schneider products at customer sites.\n\n## External engagement\n\nSchneider Electric has been part of task forces on circular economy, playing leadership roles in multi-stakeholder dialogs. For example, the Group is active in France's Circular Economy Roadmap and engaged in China with MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology) on circular strategy, leading AFEP, Gim\u00e9lec, FIEEC, IGNES, and ORGALIM discussions for its sector on circular economy, publishing articles, and speaking at conferences (Greenbiz, Gartner, WEF, SCM World, peer-to-peer, EthicalCorp, and WindEurope, among others).",

Massive acceleration in the adoption of digital technologies and connectivity has changed the way we all live and work. The sense of urgency around climate change has intensified. Social aspirations, including demand for equality, have soared. New ways of organizing workforces have emerged. New capabilities are being developed to maximize the human-to-digital intersection. There has been a shift in the balance of the global versus local economies amidst geopolitical differences.\n\n## 2.5.1.1 Schneider Electric's People Vision Employee Value Proposition, Core Values, and Leadership Expectations\n\n## People Vision\n\nGreat people make Schneider Electric a great company. To transform our culture and create a great place to work for, we launched our new People Vision in 2018.\n\nThe People Vision provided the impetus to change the way Schneider works and accelerate the cultural transformation at the Company. With an Employee Value Proposition (EVP), a set of Core Values and Leadership Expectations, there is a strong anchor to the people strategy.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the People Vision helped us remain resilient and rebound on business performance.\n\nThe People Vision consists of the following:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\nOur EVP is our commitment to engage existing and future talent. It's the reason why people join, stay, and remain engaged and shows how we differentiate ourselves as an employer.\n\nOur Core Values determine who we are, what we do, and define the way we work together and deliver on our EVP promises. Our values guide our choices and illustrate the behaviors we expect our employees to demonstrate.\n\nOur Leadership Expectations show how we expect leaders to drive the Company for the future. They emphasize how our leaders will transform Schneider Electric by stepping up individually and collectively.\n\n## Employee Value Proposition\n\nThe Group is also looking to establish a strong name as an employer and communicate around its Employee Value Proposition, which is our promise to current and future employees.\n\nWe believe that great people make Schneider Electric a great company. We are driven by our meaningful purpose and continuously create an inclusive environment where employees are empowered to be at their best and innovate.\n\nOur Employee Value Proposition continues to evolve in line with the business. Making the emotional connection as to 'Why Schneider Electric?' is fundamental in the ability to not only attract the best talent and be an 'employer of choice', but also to have it resonate as authentic with employees as a form of encouragement, motivation and inspiration.\n\n## Employee Value Proposition\n\n## MEANINGFUL\n\nWe empower all to make the most of their energy and resources , ensuring Life Is On everywhere, for everyone, at every moment.\n\nOur mission is to provide energy and automation digital solutions for efficiency and sustainability .\n\n## INCLUSIVE\n\nWe want to be the most diverse, inclusive and equitable company, globally.\n\nWe value differences , and welcome people from all walks of life.\n\nWe believe in equal opportunities for everyone, everywhere.\n\nWe adhere to the highest standards of governance and ethics .\n\n## EMPOWERED\n\n## Freedom breeds innovation .\n\nWe believe that empowerment generates high performance, personal fulfillment and fun .\n\nWe empower our people to use their judgement , do the best for our customers , and make the most of their energy .",

So, not only do we put ourselves in their shoes, but we also anticipate their needs and go the extra mile. We champion our sales people, because they are the face of our Company. Whatever our role, we have an impact on the customer's experience.\n\nDare to Disrupt. Constantly in Beta. Innovation is our middle name. Good is never good enough, and that's why we are constantly experimenting, taking risks, and disrupting the status quo. We think fast, and we act even faster. Setbacks don't hurt us. They motivate us. That's why we are not afraid to make our bets bigger and our decisions bolder to power the digital economy through energy management and automation. We, at Schneider, ensure Life Is On.\n\nEmbrace Different. Different is Beautiful. We are 100% committed to inclusion. 'Exclusion' is not even in our vocabulary. We believe in equal opportunities for everyone, everywhere. This means welcoming people from all walks of life, ages, and cultures, embracing different perspectives and calling out bias when we see it, so that every person feels uniquely valued and safe to be at their best. To us, a stranger is simply a friend we haven't met yet.\n\nLearn Every Day. #Whatdidyoulearntoday? To stop learning is to stop growing. We are genuinely curious, never done with learning. To us, there is no such thing as knowing it all or having all the answers. We believe in life-long learning. Every minute of every day brings a new chance to listen, open up our minds, and widen our horizons. We are never too experienced to learn.\n\nAct Like Owners. All in. Together. Entrepreneurs at heart, we take responsibility and ownership of everything we do. This is not somebody else's company. It's ours! We are individually empowered and collectively driven to collaborate and beat the competition together. In the end, we do what is right for Schneider first - always with integrity and honesty.\n\n## 2.5.1.2 2025 People Strategy\n\nDuring the pandemic, we successfully pivoted to digital interactions with customers and remote working with our teams. As we move towards the post-pandemic era, the nature of work, the workplace, and the relationship between companies, customers, and employees has dramatically changed.\n\nIn January 2021, our new People Strategy was launched, with the aim to set the bar higher to support business growth and culture/ leadership transformation. To deliver on this mission and shape the workforce of the future in the 'next normal', the strategy has three outcome-based themes:\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nFuture ready talent - a diverse, empowered, and digitally skilled team. All talents develop current and future skills through on-thejob learning, exposure, and education to realize their potential.\n\nInclusive leadership - leaders drive greater disruption and acceleration. They build human connections by coaching, caring, and collaborating across teams to achieve together and deliver impact.\n\n## 2.5.1.3 Organization\n\nSince 2009, the Human Resources (HR) department has been structured around three principal roles to better respond to its missions:\n\nHR Business Partners assist managers on a day-to-day basis in setting out their business strategies and in assessing the human resource requirements needed to meet business targets. They also play a pivotal role in anticipating skill requirements and employee development, and in the management of employee relations.\n\nHR Solutions creates and develops comprehensive solutions for the organization's strategic challenges in key areas, such as compensation, benefits, human capital development, learning, and performance management. Regional teams are leveraged to effectively support the Group's globalized operations.\n\nHR Services handles the logistics and administrative responsibilities relating to payroll, sourcing, mobility, and training programs, mainly through shared service centers designed to optimize efficiency and costs. Since 2015, the Group has put in place an HR Excellence initiative with the objective of creating HR teams ready to make the Leadership and Culture vision a reality while supporting the growth of the business.\n\n## 2.5.1.4 Governance\n\nIn 2020, Schneider Electric decided to further reinforce the governance of the Group, the professionalism of our processes, and our foundations for trust.\n\nA new global organization CGO (Corporate Governance Office) was created to support this aim. Human Resources followed suit with the creation of a governance role within the function to articulate corporate governance directions within the function and to reinforce its own governance.\n\nHR Governance acts as single point of contact to corporate organizations such as M&A, Internal Audit, Internal Control, Ethics & Compliance, and Data Privacy facilitating an agile response to corporate directions by the function. Similarly, HR Governance provides support to HR people around governance questions.\n\nOrganizational agility - a growth and innovation culture, enabled by a flatter, leaner, and multi-hub/multi-local structure, customer proximity, and fast decision making, supported by new ways of working.\n\n## Core Values\n\nCUSTOMER FIRST\n\nDARE TO DISRUPT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

Engaged employees are key to enable the organization to be at its best and support the achievement of the Group strategy together. People who understand and connect with the company's purpose will feel more personally involved and more likely to deliver more than what is expected from them.\n\n## Key updates in 2021\n\n- 1.  In line with Group priorities and People Strategy , the Continuous Listening Strategy and particularly, annual employee engagement survey, OneVoice, was updated to reflect some of the key 2021-2025 ambitions and working in the next normal\n- 2. There is an increased focus on action plans and follow-up based on these insights\n- 3.  Leaders and Managers are more involved to drive the topic and ensure care towards employees\n\n## 1. Refreshed questions to adapt to working in the next normal and align with Group's 2025 ambition\n\nFirst set up in 2009, the OneVoice internal survey was designed to measure employee satisfaction. In 2012, the survey evolved to include employee engagement to derive a more holistic view of employee expectations, commitment, and sentiment.\n\nAs an inclusive company, all employees are asked to provide their honest feedback through a questionnaire evaluating their engagement and measuring the drivers of engagement such as diversity, learning, and new ways of working. This process helps the Group identify key avenues for improving employees' engagement and their unique life at work.\n\nIn 2021, it was important to refresh the questions to make them more relevant due to the new working environment of employees, particularly regarding the new normal, flexibility at work, empowerment of the teams and inclusion. As rated by our employees:\n\nNew ways of working empowerment and inclusion are the Top 3 drivers of employee engagement\n\n80%\n\nfeel they have flexibility to modify their work arrangements when needed.\n\n79%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfeel empowered to choose how best to complete their work.\n\n78%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconsider they are treated fairly regardless of their individual differences.\n\nIn 2021, despite global external predictions on the impact of pandemic fatigue on employees, Schneider Electric recorded its highest employee engagement score, 71%, + 7 points compared to 2019 in the pre-COVID-19 context. This is evidence of a strong and lasting emotional bond between employees and the organization as well as confirmation that employees felt supported by the organization during challenging times. Schneider Electric tracks its own employee engagement index in relation to the industry and top-performing companies globally. The Company also has a Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) ambition to achieve 75% employee engagement score by the end of 2025.\n\n## 2. Reinforce action planning to ensure meaningful outcomes\n\nAs internal and external research has demonstrated that the role of the manager has a significant impact on employees to drive engagement of their teams, the Company has focused on building awareness and knowledge among managers and following up to ensure that action plans were implemented at all levels of the organization. Schneider Electric carefully follows its own action plans, making sure that they are seriously implemented, and that good practice can be spread across the organization. In 2021, the Company strengthened its efforts at three pivotal levels: global, local, and team.\n\nGlobal level: one of the key learning from the crisis was that employees recognized the support provided by the company during those times. As a concrete action taken at Group level, live sessions were organized for all employees every month, aiming at learning how to better take care of their Well-Being.\n\nLocal level: the financial support provided to India through Tomorrow Rising fund had a very positive impact which was raised in the comments of our OneVoice annual survey as a delightful moment.\n\nTeam level: Managers still played a key role and the recognition they gave to their team members had a positive impact on their team members. One of the concrete actions taken in Victoria's plant in the United States is to empower collaborators to come to management team with ideas for recognition events.\n\n## Key highlights for 2021\n\n100% of employees were surveyed in May 2021 through a consistent and continued measurement of the employee engagement index but with a refreshed set of questions to better fit our ambition:\n\nParticipation\n\n85%\n\nComments analyzed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n134k\n\n108,904 responses\n\nEngagement\n\n71%\n\n+2pts vs 2020 +7pts vs 2019\n\nManagers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhave access to a customized report\n\nAction plans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrecorded since July 2021",

In 2021, collaboration was the #1 topic raised by employees as a major driver contributing to their engagement. During difficult times, employees expressed their pride to feel recognized by their managers, customers, colleagues for a successful teamwork.\n\nBaseline\n\n2025 target\n\n69%\n\n75%\n\n2021 Progress\n\n71%\n\n## 3. More involvement of leaders and managers\n\nFollowing communication of the results, and with the support of their HR Business Partner, managers organized feedback sessions with their team to foster dialog and build relevant action plans, based on both qualitative and quantitative results. Acting with trust, empathy, and humanity, communicating to teams agilely and providing sincere support to employees is key in keeping people engaged.\n\nAs actions are important to demonstrate that feedback is acted upon and the company 'walks the talk', a 'nudge' approach was introduced to remind managers to follow up on their action plans with their teams, while peer to peer sessions were introduced to provide managers with opportunities to share challenges and best practices on implementing improvement actions.\n\nThis year, to enhance action plans implementation and follow up reviews, the Company created a leader-led Advisory Board composed of business and HR leaders to act as a sounding board as well as an Operating Committee, composed of employee engagement and continuous listening partners, to pair with frontline managers to promote, share, and test any new initiatives.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

Schneider Electric wants its employees - no matter who they are, or where in the world they live - to feel uniquely valued and safe to contribute their best. The Group believes that diversity, equity, and inclusion is a moral as well as a business imperative, as a diversity of people and an environment of inclusion leads to greater engagement, performance, and innovation.\n\nSince 2015, Schneider Electric has also made well-being and mental health strategic priorities. The events of the last couple years have only confirmed that nurturing employees' well-being and mental health is a critical business imperative, and that leaders must develop the right skills to support their teams' well-being. Pandemic fatigue is real, as is the increase in employee burnout and mental health challenges across the globe. Companies have to accommodate these realities and strive to provide the support every individual needs. Recognizing that well-being and mental health matter is key to fostering an inclusive company culture where everyone feels safe to be their unique self.\n\n## 2.5.2.2 Governance\n\nThe Global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) Board is a group of top leaders from all markets, sponsored by the Executive Committee, which acts as a sounding board for the global DEI strategy as well as internal and external DEI champions. Board members are nominated by the Executive Committee to serve a two to three-year term.\n\nAll Schneider Electric entities develop action plans based on the feedback of employees while meeting local regulations and addressing country-specific situations. For DEI, leaders have been appointed in more than 30 countries/ zones and entities of the Group to lead these actions plans. This global network convenes bi-monthly to share progress and best practices.\n\nThe well-being governance model consists of a structured network of more than 50 champions worldwide converting the global vision into customized local actions responding to the diversity and local needs of more than 100 countries. The well-being champions network convenes every six weeks to share progress, internal and external trends, as well as best practices.\n\nBeyond this governance structure, all employees at Schneider Electric are held accountable for our DEI and well-being transformation, through targets included in the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) and Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE), the Group's performance dashboards for sustainability. The SSI is factored into every employee's short-term incentive plan. This ensures a high level of awareness and accountability from both employees and leaders.\n\n## 2.5.2.3 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric's overall aspiration to improve the lives of people everywhere in the world by developing sustainable energy solutions for its customers also extends to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) ambition. The DEI and Well-Being strategy focuses on engaging and impacting the individual, the organization, and society at large, via three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 'Sustain You': Schneider Electric is committed to making sure all employees feel safe to be their best selves in a culture that fosters trust, respect, and flexibility. Employees are empowered to prioritize their own well-being and mental health, invest in healthy ways of working, and role-model inclusive behaviors.\n- \u00b7 'Activate Schneider': Schneider Electric is committed to reflecting the diversity of the communities in which it operates. The Company continues its efforts to hardwire equity and inclusion at all stages of its Total Employee Experience, ensure fairness in people processes and policies, and foster a culture of care and inclusion at all levels.\n- \u00b7 'Impact Society & Planet': Schneider Electric is committed to driving change within its broader ecosystem and society at large, through advocacy and role-modelling. The Company works closely with its strategic partners and suppliers and invests in local actions through the Schneider Electric Foundation, with the goal of addressing systemic inequities and becoming a leader in corporate citizenship. Schneider Electric also engages in coalitions and partnerships to influence policy and play its part in building a society that embraces diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nWhile DEI is increasingly driven by local and regional regulation, with which the Group complies, other countries where Schneider Electric operates are encouraged to tackle additional DEI and well-being challenges specifically relevant to their markets and tailored to their needs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.5.2.4  A diverse workforce\n\n## 2.5.2.4.1 Gender balance\n\nSchneider Electric is strongly committed to building a diverse organization at every level. In that context, the Group has identified increasing the share of women in its workforce and leadership as an absolute priority.\n\nSchneider Electric's journey to become a more gender balanced organization began more than 10 years ago. The Group stated ambitions on increasing female representation in the overall workforce and in specific segments like leadership roles, and technical and sales functions. Because they are a key internal leadership talent pool, Schneider Electric has been focusing on hiring and including more women in sales and technical roles. As of end 2021, women made up 34% of IT roles with a hiring rate of 41%, and 17% of engineering roles, with a hiring rate of 27%. Similarly, as of end of 2021, women made up 21% of the sales population, with a 31% hiring rate. Overall, women account for 20% of revenueproducing roles at Schneider Electric, with a hiring rate of 30%.\n\nWhile significant progress has been made in the representation of women, especially on the Board and Executive Committee level (respectively, 42% and 44% female as of end of 2021), the Company recognizes that there is still a need to accelerate efforts at lower levels in the organization.\n\n## 2025 gender diversity commitment\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric renewed its commitment to gender balance with the 2021 - 2025 SSI gender balance KPI, 50/40/30 - women representing 50% of all new hires, 40% of frontline managers, and 30% of senior leadership by 2025.\n\nThis new commitment is both a testament to the progress the Group has made so far and a clear signal that it intends to doubledown on its efforts to achieve more gender balance across all levels of the organization.\n\nAt the leadership level, we focus on 30% representation because research has shown that 30% is the tipping point for diversity to have a real impact on teams. This approach is informed by critical mass theory, which takes its roots in physics, where a minimum 'critical mass' is needed to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. When it comes to diversity on teams, 30% has been identified as the critical mass number. To get to that level of representation in leadership, we need to build a strong pipeline for female talents to grow within the organization and access senior levels. This starts with a strong\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Total new hires - all new hires in 2021.\n\n**\n\nFrontline management - junior and mid-level management whose direct reports are individual contributors only.\n\n- ***  Leadership - Vice-Presidents and above.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\ncommitment to reach gender-balance in hiring and continues with efforts to promote and develop women internally.\n\nSchneider Electric is also committed to removing the structural and social barriers hindering women's career progression through a holistic strategy promoting gender equality in STEM and within the organization, and through targeted career development initiatives.\n\nIn 2019, the Company revitalized its commitment to gender equity in leadership roles and partnered with INSEAD to launch the Schneider Women Leaders' Program (SWLP) - a global program with a common cause, enabling more women at their mid-career point to build the skills and confidence to step up their leadership capability and impact. The SWLP program is a seven-month coaching and virtual workshop experience, culminating in a threeday virtual global summit, bringing the graduating women together with senior Schneider leaders and world-class business school faculty. Since its inception in 2019, more than 230 women have benefited from this targeted leadership development program.\n\nIn addition to SWLP, a new program called 'How Women Rise' was launched for Schneider employees in several countries. Over the last couple of years, this leadership program has benefitted more than 1000 women.\n\nEmployee Resource Networks (ERNs) also play a large role in empowering women locally and helping drive efforts to advance women in leadership. As of the end of 2021, local ERNs have contributed to the Group's efforts towards gender equality and inclusion in more than 40 countries.\n\n## Initiatives in France\n\nIn France, Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider Electric France (SEI-SEF) continue to partner with Elles Bougent (an association of women engineers), C G\u00e9nial Foundation (a foundation promoting STEM jobs), and MEDEF (union of employers) to promote technical roles in schools and break gender stereotypes around specific careers. Thanks to this French Women in Tech network set-up in 2014, as of the end of 2021, more than 100 technicians and female engineers have been able to meet with over 12,000 pupils, on Schneider Electric sites or virtually.\n\nIn 2019, SEI-SEF also launched an annual year-long mentoring program where high potential women are paired with senior leaders. The focus of this program is to increase both the promotion of female talents and their access to leadership positions. From 2019 to 2021, a total of 41 women have benefited from this initiative.\n\n2.",

This relationship provides networking and alliances with other leading organizations working to create opportunities for women engineers and technologists. This partnership with SWE provides recruitment, development, exposure, and leadership opportunities for Schneider Electric USA employees.\n\n## Initiatives in India\n\nIn India, through a program named 'Her Second Innings', Schneider Electric strives to leverage an untapped talent pool, by hiring women who are looking to re-enter the workforce after a career break. Schneider Electric Greater India also has a leadership development program, 'URJA' (which translates to 'Energy' in English), which is designed to harness the leadership skills of midcareer women employees identified as solid potentials. As of the end of 2021, about 600 women have participated in the program.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increase gender diversity in hiring (50%), front-line management (40%), and leadership teams (30%)\n\nIn line with its gender diversity goal, Schneider Electric is focused on building a robust female talent pipeline. The company has set bold 50/40/30 targets, committing to increase representation of women to reach 50% of all new hires, 40% of frontline managers, and 30% of leadership by 2025. This requires strategic planning, targeted talent development, accountability mechanisms, and most importantly, the support of everyone in the organization, starting with anyone involved in hiring or promotion decisions. This is why Schneider Electric ensures that its talent processes are fair and equitable, and the organization counts on each leader, when making a hiring or promotion decision, to help advance its overall goal to create a skilled and diverse workforce for the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.5.2.4.2  Diversity of ethnicities and nationalities\n\nSchneider Electric wants everyone, everywhere in the Company to have the same chance of success irrespective of their nationality, ethnicity, race, or location. The Group's multi-hub model is key to deliver on this ambition. Schneider Electric believes in a multilocal world with locally tailored solutions supported by diverse teams across the globe to best meet its customers' needs with customization, quality, and speed. In the 'next normal' world, with continued disruption and need for speed and agility, the multi-hub operating model is more relevant than ever. The opportunity for Schneider Electric to be the 'most local of global companies' with a balanced multi-hub footprint to enable customer proximity, innovation, speed, collaboration, and diversity, is a key differentiator for Schneider's long-term success.\n\nTo continue to reinforce the 'equity and equal opportunities' strategy and to reinforce its reputation as the most global of local companies, Schneider Electric ensures that its leadership footprint is in line with its business footprint. As of end of 2021, 34.5% of Schneider Electric' leadership team is from new economies, and 84% of country presidents are from the country or region they are leading.\n\nSchneider also has a global commitment on ethnicity and racial equity, with countries in the lead to drive ambition and actions. The goal set for racial equity and inclusion means:\n\n- \u00b7 Employee population is reflective of the communities operated by Schneider Electric, including at the leadership level;\n- \u00b7 Employees have equal opportunity for growth and training;\n- \u00b7 Everyone feels safe, valued, and respected for who they are, to be their authentic self.\n\nIn line with this goal, since 2021, Schneider Electric has been an active member of the Business for Inclusive Growth Partnership (B4IG) Working Group on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, whose first order of business was to gather best practices and develop guidelines to advance ethnic diversity and inclusion in the corporate world. These 'Operational Recommendations for Ethnic Diversity & Inclusion' were drafted collectively and endorsed by B4IG-participating CEOs in December 2021. They will serve as guidance while Schneider Electric continues to drive change in this area, at the global level.\n\n## Employees in New/Mature Economies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- New Economies\n- Mature Economies*\n- * Mature economies gather mainly Western Europe and North American countries.\n\n84%\n\nof Country Presidents are either local or regional (41 out of 49)",

Schneider Electric USA has committed to evolving the racial and ethnic diversity of its employee population, with specific representation targets in place. Schneider Electric USA continues to be a proud member of the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) Board of Corporate Affiliates (BCA), which provides recruitment, development, exposure, and leadership opportunities for its employees. To further accelerate progress, Schneider Electric USA launched a Racial Equity Task Force in June 2020. Under the stewardship of the Task Force, several projects have been developed in 2020/2021:\n\n- \u00b7 A sounding board team was created, examining how frontline manager hiring decisions are made and whether biases exist that create barriers to advancement for Black professionals;\n- \u00b7 The employee-led Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion task force worked on examining the current perceptions and experiences of diverse groups through quantitative and qualitative measures;\n- \u00b7 The Psychological Safety task force team identified a need for a 'Safety Zone,' a safe and confidential space to support employees on topics impacting their psychological safety (racism, microaggressions, inequities, mental health, etc.). The 'Safety Zone' will be implemented into a new US benefit for all US employees in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric USA debuted partnerships with two Historically Black Colleges & Universities (HBCUs), Tennessee State University and North Carolina A&T University, with the goal of hiring more diverse early-career talents.\n\n## 2.5.2.4.3 Generational diversity\n\nFor the five generations working at Schneider, the aim is to foster life-long career development and knowledge exchange for and across all generations to boost learning and innovation. Schneider is committed to creating new opportunities for the next generation (through, among other things, apprenticeships, internships, as well as its annual global student contest, Schneider Go Green in the City) and to harnessing the power of all generations, through tailored career development opportunities offered for each career stage (career week, coaching, development plans, reverse mentoring, etc.). For more information, see 2.5.3 Talent attraction and development, page 177.\n\n## Generation breakdown\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 2.5.2.4.4  Accessibility and inclusion for People with disabilities\n\nSchneider Electric is strongly committed to the inclusion of people with disabilities. In January 2021, Schneider Electric joined the International Labour Organization (ILO) Global Business and Disability Network and signed their charter, committing to promote and include people with disabilities throughout their operations worldwide.\n\nIn October 2021, in line with its commitment to digital accessibility, the Company debuted a new, more accessible version of its official website. In December 2021, in honor of the International Day of People with Disabilities, Schneider Electric organized a week-long global awareness campaign on the topic of disability and accessibility, educating employees about the diversity of disabilities and the actions allies can take to build an inclusive environment for all.\n\nAt Schneider Electric France, overall, employees with disabilities account for 5.25% of the direct workforce (as of end of 2020). Schneider Electric France worked closely with a diverse panel of partnerships to develop the employment of disabled people, internally and externally, including targeted schools or universities in order to develop the visibility of professional opportunities to young talents with disabilities. In 2021, the Company remained committed to the recruitment of people with disabilities, with the addition of 24 new apprentices and 11 new permanent workers. Schneider Electric France keeps a strong focus on raising awareness of invisible disabilities including cognitive disabilities and chronic diseases. The awareness campaign includes webinars, educational materials as well as specific web series.\n\nA new Agreement on People with Disabilities has been signed with unions in December, giving means and objectives for 3 years focused on more recruitments (100 in 3 years), more accessibility (physical and digital) and more collaborative actions to allow employees facing health issues to work.\n\nTo facilitate better communication in the context of the pandemic, all employees with hearing disabilities as well as their co-workers are still fitted with 'inclusive masks' that allow visibility of the lower face.\n\n## 2.5.2.4.5 LGBT+ inclusion\n\nIn March 2018, Schneider Electric committed to the United Nations Free and Equal Standards of Conduct for Business on Tackling Discrimination against Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans and Intersex People, standing up for equal rights and fair treatment for LGBT+ people everywhere.\n\nBy adopting these standards, the Group pledges to respect and stand up for the human rights of LGBT+ workers, customers, and members of the public; to support our LGBT+ employees and to prevent discrimination, including workplace discrimination, against LGBT+ people.\n\nIn June 2019, during Pride Month, the Company announced the launch of its global LGBT+ Employee Resource Network (ERN): Schneider LGBT+ and Allies. The Group is open to all - LGBT+ people and allies alike - with an interest to further inclusion in the workplace. In October 2020, in addition to its (virtual) celebration of Pride Month, Schneider Electric held its first global LGBT+ Awareness Month. Each week, video testimonials, podcasts, and educational materials were provided to all employees interested in learning and hearing from their LGBT+ colleagues. In June 2021, the Company celebrated Pride Month globally, with a campaign that focused on the concept of intersectionality.\n\n2.",

In 2022, Schneider Electric USA scored 90/100 on the Corporate Equality Index, the nation's foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBT+ workplace equality. Schneider Electric USA offers benefits to support LGBT+ community members including fertility and infertility care, adoption, surrogacy, gender reassignment surgeries, paid primary and secondary parental leave, and mental health support through free counseling sessions, online resources, digital therapy, coaching and more. All LGBT+ community members and allies are encouraged to present their authentic selves.\n\n## 2.5.2.5  An equitable, inclusive, and caring environment\n\n## 2.5.2.5.1  Being fair and equitable\n\nSchneider Electric wants its talent processes to be fair and equitable. Talent decisions are based on skills, values, performance, and potential. The Company counts on each leader to be fair and equitable when making a hiring or promotion decision to help advance its overall goal to create a skilled and diverse workforce for the future. The Company has built in reminders to check hidden bias and mitigate them through inclusive tips into its major human resource programs, including performance and salary review processes.\n\nFair and equitable pay is a core component of the Group's compensation philosophy, in line with the principle of equal pay for equal work. Since 2015, the Company has adopted a Global Pay Equity Framework - a global methodology to identify gender pay gaps within comparable groups of employees and lead a countrydriven approach to address gaps with appropriate corrective actions. With the help of this Framework, Schneider Electric has committed to reaching <1% pay gap for both females and males by 2025. As of end 2021, the pay gap was -1.61% for females and 1.11% for males, on track with target.\n\n- To learn more, please see page 182 . \u01f0\n\n## 2.5.2.5.2  Managing our unique lives and work\n\n## New Ways of Working\n\nSchneider Electric wants all employees to be able to manage their unique lives and work in the way that works best for them and has implemented several policies to this end.\n\nIn October 2020, Schneider Electric's Global Flexibility@Work Policy was refreshed, making it a global standard to work from home (WFH) two days a week for all eligible employees, and one day for employees working in distribution centers and plants, starting in 2021 (1) . The new global standard came in response to feedback in the Company's 2020 global employee survey in which a large proportion of employees stated that they preferred a hybrid work model (mix of WFH and 'work from office'). Additionally, the policy addresses hybrid work holistically, providing employees with mental health resources and training on best practices. This new policy reflects the broader shifts of a global, digital, and everchanging environment, and contributes to a more agile, inclusive, empowered, and trusting Company culture. As part of this new Flexibility@Work Policy, countries can explore additional measures such as flexible working hours, flexible holidays, part-time work, and volunteering. Some examples of Schneider Electric countries raising the global standards with no fixed limit on the number of WFH days are Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Slovakia, Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, operating with a fully flexible, output driven philosophy.\n\nAt the end of 2021, 99% of the countries have implemented the new Flexibility@Work policy covering 88% of Schneider Electric's workforce.\n\nIn addition to its Flexibility@Work Policy, Schneider Electric's Global Family Leave Policy supports all employees globally with personal time at critical life stages and empowers them to manage their unique life and work so that they can be at their best. While the Group's countries have flexibility to define eligibility and policy details per statutory/market requirements, the policy sets global minimum standards for paid parental leave (primary parent 12 weeks, secondary parent - 2 weeks), care leave (for sick/elderly relatives - 1 week); and bereavement leave (1 week). In 2020, the Group expanded its care leave from one to two weeks for our employees to care for their dependents diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n- For more information on our Global Family Leave policy, see page 184 'Global benefit standards'. \u01f0\n\nLastly, Schneider Electric has also implemented global benefits standards for all its employees. Schneider Electric regularly reviews compliance with its global benefit policies and principles to ensure that its inclusive global benefit standards are delivered for everyone, everywhere. These standards cover healthcare, family leave, and life cover.\n\n- To learn more on this, please refer to page 184 . \u01f0\n\n## 2.5.2.5.3  Promoting well-being and mental health Well-being in our DNA\n\nWell-being has been a strategic priority since 2015. Schneider Electric's well-being ambition is to create an environment where employees are empowered to manage their unique life and work by making the most of their energy.",

The current strategy tackles three areas of impact:\n\n- \u00b7 Overall Well-Being\n- \u00b7 Mental Health\n- \u00b7 New Ways of Working\n\nThe deepening and acceleration of these key avenues is supporting the hardwire recovery and care into organizational structure - for sustained high performance. 2021 has shown how the expertise in well-being, gained in the past six years, has evolved and translated into an increase of internal demand for consulting to leaders' teams to sustain and boost their performance.\n\nAwareness and training are essentials for this transformation. Back in 2020, Schneider Electric achieved its goal to reach 90% of employees having access to a comprehensive well-being at work program (including access to medical coverage and well-being training).\n\nEmployees have access to training in different topics such as new and smarter ways of working, the upside of stress, how to work in a hybrid world, mindfulness at work, energizing our people to perform, spotting the signs of mental health challenges, and using strengths to prevent burnout.\n\n## Holistic Approach - 4 Dimensions\n\n## Physical\n\n## Mental\n\nPhysical well-being is what we do with and to our bodies: sleep, fitness, nutrition, regular rest and renewal.\n\n## Emotional\n\nEmotional well-being is about cultivating and generating positive emotions: optimistic, engaged, happy, joyful, confident, enthusiastic, present, peaceful, relaxed, comfortable, serene.\n\nMental well-being is the ability to manage and train your mind: relax your mind, concentrate and focus, observe your mind, thoughts, beliefs, perceptions.\n\n## Social\n\nSocial well-being comes from connecting and supporting others, finding meaning in what you do, serving something larger than yourself, and living in alignment with your values.\n\nApproach: Training and researched practical applications based on Emotional Intelligence, Positive Psychology, Neuroscience and Mindfulness\n\n## Mental health in the workplace\n\nAccording to the World Economic Forum, the cost of mental health is projected to rise up to 230% by 2030. Beyond the economic aspect, it is imperative for corporations to tackle the mental health topics, even more so after the effects the pandemic.\n\nSince 2019, mental health is part of the global well-being agenda of Schneider Electric, raising awareness within the organization about its importance and aligning with the World health Organization's definition and World Mental Health Day.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nFirst, the Company provides all employees with a playbook supported by a series of trainings in several languages to equip employees and managers with knowledge of how to deal with Mental Health challenges.\n\nIn addition, for the third year, a global mental health campaign was organized during the month of October using the tagline 'Mental Health Matters':\n\n- \u00b7 Internally, more than 10,000 employees worldwide participated in different activities and trainings to learn more about how to take care of their mental health and boost their resilience.\n- \u00b7 Externally, testimonies about personal practices from the Chairman & CEO, executive team, and Senior Vice-Presidents on social media using the hashtag #MentalHealthMatters reached over 300,000 people.\n- \u00b7 In addition, over the year, specific sessions have been held on 'Spot the signs of Mental Health Challenges' for HR and Health & Safety people as the key support functions for this topic.\n\nMindfulness practice is an important aspect of the mental health initiative. A global mindfulness team comprised of volunteers across the organization drives various events, globally and locally, to support employees. In 2021, during the October mental health campaign, 18 global Mindfulness practice sessions were organized, in English, Spanish, French, and Italian, and four regional sessions for South Eastern Europe and Central & South America.\n\nIn 2022 the learning and awareness ambition will continue through a mandatory training for all employees 'We All have Mental Health', which consists in understanding what mental health means, learning to recognize the signs of mental health challenges, and how to act upon these signs.\n\n## 2.5.2.5.4  Building a culture of inclusion and respect\n\nIn 2018, with the launch of its Global Anti-Harassment Policy, the Group formalized its zero-tolerance stance on harassment. The policy explicitly prohibits any kind of harassment (sexual or non-sexual) in the workplace, and states that 'no Schneider Electric employee shall be subjected to harassment, victimization or retaliation based on - including but not limited to - race, sex, national origin, religion, political opinion, age, medical status, disability, gender, marital status, pregnancy, sexual orientation or gender identity'. The policy sets clear and consistent expectations of workplace conduct, outlines the roles and responsibilities of employees, managers, and witnesses in creating a workplace free of harassment, and highlights the different reporting channels available to all to report incidents, while maintaining confidentiality and protection against retaliation. Lastly, the policy lays out the type of corrective or disciplinary actions that can be taken in case of discriminatory behavior or harassment, or failure to report such incidents.\n\n- To learn more on the different reporting channels employees can use to report incidents, see section 2.3. 'Ethics and Compliance' page 95 . \u01f0\n\nIn alignment with its Trust Charter, and Global Anti-Harassment Policy, Schneider Electric has developed a comprehensive education approach to build inclusive teams and leaders at every level.

Through an e-workout on 'Overcoming Hidden bias', participants learn to understand what hidden bias means, explore clear steps to keep their decision-making objective, and learn how to proactively call out bias when they see it in others.\n- \u00b7 Since 2021, all employees are also required to take a mandatory e-learning on 'Building a Culture of Respect' (30 minutes). Through this training, participants explore the importance of building a culture of respect, learn to recognize the different forms of harassment, and understand the actions they need to take (as employees and managers) when witnessing such conduct. At the end of 2021, 98% of employees had completed this training.\n- \u00b7 Lastly, Schneider Electric frequently reminds employees of our diversity, equity, and inclusion values through specific nudges (articles, videos, white papers, etc.). These nudges build on the content of the aforementioned e-learnings and provide employees with practical tips and real-world examples to help them build inclusion.\n\n## 2.5.2.5.5 Impacting society and advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion\n\nSchneider Electric is committed to driving change within its broader ecosystem and society at large, through advocacy and rolemodelling. The Company works closely with its strategic partners and suppliers and invests in local actions through the Schneider Electric Foundation, with the goal of addressing systemic inequities and becoming a leader in corporate citizenship. Schneider Electric USA has committed to diversifying its supply chain through its Supplier Diversity program (see section '2.2.11.4.7 US diversity program with suppliers' page 123).\n\nSchneider Electric is also very open in its journey to progress diversity, equity, and inclusion within the Company and beyond and shares its progress both internally and externally.\n\nInternally, this includes raising awareness by familiarizing employees with the Company's data, commitments, and various partnerships and initiatives. In 2021, employees celebrated International Women's Day, Pride Month, International Men's Day, and Global Mental Health Day, and led awareness campaigns for LGBT+ inclusion and accessibility for people with disabilities.\n\nSchneider Electric is also engaged in various partnership to be an agent of change within the private sector and beyond:\n\n- \u00b7 In May 2021, Schneider Electric renewed its long-standing partnership with United Nations Women through the newly launched Generation Equality Forum (GEF). The GEF is a global multi-stakeholder initiative that brings together representatives from the private sector, Member States, United Nations Entities, and civil societies, including youth organizations and networks, to accelerate progress for gender equality around the world. As part of the GEF 'Economic Justice and Rights' Coalition, the Company has committed, through the Schneider Electric Foundation, to support the training of 5,000 women in the energy trades and their self-employment or access to jobs, through specialized partnerships, and to launch two new international initiatives to train and empower women in the energy field by end 2022. As part of the 'Feminist Movements and Leadership' Coalition, and in alignment with its SSI 50/40/30 target, Schneider has committed to reach 45/29/26; that is, women representing 45% of its new hires, 29% of its frontline managers, and 26% of its leaders by the end of 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 In addition, Schneider Electric has also committed to the United Nations Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) and in 2019, became the first multinational company to achieve 100% commitment to the WEPs across its global leadership team. All new country leaders now make this commitment as part of their onboarding process.\n- \u00b7 In 2021, the Company officially joined the World Economic Forum's Partnership for New Work Standards; a global, crossindustry partnership aiming to pave the way in building a healthy, resilient, and equitable future of work.\n- \u00b7 Lastly, since 2020, Schneider Electric is a member of the Gender and Diversity KPI Alliance (GDKA), a group of DEI advocates, corporations, academics, and trade organizations that support the adoption and use of a set of KPIs to measure gender and other types of diversity in their organizations.\n\n## 2.5.2.6 Recognitions and awards\n\nSchneider Electric has been included in the 2021 and 2022 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the fourth and fifth year in a row.

The growth of the Group's businesses in markets around the world, in conjunction with the rapidly evolving 'next normal', requires an acceleration of skill development to prepare for greater organizational agility, develop leaders who build human connections in a digital world, and shape the workforce of the future.\n\nThe Group strives to be recognized as an employer of choice to attract the best talent and to be a market leader for talent development for people of all walks of life, ages, and cultures. Key programs are in place to invest in the attraction and development of people, creating opportunities and the environment for people to learn and grow, while enabling employees to own their development, taking responsibility to build critical skills to keep up with the changing world, supported by their manager and enabled by digital tools. This mitigates the risk of skill gaps and supports overall retention of employees. Focusing on critical skills to drive results and innovation for customers helps keep the businesses ahead of the competition. The opportunity for Schneider Electric to have a balanced multi-hub footprint will be a key differentiator for talent attraction and retention, especially with regards to career development and opportunities for our local and regional talents.\n\n## 2.5.3.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric believes that all employees are talent and empowers people to grow to their fullest potential, developing new skills and building careers for today and tomorrow, enabled by our multi-hub organization. Establishing a strong brand as an employer is communicated in the EVP (Meaningful, Inclusive, Empowered); the promise to current and future employees, driven and anchored by a meaningful purpose. In addition, the Group invests in learning and development for the wider ecosystem, including universities and schools, partners, customers, and the wider community.\n\nThe Group has a two-pronged approach to talent development, in order to prepare the workforce of the future - for all employees and for specific target groups.\n\n- \u00b7 For all employees , the Group ensures there are tools and processes in place to set individual performance and development goals, access learning and development opportunities for their current role as well as future roles and explore diverse career paths around the world. #LearnEveryDay as one of the Core Values sets the tone for employees to be open to new challenges and continue to upskill for themselves, their teams, and their communities. In the OneVoice employee survey, 75% of employees were favorable to being able to renew their skills through learning and development opportunities at Schneider.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n- \u00b7 For specific groups of talent , there is a strong focus on high potentials, early career talent, and a new pilot program for talent who are in a later stage in their professional career. An annual talent review process operates across the Company to help ensure high potential talent, including technical and digital talent, is identified, recognized, and supported with an accelerated development path. There are also targeted programs for specific skills to support our commercial, digital, and leadership transformations and equip our blue-collar workers for the supply chain of the future.\n\nIn the next normal, the role of leaders to transform culture, build great teams, and deliver impact is more critical than ever. The 2021 Culture & Leadership survey of around 2,000 Schneider leaders validated steady progress on the overall Group leadership and culture transformation started in 2017. Key strengths include strong ethics and integrity, sense of purpose, and customer focus, as well as positive spirit and willingness to go above and beyond. Moving forward, the Group has identified four resets for leaders that require a renewed focus for the next normal. In this context, the Leadership Expectations were refreshed in Q4 2021 to emphasize the collective focus for leaders to disrupt, accelerate, coach, and collaborate.\n\n## 2.5.3.3 Governance\n\nThe Executive Committee discusses the overall health of the leadership pipeline and succession strength for top positions on an annual basis. In addition, the Executive Committee meets regularly to make critical selection and succession decisions and review specific talent attraction and development strategies, for example digital talent and global top potential talent. This is supported by integrated HR information systems and analytics platforms which provide data and analysis in the areas of workforce planning and talent management. In addition, Regional, Business, and Function People Committees also meet regularly to review talent in their perimeter.\n\n## 2.5.3.4  Attracting talent to shape the workforce of the future\n\nIn the next normal, attracting talent at all levels is more critical than ever to enable delivery of the Group strategy and continually innovate for our customers. To support the increased focus on talent acquisition, the Group invested in a new talent acquisition tool in 2021 which is enabling digital and borderless pipelines of talent and powering a seamless digital experience to help us compete in the market for top talent. So far, this has resulted in a 1,000% increase in talent joining our talent network, and a 95% reduction in time to apply. Deployment will continue into 2022.\n\n## Our Leadership Expectations 2.0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBUILD THE BEST TEAM\n\nCoach and Care\n\nACHIEVE TOGETHER\n\nCollaborate to Win\n\nSHAPE OUR FUTURE\n\nDisrupt ahead of the curve\n\nUSE YOUR JUDGEMENT\n\nEmpower and Trust\n\n2.",

As part of SSI/uni00A0#10, our five-year ambition is to grow the early-career pipeline by two times. This involves leveraging traditional approaches today but migrating to more digital, borderless, and self-paced offers, ensuring the Company can de-bias practices and create a more equal playing field for those interested in Schneider and sustainability. This will be achieved through flagship global programs and partnerships, supplemented by country-specific initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 Schneider Global Virtual Student Experience: A completely digital experience designed to provide students with a way to engage with Schneider Electric through e-learning modules and on project simulations that mirror the skills and qualities that are important to our mission and when serving customers.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Go Green: an annual global competition for business and Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) students around the world to find innovative solutions for energy management and automation. Over the past ten years, Schneider Go Green has had over 117,400 registrants and more than 21,700 students have submitted ideas from 172 countries. In 2021 alone, more than 25,400 students registered with close to 2,800 students submitted their ideas, proving that Go Green continues to be consistent in developing strong and increasing interest from students for this contest, especially from emerging economies.\n- \u00b7 Development programs around the world that are structured to help support the acceleration of early career talent through a robust training and development path including graduate programs, internships, apprenticeships, and co-ops.\n- \u00b7 Sponsorship initiatives, virtual Careers Fairs, office/site tours, Innovation Summit tours, digital and face-to-face speaking engagements and networking opportunities, mentoring relationships.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2x number of opportunities for interns, apprentices, and fresh graduate hires\n\nSchneider Global Virtual Student Experience In 2021, the Company ran a digital and borderless learning experience, providing opportunities to the next generation of talent broken into three phases: skills building through professional e-learning courses, project simulation using genuine business problems, and feedback and coaching from Schneider Electric employees. This resulted in 1.6 million impressions and 5k+ registrations, growing the next generation pipeline of talent in key skill areas: digital, sustainability, services, supply chain, and electronics/R&D.\n\nBaseline\n\n2025 target\n\n4,939\n\nx2.00\n\n2021 Progress\n\nx1.25\n\n## 2.5.3.5  Driving high performance\n\nSchneider Electric's approach to performance and development is anchored by the Group's Core Values, and for leaders, by the Leadership Expectations. The approach encourages learning and growth, enabling employees to reach their full potential individually, as teams, and as a Company. The Group's robust process of setting individual performance and development goals annually with regular reviews during the year provides everyone with a clear roadmap to deliver with impact based on the 'what' and the 'how' to ultimately achieve collective success. Schneider Electric employees are encouraged to seek, give, and receive feedback, empowering them to take ownership for driving their individual performance, and managers are encouraged to support them with coaching and frequent conversations, driving the business forward. In 2021, 98% of eligible employees completed a performance and development review.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.5.3.6  Enabling sustainable careers\n\nDeveloping employees in their current role and for future roles is critical to enable growth of the Group's businesses. In line with the belief that all employees are talent, Schneider Electric believes that all employees should take ownership of their own unique career development, whatever the stage of their career, supported by their managers and enabled by digital tools. To empower and engage employees with this approach, Schneider Electric held its first Career Week for all employees in 2021. Over 250 events took place with employees participating from over 90 countries, sharing career stories, having career check-in conversations with their manager, learning about different roles and skills, and being equipped with tools and resources to develop, grow, and shape their future. 95% of employees surveyed were positive about the event, especially appreciating the time to discuss and learn about career development.",

To harness the power of all generations, in addition to career programs for early talent, pilot programs for talent in the later stages of their professional career started in four countries in 2021. The intention is to support talent in the later stages of their professional career to have meaningful and fulfilling development and recognize and leverage their unique expertise and experience to boost learning and innovation across generations. The plan is to expand the pilot programs to more countries in 2022. This ambition is reflected in SSE/uni00A0#23.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Access to meaningful career development programs for >90% employees during later stages of their career\n\nSchneider Electric want to recognize and support talent who are near the later stages of their professional career to strengthen key skills, leverage expertise and ensure knowledge exchange. The strategy and approach has been defined in 2021 and 'personas' based on employee motivations have been established. Ten entities have been identified to pilot the program in 2022 including France, Germany, Japan, Denmark, UK & Ireland, China, India and Australia. Programs will be anchored by a robust career plan and development options that may include flexible work, upskilling, career pivots, personal planning, or workplace adjustments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAn annual talent review process operates across the Company to discuss employee performance and potential, and their development. This process also ensures that high potential individuals are identified and supported with an accelerated development path to realize their full career potential. High potential individuals are identified by managers as demonstrating high levels of performance and career growth potential over time, with the ability to deliver transformational impact with others in a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) world. Structured succession planning for leadership and critical roles helps to accelerate individual career development while maintaining continuity for the organization. In selecting and developing talent, an important consideration is also to foster diversity such as gender and nationalities (new economies as well as mature economies), as well as building the pipeline for leadership roles and technical expertise. Towards the end of the talent review process across the entities, there is an aggregated review with the Executive Committee to discuss the overall health of the leadership pipeline and succession strength for top positions.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nThe Group has an expert program to recognize individual employees who have demonstrated outstanding achievement, expertise, and leadership throughout the Company. Schneider Electric strongly believes that its position as a global technology and innovation company is driven by the innovative contributions of its creative employees. The expert program offers them a chance to continue to extend their contribution and increase their impact and exposure to the Group's strategy. Employees in this program are identified as Level 1 - Expert, Level 2 - Senior Expert, or Level 3 - Master Expert.\n\nThe Group actively promotes a learning and teaching culture by developing its internal trainer capability. There has been a strong focus on equipping internal trainers to develop and facilitate virtual classroom training, including using tools such as Klaxoon and BlendedX for additional interaction and engagement. A Global Virtual Internal Trainer Conference was organized in September with the purpose to recognize, develop, and connect internal trainers. It was a day-long conference providing sessions on facilitation skills, creating impactful presentations, and how to create impact virtually, with a Keynote speaker from MIT-Sloan. There are currently over 5,500 identified internal trainers who collectively delivered over 20,000 sessions in 2021, accounting for 71% of formal training. Additionally, the Company currently has over 250 communities of practice as part of the Communities@Work program. These communities promote a new way of working, with employees coming together to share activities on a specific professional topic, solving problems, innovating, and learning together.\n\n## 2.5.3.7  Upskilling for today and tomorrow\n\nThe Group recognizes skills are rapidly becoming outdated, especially vital technical and digital skills required to accelerate our business growth. Roles requiring digital and human skills are growing due to the rise of AI, automation, and digitization. Purposeful renewal of skills is necessary to ensure sustainable careers and a resilient, future-ready business. To support this ambition, business, and function academies are in place to partner with the business in identifying learning needs and spotting gaps in core and future skills for relevant employee populations. They develop and promote learning and development opportunities based on the 3E model (education, exposure, and experience). Key programs include:\n\n## Consultative Selling:\n\nThe Commercial Excellence Academy has created a blended and fully digital learning curriculum to enable sales teams to build trusted advisor relationships with business decision makers. This consistent, repeatable & consultative approach drives sustainable & profitable growth, champions digitization and enables customer success. As such, this program is a key pillar in the overall customer-centric commercial transformation at Schneider Electric. At the heart of the Consultative Selling approach is understanding customers' undiscovered pain points by conducting strategic sales dialogues through effective questioning strategy and then articulating outcome-based results and benefits to those customer challenges. This sales culture transformation is a paradigm shift in the way sales teams engage with customers and requires a robust learning intervention on skillset, toolset, and mindset, all of which are stitched together in the learning journey. Additionally, the program is complemented by a robust module for sales managers, named Coaching for Consultative Selling Approach, which ensures that the managers are able to coach and develop the team members constantly as they navigate this transformation, developing best-in class consultative mindset.\n\n2.",

As a result of the program, 93% of managers say they have observed the participants using the consultative approach consistently while engaging with customers. Given the success and impact of the program in 2021, the program has been adapted and extended to other teams including tendering, customer care and customer facing roles in Global Supply Chain to ensure adoption end to end of a more consultative approach to engage and interact with customers.\n\n## Leadership for Profitable Growth:\n\nWith a fast-changing, rapidly digitizing industry and customer base, Schneider Electric faces a challenge of transformation and performance. The Executive Committee committed to the market to significantly increase both top and bottom line and set a goal to rapidly align, educate, and mobilize the top 1,000 leaders across the company to drive for this outcome. As the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world, severely disrupting supply chains, customer engagements, business continuity and sales, through the design and rapid deployment of the 'Leadership for Profitable Growth' program, Schneider was able to both continue to drive its business profitably in extraordinary circumstances, whilst delivering critical business, strategic, and financial acumen learning to its executive leadership in a 100% digital solution.\n\nThe Leadership for Profitable Growth executive masterclass combines:\n\n- \u00b7 Markets & Financial theory with a finance professor\n- \u00b7 Schneider applications in the context of the company's three core business models\n- \u00b7 A business game simulation designed to engage leaders in competitive learning for optimizing share price performance\n\nThe result has been above competitor performance, a substantial increase in business literacy, and a more commercially capable executive leadership population prepared to deliver in the most challenging market circumstances. The program has also been recognized by the industry at the 2021 Brandon Hall Group HCM Excellence Awards with the Leadership for Profitable Growth masterclass winning Gold in the 'Best Unique or Innovative Learning and Development Program' category and two Silver awards.\n\nBuilding on the 83% Learner Promoter Score, in 2021, the program has been progressively cascaded to other leadership levels in the Group. Almost 1,500 leaders in total have now completed the program.\n\n## Foundational digital skills for all employees:\n\nDigital is a must to succeed in this VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, ambiguous) world and our employees are key to support the business transformation. The Group has set the goal to achieve >90% employees undergo digital upskilling through the Digital Citizenship program and digital transformation training by 2025 (SSE/uni00A0#22). This commitment to growing the digital mindset and digital skills of all employees, enabling them to become 'digital citizens' was introduced in the Digital Citizenship framework in 2018. This provided an understanding of the digital baseline of all employees. A smart learning solution 'Boost Your Digital Knowledge' was launched in 2020, by the Digital Academy, designed for employees to self-assess and evaluate strength and development areas, followed by learning suggestions to upskill in key digital areas based on individual results. In 2021,\n\n20,100+ employees completed the Boost Your Digital Knowledge assessment. Specifically for Global Supply Chain, a Digital Acumen Quiz has been designed according to the digital citizen competency requirement. This quiz recommends related e-learning if results are below a certain threshold. This quiz also helps to objectively measures an employee's digital citizenship level within the function. For workers, the SSE/uni00A0#22 goal is to achieve >90% completion of two hours of training per year on digital transformation.\n\nSupporting these programs and available any time, the Digital Citizenship Learning Corner empowers employees to own their development as digital citizens by exploring and completing courses as needed by topic, persona, and/or function. In total, the Group had 171,800+ completions by over 29,700 employees on digital foundational knowledge. A special attention is given to the blue collars in the plants and distribution centers by implementing physical learning corners in each site with individual access to the learning platform with dedicated, multi-language content.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The tool leverages AI (Artificial Intelligence) to match the supply and demand of internal talent with a transparent, digital, and borderless approach, empowering employees to drive their own careers by discovering opportunities for mentoring, new positions, and part-time projects, as well as potential career paths. The ambition for usage is to increase 3x the number of employee-driven development interactions in the OTM by 2025 (SSE/uni00A0#21). At the end of 2021, 71% of eligible employees are registered on the platform and 25% of those have engaged in some type of opportunity since registration. Through OTM in 2021, 553 employees have been given visibility to over 1,100 open positions, 3,229 mentoring relationships were formed and 3,248 part-time project roles were assigned. OTM's Career Planning functionality was launched in June 2021 and almost 20,000 employees visited the feature before the end of the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4x the number of employee-driven development interactions on the Open Talent Market\n\nTestimonial from Randy Kesel, Customer Project Specialist, North America Operations.\n\n'Since OTM opened a couple of years ago, it has steadily grown as a user-friendly tool to help Schneider employees realize their potential. There are abundant opportunities for anyone that wants to take their career to the next level, whether that is participating in a project, finding a new position, or taking on a mentoring role. I really think the new Career Planning feature will be a game changer for anyone that wants to map out future role suggestions and how to get there. I've frequently used OTM to find new projects, such as the NAM OTM Champions Community, and to stay informed of open positions within the company.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider Electric also has an open learning ecosystem comprised of interconnected platforms at the center of which is My LearningLink (MLL). This platform integrates e-learning, webinars, social learning, classroom learning, assessments, and full certification paths. The Group continues to see an increase in usage and an increase in digital learning. In 2021 there were:\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n- \u00b7 More than 147,000 employees with access to the system;\n- \u00b7 More than 74,000 employees visiting MLL every month;\n- \u00b7 More than 24,000 modules of learning content available in more than one language;\n- \u00b7 Digital learning consumption at 73% for all employees and 79% for connected employees, stable compared to 2020 and an increase of 45% on 2019.\n\nMy LearningLink was made available to all employees on mobile in 2021 (as well as on desktop) and is also now integrated with MS Teams to enable learning in the flow of work. Schneider also continues the program to connect shop floor workers to the Schneider Electric network, either from a computer or kiosk installed in our facilities called 'Digital Learning Corner' or from their mobile phone.\n\nOnline training content to Schneider Electric's partners is also delivered via My LearningLink. The mySchneider Partner Portal is deployed in 140 countries and provides a customized learning experience with targeted training content that is most relevant to the different personas in partners' businesses. The training portal is accessible to over one million Schneider Electric partners, distributors, resellers, and customers who have completed close to 1.4 million courses since its inception in 2015.\n\n## 2.5.3.9  Recognitions and awards\n\nSchneider Electric achievements include:\n\n- \u00b7 Brandon Hall Excellence Awards in Learning Gold and Silver for the 'Leadership for Profitable Growth' program dedicated to our top leaders.\n- \u00b7 Fortune recognized Schneider as one of the 'World's Most Admired Companies', ranking #3 within the Electronics Industry in 2021.\n- \u00b7 Universum, university student specialized ranking, recognized Schneider as #24 in their 'World's Most Attractive Employers 2021' ranking amongst engineering students.\n- \u00b7 Fortune ranked Schneider #40 on their 'Change the World' list in 2021.\n- \u00b7 Great Place to Work certified Schneider Electric in the US, Colombia, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, and Vietnam.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric Chairman & CEO, Jean-Pascal Tricoire, was named as 'Glassdoor Top CEOs 2021' ranking #2 in France and #8 in Canada.\n- \u00b7 Schneider's Glassdoor rating is on a steady growth, up to 4.2 at the end of 2021, recognizing Schneider Electric France as one of the Best Place to Work for 2021:\n- - In 2016, Schneider's rating was at 3.5 and increased to 3.7 and 4.0 in subsequent years, leading to 4.2 at the end of 2021, out of a 5 points scale.

Its inclusive reward portfolio is designed to support employees to be at their best, and it goes beyond pay and benefits. It's a meaningful mix of programs to engage employees, including recognition to celebrate great work, incentives to reward high performance, an award-winning employee share ownership plan, and benefits to suit employees and their dependents.\n\nSchneider Electric ensures that all compensation and benefits decisions and policies are based on these above principles and follow local statutory and collective agreements.\n\nSchneider Electric believes in rewarding, recognizing, and differentiating fairly employees who contribute to the success and live the values of the Company. By putting recognition at the center of a high-performance ambition, employees feel engaged and motivated to do more. Delivering high performance is rewarded by competitive market pay, incentive programs, employee shareholding, and opportunities to grow careers within Schneider Electric.\n\nThe Group offers a portfolio of benefits to care for employees' needs at each life stage. Its diverse and multi-generational workforce is provided with meaningful choices covering a holistic range of well-being, flexibility, and financial protections to provide peace of mind to employees and their dependents.\n\n## 2.5.4.3 Compensation\n\n## 2.5.4.3.1  Our job architecture and compensation process\n\nThe Company has implemented a global job architecture to support HR processes and programs and to enable Schneider Electric to engage, develop, and move talents across different businesses and geographies. The job architecture provides alignment to market practice and organizational structure to ensure the reward package offered for a role is fair and competitive. This helps working towards creating greater transparency for career development and progression.\n\n## 2.5.4.3.2  Pay competitively and pay-forperformance\n\nSchneider Electric employees are empowered to receive ongoing feedback, recognition, and coaching from their managers, and their individual performance is assessed in a fair manner based on their goals and behaviors. In line with the Group's pay-forperformance philosophy, the compensation structure typically includes fixed and variable (incentive) elements. Compensation programs and decisions are based on individual performance and behaviors, Company performance, and competitive market positioning.\n\n## 2.5.4.3.3  Equal pay for equal work\n\nAt Schneider Electric, the basic foundational principles of fairness, equity, ethics, and transparency are fully embedded in our values. Through reward policies and processes, employees are compensated fairly and equitably for the skill set they possess and value contributions as a business imperative. Over the past five years, proactive actions have been taken to not only close gender pay gaps, but to prevent new gaps from being created.\n\nTo ensure accountability and transparency, Schneider Electric conducts quarterly reviews of compensation, both at country and global levels, leveraging analysis from HR data, which covers all key drivers of the employee lifecycle from hiring, performance assessment, and salary adjustment to career moves. Focusing on this Pay Equity Ecosystem allows Schneider Electric to proactively create offers for new hires and promotions that do not create pay gaps. The global pay equity framework was implemented in all countries by the end of 2020, covering 99.6% of Schneider Electric's total workforce.\n\nGiven the progress made on pay equity and to support our inclusion philosophy, starting in 2021 the focus on pay equity has gone beyond gender. The ambition to attain and maintain a pay gap below 1% by 2025 for both females and males has been included as part of the SSE/uni00A0#18 for 2021 - 2025. Our baseline as of the end of 2020 is -1.73% and +1.00% for females and males respectively. As of the end of 2021, the pay gap was -1.61% for females and 1.11% for males, on track with target. Note that this measurement will differ from Country figures that may be required to be reported due to statutory requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.5.4.3.4 Living wage\n\nIn line with its Human Rights Policy and Trust Charter, Schneider Electric believes earning a living wage is a basic human right and a key element to decent work. Schneider Electric is committed to paying all employees at or above the living wage to meet their families' basic needs. By basic needs, the Group considers food, housing, sanitation, education, healthcare, plus discretionary income for a given local standard of living.\n\nIn 2018, Schneider Electric started working with an independent advisor - Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) - to implement its living wage commitment as part of its fair and equitable policies. Schneider Electric has initiated a global process to analyze wage levels and employment practices against local living wage standards set by BSR. Moving forward into 2020, the COVID-19 crisis highlighted even more strongly the need for a safety net to guarantee a minimum income level for employees. Given the complexity to evaluate and mitigate the macroeconomic impact of the crisis, the Group did not run a gap analysis that year. In 2021, the new gap analysis covered 63 countries (representing over 99% of Schneider Electric footprint globally). As of December 31 st , 99.9% of in scope employees, i.e. all Schneider employees treated as permanent workforce, were paid at least a living wage. Where living wage gaps were identified, corrective actions were taken to ensure that all employees are paid a living wage and no new gaps are created. In addition to guaranteeing that all in scope employees are paid at least a living wage, Schneider continues to comply with all applicable federal, state and local regulations regarding minimum wage requirements.\n\nFrom 2021 onwards, the Group reiterated its commitment to pay 100% of employees at least a living wage as part of its SSE/uni00A0#20. This commitment will be audited annually with the support of an independent third party. Schneider Electric also continues to be part of leading corporate coalitions and notably became a Decent Work patron for the UN Global Compact. These global coalitions work together to implement living wage standards within their workforce and their entire ecosystem.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 100% of employees paid at least a living wage\n\nThe UN Global Compact announced its new 2021-2023 strategy, which aims to accelerate and scale up the global collective impact of business by upholding the Global Compact Ten Principles and the SDGs through accountable companies and enabling ecosystems. Given that Schneider Electric is a leader in providing and promoting a living wage, the UN Global Compact invited Schneider Electric to become a Patron of its Decent Work portfolio. The Group's role will be key to raise the bar by advancing decent work for its ecosystem and other companies.\n\nBaseline\n\n2025 target\n\n99%\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\n2021 Progress\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 2.5.4.3.5 Short-term incentive\n\nFor employees, the annual short-term incentive is linked with the overall Company performance and individual objectives. It is designed to encourage and motivate employees to deliver on collective ambitions through accountability and collaboration, driving better performance collectively and individually. With a strong sustainability component, the annual short-term incentives for the Group's executives and c. 64,000 eligible employees focus on what matters to Schneider Electric. Since 2011, sustainability performance criteria have been embedded in the incentive goals for Group executives. They are directly linked to the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) targets.\n\nFrom 2019, the weight of the SSI criteria has increased from 6% to 20% in the collective part of the annual short-term incentive highlighting further the importance of sustainability on Schneider Electric's business agenda. In France, since 2012, the SSI has also been included in the profit-sharing incentive plan for the French entities, Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider Electric France. The reduction in the occupational accidents severity rate is also considered in the profit-sharing incentive plans of 24 other French entities.\n\nTo promote a superior sales culture where sales people go above and beyond to surprise and delight customers, Schneider Electric offers levels of differentiated reward for sales people to enhance motivation and results.\n\n## 2.5.4.3.6 Long-term incentive\n\nSchneider Electric's long-term incentive plan offers share ownership opportunities to the Group's key talents and critical roles to align their rewards with the interests and experience of Schneider Electric shareholders. Similar to the short-term incentive, a portion of the award under the long-term incentive plan is subject to the achievement of sustainability objectives. From 2020, the long-term sustainability performance is measured through the Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI), a combination of external indices which cover a range of environmental, social, and governance indicators wider than and different from the SSI criteria included in the annual incentive plan. See more details on SSERI in Chapter 4.2 'Compensation Report', page 311.\n\n## 2.5.4.3.7  Recognition is in our DNA\n\nEvery day, Schneider Electric employees are making important contributions to help the organization achieve its mission and key business results. The global recognition portal 'Step Up' gives employees a way to formally recognize and celebrate people who consistently demonstrate the Company's Core Values and go above and beyond. Schneider Electric creates a culture where employees receive regular feedback and coaching from their managers and colleagues and encourages the recognition of small and big achievements by simply saying 'thank you'.\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric celebrated five successful years of the Step Up program. Throughout the year, the recognition culture remained strong, with many employees continuing to utilize the dedicated platform to appreciate and recognize colleagues. In 2021, over 600,000 recognition moments were recorded, acknowledging Schneider Electric employees living the Core Values around the world.\n\n2.",

Schneider ensures that all employee benefits are locally and globally compliant, as well as market relevant. Because employee benefit plans vary significantly between countries due to different levels of social, tax, and legal regulations, Schneider Electric's benefits portfolio is primarily country-driven and aims at providing similar benefits within a country territory.\n\n## 2.5.4.4.1  Global benefit standards\n\nSchneider Electric regularly reviews compliance with its global benefit policies and principles to ensure that its inclusive global benefit standards are delivered for everyone, everywhere. These standards cover healthcare, family leave, and life cover and are audited in the SSI.\n\nOne of Schneider Electric's underlying benefit objectives is to ensure all its employees are equipped to manage their basic health and well-being and to provide adequate security to employees and their dependents. Health and well-being are embedded in the Schneider Electric strategic people priorities and contribute to its sustainability mission. The Group is committed to provide its employees access to a comprehensive well-being at work program - translated into a dual standard of access to healthcare and wellbeing training programs (detailed further in subsection 'Well-being in our DNA', page 174). Access to an inclusive and comprehensive standard of healthcare coverage (outpatient, hospitalization, key health risks/chronic conditions, maternity, children) is defined by local regulations and employment agreements. Schneider Electric also supports its employees with personal time off at critical life stages and this is fully deployed in 100% of countries as detailed below. In addition, the Group commits to provide financial security to employee dependents, in the event of an employee's death, in the form of a minimum standard of life assurance coverage of at least a multiple equivalent to one year's salary.\n\nSchneider Electric has reaffirmed and enhanced its existing global benefit standards outlined above for all our employees worldwide, for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis. This included a global extension of care leave from one to two weeks for our employees to care for their dependents diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n## Global Family Leave Policy\n\nAs part of being a caring and responsible employer, Schneider Electric launched its global family leave policy along with care leave in 2017. With its industry-leading Global Family Leave Policy, Schneider Electric supports employees with personal time at critical life stages and empowers everyone to manage their 'unique life and work' so that they can be at their best. While the Group's countries have flexibility to define eligibility and policy details per statutory/market requirements, the policy sets global minimum standards:\n\n- \u00b7 Fully paid parental leave (primary parent - 12 weeks, secondary parent - 2 weeks);\n- \u00b7 Care leave (for sick/elderly relatives - 1 week); and\n- \u00b7 Bereavement leave (1 week).\n\nAll benefits eligible employees have access to this global policy.\n\n## 2.5.4.4.2  Employee share ownership\n\nThe Worldwide Employee Share Ownership Plan (WESOP) is one of the Group's recurring key annual reward programs, offering employees across the world an opportunity to become owners of the Company, at preferred conditions.\n\nWESOP is strongly ingrained in the Group's culture, as a cultural and reward differentiator with a positive impact on engagement, attraction and retention. Schneider Electric has strongly developed and reinforced its offer over the years in order to build a sustainable group of employee shareholders reflecting the workforce diversity, to create a strong feeling of belonging, and to link employees to the performance of the Company, acting like owners of Schneider Electric. In that spirit, WESOP has become part of the Group sustainability commitments towards its 2025 roadmap (SSE/uni00A0#19).\n\nIn participating countries, eligible employees have the chance to participate. All eligible country teams are collaborating to deploy WESOP and they made its success possible over the years.\n\nIn 2021 the Group successfully reintroduced WESOP in 40 countries for the 25 th anniversary, after cancelling the plan in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, achieving 59% subscription rate, a higher rate than in 2019 at 50%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the employee shareholding represented 3.6% of Schneider Electric SE's capital and 6.3% of the voting rights. 77% of the Group employee shareholders were located outside of France, of which 13% are in China, 15% in India, and 10% in the US. This also includes employee shareholding resulting from the long-term incentives grants.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Scope concerns 29 recurring participating countries, among the 40 participating countries representing 91% of the eligible headcount.\n\nFrom 53% subscription rate in the recurring countries in 2019, WESOP has reached 60.5% achieving the 2025 target four years ahead of the deadline. The Group aims to maintaining at least 60% subscription rate in the coming years in the recurring countries.\n\nWith more than 80% subscription rate, India, and China outperformed and have become part of the major contributors of the 2021 capital increase, representing together more than one-quarter of 2021 total subscription.\n\n60%\n\n53%\n\nBaseline\n\n2025 target\n\n2021 Progress\n\n61%\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 2.5.5  Social dialog and relations\n\n## 2.5.5.1  Risks and opportunities\n\nSocial dialog and freedom of association must be seen within the wider context of ethics and responsibility. As a global Company, Schneider Electric is convinced that its responsibility goes beyond compliance with local and international regulations and is committed to conducting its business ethically, sustainably, and responsibly.\n\nThe Company is constantly interacting with all stakeholders throughout the world: its borders are expanding, its environment is changing ever faster, its activities are becoming globalized, and its social responsibilities are growing.\n\nThe challenge is to gain and maintain the highest confidence of its stakeholders. To support each employee in this approach, the Group emphasizes the importance of placing responsibility at the heart of its corporate governance.\n\nThe Group currently has around 128,000 employees worldwide. Following the Group's various acquisitions, it has been able to integrate this exceptional professional and cultural diversity.\n\n## 2.5.5.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric considers freedom of association and collective bargaining as fundamental rights that must be respected everywhere and therefore in its Trust Charter commits to complying with local laws in every country where it operates.\n\nIn its Human Rights Policy, Schneider confirms that it considers freedom of association as the basis of a regular dialog between a company and its employees. To that purpose, Schneider respects the individual right of its employees to freely join, participate in, or quit labor organizations to assert and defend their interests. Subsequently, Schneider guarantees that any employee wishing to do so shall be protected against any internal measure limiting his or her freedom of association such as discrimination of any kind, pay loss, or dismissal. Schneider also recognizes the importance of dialog with freely appointed employee representatives, employee representative bodies (such as Works Councils or employee forums), or organizations (like trade unions) and supports collective bargaining.\n\nIn addition, Schneider joined the Global Deal initiative in 2017. The Group is promoting social dialog as a means to foster decent work, quality jobs, increased productivity and, by extension, greater equality and inclusive growth.\n\n2.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\n## 2.5  Great People making Schneider Electric a great company\n\n## 2.5.5.3 Governance\n\nSocial dialog is managed at country level by the HR leaders with the employee representative bodies and unions, and at transnational level with the European Works Council (EWC) which covers most of geographical Europe. Social dialog is also taken into consideration by the Group's social reporting system, where local HR teams report on the presence of trade unions, works councils, and the Health and Safety Committee every year.\n\nIn 2014, while changing the corporate form of its parent company, Schneider Electric SA, into a European company (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 europ\u00e9enne), Schneider Electric negotiated an agreement with employee representatives of European countries about the involvement of these countries' employees in the Company's decision-making processes, thus reaffirming its commitment to promoting social dialog at international level.\n\nLabor relations within Schneider Electric are based on respect and dialog. In this spirit, management, and employee representatives meet regularly to exchanges views, negotiate, sign agreements, and ensure that agreements are being implemented.\n\n## 2.5.5.4  European Works Council (EWC)\n\nThe changes that were made in 2014 to the EWC in the framework of Schneider Electric SA's transformation into a European company significantly enhanced the intensity and the impact of social dialog at European level. This European channel for dialog aims at enabling management to make more efficient decisions by giving employee representatives the opportunity to be informed of such decisions and to understand their reasons, as well as to put forward proposals to supplement or improve them.\n\nIt has also fostered the emergence of a strong identity, combining different cultures and having the common aim of working towards social and economic progress within the companies in the Group at European level. The EWC covers all European Economic Area countries (hence all EU member states) and Switzerland, for a total of 43,000 employees.\n\nIn 2017, Schneider Electric and IndustriAll Europe signed an innovative Europe-wide agreement, the European agreement on the anticipation and development of competencies and employment with respect to the Schneider business strategy. This agreement is a great opportunity to create a governance for jobs and skills at the Company by anticipating impact and evolution in business in line with current market trends and the Company's ambition. It sets clear objectives for boosting employees' employability, and for enriching the workforce by diversity and digital generation recruitment and reinforces constructive social dialog at European and local level within the Company.\n\nSince the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic crisis, Schneider Electric has constantly increased its interactions with its employees and its representatives in order to contribute to helping create a stimulating work environment and participate in decisions aimed at improving the way we work and the need to adapt to our environment, all of which go hand in hand. For example, a new discussion space with EWC members has been set up to propose a collective improvement of the whistleblowing process.\n\nThe digital June plenary session hosted presentations and discussions on the Company's strategy with Executive Committee members including Schneider Electric's Chairman & CEO.\n\n## 2.5.5.5  Group Works Council, France\n\nSchneider Electric is organized in France through more than 28 legal entities. However, with a coverage of 80% of employees, Schneider Electric Industries and Schneider Electric France SAS set the tone for social dialog in France mainly through the Group Works Council.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to limit the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business through our proven practice of social dialog, such as negotiations about the flexible working hours agreement.\n\nSeveral collective agreements were concluded with an objective to keep resiliency, strengthen Company performance, and at the same time maintain investments and employability of the workforce.\n\nTo anticipate and manage the consequences of the evolution of Schneider Electric's strategy over the next three years, a strategic workforce planning agreement was negotiated with the trade unions. Every year, Schneider Electric will discuss with its employee representatives the evolution of skills and workforce, including the opportunity to enhance its commitment on apprenticeship programs and others disruptive actions.\n\n## 2.5.5.6  Social dialog in the United States\n\nIn the US, and more generally in North America, regular communication takes place with both union and non-union employees on key business topics and trends affecting their jobs. Company officials meet with key international union leaders and local union leadership on an ongoing basis, and formally on an annual basis, to advise and discuss competitive issues impacting the Company's business, and to ensure alignment with the Company's business strategies and challenges. In 2021, contract negotiations took place both locally and nationally resulting in successful contract ratification. Company officials have continued to partner with union representatives to discuss COVID-19 and ensure safety protocols are in place for employees, customers, and vendors. Recently, impact bargaining took place in November with union leaders regarding the Company's 'COVID-19 US Vaccination Policy' aligned with the federal mandate, Executive Order 14042.\n\n## 2.5.5.7  Social dialog in Mexico\n\nIn Mexico, Schneider Electric leaders conduct regular communication with employees on topics related to their jobs; this communication takes place in different ways, including large communication meetings and small group conversations. There is also continuous communication with the union leaders and delegates of four national unions which represent unionized employees. Schneider Electric informs them of internal and external issues impacting the Company's results, listens to their concerns, and looks for alignment with the Company strategy and challenges. Moreover, Schneider and the unions review the collective contract every year. Social dialog has been a critical factor reinforced during the pandemic to ensure collaboration and optimal relations between Schneider and its unionized employees. Each site is empowered to lead its social actions according to local needs.\n\nFor over the past 10 years, Schneider Electric Mexico has been certified annually by the CEMEFI (Mexican Center for Philanthropy) as a Socially Responsible Company, recognizing the Group's actions focused on labor relations, ethics and governance, human rights, community impact, and sustainability.",

In 2021, the Company fostered active social dialog with joint Group efforts. The HR department, in partnership with unions, facilitate active dialog with employee representatives on topics that cover employee lifecycle:\n\n- \u00b7 Mobile-enabled learning is extended to both office and plant workers, while virtual and on-site blended training with action learning is deployed in all talent programs ensuring generation and gender diversities. Employee average learning time has reached 18 hours.\n- \u00b7 Leadership management continuously listens to employees with open communication, reflection, and action plans. Well-being bi-monthly live talks have attracted over 3,000 participants; topics cover mental health, stress management, parenting, etc.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability practices are promoted through various events, for instance, Zero Carbon Run to increase carbon neutral knowledge and corporate commitments awareness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.5.5.9  Social dialog in India\n\nSchneider Electric India has a strong culture of social dialog with all employees, unionized and non-unionized. In 2021, Schneider Electric India maintained engaging in equitable industrial relations across its plants and associated establishments.\n\nIndustrial harmony has been achieved through a time-tested collective bargaining process involving unions or through worker representative committees. In some of the plants where there are no recognized unions, this bargaining process is conducted with elected employees on committees such as Welfare (Works Committee). There is also strong engagement with other committees like Health & Safety, Canteen, Sports, and Transport, including a special committee for women employees and a prevention of sexual harassment committee (fully compliant with the prevention of sexual harassment governance as per local laws), duly represented by employees and external women with specialist knowledge of the subject and with legal backgrounds. These committees provide a platform for employees to represent their concerns, collective grievances, and workplace-related issues to the management. All employee engagement programs are run through these committees with the active participation of every employee.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nThe process of social dialog also includes monthly employee communication at plants level, as well as through Quarterly Town Hall communication on Company performance, strategy, and challenges. Special sessions were organized for employees' family members on the world standard safety procedures at the workplace which boosted confidence and encouraged employees to return to work. To drive positive mental well-being, the Company leveraged the existing Employee Assistant Program (Saathi) for employees and family members, which became a huge support system. Experienced doctors and specialists facilitated COVID-19 safety and mental health sessions. Employees regularly connected with counsellors, read articles on relevant health topics, and attended webinars to augment their health preparedness. Employees were regularly involved in social and environmental protection initiatives through large scale tree plantation drives across the factory and at nearby locations. Campaigns on virtual engagement and collaboration, and leaders connecting in formal and informal settings, further ensured that a physical and psychologically safe environment for employees was created.\n\n## 2.5.5.10  Social dialog in Turkey\n\nIn 2021 the Company saw great benefits from the policies that were deployed in 2020. All COVID-19 actions continued to be followed systematically and more digitally by Health Safety & Environment and HR, and updated information was regularly shared with all employees.\n\nThis year, Schneider Electric successfully renewed the union agreement which covers nearly 650 employees without any dispute. With this agreement, the private health insurance scope has been extended, and not only the employees but also the families have been taken under the coverage. Digital learning, which has been a priority for many years, was further encouraged during this time. The Digital Learning Corner project has been completed so all shop-floor employees can access digital learning, with a wide range of topics available from Schneider Essentials learning offer to digital technology trends, Lean Digitization Systems, and more.\n\n2020 also, unfortunately, saw a serious forest fire in much of Turkey, especially the Aegean region. Schneider Electric and employees came together and provided support to the region. In 2021, Schneider Electric supported the project, which was initiated under the leadership of Bogazi\u00e7i University Climate Center and United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Networks - SDNS Turkey, for the training of teachers within the scope of Turkey's Climate Mobilization. Within the scope of the 'Climate 2030: Special Education for Educators on Climate Change' project, it is aimed to inform about the basic concepts of climate change, its physical foundations, the reduction and adaptation dimension of climate change, its international processes, and sustainable climate actions. Istanbul innovation hub started to co-operate with selected universities in Turkey, giving young people the opportunity to see the digital solutions in energy management and the latest technologies applied by the Company, to expand their vision.\n\n2.",

They are committed to address the biggest challenges of our time. However, many of them lack access to education to unleash their true potential. Schneider Electric has a key role to play in supporting all young people and ensuring that they acquire the skills to build their future.'\n\nGilles Vermot Desroches, Senior Vice President Corporate Citizenship & Institutional Affairs\n\n## Context and goals\n\nSchneider Electric has been building a sustainable development approach since the late 1990s thanks to the Schneider Sustainability Impact, measuring the Company's objectives and progress every quarter. These objectives have always taken into account all dimensions of responsibility - environmental, social, territorial, and governance - encompassing all the Group's stakeholders on a global scale.\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric was recognized by Corporate Knights as the World's Most Sustainable Corporation out of 5,000 companies surveyed. All of this prompted the Group to get moving, to think about the world of tomorrow by building scenarios, both in the environmental and climate fields - but without forgetting the social and territorial dimensions. If the transition is not inclusive and fair, it will not allow people in underserved communities to build their future and create their own business. Schneider Electric Corporate Citizenship division, created in early 2021, embodies this vision. The planet has to be saved, and its inhabitants too.\n\nFour main lines of action have been defined. The first one is to ensure that the Group's business partners respect all human rights for everyone, everywhere, at any time and in any situation, from decent work standards to the creation of a social label for the Group's products.\n\n190\n\nThe second line of action is to ensure that everyone is supported in building their future, regardless of their generation. Schneider has always played an active role in the economic development of the communities in which it has a presence, in particular where people have no or poor access to energy through dedicated products offers and socially responsible investments for impact.\n\nThis focus is in line with the third major action, youth. There have never been so many young people on the planet, but many have no access to training. Yet it is young people who bring innovation. The Company has a role to play in supporting them and ensuring that they acquire the skills to build their future. This is the mission of the Schneider Electric Foundation, to give them the means to do so. The first of these means is training, the Foundation's historical activity. It has already enabled more than 300,000 young people around the world to receive professional training in energy-related professions. These are essential jobs for the future in a world that is becoming increasingly electrified and digitized and where access to energy is still difficult for millions of people.\n\nThe fourth approach is to make citizenship a collective commitment to co-construct the future in a dynamic way by learning and sharing with many different initiatives.",

Nonetheless, as SEforAll (2) puts it, 'electricity access is growing, but not for everyone'.\n\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, colossal additional efforts must be made to achieve universal access:\n\n- \u00b7 About 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to electricity, i.e., more than one in two inhabitants;\n- \u00b7 This trend is increasing, due to demographic pressure;\n- \u00b7 The COVID-19 pandemic will have further amplified the difficulties of access to electricity in the most fragile areas; according to SEforAll, the pandemic could increase the non-electrified population by 100 million in 2020;\n- \u00b7 By 2030, on the current trajectory, 85% of the remaining unelectrified world population will be in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAsia-Pacific is approaching universal electrification with ambitious government off-grid electrification and grid extension programs:\n\n- \u00b7 Between 2000 and 2018, more than 1.4 billion people gained access to electricity worldwide, mainly in developing countries in Asia;\n- \u00b7 Nevertheless, the grid can be unreliable in remote areas, where it must be supplemented with solar-powered backup solutions;\n- \u00b7 The growing need for equipment and electrical appliances for productive use in rural areas must be met with renewable energy solutions.\n\nIn addition to the 759 million people without electricity access, an estimated one billion people have access to intermittent, unreliable, or dangerous electricity.\n\nTo achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7), access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy must be a major objective, as the lack of energy affects the poorest: among the energy poor, three quarters are also multidimensionally poor in terms of human development 2 .\n\nAccess to green electricity offers a chance to live a better life, as it can have a positive multiplier effect on all socio-economic dimensions of the individual or community: livelihood, health, education, security, and empowerment of women, while fighting against climate change by replacing fossil solutions.\n\n## 2.6.1.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric launched its Access to Energy program in 2009, with a unique approach combining three dimensions that enrich each other:\n\n- \u00b7 A training and entrepreneurship program aimed at developing skills in the electricity trades and supporting entrepreneurs in this area, in particular women, in order to promote sustainable and inclusive local development.\n- \u00b7 A social and inclusive business, with products and solutions for rural electrification (collective and individual, such as solar lanterns, solar home systems including Pay-As-You-Go features, solar water pumping systems, microgrids including plug and play containerized solutions, etc.), creating local jobs in distribution, energy services, electricity powered industries, etc.\n- \u00b7 Impact investment funds to support local economies in gaining access to modern energy and reducing energy poverty.\n\nThe purpose of the Access to Energy social business is to bring clean electricity to populations in emerging markets both as a fundamental right and a means for social and economic development, with a safe, affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy offer. At Schneider, we call this Electricity for Life and Electricity for Livelihood.\n\nThe ambition of the Access to Energy social business is to connect an additional 20 million people between 2021 and 2025, and 70 million by 2030. 34 million people have already benefited from the Schneider energy access solutions between 2009 and 2021.\n\nThe impact investment funds will contribute to these targets, within the scope of the invested companies contributing to the mission of providing access to green electricity. More broadly, Schneider's vision of impact investing is to fund high social impact initiatives, such as energy and digital services that enable all generations to contribute to a better future.\n\n## 2.6.1.3  Access to energy social business\n\nSchneider Electric develops products and solutions to meet a range of both individual and community needs across the energy chain, from solar lanterns and solar home systems to decentralized small power plants, water pumping systems, and street lighting. These offerings also make it possible to maintain a sustainable economic and social activity as well as include and involve local communities in projects.\n\n## 2.6.1.3.1 Governance\n\nA new governance of the Access to Energy business was put in place from 2021. It is placed under the responsibility of the Access to Energy Business Vice-President, reporting to the Sustainability Senior Vice-President.\n\nAn advisory board dedicated to the subject has been set up, made up of the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, the Energy Management Executive Vice-President, the International Operations Executive Vice-President, as well as the Sustainability Senior Vice-President and the Access to Energy Business Vice-President, and, once a year, the Chairman & CEO. The subject was also one of those reviewed in 2021 by the Schneider Electric Stakeholder Committee.",

        "page_content": "## 2.6.1.3.2  Electricity for Life\n\nActions towards 'Electricity for Life' focus on delivering access to green electricity for off-grid households and small businesses, and the humanitarian sector. Almost 800 million people live in off-grid areas, and our world has no less than 80 million people forcibly displaced. These people are in need for energy as a fundamental right answering to essential needs in homes (lighting, cooking, social connection, education, etc.).\n\nWhether due to the geopolitical context, natural disasters, or climate change, emergency situations continue to rise in an increasingly uncertain world. With nearly 80 million people displaced in 2019, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has seen an unprecedented number of people uprooted by war, violence, or persecution worldwide. According to the NGO Oxfam, an estimated 23.5 million people were forced to leave their homes in 2016 due to extreme natural disasters. Since 2016, Schneider Electric has committed to offering energy access solutions in emergency situations and has been working closely with the UNHCR to find solutions that are suited to the specific needs of refugees or displaced persons. In 2018, Schneider and the UNHCR signed a memorandum of agreement to seal their commitment with the deployment of Mobiya lamps in refugee camps over a three-year period. This agreement has been extended to 2022. Schneider has provided camps around the globe with modern energy systems and services. Such systems and services range from Mobiya lamps to microgrids - including with connection to EcoStruxure \u2122 for Energy Access - energy dispensers, solar streetlights, and training in electricity trades.\n\n## 2.6.1.3.3  Electricity for Livelihood\n\nActions towards 'Electricity for Livelihood' focus on delivering access to green electricity for households and small businesses connected to an unreliable grid, and for productive businesses. Around one billion people depend on an unreliable, intermittent grid, and are in need for quality energy with solar backup equipment. Micro-businesses and micro-industries in rural areas need solar power generation and storage equipment; for example, in agriculture where solar systems can power water pumping and processing activities. 'Electricity for Livelihood' proves that energy is a driver of economic development and poverty reduction.\n\nElectricity can make a real difference to the lives of farmers and ensure food security through irrigation, food storage, and processing, or linking to the market to ensure better prices, while allowing people to be the agents of their own transformation.\n\nIn India, the 'Energy for Livelihood' Schneider initiative is transforming the lives of farmers, in particular women, through the innovative Villaya Agri-business solution. This project promotes sustainable livelihood activities in the farming, agri-enterprises, food processing, livestock, handicraft, and other micro-enterprises.\n\nSustainable and reliable electricity is also a prerequisite for enabling effective health services, especially in the fight against pandemics such as COVID-19. Providing local infrastructures with modern energy also contributes to socio-economic recovery through better health and a greater capacity to work and enhances rural appeal.\n\nIn Nigeria, the COVID-19 isolation facility of the Eleme General Hospital in Rivers State needed a reliable system to provide uninterrupted power supply to its medical equipment. Schneider Electric supplied a solar mini-grid and power storage.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Provide access to green electricity to 50 million people\n\nSchneider Electric is equipping five remote cities with solar hybrid microgrids in Chad, providing electrical distribution and monitoring software. The five sites are currently gridconnected but with only two hours of power per day on average and with priority given to productive hubs - homes are not connected. Thanks to this project, hybridization and batteries will make it possible to provide 24-hour energy to all 150,000 inhabitants.\n\nBaseline\n\n2025 target\n\n30M\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021 Progress\n\n+4.2M\n\n50M\n\n2.",

It also promotes digital and financial inclusion and the transition to a decarbonized world.\n\n## 2.6.2.2 Group policy\n\nThe goal of Schneider Electric's Impact Investing is to generate high social impact while protecting the assets under management. Accordingly, it has adopted strict management rules, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Always invest in partnerships with recognized players;\n- \u00b7 Never take a majority stake;\n- \u00b7 Always provide efficient company support (help develop a business plan, provide technical advice, etc.) to deliver the optimum social impact while minimizing risk; and\n- \u00b7 Ensure that ethical business practices and rules are respected.\n\n## 2.6.2.3 Governance\n\nEach investment vehicle has its own governance structure generally composed of at least two bodies.\n\nThe first one is a Board of Directors or a Supervisory Board in charge of ensuring compliance with all legal and ethical regulations. In most cases investors are represented in this board.\n\nThe second one is a Management Investment Committee which can be either totally independent or composed by investors according to the legal structure. All Management Investment Committee members bring specific competencies and knowledge to assess investment decisions. In some cases, they can also rely on external experts. They are responsible for ensuring compliance with investment policies and are regularly updated on investment performance, both in terms of impact and finance.\n\nIn some cases, an investment vehicle can also rely on Advisory Committee or Strategic Committee to help them setting up and managing their investment strategies and policies.\n\nAll investment vehicles are supervised by independent auditors.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 2.6.2.4  Tackling energy poverty in Europe with Schneider Electric Energy Access (SEEA)\n\nIn July 2009, Schneider Electric created an Impact Investing structure in the form of a variable-capital SAS (simplified joint-stock company), Schneider Electric Energy Access (SEEA), certified as a social and solidarity investment company (ESUS certification) and open to French employee savings through the Group's Employee Savings Plan (Schneider Energie Solidaire Fund) .\n\nWith a dedicated Schneider management team based in Rueil-Malmaison (France), SEEA invests primarily in equity and quasi-equity in start-ups that:\n\n- \u00b7 Fight against energy poverty by promoting efficient affordable housing and energy efficiency solutions:\n- - Six invested companies for a total of EUR 2.3 million (Fonci\u00e8re Ch\u00eanelet, Fonci\u00e8re du Possible, LVD Energie/ HomeBlok, Soliha BLI, Dor\u00e9mi, R\u00e9seau Eco-Habitat)\n- \u00b7 Promote digital and financial inclusion:\n- - Two invested companies for a total of EUR 644,000 (Sunfunder, SIDI)\n- \u00b7 Provide access to affordable, clean and sustainable energy: - Two invested companies for a total of EUR 940,000 (Okra Solar, Amped Innovations)\n- \u00b7 Promote job creation and income generation:\n- - Three invested companies for a total of EUR 400,000 (Bretagne Ateliers, Incubethic, Envie Rh\u00f4nes Alpes )\n\nSEEA has invested in 21 companies and has exited eight. As of December 2021, SEEA had 13 companies in its portfolio: 10 in France, two operating in sub-Saharan Africa, and one operating in South-East Asia, and managed the following amounts:\n\n- \u00b7 EUR 3,000,000 in capital invested by Schneider Electric;\n- \u00b7 EUR 3,200,000 invested by Schneider Energie SICAV Solidaire (including EUR 500,000 in capital), a mutual fund managing the employee savings scheme for Schneider Electric employees in France;\n- \u00b7 EUR 200,000 of capital invested by Phitrust Impact Investors;\n- \u00b7 EUR 500,000 of capital invested by Mutuelle d'Entreprises Schneider Electric (MESE).\n\nSEEA brings together different stakeholders by encouraging Schneider Electric's employees and business partners around the world to play an active role in this commitment. At the end of August 2021, 6,576 (past or present) Group employees in France have invested EUR 57 million in the Schneider Energie SICAV Solidaire fund.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

The fund is jointly backed by Schneider Electric, CDC group (on behalf of the UK Department for International Development, DFID), the European Investment Bank, FMO (Dutch development Bank), FISEAPROPARCO, OFID, and AFD-FFEM.\n\nAt the end of 2021, EAV has invested in 15 companies and has exited one. EAV is now entering the seventh year and the independent management team based in Nairobi (Kenya) is now focusing on actuating on value creation in the portfolio, follow-on investments, and driving liquidity events.\n\nEAV invests primarily in equity and quasi-equity in start-ups that:\n\n- \u00b7 Provide access to affordable, clean, and sustainable energy solutions:\n- - Five invested companies for a total of EUR 15.1 million (Zola Electric in Tanzania, PEGAfrica in Ghana, Nuru in DRC, Zonful Solar Energy in Zimbabwe, ZIZ Energy in Chad)\n- \u00b7 Provide access to clean productive use energy:\n- - Six invested companies for a total of EUR 22.2 million (ManoCap Energy in Ghana, Candi Solar in South Africa, SolarX in Mali, PayGo Energy, SunCulture, and InspiraFarms in Kenya)\n- \u00b7 Promote digital and financial inclusion:\n- - Three invested companies for a total of EUR 8.9 million (Mawingu, Solarise Africa, Palgo in Kenya)\n\n## 2.6.2.6  Bringing access to green energy in South and South East Asia with Schneider Electric Energy Access Asia (SEEAA)\n\nIn recent years, electrification rates in Asia have improved due to strong government policies supporting national electrification. As Asian countries are now approaching universal access to electricity, the focus has been shifting to integrating renewable energy into the energy mix. However, at the micro level, there are still a considerable number of rural areas without access to electricity. Even when access is available, electricity is often not reliable as power grids struggle with load and connectivity issues.\n\nSchneider Electric recognizes the gap and opportunities in this region and envisioned the SEEAA impact investing vehicle in 2018 to help the region advance towards SDG 7 'Affordable and Clean Energy'. The vision convinced three other investors to join forces and the SEEAA was officially established in December 2019 with four founding partners investing EUR 20.9 million: Schneider Electric (SEI SAS), the European Development Finance Institution Management Company (EDFI MC), Norwegian Investment Fund for Developing Countries (Norfund), and Amundi Finance et Solidarit\u00e9 (Amundi).\n\nWith a dedicated Schneider management team based in Singapore, SEEAA invests primarily in equity in start-ups that work toward increasing quality of life and boosting economic development in Asia, thanks to access to affordable, clean, and sustainable energy. The goals of SEEAA are twofold:\n\n- 1 Increasing access to affordable and reliable energy primarily targets unprivileged communities where last mile energy access is not, or poorly, available. SEEAA aims at creating to social impact for these rural communities especially leveraging productive use of energy.\n- 2 Accelerating the transition of economies to clean and renewable sources and increasing the mix of renewables in total energy consumption. For instance, this can be achieved by investing in companies developing renewable energy assets.\n\nAs of December 2021, SEEAA had invested in four start-up companies for a total of EUR 2.5 million. Two companies are contributing to Goal 1, both operating in India: Frontier Markets and Oorja Development Solutions, and two are contributing to Goal 2, Freyr Energy and Xurya operating in India and Indonesia respectively.\n\nIndia: a farmer irrigates his crop using water from a solar-powered pump operated by Oorja in Bahraich district, Uttar Pradesh. \u00a9 Oorja Development Solutions India Private Limited\n\n<!-- image -->",

As at the end of 2021, three million tons of CO 2 have been avoided or sequestrated and 1.5 million people have been positively impacted.\n\nThe Livelihoods Funds support three types of projects: reforestation, agroforestry, and agricultural practices, and rural energy (improved cookstoves).\n\nThe Livelihoods Carbon Funds #1 and #2 have contributed to three mangrove reforestation projects in Senegal, India, and Indonesia. These projects have enabled local communities to improve their living conditions thanks to the restoration of the ecosystem (fish, crabs, etc.). Furthermore, the mangrove has provided efficient protection to the villages and crops during the last tornadoes that struck Asia recently.\n\nLivelihoods Agroforestry projects enable farming communities to increase their revenues thanks to improved conditions for cash crops such as coffee or cocoa and the plantation of fruit trees such as mangoes. Furthermore, Livelihoods Funds contributes to the creation of new downstream activities such as food processing and commercialization.\n\nRural energy projects contribute strongly to improving women's lives and create jobs thanks to the construction and the distribution of the cookstoves. The carbon credits from the Hifadi project in Kenya, supported by Schneider Electric, are used to offset all the carbon emissions generated by the Schneider Electric Marathon de Paris; the race has been carbon-neutral since 2019.\n\nAll these projects are an integral part of Schneider Electric's Carbon Pledge, ensuring that the compensation part has a real effect both on climate and on social development.\n\nSenegal: the largest mangrove restoration program in the world Artisanal fishing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a9 Hellio & Van Ingen/Livelihoods Funds\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 2.6.3 Empowering new generations with the Schneider Electric Foundation\n\n## 2.6.3.1 Risks and opportunities\n\nToday's young people are forward-thinking, creative and one of the largest demographics. They need to be empowered with the necessary skills and supported to build a life aligned with their dreams and aspirations.\n\nNew social and environmental challenges have weakened social cohesion and blurred opportunities for the future, especially for the youth. They are going to be the first generation to feel the sting of issues such as climate change, and the last generation that can do something about it. Skilling and empowering the youth enables them to actively define their future and find their place in a complex and fast-paced world.\n\n## 2.6.3.2 Group policy\n\nIn a world where ecological and social challenges are more widespread and more urgent than ever, the Schneider Electric Foundation, under the aegis of Fondation de France , supports innovative and forward-looking initiatives to empower youth with the energy they need to succeed.\n\nOptimistically, the Foundation's aim is to help build a fairer, lower-carbon society to give future generations the keys to transform our world.\n\n## 2.6.3.3 Governance\n\n## 2.6.3.3.1 The Foundation fully in line with the Sustainable Development Goals\n\nFor more than 20 years, the Schneider Electric Foundation has been deploying the Group's philanthropic activities in coherence with its sustainability commitments. It contributes directly to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and more specifically SDGs 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 17.\n\nIn 2021, there were more than 100 projects, 46,817 young people receiving support, through 9,512 days of volunteering. With an annual budget of EUR 4 million, the Schneider Electric Foundation contributes to the partnerships that are completed by more than EUR 15 million in support from Schneider Electric's entities. Group employees are also involved in these partnerships. In total, more than EUR 19.5 million has been invested to help local communities worldwide.\n\n## 2.6.3.3.2 A foundation under the aegis of Fondation de France\n\nFondation de France is a non-profit organization that, since its creation in 1969, has been the bridge between donors, founders, and field structures in order to support projects in a range of general interest areas. It supports other foundations (916 in 2021) whose operations are governed separately, but who are legally part of Fondation de France . It is responsible for ensuring that their actions comply with its by-laws and the legal framework of the sponsorship. The Schneider Electric Foundation's Executive Committee determines the major focuses of its actions and the projects it supports. It then informs Fondation de France of its decisions, and the latter verifies the projects' compliance and implements them.\n\n2.",

These committees are made up of zone /cluster Presidents and aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 Share a quarterly activity report;\n- \u00b7 Validate the commitments/partners to join;\n- \u00b7 Specify the respective contribution levels (financial or in-kind donations, skills);\n- \u00b7 Follow up on projects.\n\nThese committees meet two to three times a year.\n\nThe members of the operational team are:\n\n- \u00b7 Gilles Vermot Desroches, General Delegate;\n- \u00b7 Patricia Benchenna, Corporate Philanthropy Director;\n- \u00b7 Brigitte Antoine, Employee Engagement Leader;\n- \u00b7 Morgane Lasserre, Administrative Assistant.\n\nLastly, the Foundation's Selection Committee is composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 Gilles Vermot Desroches, General Delegate;\n- \u00b7 Patricia Benchenna, Corporate Philanthropy Director;\n- \u00b7 Fran\u00e7ois Milioni, Program Director, Training & Entrepreneurship.\n\n## 2.6.3.4  Give all young people the means to build solutions for a better life\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation supports innovative initiatives all over the world that enable the most vulnerable, especially young people, to access the energy needed to succeed and build the world of tomorrow. To be relevant and effective, i.e., to have the greatest possible impact and respond specifically to the needs of the people concerned, it is essential that these initiatives combine education, technological innovation, social innovation, and entrepreneurship. These initiatives cover three main areas.\n\n## 2.6.3.4.1  Vocational training for the youth, underprivileged persons, and entrepreneurship support\n\nTraining is the historical mission of the Schneider Electric Foundation. The energy sector, and more particularly electricity and renewable energies, offers a lot of potential, especially in areas where access to energy is difficult and growing. Passing\n\non skills to young people and giving them the means to support their families could, in the long term, boost the local electricity and electrotechnical sectors. This will improve their quality of life and create sustainable jobs. That is what the Training & Entrepreneurship program set up in 2009 is all about.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation encourages and provides long-term support for vocational and entrepreneurial training organizations. These include associations and electrical profession educational institutions. The vocational training and entrepreneurship program capture 67% of the funding allocated by the Foundation. All of these actions are monitored and measured on a quarterly basis within the scope of the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI/uni00A0#11): '1 million people trained in energy management by 2025'.\n\nSince 2009, 328,359 underprivileged people have been trained in more than 45 countries.\n\n## 2.6.3.4.2  Raising awareness of sustainability and the use of reliable, affordable, and clean energy\n\nContributing to meeting the United Nations SDGs also involves, amongst other things, raising awareness among as many people as possible, especially young people, about the challenges of the fight against climate change and of sustainability.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation therefore invests in emblematic and international programs by making available its knowledge of energy systems management, through donations in resources and/ or knowledge. It has made a four-year commitment to the Solar Impulse Foundation, which selects 1,000 solutions that contribute to the achievement of at least five SDGs:\n\n- \u00b7 Clean, Accessible Water for All (SDG 6);\n- \u00b7 Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7);\n- \u00b7 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9);\n- \u00b7 Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11); and\n- \u00b7 Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12).\n\nThe selected solutions must meet the following criteria: technical feasibility, environmental benefits, and economic viability. Schneider Electric employees are mobilizing their skills to analyze the various solutions within their field of expertise.\n\nThe Solar Sound System project by Atelier 21, a Foundation partner, obtained two Solar Impulse Efficient labels:\n\n- \u00b7 Solar sound systems for events powered by renewable energies (solar or bike-powered). With seven systems in place in France and Switzerland, Solar Sound System has set up solidarity projects in Haiti, Brazil, India, Taiwan, and Cameroon and has projects in Reunion, the United States, and South Africa.\n- \u00b7 Regenbox, the first do-it-yourself 'non-rechargeable' alkaline battery charger. Regenbox aims to be ecological and antiplanned obsolescence. This project is also an educational tool and a mean to raising awareness about a different use of batteries in order to reduce the amount of electronic waste so present in our daily lives.\n\nBertrand Piccard, Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, will then promote this portfolio of solutions to corporate and political leaders worldwide. At the end of 2021, 1,000+ solutions had already received the Solar Impulse Efficient Solution label. These included insulating blocks made from hempcrete, wind turbine floats, and a web-based pallet exchange platform.",

        "page_content": "The Schneider Electric Foundation works almost exclusively with local structures. It is a guarantee of reliability and efficiency because only organizations that work most closely with the communities to be supported know their specific needs and constraints and can provide the appropriate solutions. The creation of the zone/cluster committees, since 2019, made up of Schneider Electric zone directors is a step in that direction.\n\nOver and above financial, material, or logistics support for projects, the actions of the Schneider Electric Foundation aim to create bonds among partners, encourage structures to work together, and build relevant and innovative solutions with all stakeholders to raise the challenges of sustainability.\n\n## 2.6.3.8  Group employees, spearheading the Schneider Electric Foundation's actions\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation strongly focuses on the involvement of Group employees in all the actions it implements. Whether they are Foundation delegates or employee volunteers, they are the link between the Company, the Foundation, and the supported organizations. In 2012, the Schneider Electric VolunteerIn NGO was created to organize volunteer missions benefiting the Foundation's partners. Wherever the Company is based, Schneider Electric VolunteerIn empowers people to be actors and ambassadors of societal commitments in the fields of education, access to energy, and the fight against energy poverty. In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Employees volunteer their time and make their skills available;\n- \u00b7 Partners look for skills to support their activities, specify their needs, and support volunteers in carrying out their mission;\n- \u00b7 The Schneider VolunteerIn association as well as the Foundation delegates co-ordinate, connect, and organize the process and cover costs related to carrying out missions, in particular abroad;\n- \u00b7 The Schneider Electric entities host the volunteers when the mission takes place outside their country of habitual residence.\n\n## 2.6.3.8.1 Governance\n\nThe Schneider Electric VolunteerIn Executive Board is composed of Schneider Electric leaders:\n\n- \u00b7 Charise Le (Chairman, Chief Human Resources Officer);\n- \u00b7 Michel Crochon (Vice-President),\n- \u00b7 Fran\u00e7ois Milioni (Secretary, in charge of the Training & Entrepreneurship program);\n- \u00b7 Christophe Poline (Treasurer, in charge of the SEEA solidarity investment fund);\n- \u00b7 Emir Boumediene (Member, volunteer representative);\n- \u00b7 Gilles Vermot Desroches (Member, Senior Vice-President Corporate Citizenship).\n\nOne to two Executive Board meetings are organized each year.\n\n## 2.6.3.8.2  100 delegates in 80 countries to catalyze the Schneider Electric Foundation's actions\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation draws on a network of around 100 volunteer employees, also known as delegates, covering 80 countries. Their role is to select local partners in the fields of vocational training in the energy sector, entrepreneurship, and raising sustainability awareness. They inform the employees of their entity, as well as the Foundation. They follow the progress of the projects after they have been launched. Each proposed project is subject to a review process based on administrative and financial data by the Schneider Electric Foundation and by Fondation de France before funds are released.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nThe delegates manage a digital platform, VolunteerIn, that groups together all the missions proposed by the Foundation locally and internationally. Available in eight languages, the platform can be accessed from anywhere in the world and enables employees to apply for volunteer assignments for the benefit of the Foundation's partners and their beneficiaries.\n\nFinally, the delegates co-ordinate the organization of the Schneider Electric Foundation's campaigns for international mobilization such as the Tomorrow Rising fund. This showcases local initiatives to a global audience. They also engage in campaigns organized following natural disasters.\n\nAn assignment campaign will be conducted in 2022 to renew the Foundation delegates' mandates.\n\nEach year, around 35,000 employees in 50 countries take part in these campaigns.\n\n## 2.6.3.8.3  Standardize measurement to improve the impact and coherence of actions in favor of sustainability\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation is a groundbreaker in the measurement of the social impact of the actions that it supports. The idea is to enable its partners to better fulfill their missions by identifying areas for improvement.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Foundation is assisted in particular by KiMSO, a social impact assessment consulting firm. A first study was conducted in 2018, as part of the fight against energy poverty, to draw up an innovative methodology to assess the social impact of missions. This methodology is placed at the disposal of project sponsors. CLER, the Energy Transition Network, has used this methodology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 50,000 volunteering days since 2017\n\nIn 2021, employee participation in the activities of the Schneider Electric Foundation greatly increased.\n\nThe pandemic raised a lot of fragilities in our society. In this difficult period, volunteers at Schneider Electric have accelerated their contribution to initiatives aiming at access to food, education and health. Mainly through digital and remote missions, they demonstrated their ability to adapt and to help the most vulnerable; above all the youth in need of support and coaching. With more than 25,000 volunteering days in 2021, over 50% of the 2025 target for this indicator has already been reached.\n\n50,000\n\n18,469\n\nBaseline\n\n2025 target\n\n2021 Progress\n\n27,981\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

In 2021, for the second year in a row the COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted education systems and left millions of children and youth out of school. The youth unemployment rate is growing worldwide and there is an urgent need to create a better transition between education and access to employment, and to develop the tools to provide continuous education even in time of crisis.\n\nTechnical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) play a vital role in national sustainable development for countries, it fosters employment and entrepreneurship, and promotes economic development. In order to have better impact and ensure life-long competencies, the TVET systems need partnership between the private and public sectors, and higher investments.\n\n## 2.6.4.2 Group policy\n\nSchneider Electric and the Schneider Electric Foundation are committed to include all generations in the energy transition. For more than 10 years the Training & Entrepreneurship program has been supporting the development of TVET. Training in the energy field is a key that offers an inclusive answer to several challenges of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). TVET plays two major roles regarding social and economic development. The first role is to provide training and career opportunities for people, in particular, those who are not in education, employment or training. The second role is to help build a generation of skilled manpower, which are needed at all levels of the economies. Furthermore, TVET can also be a valuable tool for sustainable development, as it allows the development of environmentally sound skills, critical for shifting toward a more sustainable economic model.\n\nThe program has a specific focus on impacting people not in education, employment, or training, the youth, refugees, women in vulnerable situations, and marginalized groups of people. The actions are always implemented in partnership with local players and/or national or international non-profit organizations (NGOs, governments, etc.) and with Schneider Electric's local subsidiary.\n\nThanks to the ecosystem of partners, the program has supported the training of more than 300,000 people across Asia, South America, Africa, and Middle East since 2010. More than 5,000 trainers and 4,000 entrepreneurs have also been supported. The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily impacted education and increased inequalities. We are committed to go further and faster by reaching one million people trained by 2025, 10,000 entrepreneurs supported, and 10,000 trainers trained. From now on, the program will also operate in OECD countries.\n\n## 2.6.4.3 Governance\n\nThe Training & Entrepreneurship program follows the rules and governance of the Schneider Electric Foundation and Fondation de France .\n\nTo increase effectiveness in following up the partnerships and achieve the 2025 ambition, the program organizes every six months zone meetings with the zone President, the Foundation representatives, and the Training & Entrepreneurship program leaders. Each zone has a defined ambition up to 2025 and a pipeline of projects that is reviewed. Corrective actions are implemented if necessary.\n\nThe program is led by zone representatives and in-country leaders that exchange on a daily basis. One global co-ordinator sets regular meetings to support the zone representatives and guarantee the progress of the program in each zone.\n\nThe program is part of the Schneider Sustainability Impact. Every quarter, the zone representatives report on a central tool the impact of the program, and data are reviewed by an external auditor. With rare exceptions, all projects-initiated benefit from monitoring by employees of Schneider Electric entities operating in the countries concerned.\n\n## 2.6.4.4  Actions supporting trainees and trainers' skills development\n\nThe key challenge of training in the energy sector is to provide the youth with the knowledge and skills to be able to carry out a trade in a safe and responsible way, providing them and their families with the means for satisfactory subsistence. It will also give them the ability, should they wish, to sell and maintain energy solutions and to create their own small business in time. Furthermore, they are a vital and indispensable element for all responsible and sustainable rural electrification policies.\n\nSchneider Electric's strategy, backed by its Foundation, under the aegis of Fondation de France , for training people in the energy sector, includes three key priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Basic training over a few months, which is free and accessible to many people and adapted as much as possible to the local situation. These training courses lead to the issuing of a certificate of competence by Schneider Electric;\n- \u00b7 Single or multi-year trainings leading to qualifications, in partnership with local Ministries of Education, or even under bilateral agreements; and\n- \u00b7 The training of trainers to support the effective and quality roll-out of training down the line.\n\nThe Training & Entrepreneurship program also provides valuable support to trainers involved in projects at its partners training centers. The aim is to help trainers thoroughly grasp the training approach and materials, enabling them to efficiently convey full and relevant knowledge to the students in short and long-term courses. Training of trainers ensures effective long-term transmission of quality, up-to-date knowledge finely tuned to the characteristics of today's energy markets in the host country.\n\nTraining of trainers is supported by the VolunteerIn association via missions at the partners training centers:\n\n'I helped to create an entire training module using a pragmatic and realistic approach. I feel like I've contributed to a better future for a lot of young people in Vietnam.'

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic on sites missions were stopped, but via digital tools contact was kept with the training centers.\n\n## 2.6.4.5  Actions supporting women integration in the energy trades\n\nSince the beginning of the Training & Entrepreneurship program, female participation in the energy trainings has remained low. Indeed, the energy sector is still a male dominated environment, and young women are sometimes discouraged by social norms and even by their family to venture down this path. Moreover, for Schneider Electric and its Foundation, it is essential to include women in all stage of the energy value chain. Most programs today only include women in non-technical, such as selling solar products, and non-essential activities.",

        "page_content": "Schneider Electric Foundation's Training & Entrepreneurship Program supports local organizations specializing in skills development and women empowerment, which are two critical factors in achieving a sustainable change. These organizations create inclusive ecosystems offering training, mentoring, and funding to enable women to work in the energy sector and become entrepreneurs. Schneider Electric and its partners also raise awareness among local communities, promoting best practices and encouraging a bottom-up approach to gender equality. Through these initiatives, the Training & Entrepreneurship Program seeks to play a dual role, championing economic inclusion and gender equality.\n\nIn 2017, in Ivory Coast, Schneider Electric and the Foundation, Mastercard Foundation, and International Rescue Committee have partnered to support 1,250 unemployed youth to acquire long-term competencies and start their own activity in electricity and solar energy; 60% of the total beneficiaries are women. In 2021, USAID joined force through their 'Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative' with the three existing partners, to expand the program targeting women and support two new training centers in Abidjan and Ferk\u00e9.\n\nIn 2021, during the Generation Equality Forum, Schneider Electric and its Foundation took commitments under the Economic Justice and Rights Coalition. On one hand, to support the training of 5,000 women in the energy trades and their self-employment or access to jobs by the end of 2022. On the other hand, to launch two new international initiatives around women training and empowerment in the energy field.\n\n## 2.6.4.6  Actions towards entrepreneurs\n\nEncouraged by the achievements of its training courses, the Training & Entrepreneurship program is going further by providing informal entrepreneurs and those trained in the electricity sector with support in setting up their own businesses. Employment markets in emerging economies are characterized by high proportions of informal sectors, underemployment and people holding multiple jobs to make ends meet. In addition to specific skills training, entrepreneurs need business startup support and access to funding, both being key factors in the creation of longlasting businesses.\n\nSince 2017, 52 technical laboratories in electricity and energy management have been upgraded in Pakistan's Punjab province. 6,200 youths have been trained and 1,890 have become entrepreneurs. This project was financed by Schneider Electric and implemented in Pakistan by Muslim Hands Pakistan (as the lead agency) in partnership with the Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (TEVTA) Punjab, and Punjab Vocational Training Council (PVTC), to improve and expand vocational training in Pakistan's dynamic energy sector.\n\n## 2.6.4.7  Actions towards digital trainings\n\nThe digitization program strategy is to provide the current partners with online tools to deliver their training programs while also supporting new online programs. The online programs will allow to both study theory and practice related to the energy content and will deliver a certificate.\n\nSchneider Electric and its Foundation have the objective to develop digital training to complement the training offer in energy and automation. Theoretical courses but also practical courses will be covered to deliver comprehensive training curriculum, that can be followed online only or through blended learning (a mix of in-class and online training).\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nTo start this journey, in 2021 Schneider has collaborated with SENAR, an Augmented Reality platform development company, to develop digital twins of Schneider's didactic equipment. Until now, three practical simulator exercises are ready and are being tested in Indonesia.\n\nThe three simulators are about:\n\n- \u00b7 Study bench for grounding schemes\n- \u00b7 Motor starting\n- \u00b7 Microgrid for isolated areas\n\nSchneider Electric also has an in-house simulator-based training tool, the Augmented Operator Advisor (AOA), which is typically used to train customers in Industry 4.0. It has a builder feature which allows teams to build their own exercises and disperse them among learners. It is currently being tested with trainers in France to create practical exercises for vocational training.\n\n## 2.6.4.8  Testimonies of people trained\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric continued to promote Tomorrow Rising, a five-episode docuseries made up of concrete testimonies. It presented the stories of four students who are building tomorrow's energy world each in their own way:\n\n- \u00b7 Y\u00e9y\u00e9 is the narrator and her ambition is to become a respected engineer. The documentary follows her from the beginning of her training in Lagos, Nigeria, to her diploma;\n- \u00b7 Pierre, in Senegal, has been trained to be a teacher and is now fighting to improve the future of youth in his country;\n- \u00b7 For Vitor, in Brazil, Schneider's training has been a genuine lifeline helping him build a career in electricity;\n- \u00b7 Lastly, in India, Gurdeep, an ambitious young entrepreneur installs solar panels and employs young people, like him, benefiting from Schneider Electric training.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Train 1 million people in energy management\n\nIn 2021, a partnership with Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training of Cambodia was established through its subsidiary college, NTTI. The partnership aims to build 1 center of excellence and upgrade 21 schools across the nation, which will train 290 teachers and 7,300 students.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

With its partner KiMSO, the Group built a guidebook intended to support its local partners in assessing, in a standardized way, the social impact of their training activities. The pilot phase was carried in several centers. The roll-out program was shelved because of the health crisis, leading to the temporary closure of many centers. KiMSO is a social impact assessment consulting firm that helps charities, NGOs, and Foundations to understand, measure and value their impact on key stakeholders.\n\nThe project covers both social impact assessment and results chain analysis.\n\nSocial impact consists of the direct or indirect, intended or unintended, effects of an organization's actions on its stakeholders (i.e., beneficiaries, users, volunteers, partners) and on society in general.\n\nSocial impact assessment refers to the process of monitoring, analyzing, and managing those social consequences, which can be both positive and negative. This is an evaluative process aiming at answering the following key question: what changes thanks to us?\n\nResults chain analysis establishes causal relationships from the resources used to conduct a program to the long-term effects following the end of the program. It sets out a logical and plausible outline of how a sequence of inputs and outputs interacts with individuals' behavior and conditions to generate outcomes.",

In France, numerous projects, broken down into four challenges: youth, planet, poverty, and territory, demonstrate Schneider Electric's desire to be engaged, notably in the area of employability, and to contribute fully to local economic development. Based on their successes, some of them are planned to be deployed broadly in the frame of the long-term commitments in the Schneider Sustainability Impact; called 'Empower local communities'.\n\n## 2.6.4.10.1  Schneider Electric School\n\nIn 1929, Schneider Electric founded its own school - Paul-Louis Merlin - in Grenoble, to address the difficulty of recruiting skilled labor in the energy industry and help young people in precarious situations to access promising jobs. Today, it still focuses on vocational training in Schneider Electric areas of expertise, with innovative training approaches and close alignment with actual industry practices.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nIn 2019, to reinforce the link with the Group, the school changed its name to \u00c9cole Schneider Electric and a new vocational training has been added in the frame of the creation of its CFA (Centre de Formation d'Apprentis) .\n\nIn July 2021, to meet the ever-increasing need for skills in the energy and electrical sectors, and in a context where there is growing concern about the professional future of young people, the CFA has taken a new step forward and expanded its range of training courses both geographically and in terms of content by forging new partnerships. In addition to the current BTS 'Fluids Energies Home Automation' and the Licence professionnelle 'Connected Buildings and Intelligent Energy Management' courses, which are currently offered by the CFA, there are:\n\n- \u00b7 The BTS CRSA (Design and Production of Automatic Systems) with the Vaucanson High School in Grenoble (France);\n- \u00b7 The vocational baccalaureate MELEC (Electrical Trades and Connected Environments) with the Lyc\u00e9e Pablo Neruda in Saint-Martin-d'H\u00e8res (France);\n- \u00b7 The BTS FED Home Automation and Communicating Buildings, extended to a new geographical area, with the Lyc\u00e9e Maximilien-Perret in Alfortville (France).\n\nStudents leave with qualifications enabling them to continue in higher education or take employment in innovation-rich energysector fields such as renewable energies, home automation, and smart buildings, as well as energy management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

In priority urban areas, there is a huge amount of talent that is eager to grow. Recognizing this, Schneider Electric believes that companies have a role to play. It is their duty to act, particularly in the heart of the markets in which they operate.\n\nConvinced of the need to better support young people entering the workforce, Schneider Electric is involved in different ways: training, work/study programs for young adults from underprivileged backgrounds entering the workforce, partnerships with schools and associations, financial support for young students, and participation in technical or general training courses. Such is the scope of the initiatives implemented by Schneider Electric. These actions complement the partnerships established within the framework of the Schneider Electric Foundation.\n\nThe unemployment of young people, especially those living in priority employment neighborhoods, is unacceptable and efficient actions have been put in place to reduce this scourge, regardless of the economic, social, or industrial situation.\n\nSchneider Electric is involved in three major programs. Two of them are sponsored by the French Government: paQte (priority neighborhoods under the City Policy, QPV)) and the 'La France, une chance. Les Entreprises s'engagent' program. The third program, 'Le Collectif pour une \u00c9conomie plus Inclusive,' is sponsored by companies.\n\nThis group was initiated by the CEO of Danone at the end of 2018. Schneider Electric joined the group and has developed the 'inclusion focus' in France in 10 cities (Aubervilliers, Strasbourg, Rouen, Marseille, Lyon, Bordeaux, Nantes, Lille, Toulouse, and Grenoble). Within this framework and in conjunction with state employment stakeholders (the French Public Employment Service, Youth Employment Centers, and Maison de l'Emploi), it organized neighborhood-oriented forums, e-forums during the pandemic, and coaching sessions for the youth.\n\nLastly, there is the '100 opportunities - 100 jobs' system, which takes in more than 1,000 young people primarily from priority neighborhoods (as defined in the City Policy/QPV) and helps them to find long-term employment or training. Today it represents a collective of 1,500 companies located in 45 territorial areas. The relationship between all the local companies builds a melting pot that becomes the network for young people who have no network, in order to support them and structure their future project. It is a real public/private partnership that brings two worlds together for work.\n\nThe '100 opportunities - 100 jobs' system was implemented for the first time in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne in 2005, and by the end of 2021 more than 8,600 young people had been involved, with 68% achieving positive exits, fixed-term contracts or interim contracts longer than six months, permanent contracts, or a qualification or diploma training.\n\nSchneider Electric works to help inhabitants of the disadvantaged neighborhoods identified in the City Policy (QPV) and is naturally in line with the PaQte (Pact with Neighborhoods for all Companies) with respect to the four pillars of Raise Awareness, Train, Recruit, and Buy.\n\nSchneider Electric in France includes integration clauses in contracts to encourage suppliers to become committed to an approach of vocational integration of persons who are outside the job circuit. Schneider Electric in France challenges employment agencies to put in place temporary occupational integration contracts (CIPI) and interim open-ended employment contracts (CDI-I), which accompany the unemployed toward long-term employment and encourage temporary work that integrates people.\n\nFinally, Schneider Electric has partnered with many other structures or associations: \u00c9cole de la Deuxi\u00e8me Chance, les Entreprises pour la Cit\u00e9, FACE, T\u00e9l\u00e9maque, Fondation de la 2 \u00e8me Chance, EPA, La Cravate Solidaire, Emma\u00fcs Connect la Varappe, etc., and has made a commitment to double the number of its apprentices, interns, and doctoral students.\n\n## 2.6.4.10.3  Spirit of entrepreneurship for collaborators\n\nFor more than 27 years, Schneider Electric in France has supported employee projects to create businesses or business takeovers through Schneider Initiatives Entrepreneurs (SIE), through a dedicated structure (Pass Cr\u00e9ations) demonstrating the Group's commitment to its local labor markets: promoting actions to support local economic development and proposing and supporting volunteer employees in reliable career paths that are external to the Group. It comes resolutely within the development of a spirit of entrepreneurship.\n\nSIE provides support for Schneider Electric employees at all stages of business creation, as well as afterward, with a follow-up period of three years. Sustainability rates at three years remain above 85%.\n\nSIE's dedicated team of seasoned managers and young work/ study participants are responsible for reviewing the financial, legal, technical, and commercial aspects of business creation or company purchase projects to ensure they are viable and sustainable.\n\nSince 2010, 1,009 projects have been supported, and 537 of them have resulted in the creation or takeover of a business: these include electricians, bakers, organic trades, consultants, asset managers, and florists, creating more than 637 jobs (employees recruited by the founders to support company growth).\n\nThe SIE structure is represented directly or indirectly in local business networks and enhances the quality of services offered through partnerships with associations such as R\u00e9seaux Entreprendre, France Initiative, and other local structures.",

This competition and the prize-giving bring together many managers from the Group as well as political and economic figures. This event is an opportunity to reaffirm the important role this scheme plays in the Group's values and strategy.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nThe SIE teams manage many actions to contribute to local economic development, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 Specific missions within the fabric of the local SMEs (small and medium enterprises) carried out by Schneider Electric senior experts or missions in the framework of skills-based sponsorship ( Aliz\u00e9 system) ;\n- \u00b7 Pass Comp\u00e9tences, which allows experienced managers to take long-term assignments with SMEs. These experts invest in structuring and strategic development projects for SMEs;\n- \u00b7 Support for organizations dedicated to the creation of activities and companies (R\u00e9seau Entreprendre, France Initiative, etc.) ;\n- \u00b7 Supports employees who want a career path external to the Group within the framework of a skills-based sponsorship system called Pass Associations. It enables employees to work on defining projects with partner associations or NGOs for one or two years. It encompasses all types of professions, and there are some 30 effective assignments each year. These specific systems are valued and taken into account in human resources processes and management in France.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.",

As it is engaged in a process of constant improvement, Schneider Electric is gradually supplementing this work to adapt its frame of reference for sustainable development indicators to changes in the Group. This document is updated every year.\n\nIn keeping with its commitment to continuous improvement, Schneider Electric asked Ernst & Young to conduct a review in order to obtain a 'limited' level of assurance for certain Human Resources, safety and environmental data indicators, and all of the key performance indicators from the SSI and SSE (see Independent verifier's report on page 224). The audit work builds on that conducted since 2006.\n\nAs a general rule and subject to any particular exception to be set out in the universal registered document:\n\n- (i) Schneider Electric reports extra-financial data at Group level for all entities over which it has operational control, within 2 years of acquisition;\n- (ii) Data is consolidated over all fully integrated companies within the scope of financial consolidation;\n- (iii) Companies accounted for by the equity method are not included in the reporting.\n- (iv) Within the above scope, small entities may exceptionally be excluded if their collective exclusion does not exceed 5% of consolidated revenues or total number of employees, in agreement with external auditors.\n\nNotable exclusions in 2021 (except for SSI/uni00A0#1):\n\n- \u00b7 AVEVA and OSIsoft. AVEVA remains a listed company and publishes its financial and extra-financial statements on regular basis. It acquired OSIsoft in March 2021.\n- \u00b7 Companies acquired in 2020 and 2021: Larsen & Toubro; RIB software; ETAP.\n\n## 2.7.1.1  Human Resources, safety and environment indicators\n\nThe Human Resources (HR), safety and environmental data come from our HR Analytics for the HR data, Resource Advisor for Environmental data and GlobES (Global Environment and Safety) for the safety data. Its consolidation is placed respectively under the Global Human Resources, the Global Environment and the Global Supply Chain functions. Data reliability checks are conducted at the time of consolidation (review of variations, intersite comparison, etc.). Details for data coverage are specified in tables page 232 for each topic and are generally well above 80%.\n\nThe safety data of the sites are included in the Group metrics after one complete calendar year following their creation or acquisition. A site joining the Group in year n will be included in the metrics on January 1, n+2, except in exceptional circumstances when an agreement stipulates that the safety data will not be included for two years.\n\nThe scope of environmental reporting is that of ISO 14001-certified sites, and certain non-certified sites on a voluntary basis and without interruption in time. All production and logistics sites with 50 or more FTE employees must obtain ISO 14001 certification before the end of the third full calendar year of operation or membership of the Group. Administrative, R&D and sales sites with 500 FTE employees or more also have to obtain ISO 14001 certification. Other sites may seek certification and/or report on a voluntary basis. A difference can be thus recorded with respect to the scope of financial consolidation.\n\n220\n\n224",

Schneider Impact revenues are split into four categories described thereafter. Activities included are:\n\n- 1) Energy efficiency architectures bringing energy and/or resource efficiency to customers . Offers include building management systems, power management systems, lighting and room control, thermal control, variable speed drives, Sustainability Business (SB), and industry automation. Neutral technologies such as signaling, racks and enclosures, access control, or emergency lighting are excluded.\n- 2) Grid reinforcement and smart grid architectures contributing to electrification and decarbonization . This includes all technologies and architectures contributing to a New Electric World, helping grid and electrification come to life: smart grid and microgrid technologies, EV charging infrastructures, medium voltage systems to upgrade electricity distribution networks, low voltage connectable offers enabling smart grid management and energy efficiency, secure power and switches that enable security, and security of supply;\n- 3) Products with differentiating green performance, flagged thanks to our Green Premium program . Green Premium products offer environmental transparency (with digital life cycle analysis and circular end-of-life instructions), superior compliance to stringent environmental regulations, and differentiating environmental performance through specific environmental attributes (note: double-accounting with categories 1 or 2 is removed);\n- 4) Services that bring benefits for circularity (prolonged asset lifetime and uptime, optimized maintenance operations, repair, and refurbish) and energy efficiency (maintenance to maintain the operational performance of equipment and avoid a decrease of energy efficiency over time).\n\nAdditionally, revenues derived from activities with fossil sectors and others are systematically excluded, including Oil & Gas, coal mining, and fossil-power generation, in line with prevailing corporate responsibility reporting and sustainable finance practices, even though Schneider Electric's technologies deliver resource and carbon efficiency in such sectors as well. In line with Schneider Electric's strategy to phase out SF 6 from offers by 2025, SF 6 -containing switchgear for medium voltage applications are also excluded. In addition, neutral technologies such as signaling, racks and enclosures, access control, or emergency lighting are excluded.\n\nAll revenues consolidated in financial accounts are taken into account. Calculation is based on revenues per line of business. Exclusion of fossil revenues is based on orders per customers' end-segment, with extrapolation to estimate destination of transactional sales.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## SSI/uni00A0#2:  Deliver 800 million tonnes of saved and avoided CO 2 emissions to our customers\n\nThis indicator measures CO 2 savings and avoidances delivered by Schneider Electric offers to customers.\n\nCO 2 savings and avoidances are calculated for global sales of the reporting year and cumulated over the offers' lifetime. Net emissions are calculated as the difference between emissions with Schneider Electric's offer and emissions in the reference situation. The ambition for this indicator has been increased in 2021 with the definition of the new sustainability strategy: Schneider is committed to save and avoid 800 million metric tons of CO 2 thanks to EcoStruxure \u2122 for its customers.\n\nThe difference between 'saved' and 'avoided' emissions is key: saved CO 2 emissions correspond to brownfield sales that enable reduction of global CO 2 emissions compared to previous years, and avoided CO 2 emissions correspond to greenfield sales that enable a limitation of the increase of global emissions.\n\n- \u00b7 Brownfield sales correspond to the situation where the offer sold replaces or upgrades an existing system, leading to a change of GHG emissions of installed infrastructure versus the previous year. For 'saved' emissions, the 'brownfield reference situation' is defined as the situation before the new solution is sold and installed at the customer's site.\n- \u00b7 Greenfield sales correspond to the situation where the solution is installed into a new system, allowing a better performance with respect to the market alternative.\n\nThe calculation of CO 2 impact of offers over their lifetime is based on sales data per product range. The electricity emission factors are forward looking, integrating the decarbonization of the global energy mix as per scenario of the IEA. Market data and expert assumptions are used to determine the use-case scenario of offers and the associated CO 2 impact. This methodology is associated to typical uncertainties of CO 2 corporate accounting methodologies, and conservative assumptions are preferred.\n\nMore methodological details can be found in our website that has been made public in 2019.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI/uni00A0#3: Reduce CO 2 emissions from top 1,000 suppliers' operations by 50%\n\nUnder this program, also called Zero Carbon Project, the Group partners with 1,000 of its suppliers, who commit to reduce their company's CO 2 emissions (mandatory Scope 1 & 2; Scope 3 is optional) and not just on the proportion of sales to Schneider Electric. The active participation of upstream supply chain is critical because it represents multiple times GHG emission compared to Schneider Electric's own operations. The top 1,000 suppliers come from 64 categories across direct material, indirect material and project procurement and have been nominated by the respective procurement teams.\n\n2.",

These initiatives sensitize the suppliers on various approaches and technical levers for decarbonization, including training on basic requirements and calculations. Moreover, Schneider attempts to support and drive collaborations with suppliers through services and EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions.\n\nAs a first step in the long-term journey to decarbonize, top 1,000 suppliers are required to quantify their carbon emissions and take ambitious reduction targets and deploy roadmap to achieve them. Suppliers are required to share the carbon emission performance via the dedicated Schneider Supplier Portal-Supplier Relationship Management (SSPSRM). To measure the carbon emission reduction achieved, we calculate the average carbon intensity reduction achieved by responding suppliers, multiplied by the percentage of suppliers reporting carbon emission data. Carbon intensity is calculated as Scope 1 & 2 CO 2 emission divided by financial turnover.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI/uni00A0#4:  Increase green material content in our products to 50%\n\nA Green Material is defined as either of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 a material with a lower environment footprint;\n- \u00b7 a material that is the output of an industrial technology which is a key enabler for a 1.5\u00b0C climate scenario and/or a more circular economy.\n\nFor 2021, the scope of this KPI covers commodities identified as relevant in terms of volume (circa 29% of total products volume in 2019), environmental impact (carbon footprint and biodiversity assessment) and industry readiness, meaning:\n\n- \u00b7 Steel and aluminum direct purchases;\n- \u00b7 Thermoplastic direct and indirect purchases.\n\nOverall, the materials in scope represent approximatively 400,000 metric tons.\n\nCross-functional experts at Schneider Electric (Procurement, R&D, Environment) have worked in close relationship with suppliers to define the Green attributes for each commodity in scope, based on existing international schemes and standards.\n\nThermoplastics are qualified as 'Green' when the supplier is bringing evidence of a minimum recycled content, biobased content (minimum threshold depends on whether the compound is halogenated or not) or is using a green flame retardant.\n\nSteel is qualified as 'Green' when the supplier is bringing evidence that the mill of origin is an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) or has a Green certificate such as the ones delivered by Responsible Steel.\n\nAluminum is qualified as 'Green' when the supplier is bringing evidence that the product carbon footprint is below 8 tons of CO 2 per ton of Aluminum, is using a minimum of 90% of recycled content in its product or that the mill of origin has a Green certificate such as the ones delivered by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative.\n\nThe scope will be yearly reassessed as the program maturity and the transparency of supply chains improve.\n\nTo consolidate the KPI, several sources of data are used. The volumes of green materials are identified using Prism extract for metals and Puma extract for thermoplastic, both tools are providing budgeted volumes. The total volume in scope (the denominator\n\nof the KPI) is determined using RMI extracts for thermoplastic, steel and aluminum providing purchased volumes in metric tons. For silicon steel there is no consolidation in RMI since silicon steel is not a market index, thus the volume is estimated based on a negotiation file RCM. Schneider Electric decided to identify reported and tracked Green Materials using 'budgeted' volume since the precision of the reporting tool is better compared to RMI extract. Actually, Prism and Puma allowed to track suppliers and material grade that make the two levers mentioned above possible to activate.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI/uni00A0#5:  100% of our primary and secondary packaging is free from single-use plastic and uses recycled cardboard\n\nThis program has been designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure legal compliance through the selection of our packaging materials and the availability of adequate take-back, collection and sustainable options for our customers.\n- \u00b7 Support the achievement of our 2025 Green packaging commitment:\n- - 100% of our primary and secondary packaging uses recycled cardboard.\n- - 100% of our primary and secondary packaging is free from single-use plastic.\n- - Define the best practices to offer differentiating green packaging solutions to our customers.\n\nThe scope includes tier-one strategic suppliers with a direct purchase of cardboard and plastics in the Schneider Electric procurement system. Geographically, all regions under the global supply chain will be covered, as well as Equipment & Transformers.\n\nCardboard is considered as recycled when it includes at least 70% of recycled fiber by weight. Temporary exemption is made for NAM, where an average of 50% of recycled fiber by weight is required to be considered recycled.\n\nEvery reporting period, the spend on cardboard and plastics is extracted from the system and each element is classified as sustainable or none based on criteria mentioned above. Verification is done for sustainable declarations on the definitions already provided as well as certificates and other documentary evidence from suppliers. The list of eligible certificates/documents is continually updated to make it exhaustive and to cover countries specificities.\n\nA global campaign is being run in all global supply chain regions to progressively move the spend to sustainable sources and remove single use plastic usage with sponsorship from top management.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI/uni00A0#6:  100% of our strategic suppliers provide decent work to their employees\n\nSchneider Electric has deployed a series of engagement on the topic of working conditions to correct mal practices, but also proactively work to implement measures which will prevent such violations in future. This philosophy is the foundation of the Decent Work program.",

        "page_content": "Taking inspiration from the pioneering work of ILO, Schneider has defined 10 pillars of Decent Work:\n\n- 1. Employment opportunities;\n- 2. Adequate earnings and productive work;\n- 3. Decent working hours;\n- 4. Stability and security of work;\n- 5. Social dialogue and workplace relations;\n- 6. Fair treatment in employment;\n- 7. Safe work;\n- 8. Social protection;\n- 9. Purchasing practices; and\n- 10. Balancing work and family life.\n\nThe program requires strategic suppliers to develop a pro-active policy and provide a safe, attractive, inclusive workplace to their employees, and treat all workers as we treat our own workforce. Criteria defined for each Decent Work pillar may overlap with ISO26000 standard and are validated by Global Procurement, Human Resources, Supply Chain and Sustainability teams.\n\nThe suppliers will be assessed through remote questionnaires supported by relevant documentation as well as onsite visits, spot audits and their performance will be monitored by experts. All questions have a minimum acceptable answer defined. Suppliers responses will be evaluated against the minimum acceptable criteria to qualify as Decent Work compliant. Program deployment is ensured by Global Procurement Services to onboard, train and assess suppliers.\n\nThrough Decent Work standard setting and compliance, Schneider employment aims to enhance social integration, equity, security, dignity, satisfaction and overall improvement in the quality of life for the workers, and their family. For each Decent Work issue identified, the Global Procurement team will ask for corrective actions to be undertaken and supported by documentation. If the supplier effectively deploys corrective actions, it can be counted in the KPI calculation. Otherwise, it is still counted as non-compliant regarding the requirements of the program.\n\nA pilot for this indicator will be launched early 2022. As such, this KPI is excluded from the 2021 SSI score computation, and will be integrated in 2022.\n\nThe methodology for this indicator was reviewed by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI/uni00A0#7:  Measure the level of confidence of our employees to report behaviors against our principles of Trust\n\nSpeak-Up helps to maintain high standards, a strong reputation, and a healthy and productive working environment, and protects Schneider Electric and its employees from multiple risks. Misconduct situations will be less likely to occur if people, employees and stakeholders feel safe to speak up about concerns, dilemmas or issues in good faith, respectfully and without fear of retaliation.\n\nOur Trust Charter and Ethics & Compliance program participate to transform this belief into practical actions, notably offering multiple fair, neutral and confidential reporting channels to our employees to make them feel confident to report an unethical conduct.\n\nIn order to assess this KPI, the question 'I can report an instance of unethical conduct without fear' is annually asked to all Schneider Electric employees included in the OneVoice survey scope. The percentage of 'Agree' and 'Strongly Agree' amongst the answers determines the level of confidence of Schneider Employees to report unethical conduct. Responses are anonymized and aggregated for compliance purposes.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nThis indicator was calculated for the first time in 2021 and reached an 81/100 performance. As such, this KPI is excluded from the 2021 SSI score computation, and will be integrated in 2022.\n\nThe methodology for this indicator was reviewed by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI/uni00A0#8:  Increase gender diversity, from hiring (50%) to front-line managers (40%) and leadership teams (30%)\n\nSchneider Electric is strongly committed to building a diverse organization at every level, with a workforce that reflects the diverse markets in which we operate. This indicator measures female representation within Schneider, at the hiring, frontline manager, and leadership level.\n\nIt covers all new hires within the company, including both non direct variable costs (NDVC i.e. white-collar) and direct variable costs (DVC i.e. blue-collar) positions; managers who are in NDVC positions, at the junior and mid-management level and whose direct reports are individual contributors only; and all leaders in Senior Vice Presidents & Vice Presidents positions.\n\nThis is a composite indicator: the progress of each metric (new hires, frontline managers, leaders) is being evenly weighted (1/3) to calculate the achievement of this commitment. At the end of each quarter,\n\n- \u00b7 Percentage of female new hires : Count number of new hires that are women divided by total new hires in the current year *100.\n- \u00b7 Percentage of female frontline managers : Count number of frontline managers that are women divided by total frontline manager population *100\n- \u00b7 Percentage of female leaders : Count of women leaders divided by count total leaders *100\n- \u00b7 Blended achievement percentage : Weighted 1/3, based on annual % progression from Base Year to total 5-year achievement.\n- - 50% new hires progression: Subtract current period % of women who are new hires from 2020 base line and divide by targeted 5-year progression target (9%).\n- - 40% frontline managers progression: Subtract current period % of women who are frontline managers from 2020 base line and divide by targeted 5-year progression target (15%).\n- - 30% leaders progression: Subtract current period % of women who are leaders from 2020 base line and divide by targeted 5-year progression target (6%).\n- - Calculate blended progression achievement %: 1/3 of each KPI current period progression\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI/uni00A0#9:  Provide access to green electricity to 50 million people\n\nSchneider aims to provide access to electricity from renewable sources to 50 million people, thanks to the products and solutions that are developed and/or commercialized under the Access to Energy (A2E) program, from 2009 to end-2025.\n\n2.",

Within these A2E countries, the impact is calculated based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Individual and domestic electrification : the number of units sold is counted out of the defined list of references providing access to green electricity, and a coefficient is applied to translate into an estimated number of people impacted.\n- \u00b7 Collective electrification: the total power sold is counted out of the defined list of references giving access to green electricity; it is translated into a number of people impacted from an average energy consumption of a household in the targeted areas, estimated from external databases and studies.\n- \u00b7 Large A2E projects or electrification of public services : as an alternative to the above method, actual or statistical number of people connected can be taken into account. In this case, the technologies sold by Schneider can go beyond the strict A2E references, but their value must be at least equal to the estimated price of the project's inverters.\n- \u00b7 Impact funds (SEEA, SEEA Asia and EAV): 100% of the impact of companies that contribute directly to the Schneider A2E mission of providing green and reliable electricity in Africa and in Asia are taken into account, as well as 50% of the impact of companies that contribute indirectly. To this result, we apply the percentage of participation of SE in the fund.\n\nAn exhaustive list of products and solutions considered with reference codes is available and maintained. Considered products and solutions are those already available at the end of 2020, and the forthcoming products and solutions providing access to electricity. Products and solutions that are out of scope: A2E products and solutions that are sold out of A2E countries; other A2E products and solutions, not directly providing access to electricity (e.g. MPPT, EcoStruxure \u2122 for Energy Access, batteries, etc.).\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young. The methodology and 2021 performance was audited, not values cumulated before 2021.\n\n## SSI/uni00A0#10:  Create 2x opportunities for the next generation\n\nThe purpose of this initiative is to ensure Schneider Electric has a sustainable talent strategy to develop a Next Generation (Next Gen) pipeline of talent through full-time, temporary, and selfpaced opportunities. Our goal is to provide access to professional opportunities for young adults, educating them about sustainability and how Schneider Electric plays a part in this endeavor.\n\nTo achieve this ambition to double opportunities, the Group accounts for the various ways it interacts with talent considered to be part of the next generation pipeline, including Student Opportunities and Recent Graduate Hires:\n\n- \u00b7 Student opportunities are defined as the workforce on the cusp of entering the job market, engaged in a temporary relationship with Schneider Electric with a defined start and end date at the onset (i.e.: Intern, learning event about Schneider and sustainability).\n- \u00b7 Recent Graduate Hires are recent graduates or early career professionals hires from a formal education program whose relationship with Schneider has a defined start date but openended end date (i.e.: Contract type: open ended contract, fixed term contract).\n\nCalculations are based on actual external requisition positions filled in the Global Applicant Tracking System and opportunities tracked via connect Candidate Relationship Management.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI/uni00A0#11:  Train 1 million people in energy management\n\nThe deployment of professional training programs in energy management enable people to acquire skills to pursue a career that offers them, as well as their families, the means for a decent standard of living. These courses must benefit to disadvantaged people. They are defined according to a local reference and justifiable by the partner who must be able to justify the BoP nature of the people trained, related to the defined local benchmark.\n\nIn partnership with local and international NGOs and local authorities, the Schneider Electric Foundation and the Company's local entities provide direct and indirect contributions to professional training centers. The objective is to help them improve the level of vocational training courses with diploma or certification in energy management. As a technical partner, Schneider Electric does not pay operating expenses.\n\nThe minimum duration of these courses is three months (or totaling 100 hours). Schneider's Contributions may be (cumulative possible):\n\n- \u00b7 funding of electrical and didactic equipment, donation of request equipment, first generation, for practical work;\n- \u00b7 knowledge transfer through trainer training, and support for future entrepreneur training.\n\nThe KPI score is calculated with the number of students enrolled in trainings courses, supported by Schneider Electric through partnership agreement (supporting documents (list of young people) required).'\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSI/uni00A0#+1:  100% of Country and Zone Presidents define 3 local commitments that impact their communities in line with our sustainability transformation\n\nSince its creation in 2005, the former Planet & Society barometer (now Schneider Sustainability Impact), has focused on measuring progress against key sustainability performance indicators at worldwide level.\n\nIn SSI 2021-2025 Schneider Electric introduces a new component to measure local impact because:\n\n- \u00b7 There is a high internal demand for local communication on progress, as well as to locally empower collaborators to contribute to our meaningful purpose;\n- \u00b7 Sustainability priorities are highly dependent on local context therefore it makes sense to not only deploy worldwide programs, but also local actions close to local context and needs.\n\nIn order to boost local impact towards communities close to Schneider Electric, Countries with at least 100 employees have set 3 commitments aligned with the Group's sustainability strategy, on different pillars: Climate, Resources, Trust, Equal, Generations and Local.\n\nProgress against these commitments is measured by precise Key Performance Indicators (KPI).

This local Lead is in charge of consolidating KPI performance on an annual basis.\n\nThis indicator was not audited by Ernst & Young and is not included in the SSI score.\n\n## 2.7.1.3  Indicators from the Schneider Sustainability Essentials\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#1: 150 Zero-CO 2 sites\n\nA site achieves Zero CO 2 site status if it emits zero greenhouse gas emissions related to energy consumption and has in place Digital Energy Monitoring. Additionally, the site must have no SF 6 leaks. Exclusions for energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are considered for small sources (<3%) of a site's total energy where no feasible fossil-free solution exists today. Digital Energy Monitoring is defined as having energy data connected to a Schneider Electric solution (such as Power Monitoring Expert, EcoStruxure \u2122 Building Operation, Resource Advisor, etc.). For larger sites, this requires a significant proportion of the site's energy to be measured and monitored through real-time connected meters. For smaller sites, this requires energy invoices to be available in Schneider Electric's Resource Advisor solution. This indicator relates to all sites within the Group's full real estate footprint.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#2:  100% substitution with SF 6 -Free medium voltage technologies\n\nThis indicator measures the ability of Schneider Electric to offer to the market (i.e. SELL gate of our Offer Creation Process) industrialized SF 6 -Free solutions for all geographies.\n\nThe range considered for the calculation of this KPI are Primary & Secondary switchgears up to 40.5 kV, Indoor only:\n\n- A SF 6 free ranges ready in 2020: Vaccuum components, Premset, primary AIS with vaccum CB, HVL, Masterclad\u2026\n- B SF 6 ranges in 2020: RM6, FBX, Ringmaster, DVCAS, Flusarc, SM6, RN2C, GMA, GMAe GHA, WS, WSG, CGBS-0, CGBS-1, HVL-CC, Mcset, F400\n- C SF 6 free offers to be launched from 2021-2025: SM AirSeT, Air PacT, RM AirSeT, RingmasterX, GM AirSeT, HVLCCX, \u2026\n\nProducts above 40.5kV (WI, CBGS-2, Kite), Outdoor Equipment such as Pole mounted, Reclosers, Sectionalizers, Instrument transformers, as well as ranges manufactured by JVs and local offers adaptation are excluded.\n\nThe performance is measured as the percentage of the quantity of SF 6 free offer range available for order ( A+C above) compared to the total quantity of the current ranges sold in the 2019 reference base (for both MV switchgears and components). The current range for 2019 reference base is defined as the sum of the current SF 6 and non-SF 6 (Air, Vaccum) ranges sold in quantities ( A+B above).\n\nFor the calculation, as an example, 1 RMairSet =1 RM6. Calculation: KPI % = ( A + C ) / ( A + B ). Reference Base: total quantities by range sold in 2019.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#3:  90% of electricity sourced from renewables\n\nThis program measures the share of renewable electricity in Schneider Electric electricity supply, on the scope of environmental reporting (industrial sites >50 employees and tertiary sites >500 employees certified ISO 14001).\n\nFour different types of renewable sourcing are taken into account:\n\n- \u00b7 Renewable electricity produced onsite and consumed onsite;\n- \u00b7 Renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs);\n- \u00b7 Green tariffs; and\n- \u00b7 Renewable certificates (depending on the country: REC, iREC, GO, EAC, etc.).\n\nElectricity purchased with no specific renewable electricity claim is not taken into account, even if the electricity mix of the supplier includes a share of renewable power.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#4: 15% CO 2 efficiency in transportation\n\nTransport within Schneider Electric is a significant generator of CO 2 due to dependence on fossil-fuels. To achieve its net-zero target, the Group must engage with its transport providers on both efficiency opportunities as well as technical advancements in transport assets.\n\nThis KPI measures the Group progress against an annual 3% CO 2 emissions for its paid transportation footprint for each of the next 5 years, or 15% total reduction from 2020 to 2025. The scope of the program covers all shipments globally with all transportation providers and modes where the freight is paid by the Group. This equates to approximately two-thirds of the total freight CO 2 impact to the Group. The base calculation for CO 2 efficiency uses an activity-based method of weight multiplied by distance and by mode/equipment CO 2 factors. Progress is measured using CO 2 emissions per tonne shipped as unit.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#5:  15% energy efficiency in our sites\n\nThis program measures the normalized energy reduction of the Group's largest energy-consuming sites against a baseline. The objective is to reduce energy consumption by ~3% each year, for a total reduction of 15% over the whole duration of the company program (2021-2025) using Schneider Electric solutions and services. The program focuses on Schneider sites within the scope of environmental reporting that consume >3 GWh of total energy, along with other sites the Group considers strategic (213 sites in 2021). Energy savings are calculated versus a baseline year (2019) for the whole duration of the company program. In order to ensure a fair calculation of the savings, the actual consumption of a site is normalized versus the baseline year. This normalization is based upon a site-specific linear regression model enabling climate and changes in production levels to be taken into account. All energy consumption that can be modelled is taken into account and converted into MWh.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#6:  80% of product revenues covered by Green Premium \u2122\n\nSchneider Electric provides environmentally conscious products to customers that support their sustainability goals and ambitions.

They deliver market driven value propositions through third-party labels, such a Green Building and product certifications, that support our customers' sustainability ambitions. All globally sold products are within the scope of Green Premium. The product must be identifiable by an individual commercial reference number sold under a recognized brand of Schneider Electric. The Group provides resources efficient products (energy at usage, low CO 2 , material efficiency) whose footprints are fully available through the 'Product Environmental Profile' relying on Life Cycle Assessment; Green Premium offers also come with 'Circularity profiles', providing information on a product's Circularity through product end-of-life instructions and take-back services. Green Premium offers are regulatory compliant. Schneider is going beyond regulatory compliance with step-by-step substitution of certain materials and substances from our products. All this information is provided digitally to our customers.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#7:  One-third of corporate vehicle fleet comprised of electric vehicles\n\nSchneider Electric has joined the EV100 initiative of Climate Group to reduce its carbon emissions by committing to electrify 100% of its fleet by 2030. The fleet reporting structures the fleet carbon emissions calculations, the calculation of EVs share in the fleet and allows to support countries in the transition. As a mid-term objective, by 2025, Schneider commits to switch a third (1/3) of its fleet to electric vehicles (EV).\n\nSchneider Electric uses the definition by the Climate Group for electric vehicles, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV),\n- \u00b7 Plug-in hybrids (PHEV): Extended Range vehicle (EREV) and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) - with at least 50km of electrical autonomy\n\nVehicles' count is a picture at 31/12. The share of electric vehicle in fleet is calculated by dividing EV count by total vehicle count\n\nFleet leasers are the source of information; global leasers operate the largest share of Schneider Electric's fleet and provide data on multiple countries by region. A detailed reporting is asked to all countries to eventually correct, complete or complement the information (considering for instance vehicles under local leasers).\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#8:  100% of sites with local biodiversity conservation and restoration programs\n\nThis program measures, for each site in scope, the percentage completion of a set of biodiversity-related actions. The scope is Schneider Electric sites within full real estate footprint that have >50 people.\n\nInitiatives are defined as 'eliminate single-use plastic', and 'local biodiversity action' (2 required for large ISO14001 sites, 1 for small sites).\n\nEach site reports initiatives at completion. At Group level, performance is calculated by dividing completed initiatives by total required initiatives.\n\nThis indicator is audited annually by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#9:  200 'Waste-to-Resource' sites\n\nA site achieves 'Waste-to-Resource' status if it recovers more than 99% (by weight) of its non-hazardous waste while leveraging waste-to-energy solutions for less than 10% of its non-hazardous waste. Additionally, if a site generates hazardous waste, it must ensure 100% proper handling and treatment of that waste. Proper handling and treatment of hazardous waste means that hazardous waste shall be handled as per Schneider Electric's requirements and local regulations, whichever is the most restrictive. Waste is considered as recovered if it is reduced, reused, or sent to a waste provider for recycling or disposal in any manner except landfill and incineration without energy recovery. Waste composting and energy recovery systems qualify as recovered. This indicator relates to all sites within the Group's full real estate footprint.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#10:  420,000 metric tons of avoided primary resource consumption through 'take-back at end-of-use' since 2017\n\nThe aim of this KPI is to measure Schneider Electric's Circular Economy efforts, meaning all the industrial activities that contribute to the Circular Economy model, such as repair, reuse, refurbish and recycling, thus avoiding waste, material & energy consumption, CO 2 emissions and/or water depletion.\n\nActivities in this KPI will enrich on the basis of SE increasing focus on circularity business models, and are currently constituted of\n\n- \u00b7 Batteries take back and recycling;\n- \u00b7 Volume of devices refurbished and repaired in our repair centers (eg UPS, Drives);\n- \u00b7 Volume of MV, LV and Transformers refurbished or recycled in our Ecofit Centers.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#11:  100% of sites in water-stressed areas have a water conservation strategy and related action plan\n\nThis program measures the percentage completion of a set of water conservation actions that sites in water-stressed areas must complete. The scope is Schneider Electric sites within the scope of environmental reporting that are classified as 'high' or 'extremely high' baseline water stress, as defined by World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Actions are defined based on the amount of water that a site consumes along with the application(s) that the site uses water for. At the Group level, performance is calculated by totaling all completed site actions and dividing by the total required actions.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.",

To do so, Schneider Electric launched 3 new trainings as part of the Global Schneider Essentials training campaign reconducted every year with new content:\n\n- \u00b7 Since 2018: Training on the Principles of Responsibility (PoR document replaced in September 2021 by Trust Charter Schneider's Electric Code of Conduct) and Anticorruption.\n- \u00b7 Since 2020: Training on Cybersecurity.\n\nThe scope of this KPI is all employees registered in TalentLink (legal entities integrated in Talent Link, Core HR data system) as of November 15:\n\n- \u00b7 Principle of Responsibility and Cybersecurity e-learnings: all active employees with Open Ended Contracts (OEC) (exception: Chinese and Bulgarian Fix Term Contracts - FTC are included), present in the Group on December 31st and hired before December 1st\n- \u00b7 Anticorruption e-learning : exposed employees identified based on the job description (Schneider Electric System of Reference - description of functions), active, with connectivity type online-corporate credentials, with OEC (exception: Chinese and Bulgarian FTC) present in the Group on December 31st and hired before December 1st\n\nThis KPI is calculated as followed: the number of employees who completed all required e-learnings assigned based on defined criteria (2 or 3) divided by the number of employees x 100.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#14:  0.38 or below Medical Incident rate\n\nSafety is one of the 5 pillars of Schneider Trust Charter, which emphasizes the importance Schneider Electric is placing on its employees, customers, and contractors. Schneider works with many VIP global customers, and they demand the highest standards of Health & Safety management and performance before they engage and continue to do business with Schneider Electric.\n\nMoreover, at Schneider Electric our mission is to protect Occupational Health and Safety of employees, customers, contractors, and visitors to our locations. The Group also strives to provide employees safe, pleasant, and efficient workplaces for enhanced wellbeing and effectiveness. As such, we aim to reduce the Medical Incident Rate (MIR) to 0.38 by 2025.\n\nThe MIR is the number of work incidents requiring medical treatment per million hours worked (i.e. average hours of 500 employees working for one calendar year). Work related injuries and occupational illnesses requiring medical treatment are included. Work incidents may or may not have resulted in time off work.\n\nAll work-related incidents reported on Schneider Electric sites are counted (including therefore incidents affecting Schneider employees and other employees working under the supervision of Schneider, i.e. temporary workers). All Schneider sites within scope are considered. Medical incidents do not include: visits to a physician or other licensed healthcare professional solely for\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\nobservation or counselling; the conduct of diagnostic procedures, such as x-rays and blood tests, including the administration of prescription medications used solely for diagnostic purposes (e.g. eye drops to dilate pupils); or first aid.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#15:  Reduce by 50% scrap from safety units recalled\n\nSchneider Electric's priority is to delight its customers with an outstanding end-to-end experience. The Group strives to ensure our products' reliability, safety and cybersecurity to secure customers' business continuity and protect their people, assets and data. Quality is every customer's right and every employee's responsibility. By rationale, with an enhanced emphasis on quality, Schneider products henceforth should have minimal recall. In addition, safety in using Schneider products is of utmost priority and therefore we set this target with the mindset to ensure that our products remain safe for use for our customers.\n\nIn the unfortunate event of a recall, the Group aims to encourage a circular economy by reusing any parts from the recalled product as possible instead of scrapping it.\n\nThis KPI is based on all Problem (PRB) opened with Go decision from the Offer Safety Alert Committee (OSAC). Target of weight of scrap need to be included in the OSAC presentation and decision.\n\nThe used definition of 'recall' is a product recalled from Customer sites to Schneider's premises. Products remediated at customer's site without physical recall to SE's premises is excluded. The scope of this KPI includes all physical products sold by Schneider. Software are by definition excluded. Also, safety recalls bound by Non-Disclosure Agreement is excluded.\n\nThe weight of scrapped materials (in kilograms) is estimated by multiplying the number of physical products scrapped following a safety recall multiplied by the weight of product. The % reduction is calculated by comparing the weight of scrapped materials in the reporting year to that of the baseline (4,202 kilograms in 2020).\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#16:  In the Top 25% in external ratings for Cybersecurity performance\n\nSchneider Electric is continuously and consistently monitoring the security of its digital footprint with the support of cyber scoring agencies and this discipline is applied across the extended ecosystem* (e.g. integrated and non-integrated entities).\n\nOur primary scoring agency is BitSight which rates company security maturity between 300 to 820. This rating is calculated in real time with a proprietary algorithm that examines two classes of externally observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 configuration information, which represents how diligent a company is in implementing best practices to mitigate risk.\n- \u00b7 observed security events, which are evidences of cyber events like system compromises or data breaches etc.\n\nSecurity incidents or identified vulnerabilities can negatively impact the company's rating. They are addressed in a timely manner and the Group strives to maintain the score above 800.\n\n*Bitsight scores for non-integrated entities (e.g. Aveva) are not included and are monitored separately.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n2.",

The Group's vigilance plan reflects this ambition. It also complies with the provisions of 2017 French law on Corporate duty of vigilance: Duty of Vigilance introduced a new legal framework by which French authorities could hold corporations accountable.\n\nRisks within our Supply Chain are multiple: potential violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, serious bodily injury, Environmental damage, Health and Safety risks, etc. Impact are therefore quite various: reputation impacts, legal impacts, people health & safety, environmental pollution\u2026\n\nTo mitigate these risks with suppliers, the 2021-2025 plan is to deploy on site and remote audits for 4,000 suppliers:\n\n- \u00b7 1,000 identified in 'high risk' level (by a 3 rd party methodology, RBA or other) with one site audits; and\n- \u00b7 3,000 others through remote self-declarative assessment. Suppliers answering are counted, removing, if any, suppliers that have been audited in the current year or in past.\n\nThe KPI adds the total number of audits performed. The baseline takes into account on site audits performed between 2018 and 2020 (i.e. 374 audits); this value has been audited and validated by Ernst & Young in the previous years.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#18:  <1% pay gap for both females and males\n\nOver the last five years, Schneider Electric has proactively worked to identify and address female pay gaps with appropriate corrective actions through a country driven approach. Given the progress made on Pay Equity and to support its inclusion philosophy, starting in 2021, Schneider Electric has engaged in best practices to maintain a pay gap below 1% by 2025 for both females and males.\n\nMeasurement of the individual pay gap is achieved by comparing each employee to a universal median total target salary 'TTC' (base salary + target short term incentive) for all genders. In other words, an individual's TTC is assessed against the median TTC of their comparator group (individual TTC/median of comparator group TTC - 1). The comparator group is defined by the drivers of job level (grade) and salary structure within a country.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#19:  60% subscription in our yearly Worldwide Employee Share Ownership Plan (WESOP)\n\nThe World Employee Share Ownership Plan (WESOP) is one of the Group's recurring key annual reward programs, offering employees across the world an opportunity to become owners of the Company, at preferred conditions. Schneider Electric commits to achieve a 60% subscription rate among eligible employees in the yearly WESOP by 2025.\n\nThe scope concerns 29 recurring participating countries, representing 91% of the eligible headcount, which are all long-term employees of countries participating in WESOP with seniority of 3 month in the company. The KPI is calculated by collecting the number of subscribers from the subscription tool, divided by the\n\nnumber of eligible employees in the 29 countries as per data from our global HRIS system.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#20:  100% of employees paid at least a living wage\n\nIn line with its Human Rights Policy and Trust Charter, Schneider Electric believes earning a living wage is a basic human right. Schneider Electric is committed to paying 100% of employees at or above the living wage to meet their families' basic needs. By basic needs, the Group considers basic household expenditures (food, housing, clothing, sanitation, education, healthcare, transport), plus discretionary income for a given local standard of living.\n\nThere is no universal benchmark or methodology on how to calculate a living wage, which is why Schneider Electric has been working with an external consultant since 2018 to calculate living wages for all its locations worldwide. To calculate a living wage, the external consultant estimates the basic household expenditures of employees, as well as the number of persons earning a wage in a 'typical' household based on various sources of cost of living and macroeconomic data (national statistics, OECD, United Nations agencies, etc.).\n\nTo measure compliance with the living wage, a gap analysis is conducted every year post salary review for all our Schneider Electric employees treated as permanent workforce (employee scope coverage was 99% in 2021 and will be extended to 100% in 2022). The Reward team centrally compiles and analyses total employee remuneration data (base salary, bonus, and allowances) to compare it with agreed living wage. Employees are benchmarked to their work location living wage. To calculate employee remuneration, the Reward team uses data available in its global HRIS system, as well as local payroll. For final reporting of the year end results, Schneider Electric can disclose a final score that considers living wage gaps closed by countries until the end of the year after they have been identified.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#21:  4x the number of employee-driven development interactions on the Open Talent Market\n\nThe purpose of this initiative is to create an integrated and digital Open Talent Market (OTM) that enables employees to drive their own career development. The platform is borderless, neutral, and uses AI to help achieve best matches. The ambition is to multiply the number of employee-driven interactions within OTM by 4 in the next 5 years.\n\nInteractions are tracked in the tool for each feature of OTM. At the start of 2021, current features available to employees are:\n\n- \u00b7 Positions;\n- \u00b7 Projects; and\n- \u00b7 Mentorships.\n\nThese 3 features work best when employee profiles are robust and rate a 3/4 for completeness. The scope of this initiative extends to the connected population of Schneider Electric as defined in January 2021, thus excluding non-connected workers (ie: plant), as well as contractors, and interns/apprentices.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.",

The progress combines white collars and workers populations KPIs.\n\n- \u00b7 For white collars , the Group aims to achieve >90% eligible employees reaching Intermediate, Advanced or Expert Digital Citizenship level by 2025. The Digital Citizenship level of all employees will be assessed by their managers each year. Eligible employees in 2021 are active employees hired before January 31 2021, Open-ended and fixed-term contracts, and excludes employees in non-integrated entities & further exclusion defined by country.\n- \u00b7 For workers , the Group aims to achieve >90% workers complete 2 hours of training per year offered by the GSC Academy on digital transformation, such as Smart factory program, Cybersecurity, Digital knowledge. The scope covers active workers populations and plant team leaders defined by specific job codes and hired before January 31 2021, Open-ended and fixed-term contracts (China only) in relevant operating units, and excludes workers on extended leave of more than 6 months during the year and factories which planned to be closed before Q2 of the following year.\n\nThe scope and exclusions of this indicator will be reviewed at the beginning of each year.\n\nThe KPI is an aggregated % based on the % of employees meeting the target defined for white collars and workers to the total employee population in scope (white collars & workers).\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#23: 90% of employees have access to a program that supports meaningful development in the later stages of their professional career\n\nThis indicator aims to support and recognize talent who are near or at the later stages of their professional career through a robust career plan and development options, in order to strengthen key skills, leverage expertise and ensure knowledge exchange.\n\nIn 2021, the strategy and approach were defined. Pilot programs will start fully in 2022. As such, this indicator was not measured in 2021.\n\nFrom 2022, the indicator will be calculated as total headcount in the countries which meet the global minimum standard for a program, compared with overall Schneider Electric headcount. All countries with >250 employees are in scope. The minimum standard for a program include:\n\n- \u00b7 Training, coaching or one to one support available for employees (and their managers) in the later stages of their professional career enabling them to have a career check-in/ next-step conversation that results in a meaningful career development plan.\n- \u00b7 A selection of support options available in the employees' country that may include flexible work, upskilling and career growth options, career pivot options, personal planning options or workplace adjustments.\n\nThe methodology for this indicator was reviewed by Ernst & Young.\n\n## Chapter 2 - Sustainable development\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#24: 75% employee engagement score\n\nA high Employee Engagement index is linked to higher sales growth, higher operating income and ultimately higher customer satisfaction and loyalty toward the company. This index is calculated once a year through a survey called OneVoice, sent to 100% of Group employees, and serves a starting point to adapt the Group's people strategy, and action plans.\n\nThe computation of this KPI includes all Schneider employees treated as permanent workforce (i.e. open ended and fixed term contracts over 3 months), thus excluding interns or third party contractors.\n\nThe Kincentric employee engagement model is used, composed of 6 questions, 2 per item (SAY, STAY, STRIVE), scored on a 6 points scale by employees:\n\n- \u00b7 Employee Engagement Index: is the percentage of people for which the average of the 6 questions is equal or higher than 4.5\n- \u00b7 Employee Disengagement: percentage of people for which the average of the 6 questions is equal or lower than 3.5\n- \u00b7 Neutral: is the percentage of people for which the average of the 6 questions is scored between 3.5 and 4.5\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n## SSE/uni00A0#25: 50,000 volunteering days since 2017\n\nSchneider Electric employees' volunteering activities mainly take place in vocational or educational NGOs (vocational and technical training, schools, universities, etc.), and companies supported by the Schneider Electric Access to Energy Fund and more globally in all organizations referenced by the Schneider Electric Foundation delegates in their countries. They principally fall into actions benefiting young people, underprivileged families, the environment and are organized depending on the personal or professional skills of the volunteers as well as the needs identified by the supported organizations (specialized or non-specialized needs). Missions are posted on a dedicated digital and multilingual platform called VolunteerIn enabling Group employees to apply for volunteer missions among the Foundation's partners. Local and spontaneous initiatives organized by the Schneider Electric Foundation delegates and their partners in which employees engage are also taken into account.\n\nIn 2021, the Schneider Electric Foundation and partner NGOs increased the number of digital missions offered to employees, enabling employees to continue on engaging even under restrictions due to the pandemic. One day of volunteering is counted when a staff member dedicates five hours of his or her time to one of these partner organizations. The indicator also includes the training missions organized abroad for a period of five days minimum. However, due to the pandemic this type of mission has not been organized in 2021 for safety reasons. Only missions lasting a minimum of 0.5 days are considered.\n\nThis indicator was audited by Ernst & Young.\n\n2.",

At Schneider Electric, this represents EUR 28,905 million, as disclosed in the first line of the consolidated statement of income in this Universal Registration Document (URD, page 344).\n\nFor 86% of revenues (excluding entities having their own reporting framework), eligibility calculation combines two approaches:\n\n- \u00b7 An offer-based (by nature of technology) approach, whereby workshops are conducted with offer management teams for each line of business to define whether products are in line with the definition of economic activities included in the EU Climate Delegated Act. The analysis is performed at the level of each product category, which enables a granular segmentation between Taxonomy-eligible and Taxonomy-noneligible revenues. For example, Building Management Systems (BMS) generally include energy efficiency systems, which are Taxonomy-eligible, and fire safety and access control systems, which are not. In this example, the analysis enables to account only for energy efficiency systems installed as part of a BMS. An eligibility ratio is then consolidated for each product line (which includes multiple product categories).\n- \u00b7 An end-segment-based approach, whereby commercial teams indicate for each product line the amount of revenues generated from Taxonomy-eligible end-segments (Green Transport and Renewables mainly).\n\nDouble-counting between offer-based approach and endsegment-based approaches are removed before consolidation.\n\nThe following assumptions are made:\n\n- \u00b7 At the granularity level of product categories, data is based on orders instead of revenues. Therefore, the eligibility ratio is calculated by dividing the amount of eligible orders by the total amount of orders, and then applied to the net turnover.\n- \u00b7 At the granularity level of product categories, a non-significant share of orders (<5%) is not allocated per product category. These are not considered in the calculation of Taxonomy alignment per product line (the product line's average eligibility ratio is applied).\n- \u00b7 End-segment sales data is based on orders. A correction factor is applied to assess the value of net revenues per end-segment.\n\nFor the remaining 14% of revenues (related to entities having their own reporting frameworks), analysis is conducted separately following a review of each entity's product line reporting.\n\n## Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible Capital Expenditure (CapEx)\n\nAs per specification of CapEx as detailed in Annex 1 of the Delegated Act on Article 8, the denominator of Taxonomy-eligible CapEx KPI is equal to additions to tangible and intangible assets of the financial year 2021 (including IFRS 16 rights of use), considered before depreciation, amortization and any re-measurement and including those resulting from revaluations and impairments for the financial year 2021 and excluding fair value changes. The denominator also covers additions to tangible and intangible assets resulting from business combinations that occurred during the financial year 2021.\n\nAt Schneider Electric, total tangible assets resulting from the above definition represents EUR 581 million, including EUR 536 million from additions, as disclosed in the note 11 of the Group financial statements in this URD, and EUR 45 million from business combinations.\n\nThe total covered IFRS 16 rights of use over 2021 represents EUR 402 million, as disclosed in the note 11 of the Group financial statements (page 369), including EUR 349 million from additions and EUR 53 million from business combinations.\n\nThe total intangible assets resulting from the above definition represents EUR 1,782 million. This amount is split as follows: EUR 333 million from additions, as disclosed in the note 10 of the Group financial statements (page 367) - this includes EUR 307 millions of capitalized Research and Development (R&D) projects, as disclosed in the note 10 of the Group financial statements, and EUR 1,449 million from business combinations.\n\nAs per specification of CapEx as detailed in Annex 1 of the Delegated Act on Article 8, all costs based on IFRS 16 related to long-term leasing of buildings are eligible. CapEx related to assets or processes associated with Taxonomy-eligible activities, including R&D CapEx, were calculated using allocation keys of eligible turnover per business and operations. In 2021, CapEx for eligible individual measures was not evaluated, however the Group is working to implement the reporting process to do so next year.\n\n## Calculation of Taxonomy-eligible Operational Expenditure (OpEx)\n\nOnly non-capitalized costs related to Research and Development (R&D) are reported. OpEx related to building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair and other expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets represent less than EUR 116 million and are therefore considered as non-material for Schneider Electric business, and therefore excluded from the KPI calculation.\n\nThe denominator of Taxonomy eligible OpEx KPI represents EUR 1,276 million, corresponding to non-capitalized Research and Development costs of the Group for EUR 1,232 million presented",

It is also one of the pillars of the Group's Code of Conduct (Trust Charter). Overall, transformations linked to climate change are a source of opportunities for Schneider Electric, the main risk being to fail leading by example and thereby lose traction with customers, investors, new talents and collaborators in the company. Concrete climate-related programs to either grab opportunities, or mitigate risks are deployed every 3 to 5 years in our Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) and complement the Group's Climate Pledge - our short-term (2025), mid-term (2030) and long-term (2040, 2050) objectives, aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory. We present below our main climate-related disclosures in line with TCFD recommendations.\n\nRecommended\n\nDisclosure\n\nCDP Climate Change\n\n& URD 2021 references\n\nBrief description (please refer to CDP Climate Change response and other sections of this Universal Registration Document for further details)\n\n## 1.

The risks and opportunities are then monitored and managed on a continuous basis. Several governance bodies are involved in this process:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors has oversight of climate-related issues notably through its Human Resources & CSR Committee. This Committee has 6 Director members who report to the Board of Directors, and reviews Schneider's CSR strategy, SSI performance and the Group's positioning vs. its peers.\n- \u00b7 The Executive Committee has a dedicated Group Sustainability Committee, which gathers 6 Executive Committee members (1 level below the Chairman & CEO) and is chaired by the Chief Strategy & Sustainability (Chairman of the Committee). This Committee meets two to three times a year and decides on the sustainability strategy and validates the SSI and carbon pledge.\n- \u00b7 The SSI Steering Committee was formed in 2020 to propose precise and measurable transformation programs for the 2021 - 2025 SSI, which were then submitted to the Group Sustainability Committee for approval.\n- \u00b7 The Sustainability Department coordinates the overall sustainability strategy of the Group and rollout of action plans.\n- \u00b7 A Carbon Committee is in charge of continuously assessing climate-related risks and opportunities, steering the Group carbon pledge and proposing a strategy and management plan to the Group Sustainability Committee.\n\nAdditionally, environmental transformations are driven by a network of leading experts in various environmental fields such as eco-design, energy efficiency, circular economy, or CO 2 . Environment leaders coordinate a network of more than 600 managers responsible for the environmental management of sites, countries, product design and marketing.\n\nRead more in section 2.3.1 'Climate governance' page 128.\n\n## 2.

The Group is uniquely positioned to grab these opportunities because it acts on both sides of the equation:\n\n- \u00b7 The solutions Schneider Electric brings to the market are directly linked to activities to mitigate, adapt, and improve humanity's resilience to climate change;\n- \u00b7 At the same time, Schneider Electric acts to reduce its end-to-end CO 2 footprint, aiming for a net-zero CO 2 supply chain by 2050, with precise steps for 2025, 2030 and 2040.\n\nIn 2021, 71% of the Group revenues qualify as Impact revenues, following Schneider Electric's definition, meaning revenues from offers that bring energy, climate, or resource efficiency to customers, while not generating any significant harmful impacts to the environment. The Group aims to grow its Impact revenues to 80% by 2025. Additionally, maintaining the best offers on the market for greener, more efficient products and services that support the transition to a low-carbon economy needs adapted investments in Research and Development in the short term. Schneider Electric invest about 5% of its annual revenues in R&D each year. It is estimated that more than 90% of its innovation projects contribute to solutions contributing to climate change mitigation.",

This can translate into an increase of the cost of goods sold and reduced margins.\n- \u00b7 Transition risks: given the relatively low level of the Group's Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions, future carbon pricing regulations would have rather indirect impacts, resulting in increased supply chain costs, especially regarding the purchase of raw materials and manufactured components containing metals and plastics.\n- \u00b7 Workplace disruptions: extreme weather events, floods, droughts, and other climate impacts will increasingly put pressure onto supply chains. Shortages of all kinds can translate directly into revenue loss (missed orders), increased costs (urgent shipping), and increased working capital requirements (stock management). Extreme events can also cause damage to property and assets.\n\nTo further tie climate-related issues to financial planning, Schneider Electric successfully launched the first-ever sustainability-linked convertible bonds, linked to 3 SSI targets including the objective to save and avoid 800 million tons CO 2 on customers' end by 2025, since 2018.\n\nRead more in section 2.3.1 'Climate governance' page 128 and 2.3.2 'Roadmap towards a 1.5\u00b0C climate trajectory' page 130..\n\nSchneider Electric has a dedicated Strategy Prospective & External Affairs SVP attached to the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, in charge of climate and environment scenario analysis. Several scenarios to 2050 were developed in 2019, which included critical reviews of the geopolitical landscape, commodity and resources availability, economic and financial evolutions, climate sensitivity and evolving policies, energy transition pathways and technology developments, among others, with consequences quantified, looking at ten regions and a number of sectors individually, framing the business landscape in which Schneider operates.\n\nIn 2021, Schneider Electric published a set of scenarios exploring the feasibility of a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory in a report called 'Back to 2050', demonstrating that a net-zero carbon future, aligned with IPCC's 1.5\u00b0C scenarios, is still possible, and the Group is uniquely positioned to embark its ecosystem onto an inclusive, zero-carbon transition.\n\nKey findings are regularly cross-checked with new publications, particularly the ones from the International Energy Agency, BNEF, the IRENA, among others.\n\nGovernance is well in place, under the leadership of the Chief Strategy & Sustainability Officer, and both short- and long-term analysis are shared internally and used to inform strategic priorities across business and operations.\n\nAs part of the analysis, the Group identified that a growing demand for greener, lowcarbon products and services creates a strong business opportunity for Schneider Electric. Key takeaways from the analysis is the dominant role of:\n\n- \u00b7 Electrification: the world is becoming more electric, with demand growing potentially up to 3x by 2050;\n- \u00b7 Digitization: with the increase in connectivity, complemented by real-time information and competitive computing capabilities, digital technologies play a major role in reaching decarbonization targets while augmenting economic productivity, notably around efficiency in energy and resource use and circularity, as well as increased resiliency and security.\n\nAll these findings, and their potential financial impact on its business have helped the Group to fine-tune key development areas that will allow its active contribution to the low-carbon transition, enabling notably the development of its sustainability portfolio of offers.\n\n2.",

The carbon footprint of the Group helps to pinpoint and understand the magnitude of climate-related risks and opportunities, and is also used to monitor progress. Scope 3 emissions represent more than 99% of the Group's carbon footprint, of which 87% are due to the use phase and the products' end of life, and around 11% come from the purchase of raw materials, equipment, and services. Emissions induced, saved, and avoided by Schneider's products and services during their use phase and end-of-life are also quantified. Key metrics over the last four years (from publication year) on GHG emissions are published page 230 of this document.\n\nEmissions calculations are done with GHG Protocol methodology. The carbon footprint methodology is compliant with ISO 14069 principles. The results are calculated in tons of CO 2 equivalent, taking into account all greenhouse gases included in the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nThe Group has launched several concrete programs aiming at either directly or indirectly reducing GHG emissions, under the Climate and Resources pillars of its 2025 strategy. These programs are presented under Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) and Schneider Sustainability Essentials (SSE) 2021-2025 programs in pages 63 to 65 of this document. These programs cover the performance of the Group's operations (such as energy efficiency, renewable electricity procurement, fleet electrification), suppliers (such as The Zero Carbon Project, green materials or sustainable packaging) and customers (Green Premium offers, SF 6 -free alternative offers, CO 2 savings and avoidance quantification on customer's end thanks to EcoStruxure \u2122 ).\n\nThe overall performance of the SSI represents 20% in the short-term incentives for 64,000+ employees worldwide (collective share). The Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index (SSERI), which measures Schneider's performance in 4 major ESG external ratings (CDP Climate Change, Vigeo Eiris, DJSI and EcoVadis), also impacts 25% of the long-term incentives (LTI) for 2,300+ top leaders.\n\nIn addition, Schneider is committed to embed a carbon pricing of EUR 30-130 /metric ton (depending on time horizons) in strategic supply chain and R&D decisions, to assess the performance and resiliency of operations as well as to assess whether the investment and reduction efforts are in line with the cost of CO 2 externality.\n\nSchneider Electric is a signatory of the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C initiative aimed at setting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets in line with the global effort to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nGroup short to medium-term targets:\n\n- \u00b7 Before 2025, demonstrate that Schneider Electric is carbon positive together with its customers and partners, thanks to CO 2 savings delivered by EcoStruxure \u2122 ;\n- \u00b7 On the Group's operations (scope 1 and 2): be carbon neutral by 2025 (allowing CO 2 offsets) and net-zero CO 2 emissions by 2030;\n- \u00b7 On indirect emissions (scope 3) in its supply chain and with customers: reduce emissions by -35% by 2030 (versus 2017), by actively engaging suppliers to accelerate their climate strategy, by sourcing greener materials and by proposing more efficient solutions to its customers.\n\nThe Group's 2030 targets (net-zero CO 2 emissions on scope 1 and 2, and -35% on scope 3) have been validated 1.5\u00b0C-aligned by the Science-Based Target initiative in 2019.\n\n## Group long-term targets\n\n- \u00b7 Become carbon neutral on the Group's full end-to-end footprint by 2040 (scope 1, 2, and 3), 10 years ahead of 1.5 \u00b0C trajectory. This means that all Schneider Electric's products will be carbon neutral in 2040;\n- \u00b7 Engage with suppliers to move towards a net-zero CO 2 supply chain by 2050.\n\n2.",

As per the Group' s Environmental Policy, all industrial and logistics sites with more than 50 people and tertiary sites with more than 500 people must be ISO 14001 certified within 2 years after their acquisition or creation.\n\nA difference can, therefore, be noted with respect to the scope of financial consolidation. Comments on the indicators are included in the corresponding chapters.\n\n## 2.8.1.2  Perimeter and Environmental Management Systems (ISO 14001)\n\n| Indicators                         | Units   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| ISO 14001 certified Sites (1)      | #       | 244    | 232    | 241    | 253    |\n| Industrial and logistics sites     | #       | 211    | 212    | 220    | 230    |\n| Tertiary sites                     | #       | 33     | 20     | 21     | 23     |\n| % of sites certified ISO 14001 (2) | %       | 87%    | 90%    | 89%    | 86%    |\n\n## 2.8.1.3  Group site consumption, emissions and waste\n\n## Materials\n\n| GRI   | Indicators                                                                                           | Units       | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 301-2 | SSI #4 - Green material content in our  products (1)                                                 | %           | 11%    | 7%     | UP     | UP     |\n| 301-2 | SSI #5 - Primary and secondary packaging  free from single-use plastic using recycled  cardboard (2) | %           | 21%    | 13%    | UP     | UP     |\n|       | SSE #6 - Product revenues covered by Green  Premium \u2122                                                | %           | 78%    | 77%    | 55%    | 46%    |\n|       | SSE #10 - Metric tons of avoided primary  resource consumption through 'take-back at  end-of-use'    | metric tons | 46,293 | 60,149 | 53,867 | 43,572 |\n|       | SSE #15 - Reduce scrap from safety units  recalled                                                   | kg          | 4,024  | 4,202  | UP     | UP     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2021 audited indicators.

Examples of waste reduction projects include creating a closed-loop system for pallets between the site and the supplier, or reducing packaging waste from incoming shipments. Normal operational decreases of waste due to reduced activity do not count as waste reduction.\n- (2)  Non-hazardous waste recovered or reduced is calculated as the ratio between waste reused/recycled, incinerated with energy recovery and reduced, divided by the total non-hazardous waste generated and waste reduced. The Group's waste recovery% without waste reduction is: 95.5%, 96.3%, and 95.2% for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n- (3)  'Schneider Electric expectations' for hazardous waste means: 1) Waste meets/exceeds all local legal requirements for handling/treatment, and either 2a) waste is neutralized of its hazardous nature, or b) waste is handled/treated using the feasibly best available technique which provides the most environmentally beneficial impact.\n- (4)  2017 hazardous waste intensity was 0.42 metric tons per million euros of revenues.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\n| GRI Indicators                                                                               | Units   |   2021 |    | 2020   | 2019 2018   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|----|--------|-------------|\n| 304-1 Number of sites owned, leased or managed  in or adjacent to protected areas and/or key | #       |    260 | UP | UP     | UP          |\n| of which industrial sites or distribution centres                                            | #       |    107 | UP | UP     | UP          |\n| of which office buildings                                                                    | #       |    153 | UP | UP     | UP          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2021 audited indicators.

UP = Unpublished.\n- Note than Schneider Electric carbon footprint has been updated in 2021 to reflect changes in Global Warming Potential (GWP) values for SF 6 gaz published by the IPCC in its 6th Assessment Report. Previous GWP value of 23,500 (AR5) has been updated to 25,200 (AR6) for 2021 and historical emissions and impacts scope 1 and scope 3 CO 2 equivalent emissions.\n\n- (2)   In 2017, direct (scope 1) emissions, energy indirect (scope 2) emissions and other relevant indirect (scope 3) emissions amounted to 187,477, 511,602 (699,079 total scope 1+2) and 67,413,029 TCO 2 e respectively;\n\n- (4)  CO 2 emissions for sites not included in the energy reporting perimeter are estimated based on site surface and average CO 2 intensity of sites per region from our energy reporting.\n- (5)  Greenhouse gas emissions from renewable electricity are due to CH4 and N2O emissions of renewable electricity from biomass. In addition, biogenic CO 2 emissions are due to the consumption of renewable electricity from biomass, and are not reported in scope 2 emissions following GHG protocol guidance. These emissions are of 17,215 tCO 2 b in 2021.\n- (6)  Emissions of products sold by Schneider Electric during the year of reporting, and cumulated over their lifetime. These emissions are due to electricity consumption of products, either due to internal consumption or due to heat dissipation (Joule effect);\n- (7) CO 2 savings are calculated for sales of the reporting year and cumulated over the offers' lifetime. Emissions are calculated as the difference between emissions with Schneider Electric's offer and emissions in the reference situation. The methodology distinguishes 'saved' and 'avoided' emissions: saved CO 2 emissions correspond to brownfield sales that enable reduction of global CO 2 emissions compared to previous years, and avoided CO 2 emissions correspond to greenfield sales that enable a limitation of the increase of global emission. Each year, new methodologies are developed, and CO 2 saved and avoided from those offers is quantified for sales that occurred since 2018, and counted fully in the performance of the reporting year. In 2021, out of the 83.6 MTCO 2 e saved and avoided, 7.8 MT (9%) came from 20182020 backdated performance.\n\n2.",

Indeed, resilience is one of the fundamental elements of sustainable growth and belongs directly to the Group's Sustainability value. All Group entities, along the three lines of defense described hereafter, are encouraged to:\n\n- \u00b7 Develop a culture promoting resilience for the Group;\n- \u00b7 Raise resilience awareness and best practices, within their scope of work;\n- \u00b7 Implement initiatives aimed at increasing the Group resilience, by decreasing the risk exposure and/or increasing its level of preparedness.\n\n## Hybrid risk management model\n\nSchneider Electric uses a hybrid risk management model. It means that there are Central functions and experts in charge of setting risk management mechanisms, establishing policies, and other activities, but that the ownership of the risks belongs to the Business Units and Operating Divisions who are responsible for deploying the central framework to manage their risks. The section hereafter (3.2.2) goes over our three lines of defense and gives more detail about our hybrid risk management model.\n\n## 3.1.2 Scope of this report\n\nThe system is designed to cover the Group, defined as the Schneider Electric SE parent company and the subsidiaries over which it exercises exclusive control.\n\nAcquired companies are integrated progressively into the internal control and risk management systems.",

These reviews cover business trends, action plans, current results, and forecasts for the quarters ahead.\n\nSimilar reviews are carried out at different levels of the Group prior to Senior Management's review.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit department reports to Senior Management. It had an average headcount of 18 auditors and 23 regional internal controllers in 2021. The internal auditors are responsible for ensuring that, at the level of each Business Unit:\n\n- \u00b7 the identification and control of risks is performed;\n- \u00b7 significant financial, management, and operating information is accurate and reliable;\n- \u00b7 compliance with laws and regulations and with the Group's policies, standards, and procedures is ensured;\n- \u00b7 compliance with the instructions of the Chairman & CEO is ensured;\n- \u00b7 acquisition of resources is carried out at a competitive cost, and their protection is ensured;\n- \u00b7 expenses are properly engaged and monitored;\n- \u00b7 correct integration and control of acquisitions are ensured.\n\nAnnual internal audit and internal control plans are drawn up based on a combination of a risk-based and audit universe coveragebased approach. The risk-based dimension is embedding risk and control concerns identified by Senior Management, taking into account the results of past audits, the results of Key Internal Control self-assessments returned by the Business Units, and other indicators such as the evolution of a set of financial metrics, the Corruption Perception Index, or the Employees Disengagement Index. When necessary, the audit plan is adjusted during the year to include special requests from Senior Management.\n\nAfter each internal audit, a report is issued setting out the auditors' findings and recommendations for the Business Unit or Function audited. The management of audited entities or audited domains is requested to define for each recommendation an action plan aiming at implementing corrective actions. Measures are taken to monitor implementation of the recommendations and specific follow up audits are conducted if necessary.\n\nAudit reports and the implementation of their recommendations are distributed to Senior Management. An executive summary is sent to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee as well as to the top management. A synthesis of the main takeaways and conclusions from a selected number of audit missions is presented to the Audit Committee for each committee session (five times per year).\n\nThese reports are subject to regular exchange with the Group's auditors.\n\nThe Head of Internal Audit has direct access to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee and meets her on a regular basis throughout the year.\n\n## Internal Control department\n\nThe Internal Control department, which reports to the Reporting and Consolidation unit, is responsible for, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 defining and updating the list of Key Internal Controls in close co-operation with the Global Functions and other subject matter experts in line with the recommendations of the French Financial Market Authorities (AMF) reference framework;\n- \u00b7 maintaining and leading a network of around 14 local internal controllers who are responsible for supporting local management on internal control topics and acting as process owners for certain key areas such as the chart of authority and segregation of duties; and\n- \u00b7 organizing and monitoring the roll-out of self-assessment campaigns and implementation of set action plans following self-assessments.\n\nThe team continues to improve the internal control process and adapt its procedures following the results of self-assessments and changes in the business environment or organization.\n\n## Global Finance department\n\nThe Global Finance department is actively involved in organizing control and ensuring compliance with financial procedures.\n\nWithin the department, the Reporting and Consolidation unit plays a key role in the internal control system by:\n\n- \u00b7 drafting and updating instructions designed to ensure that statutory and management accounting practices are consistent throughout the Group and compliant with applicable regulations;\n- \u00b7 organizing period-end closing procedures;\n- \u00b7 analyzing performance and tracking the achievement of targets assigned to the Operating Divisions and Business Units.\n\nThe Reporting and Consolidation unit is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 the proper application of Group accounting principles and policies;\n- \u00b7 the integrity of the consolidation system database;\n- \u00b7 the quality of accounting and financial processes and data;\n- \u00b7 training for finance staff by developing and leading specific seminars on the function; and\n- \u00b7 drafting, updating, and distributing the necessary documents for producing quality information.\n\nThe Reporting and Consolidation unit drafts and updates:\n\n- \u00b7 a glossary of terms used by the Reporting and Consolidation unit, including a definition of each term;\n- \u00b7 the chart of accounts for reporting;\n- \u00b7 a Group statutory and management accounting standards manual, which includes details of debit/credit pairings;\n- \u00b7 a Group reporting procedures manual and a system user's guide;\n- \u00b7 a manual describing the procedures to be followed to integrate newly acquired businesses in the Group reporting process;\n- \u00b7 an intercompany reconciliation procedures manual; and\n- \u00b7 account closing schedules and instructions.\n\nThe Reporting and Consolidation unit monitors the reliability of data from subsidiaries and conducts monthly reviews of the various Business Units' primary operations and performance.\n\n3.",

Additionally, this community partners closely with the senior business leaders. This has been done to ensure a simple structure so that technology can be close to business and to maintain consistency across all divisions of Schneider Electric.\n\nThe Human Resources department is responsible for deploying and ensuring the application of procedures and compliance with HR regulations concerning employee development, promoting diversity, and well-being. The department is also responsible for establishing guidelines on rewards and compensation, hiring, on and off boarding, and learning, amongst other human resources-related duties.\n\nThe Procurement department within the Supply Chain Function is responsible for establishing guidelines concerning the procurement organization and procedures, relationships between buyers and vendors, and procedures governing product quality, level of service, and compliance with environmental and safety standards.\n\nGlobal Functions and Operating Divisions also issue, adapt, and distribute policies, target procedures, and instructions to Business Units and individuals assigned to handle their specific duties.

The figure below brings a few definitions and examples for each risk nature and shows the parameters that allow to differentiate them: Expected reward for risk and controllability.\n\n## Expected reward for risk\n\n(Value for the org. to take on risk)\n\n(Ability of org. to reduce the uncertainties creating risks)\n\nFigure 3: Three risk nature and their unique approaches\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the trend-driven risks, the objective is to reduce the business impact cost-effectively and prepare to turn a disrupted environment into opportunities.

This is complemented with specific strategy cadences.\n\nFor the event triggered risks, the objective is to reduce the risk exposure and increase the level of preparedness. Here are a few examples of the assets used to achieve this goal: crisis management and business continuity planning, strong policies and procedures adoption, and continuous risk and incidents monitoring.\n\nFor management practice risks, the objective is to avoid or eliminate occurrences cost-effectively with a risk culture and compliance model embedded in Operating Divisions, strong policies and procedures adoption, and an effective set of internal controls.",

        "page_content": "## 3.3.3 Each Risk Overseer is in charge of moving the risk flywheel for his/her respective domain\n\n## Risk taxonomy\n\nThe Group established a unique risk taxonomy to have a common language with all stakeholders. All risk categories included are mapped to a Risk Overseer who is responsible for all assets and processes around the risk flywheel (see figure below). The risk taxonomy is reviewed once per year, with inputs from the three lines of defense.\n\n## Trust Charter\n\nThe Trust Charter is the Group code of conduct. Each section is mapped to the risk taxonomy and has the goal, among others, to bring a level of awareness to employees that will contribute to decreasing the Group risk exposure. See more details about the Trust Charter in Chapter 2, section 2.2.1.\n\n## Policies\n\nA policy is an official statement and process description produced and supported by the leadership team and states where the organization stands on important topics or issues. They create the backbone of an organization and are important for all stakeholders to enable and reinforce trust. Each Risk Overseer is responsible to ensure needed policies are written and published. Then, that they are implemented, communicated, and their implementation is being monitored. See more details about policies in Chapter 2, section 2.1.4.4.\n\n## Mandatory PMI (1) tasks\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management framework applies not only to its core and legacy activities, but also to recently acquired companies as part of the post-acquisition integration process. Trust Standards are defined to ensure the integration process is addressing risks and compliance matters, meeting legal obligations, creating a more standardized back-end, and providing clarity regarding integration requirements across the portfolio of companies.\n\n## Key Internal Controls\n\nThe Group uses a set of internal controls that is reviewed and updated annually, with the feedback of the Risk Overseers (among others). One of the goals of internal controls is to assess the effectiveness of the mitigation put in place to address a risk. For the controls that are risk specific, the outcome of the yearly self-assessment campaign is twofold: provide a high-level view of the situation to the top management and Risk Overseers, and provide action plans to the risk owners to improve their mitigation, if relevant.\n\n## Key risk metrics\n\nRisk metrics are defined to measure the Group risk exposure for each risk category. They are defined by the Risk Overseers and reviewed on a regular basis. Defining risk thresholds helps to foster a risk centric culture and take business decisions based on risk appetite.\n\n## Yearly risk reviews\n\nThe Group's entities are performing frequent risk reviews. There are three types:\n\n- \u00b7 Zone or country risk reviews, where the leadership team and risk owners review the top risks affecting their territory and legal entities, as well as the mitigation in place.\n- \u00b7 Function or risk category reviews, where the leadership team and Risk Overseers review the risks affecting their domain of expertise, as well as the mitigation they put in place.\n- \u00b7 Consolidated risk reviews, performed by the Audit & Risks Committee aiming, in particular, to review and assess the internal control framework and risk management system effectiveness.\n\n## Risk maturity assessments\n\nIn a spirit of continuous improvement, Risk Overseers perform risk maturity self-assessments on a regular basis. It helps drive constant improvements to the ways in which the risk is managed within the Group. Among other things, it ensures the Group takes the right steps towards an optimized risk maturity level including:\n\n- \u00b7 Governance and organization with dynamic resource allocation;\n- \u00b7 Management systems are aligned and optimized across all three lines of defense;\n- \u00b7 Processes and controls rely on digital and advanced analytics to optimized effectiveness and efficiency;\n- \u00b7 Communication and training are adapted to specific needs, with a measured impact.\n\nFigure 4: Risk flywheel\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3.",

In 2021, around 40 of the Group's top managers were interviewed in addition to external financial analysts and Board members. Since 2016, individualized risk matrices by Operating Division or by Business Unit have been created.\n\nThe risks identified through these interviews are ranked by a risk score (comprising impact and likelihood of occurrence) and level of mitigation.\n\nRisk factors related to the Group's business, as well as procedures for managing and reducing those risks, are described in 'Key risks', section 3.4 on page 254. These procedures are an integral part of the internal control system.\n\nThe risk matrix and the analysis of changes from one year to the next contribute to the development of an internal audit plan for the following year. Around two-thirds of the risk categories identified in the Group's risk matrix are audited by the Internal Audit department over a period of five to six years to assess action plans for managing and reducing these risks.\n\n## Local risks related to the Company's business at the Business Unit level\n\nLocal risks related to the Company's business are managed first and foremost by the Business Units in liaison with the Operating Divisions, based on Group guidelines (particularly via the Key Internal Controls). Each subsidiary is responsible for implementing procedures that provide an adequate level of internal control.\n\nThe Operating Divisions implement cross-functional action plans for key risks related to the Company's business identified as being recurrent in the Business Units or as having a material impact at the Group level, as appropriate. The internal control system is adjusted to account for these risks.\n\n## Risks related to the Solutions business\n\nThe Solutions Risk Management department defines and implements principles and tools designed to manage the contractual (such as limitation of liabilities), technical (such as technical discrepancy versus customer specifications), and financial risks (such as factors that may impact margin at solution execution phase).\n\nThe network of Solution Risk Managers assess the risks and mitigations related to major projects in conjunction with the subject matter experts and Tender Managers during the preparation of offers. Solution Risk Managers then provides a comprehensive, 360-degree view on project risk and mitigations to support the opportunity approval process.\n\n## Risk management by the Legal department\n\nThe Legal department oversees the legal affairs and manages the risks relating to legal matters.\n\nThe Financial Risk Insurance team contributes to the internal control system by defining and deploying a Group-wide insurance strategy, as defined in 'Insurance', section 3.5 on page 265. The insurance strategy includes the identification and quantification of the main insurable risks, the determination of levels of retention, and the cost benefit analysis of the transfer options. The Risk and Insurance department also defines, proposes, and implements action plans to prevent these risks and protect assets.\n\n## Risk management by the Global Security department\n\nThe Group's Global Security department defines corporate governance regarding loss prevention in the area of willful acts against property and people.\n\nThe Global Security Group Committee was created in 2017, uniting the Zone Security Leaders. Some of these leaders report directly to the Global Security department and some to local management with functional reporting to Global Security. In close co-operation with the Compliance department and the Risk and Insurance department, Global Security is involved in assessing the nature of risk to our people, as well as defining adequate prevention and protection measures.",

The assessment is the result of the process performed as part of the overall risk management mechanism described in 'Risk identification and management', section 3.3.4 on page 252. The impact considered for the assessment is the potential net impact which corresponds to the potential gross impact (financial/human/legal/reputation), after having taken in consideration the current mitigation measures, as well as the probability of occurrence of this risk. The assessment by Schneider Electric of this level of materiality may be changed at any time, in particular should new facts, whether external or specific to the Group, come to light.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|     | Categories and Risks                                                                                                               | Potential   net impact Page   |\n|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1   | Event triggered risks                                                                                                              |                               |\n| 1.1 | Risk of cybersecurity on the Schneider Electric infrastructure and its digital ecosystem                                           | 255                           |\n| 1.2 | Export controls                                                                                                                    | 255                           |\n| 1.3 | Strengthening of chemical and resource-related regulations in the Electric and Electronic Equipment space                          | 256                           |\n| 1.4 | Corruption linked to B2B and project business                                                                                      | 256                           |\n| 1.5 | Human rights, environmental, and safety issues through the value chain                                                             | 257                           |\n| 1.6 | Schneider Electric connected products used as a gateway to attack Group's customers and partners                                   | 258                           |\n| 1.7 | Product quality                                                                                                                    | 259                           |\n| 1.8 | Competition laws                                                                                                                   | 259                           |\n| 1.9 | Counterparty risk                                                                                                                  | 260                           |\n| 1.1 | Currency exchange risk                                                                                                             | 260                           |\n| 2   | Trend driven risks                                                                                                                 |                               |\n| 2.1 | World deglobalization and fragmentation                                                                                            | 261                           |\n| 2.2 | New players such as digital giants, software players, and energy majors entering the energy efficiency and  renewable energy space | 261                           |\n| 2.3 | Supply chain resilience                                                                                                            | 262                           |\n| 2.4 | Digital evolution and software offers                                                                                              | 262                           |\n| 2.5 | Attracting and developing talent with a focus on critical skills                                                                   | 262                           |\n| 3   | Management practice risks                                                                                                          |                               |\n| 3.1 | IT systems management                                                                                                              | 263                           |\n| 3.2 | Pricing strategy                                                                                                                   | 264                           |\n\n## Key to symbols\n\nHigh impact\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Event triggered risks\n\n## 1.1 Risk of cybersecurity on the Schneider Electric infrastructure and its digital ecosystem\n\n## Risk description\n\nSchneider Electric, like other organizations with a similar global footprint and presence, is exposed to the risk of cyberattacks and data privacy breaches.\n\nAs an industrial and technology company, the Group has IT and Operational Technology activities spread over more than 25 sites, with dozens of R&D sites, and more than 200 production and logistic units. On those sites, Operational Technology systems are converging more and more with IT systems, especially through the use of Internet of Things (IoT) expanding the overall attack surface.\n\nAdditionally, the move from a product-centered business model to a service-oriented business model with software (e.g., digital offers like 'Advisors' software suites or managed digital services) and augmented data naturally increases cybersecurity risks, such as data breaches and intellectual property theft.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe NIST framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover) is used with a Cyber Risk Register and High-Value Assets program:\n\n## 1.2 Export controls\n\n## Risk description\n\nInternational, foreign, and national export control laws and regulations govern the transfer of goods, services, and technologies within a country or between countries and/or their nationals. Elements that may trigger restrictions and licensing requirements may include, but are not limited to, countries, parties, product, and end-uses.\n\nSchneider Electric being a Multi-National Corporation (MNC) with international operations spanning across more than 100 different countries worldwide, must constantly ensure full compliance to such laws and regulations by implementing a robust corporate export control compliance program. Any implications may result in a significant impact on the Group's businesses, results, reputation, and financial position.\n\nAlbeit that Schneider Electric's product portfolio only has a limited product range that may have dual-use goods features as well as non-dual-use goods (e.g., breakers) that may be used in sensitive applications; restriction or licensing requirements may apply to these products, especially if associated with politically sensitive countries and destinations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Cyber threats are mitigated by implementing cyber practices and capabilities, policy-driven controls, and enforcing mechanisms. For example, the Group implemented a Data Protection program, Source Code Management framework, and System & Solution security program.\n- \u00b7 Global Cyber incident management and response process is in place. Events and incidents are monitored through a Security Operations Center, driven jointly with the Group's partners.\n- \u00b7 99% of employees were trained on cybersecurity in 2021. Specific employee categories received mandatory trainings for risks linked to their activity.\n- \u00b7 Multiple cyber risk assessments were completed in 2021 by the Group's cybersecurity consulting partners. Furthermore, the Group is conducting regular crisis simulation exercises on different scenarios.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Electric's posture is continuously revisited and adapted through 'reality checks', including emergency and improvement plans across the Company and cyber scoring platforms.\n- \u00b7 Independent 'reality checks' were performed: three crosscutting internal audits and external assessments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nSchneider Electric has comprehensive policies and processes to ensure compliance with applicable export control laws and regulations ('Schneider Electric Export Control Program') and to mitigate the above described risks. The Global Export Control Center of Excellence, as part of the Schneider Electric Global Legal and Risk Management Function, oversees the monitoring and enforcement of the Schneider Electric Export Control Program.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Export Control Program may include, but is not limited to, embargo and restricted country, denied party, dual-use goods, and sensitive end-users screenings; incorporation of Export Control provision in the main sales and procurement contractual template; and conducting of regular awareness and online and classroom training sessions for all relevant Schneider Electric employees.\n\nThe Schneider Electric Export Control Program will continue its enhancement and updates to ensure compliance with applicable export control laws and regulations.\n\n3.",

Event triggered risks\n\n## 1.3 Strengthening of chemical and resource-related regulations in the Electric and Electronic Equipment space\n\n## Risk description\n\nSchneider Electric's plants and products are subject to strict environmental laws and regulations.\n\nMany countries have increased legal requirements for the use of chemicals and resources, both in manufacturing processes and in the bill of materials of products.\n\nKey Product Environmental regulations were strengthened in 2019, especially those specific to Electric and Electronic Equipment (EEE): RoHS (restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment) and WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment). RoHS bans ten chemical substances used in many product categories sold by Schneider Electric: this may require substitutions and may represent a considerable risk of non-compliance. WEEE concerns the Group Extended Producer Responsibility and obliges an active role in the framework of products end life, particularly in terms of financing the collection channels. In 2021, Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) introduced restrictions on additional substances.\n\nRegulations could phase out specific chemical substances or resources too quickly, with no suitable alternative being found in a scalable manner.\n\nIn relation with Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Schneider Electric needs to critically assess environmental risks of all acquired companies' product portfolios to ensure strict environmental compliance of all their products, in every market where they are traded.\n\nIn addition, as described in Note 21 (see 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', section 5 of chapter 5, page 381), provisions of EUR 350 million are set aside to cover environmental risks. These provisions are primarily funded to cover clean-up costs related to sites (not potential penalties). The estimation of the expected future outflows is based on reports from independent experts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFrench 'Duty of Care' and country-specific initiatives (e.g., China) have reaffirmed the expectations towards engaging suppliers in environmental de-risking efforts.\n\nLocal regulations could force a percentage of recycled content in some product categories, where neither the relevant recycled resources may be available, nor the product certified or accepted - with recycled content - by IEC, NEMA, or any other electrical standards.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Group's Integrated Management System (IMS), which covers safety, energy, quality, and environment, continues to be deployed across all industrial sites and major commercial offices. Environmental and Safety compliance audits, conducted by thirdparty consultants or internal specialists, take place periodically across countries.\n\nOffer Creation Process (OCP) is strict, and each step and deliverable embed EcoDesign ambitions and principles: selection of resources, identification of critical substances, life cycle assessment, and then production of REACH and RoHS reports.\n\nThe Group's community of EcoDesign business partners train the R&D teams in all new and upcoming environmental regulations and assist them with precise guidance.\n\nSchneider Electric has been part of taskforces on the circular economy, playing leadership roles in multi-stakeholder dialogues in Europe, China, and the USA, to discuss opportunities and hurdles: regulations, environmental impacts, protection of customers' interests, and job creation. Schneider Electric is active in France's Circular Economy Roadmap and engaged in China with MIIT on circular economy. The Group engages in discussions on circular economy relating to its sector with FIEEC, Gim\u00e9lec, IGNES, ORGALIM, and other various circles.\n\n## 1.4 Corruption linked to B2B and project business\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe exposure of the Group to corruption risk has been increasing for several years, due to the expansion of the Group's activities in new economies, especially in Asia and Africa, through organic growth, and mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe business model of the Group relies on a large ecosystem of partners, including more than 52,000 suppliers throughout the world representing a procurement volume in excess of EUR 12 billion, and also, resellers and distributors. This ecosystem may represent a risk for the Group, being accountable for activities performed on its behalf, and in regards to potential conflicts of interest or unethical solicitations.\n\nIn addition, the Group is participating in complex projects involving a large range of partners in sectors at risk, such as oil and gas, and with end-users from the public sector in countries at risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver the past years, the increase of law enforcement by public authorities, higher press coverage of fines imposed on companies, and new regulations requiring a strong compliance program have significantly changed the potential impact of corruption risks.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nTo mitigate this risk, Schneider Electric has built a dedicated Group Compliance Team, composed of corporate compliance counsels and regional compliance officers. Since August 2020, a new Ethics & Compliance department has been created, overseeing - among others - the Fraud Examination Team.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 3 - How we manage risk at Schneider Electric\n\nStrategic Report\n\nA global whistleblowing system, available to employees and external stakeholders, is also managed to combat this risk. In 2021, 585 employee and 70 external stakeholder alerts have been received and managed through follow-up inquiries.\n\nIn addition, the Group Ethics Charter, the Principles of Responsibility, was updated in September 2021 and renamed the Trust Charter, acting as the new Group Code of Conduct, reinforcing guidance regarding anti-corruption commitments. Beyond the recent updates of the Business Agents Policy (August 2019) and of the Anti-Corruption Policy (November 2019), the new Conflict of Interest Policy was deployed in 2021 and two further policies were finalized at the end of 2021, for deployment early 2022: the updated Gift & Hospitality Policy and the new Philanthropy Policy.\n\nFurthermore, a Group-wide Ethics & Compliance risk assessment was carried-out in the second half of 2021, which led to regional and Group level risk maps on corruption matters. Action plans related to global and regional corruption risks were deployed\n\nin 2021, and internal controls and internal audit missions were reinforced on compliance risks with several audits performed.\n\n98% of employees exposed to corruption risks have been trained thanks to the yearly mandatory Anti-corruption e-learning. The content of this e-learning is updated each year.\n\nA new project to screen the Group's third parties on anti-corruption matters has been initiated in 2021, with a gradual geographic deployment in waves planned until end 2022; the first wave of screening has been carried-out in Q4 2021.\n\nA system built-in segregation of duties control is in place in the Group's main ERPs.\n\nAll compliance-related aspects are part of the due diligence undertaken by the Group for mergers and acquisitions, in line with the specific M&A Compliance framework put in place in February 2020.\n\n## 1.5 Human rights, environmental, and safety issues through the value chain\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe exposure of the Group to human rights risks has been increasing for several years, due to the expansion of the Group's activities in countries with lesser regulatory framework regarding human rights.\n\nSpecifically, Schneider Electric's procurement volume represents more than EUR 12 billion with more than 52,000 suppliers. As part of the Duty of Vigilance program in the supply chain, Schneider Electric has performed a risk analysis through its network of suppliers and identified potential risks in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Human rights\n- \u00b7 Environment\n- \u00b7 Ethical business conduct\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity and data privacy\n\nThe occurrence of these risks with third parties may result in the following impacts on Schneider Electric:\n\n## Reputation\n\nSchneider Electric's image may be negatively impacted by third parties who:\n\n- \u00b7 Do not respect human rights or safety rules for their workers;\n- \u00b7 Are responsible for pollution and damage to the environment;\n- \u00b7 Are conducting business in a non-compliant or illegal manner.\n\n## Disruption of supply chain\n\nIt may occur due to:\n\n- \u00b7 Short-term termination of relations with a supplier;\n- \u00b7 Events resulting from a lack of safety or insufficient protective measures (e.g., fire prevention) that may affect the supply of components;\n- \u00b7 Damage to data exchanged with suppliers or digital systems (e.g., virus, malware).\n\n## Legal\n\nOver the past two years, laws regarding human rights protection, such as modern slavery matters in Australia, or the European Union's new framework on restrictive measures against serious human rights violations and abuses, have increased. Higher coverage of fines imposed on companies, and new regulations requiring a strong compliance program have significantly changed the impact of human rights violations risks.\n\nSchneider Electric expects that the exposure will continue to grow, in reference to the current drafting of a Duty of Vigilance directive at European level, as well as the European Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2024, which sets out ambitions and priorities for the next five years in this field. In addition, the current discussions on human rights due diligence framework at United Nations level, supported by the Global Compact that Schneider Electric is part of, will certainly increase the pressure on the private sector to tackle human rights challenges in the supply chain.\n\n## 2021 Specific events\n\nThe competent court regarding Duty of Vigilance cases was determined on October 21, 2021 by the joint commission in France (commission composed of seven deputies and seven senators). The judicial court will have jurisdiction over such cases, which is composed of dedicated professional lawyers.\n\nRegarding the cases related to non-compliance with the Duty of Vigilance, there has been no update on the substance of the cases, the question of jurisdiction competency being pending.\n\nIn 2021, a group of associations and NGOs filed a complaint in France against four companies in the textile sector (excluding Schneider Electric) regarding their potential involvement, via suppliers/subcontractors, in human rights violations in China.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3.",

Event triggered risks\n\n## 1.5 Human rights, environmental, and safety issues through the value chain (continued)\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nHuman rights are part of the Ethics & Compliance program which is managed by the Ethics & Compliance Committee, and Legal and Corporate Citizenship departments. More specifically, human rights are managed by the Corporate Citizenship department with the support of the Ethics & Compliance Committee in regards to risk identification through risk assessment as well as risk detection, with the whistleblowing system available for employees and for external stakeholders.\n\nRegarding training, e-learning on the Trust Charter is mandatory for all employees and, in 2021, focused on human rights amongst other ethics and compliance topics. 93% of employees completed the training by the end of 2021.\n\nSuppliers are selected according to the 'Schneider Electric Supplier Quality Management' system, which includes sustainable development criteria weighing 15% of the total evaluation of a supplier. These criteria include human rights topics.\n\nIn 2019, Schneider Electric organized the Global Suppliers Day. During this day, the Trust Charter was introduced to suppliers.\n\nAs part of the Group's five-year objective for 2021 - 2025, strategic suppliers are requested to submit themselves to an ISO 26000 evaluation. Consistent with a continuous improvement effort, these suppliers have achieved on average a +6.3 points increase\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbetween 2018 and 2020 and a +1.2 points increase in 2021 to reach an average score of 58.6.\n\nSchneider Electric has built a supplier vigilance plan in which risky suppliers are identified using criteria that take into account the geographical location of the supplier, the technologies, and the processes used. An audit plan is then built to perform either on-site supplier audits or remote self-assessments. When nonconformances are identified, corrective actions are deployed. The suppliers are then re-audited to verify that the actions have remediated the non-conformances. In 2021, in the scope of 2021 - 2025 SSE objective #17 '4,000 suppliers assessed under our 'Vigilance Program'', the Group conducted 180 on-site audits and 629 remote self-assessments. At the end of 2021, 94% of nonconformances from 2020 have been closed. The supplier vigilance plan also includes an internal training program for Schneider Electric Procurement teams and workshops with suppliers.\n\nThe Group has also defined, in 2021, a specific program with the objective to ensure that 100% of Schneider Electric's strategic suppliers provide decent work to their employees, in the scope of SSI indicator #6. The program will be launch in 2022.\n\nSchneider Electric is also currently developing a program to ensure 'social excellence' for the Group's suppliers.\n\n## 1.6 Schneider Electric connected products used as a gateway to attack Group's customers and partners\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe Energy Management and Industrial Automation sectors, like many others, are becoming more digital with pervasive IoT usage and augmented data being major accelerators for mobility, the cloud, pervasive sensing, big data, and analytics.\n\nThe digitalization of products, including native connectivity, is increasing the exposure to cybersecurity risk, where connected products and digital offers (e.g., remotely managed services like 'Advisor') at Schneider Electric or customers sites could be used as a gateway for malicious cyberattacks.\n\nSchneider Electric Exchange is an ecosystem collaboration platform with over 50,000 users, approximately 300 leverageable applications, more than 150 service providers, and around 100 communities. These types of digital offers and platforms, if compromised, could negatively impact a customer's business and consequently affect the service quality, profitability, and reputation of Schneider Electric.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Product & Systems Security Office (PSO) is reinforced with a strong mandate of developing products and securing the ecosystem in conformity with cybersecurity standards (such as the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nISO 27000 suite and IEC 62443). As an illustration, the IoT Cloud Platform (EcoStruxure \u2122 Technology Platform) has implemented controls that are mappable against the ISO 27001 standard.\n\nSchneider Electric follows a Secure Development Lifecycle process to build cybersecurity into its products, even before the design stage. In 2019, security and privacy design were enhanced with a new Secure Development Lifecycle and certified to IEC 62443-4-1. Since 2020, all digital offers (mainly 'Advisor' software suites) were assessed in the framework of digital security and privacy conformance.\n\nSchneider Electric enforces digital security and privacy conformance for products, systems, software, platforms, applications, and digital offers through security reviews and, when applicable, the Digital Certification process.\n\nSchneider Electric addresses cybersecurity vulnerabilities affecting products, software, and systems to support the security and safety of our customers. Schneider Electric works collaboratively with researchers, Cyber Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), and asset owners to ensure that accurate information is provided in a timely fashion to adequately protect customer installations. In case of a cyber incident, a process of response, connecting, and debriefing is organized with partners and customers.",

The failure of a product, system, or solution may involve costs related to the product recall, result in new development expenditure, and consume technical and economic resources.\n\nSchneider Electric's products are also subject to multiple quality and safety controls and regulations and are governed by both national and supranational standards. New or more stringent standards or regulations could result in capital investment or costs of specific measures for compliance.\n\nThe above-mentioned costs could have a significant impact on the profitability and cash equivalent of the Group. The business reputation of Schneider Electric could also be negatively impacted. Indeed, the Group has been impacted by several recalls recently, more or less ranging from EUR 10 million to EUR 40 million, depending on the case.\n\n## 1.8 Competition laws\n\n## Risk description\n\nSchneider Electric's products are sold in markets worldwide and are subject to national and supranational competition laws and antitrust regulations.\n\nSome Group entities worldwide including, but not limited to, entities in Pakistan, Belgium, France, and Spain have been directly or indirectly cited in antitrust proceedings or investigated.\n\nIn Pakistan and Belgium, the Group inherited, and subsequently discontinued, local operations from AREVA. These operations were investigated and sanctioned by the World Bank and the Belgium Competition Authority respectively.\n\nIn France, investigations were performed in September 2018 by the French police and antitrust authorities at Schneider Electric's head office and other premises concerning electrical distribution activities in France. Schneider Electric is co-operating with the French authorities in their investigations. As with any investigation, it is possible that these investigations could lead to formal proceedings against the Group in the future. While such proceedings and the possible outcomes cannot be determined at this time, it is possible it could be material in nature.\n\nIn Spain, the local subsidiary was indicted for anti-competitive behavior related to a previously owned subsidiary. The investigation was concluded in February 2020 without any significant consequence for the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nIn 2019, the Group launched a specific program called Phoenix to continue to strengthen manufacturing tools and processes. This is extended to logistic processes and suppliers, and leverages processes digitization at suppliers' sites and in our own entities.\n\nTo ensure improvement in the area of design, the Group launched in mid-2020, a dedicated program, ReeD (Reliability End To End by Design), to secure fundamentals and ensure full integration of new customer expectations (from Quality to Reliability).\n\nTo continue to protect our customers, the Group first defined five critical products ranges, and now 15 where some internal 'Nets' are implemented. The objective is to identify internal weaknesses and ensure our customers avoid facing those.\n\nThe Group grows its new design offer through constant learning, insights from the current offer, and leverage methodologies such as 'Agile' to embed quality in each and every design step.\n\nThanks to advanced analytics, the Group is starting to proactively listen for weak signals from internal captures or from customer experiences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe whistleblowing system of Trust Line for employees and external stakeholders such as suppliers is managed to identify any inappropriate practice or behavior with competitors or business partners that may be reported.\n\nFurthermore, internal controls and internal audit missions have been reinforced on compliance risks, including in respect of competition and antitrust risks.\n\nA revised compliance due diligence program for mergers and acquisitions was issued to strengthen upfront identification of compliance issues with potential acquisition targets.\n\nThe Group deployed the Trust Charter in September 2021, with reinforced guidance regarding competition and antitrust rules, and issued various other policies and directives related to competition and anti-corruption.\n\n3.",

Event triggered risks\n\n## 1.9 Counterparty risk\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe Group has a particularly wide international presence (more than 115 countries), with revenue almost equally spread across the four regions (Asia Pacific, Western Europe, North America, Rest of the World), and 43% of the revenue generated in new economies.\n\nThe Group is therefore facing multiple counterparty risks, as any economic downturn could lead to local liquidity issues with consequences in terms of cash collection and delay of payments from the customers, affecting adversely the Group's cash conversion rate.\n\nThe Group is also exposed to counterparty risks coming from financial operation with financial institutions. It includes activities such as deposits and asset management and transactions implying flows in future value dates.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, 10.8% of trade receivables were overdue, of which 2.5% by more than three months (refer to Note 16 in 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', section 5 of Chapter 5, page 373).\n\n## 1.10 Currency exchange risk\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe Group's international operations and the particularly wide international presence expose it to the risk of fluctuation of exchange rates.\n\nFluctuations in exchange rates between the reporting currencies of the Group entities and the currencies of transactions can have an impact on the Group's results and distort year-on-year performance comparisons. The same applies to the fluctuations between euro and the reporting currencies, in a more significant proportion.\n\nThe main exposure of the Group in terms of currency exchange risks is related to the US dollar, Chinese yuan, and currencies linked to the US dollar.\n\nIn 2021, revenue in foreign currencies amounted EUR 23.01 billion, including around EUR 7.4 billion in US dollars and EUR 4.4 billion in Chinese yuan.\n\nThe Group estimates that in the current structure of its operations, a 10% appreciation of the euro compared to the US dollar would have a translation effect of around minus EUR 96 million on adjusted EBITA.\n\nThe result of exchange gains and losses of 2021 amounts to EUR -8 million (as described in Note 7 in 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', section 5 of Chapter 5, page 366).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nFinancial transactions are entered into with carefully selected counterparties and adapted terms and conditions are included in contracts with customers.\n\nBanking counterparties are chosen according to the customary criteria, including the credit rating issued by an independent rating agency. Group policy consists of diversifying counterparty risks and periodic controls are performed to check compliance with the related rules.\n\nIn addition, the Group takes out substantial credit insurance and uses other types of guarantees (letters of credit and bank guarantees) to limit the risk of losses on trade accounts receivable.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the amount of the provision for receivables impairment is EUR 498 million (as described in Note 16 in 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', section 5 of Chapter 5, page 373).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Group manages its exposure to transactional currency risk to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to changes in exchange rates. Receivables and payables of the Group's subsidiaries denominated in currency other than their functional currency are hedged primarily by means of rebalancing assets and liabilities per currency (natural hedge).\n\nMore than 20 currencies are involved, with the US dollar, the Singapore dollar, the Chinese yuan, Russian ruble, Japanese yen, Mexican peso and Canadian dollar representing the most significant sources of those risks.\n\nDepending on market conditions, risks in the main currencies may be hedged based on cash-flow forecasting using contracts that expire in 12 months or less.\n\nThe financial instruments used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates are described in Note 23 in 'Notes to the consolidated financial statements', section 5 of Chapter 5, page 383.",

Trends of increased mercantilism is leading towards regionalization of trade around the United States, China, Russia, Europe, and Indian poles. Regionalized, rather than globally balanced government regulations and policies on, but not limited to, digitization, circularity, carbon, supply chain management, and others could handicap offer development efficiency through redundant efforts. These offer development duplication efforts can potentially impact Schneider Electric's profitability. In addition to the trade regionalization trend, technology decoupling, specifically between the USA and Chinese poles, have been observed through increased regulations.\n\nFurthermore, this acceleration of regional versus global trade and technology policies is increasing the pressure on the supply chains of global companies in the forms of both tariff and non-tariff barriers. As such, trade wars could disrupt Schneider Electric's operations and global supply chain. The above-mentioned combination of both nationally orientated tariff and non-tariff burden could increase the cost to market and potentially adversely impact the Group profitability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nTo mitigate the risk on supply chain efficiencies and tariff impacts, Schneider Electric has implemented a multi-hub organization. The Group has R&D and supply chain activities, suppliers, and commercial networks in the main international hubs, which are North America, EMEA, and Asia. In this multi-local context, Schneider Electric can rebalance its activities across geographies.\n\nThis setup has proved pertinent as the Group has demonstrated a solid resilience in 2020 and 2021.\n\nSchneider Electric uses prospective scenarios planning, focusing on geopolitics and trade. While the pace of external changes continues at a historically unprecedented scale regionally, global teams are working across stakeholders from Business Units, Regional Operations, and Transversal Functions (i.e., Finance, Supply Chain, Legal, Marketing, R&D, HR).\n\n## 2.2 New players such as digital giants, software players, and energy majors entering the energy efficiency and renewable energy space\n\n## Risk description\n\nSchneider Electric operates in the energy market which attracts new players and creates a new competitive landscape. Indeed, the energy industry is undergoing major transformations and disruptions driven by the following main trends:\n\n- \u00b7 A net-zero world: pressure on climate change and sustainability call for a change in business practices;\n- \u00b7 An all-electrical world: oil majors urged to reduce their impacts on carbon emissions;\n- \u00b7 An all-digital world: increasing influence of digital giants and software players.\n\nIn this context, Schneider Electric's competition landscape is evolving, and the Group can now see some digital giants, software players, or large companies such as energy majors positioning themselves - directly or indirectly - as providers of energy efficiency, which may compete with the digital services Value Propositions currently developed by the Group.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Group is driving competition performance analysis and followup of organizational changes and M&A news, and reviewing its competitors peer group and all key players in its environment.\n\nTo anticipate these changes in the competitive landscape, the Group is communicating more widely its values and positioning on climate change and sustainability.\n\nSchneider Electric also reinforces its offer portfolio with acquisitions or investments in software companies, such as RIB Software in 2020, and OSIsoft with AVEVA in 2021.\n\nSchneider Electric provides a full portfolio of solutions for customers (hardware and software) - as EcoStruxure \u2122 solutions - and energy and automation digital solutions for efficiency and sustainability.\n\nIt is also developing the Group's network of partners and reinforcing its Strategic Technology Alliances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3.",

Due to market dynamics, these constraints are unlikely to abate in the first half of 2022, particularly in electronic components such as semiconductors.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Group's supply chain strategy team is responding to the global supply chain crisis to ensure supply chain flexibility and resilience is continually improved.\n\n## 2.4 Digital evolution and software offers\n\n## Risk description\n\nMajor transformation in several areas is impacting the markets in which Schneider Electric operates, including the digitization of the Energy industry.\n\nIn the age of IoT, customers expect ever smarter products with open interfaces enabling them to be tightly integrated into more and more complex software-based solutions and benefit from new services leveraging artificial intelligence and advanced algorithms.\n\nThe Group is investing in its digital transformation journey and as such is increasing the share of its digital offers. In 2021 software and digital services had a strong growth. As such, Schneider Electric is focusing on offering more digital services, generating more recurring revenues, and increasing customer retention.\n\nAlso, in 2021, the Group has acquired ETAP, which is a fundamental brick of the digitization of electrical distribution network. This acquisition will accelerate Schneider Electric's journey to build a network digital twin software portfolio and reach a leadership position in digital and sustainable solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group is working closely with its suppliers and research and development teams to qualify alternate components to support increased demand and improve continuity of supply.

Accelerating skill development (upskilling and reskilling) of employees and the development of leaders who can build human connections in a digital world is also necessary to reduce the risk of skill gaps and bring greater organizational agility.\n\n## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Group has a number of initiatives and programs in place to mitigate these risks, anchored in the Group's People Strategy, at the heart of which is the Employee Value Proposition, the Core Values and Leadership Expectations 2.0. Schneider's approach focuses on the end-to-end talent pipeline from hiring to rewarding to developing for all employees as well as critical talent segments from a workforce size, quality, diversity, and velocity perspective. This systematic approach allows for data-driven monitoring of key gaps and risks. Supporting initiatives and programs include:\n\n- \u00b7 Annual performance and development goal setting and reviews, as well as talent reviews - culminating in year-end reviews of pipeline, succession, diversity, and skills by each entity with the Chairman & CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer. Overall health of the talent attraction and development strategy, leadership pipeline, as well as succession of key people and positions is reviewed monthly with the Executive Committee;\n- \u00b7 A five-year ambition to grow the early-career pipeline by 2x including internships, trainees, apprenticeships, and fresh graduates. For example, the Schneider Global Student Experience and the Schneider Go Green annual competition each year attracts thousands of university talents;\n\n## 3. Management practice risks\n\n## 3.1 IT systems management\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe Group operates either directly or through service providers, a wide range of highly complex information systems, including servers, networks, data repositories, applications, and databases with three targeted landing zones, on premise, co-location hubs, and in the cloud, that are essential for the efficiency of its sales and manufacturing processes, as well as platforms to enable digital offers such as EcoStruxure \u2122 . The Group is deploying various applications aimed at enhancing commercial experience, employee experience, and supply chain efficiency as well as enabling digital commercial offers.\n\nSignificant failure in fulfilment by a service provider or a major network outage, hardware and/or system failure could adversely affect the quality of service offered by Schneider Electric.\n\n- \u00b7 Investing in a new talent acquisition platform to manage prospective talents and the hiring processes, providing a seamless digital experience and enabling the Group to compete in the market for top talent. To date this has resulted in a 1,000% increase in talents joining the talent network;\n- \u00b7 An 50/40/30 ambition towards gender: 50% of women in hiring, 40% in frontline management, and 30% in leadership (VicePresident and above);\n- \u00b7 Policies for family leave, pay equity, and flexible 'new ways of working', supplemented with a strong program of activities to accelerate the diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda and focus on employee well-being, especially mental health;\n- \u00b7 A multi-hub operating model enabling customer proximity, innovation, speed, collaboration, and diversity of talent opportunities;\n- \u00b7 Career development focus for all employees, leveraging Open Talent Market for internal mobility and anchored in an annual performance and development review;\n- \u00b7 Programs for specific segments of talent including early talent, experts, high-potential talent, and talent in the later stages of their professional career;\n- \u00b7 Upskilling for today and tomorrow with a strong focus on digital skills, technical skills, commercial excellence, and functional expertise, led by Global learning academies of experts;\n- \u00b7 A collective focus for leaders to disrupt, accelerate, coach, and collaborate in order to transform culture and build great teams;\n- \u00b7 Continuous listening strategy to seek feedback from employees throughout their employment lifecycle.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, the provision of safe and secure foundational Information Systems is critical to the ongoing expansion of digital offers and customer interactions. As the Group moves towards more digital offers, services, and software, the variety of legacy systems makes it harder and more complex to evolve and scale.\n\nDespite the Group's policy of establishing governance structures and contingency plans, there can be no assurance that information systems projects will not be subject to technical problems and/ or execution delays. While it is difficult to accurately quantify the impact of any such problems, data loss, or delays, they could have an adverse effect on inventory levels, service quality, and, consequently, on the Group's financial results.\n\n3.",

This complex new environment is requiring strong resilience.\n\n## 2022 Specific events - Russia - Ukraine\n\nAs a consequence of the hostilities, which commenced at the end of February, 2022 between Russia and Ukraine, and the unstable geopolitical situation, the Group has seen several direct and indirect impacts on its employees, stakeholders and business. Continuous risk identification, assessment and mitigation is being performed. It focuses, first, on the humanitarian aspects including the support provided by the Group to the Group employees and their families. Further, it encompasses, in no particular order: the financial and operational impacts resulting from sanctions and counter-sanctions, the cybersecurity increased threats on both the Group assets and its customers' safety and products, and the potential unavailability or loss of critical suppliers. In 2021, Ukraine represented a revenue of 70M\u20ac and Russia a revenue of about 640M\u20ac. It is a total of around 2% of the Group's global revenues, with no significant impact on the Group's balance sheet. As of February 2022, and to answer to this fast evolving environment, the Group activated its crisis cells and preparedness plans in order to be in a position to respond effectively to a wide range of scenarios.",

The Risk and Insurance department reviews the current pricing and coverage conditions of the external insurance market in implementing the most efficient insurance program.\n\nThese policies are arranged on a global basis for all Group subsidiaries over which Schneider Electric has operational control. These policies are in all countries where the Group operates and are compliant with local regulations. All insurance companies used by Schneider Electric must meet certain credit and security requirements.\n\nAll insurance policies have aggregate limits determined based upon loss scenarios and available capacities on the market. However, there is the risk that an extreme claim could exceed the amount of insurance purchased.\n\nThe insurance policies that are purchased cover varying exposures including, but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 General liability risks arising from events where the Group is liable for damages to a third party as a result of the activities of its people or its products;\n- \u00b7 Property damage and business interruption resulting from an insured risk such as fire, flood, or earthquake at a Group site or, to a lesser extent, a customer or supplier location;\n- \u00b7 Risks associated with the transportation of assets by land, sea, or air;\n- \u00b7 Damage to equipment being installed at customer locations or construction sites;\n- \u00b7 Risks arising from data breaches and attacks on IT systems;\n- \u00b7 Local compulsory policies for employee safety and automobiles;\n- \u00b7 Liabilities of Executive Directors and Officers;\n- \u00b7 Environmental risks;\n- \u00b7 Emergency assistance and repatriation for employees travelling.\n\n## Insurable risk mitigations\n\nThe Group identifies and measures the impact of the main insurable risks with a view to reducing or eliminating their impact.\n\n- \u00b7 In order to minimize the risks of damage and protect our production capacity, protection standards (including for the sites managed by third parties) are defined, and main industrial sites are audited by an independent loss prevention company with a process to action any recommendations from these audits.\n- \u00b7 Business continuity plans are implemented, reviewed, and tested, in particular for the Group's main sites and critical suppliers. These plans are developed to identify internal alternative manufacturing and storage solutions to reduce the disruption to the business.\n- \u00b7 Crisis management tools are implemented in conjunction with the Group's Global Security department. These are tested on a systematic basis. Regular exercises are performed to identify areas for improvement.\n- \u00b7 Hazard and vulnerability studies are carried out to protect our people and our equipment.\n\n- \u00b7 For transportation risks, the lessons learned from losses are communicated across the Group to improve the risk management of shipments and the Insurance department liaise closely with Logistic and Planning teams to minimize incident impact.\n- \u00b7 Employee safety and a safe work environment are priority topics at all site management meetings. Safety training for new employees combined with regular reviews ensure continuous learning and improvement in the recognition and elimination of hazards.\n\n## Self-insurance\n\nAs part of the overall insurance strategy the Group self-insures certain risks through two captive insurance and reinsurance companies located in Europe and North America.\n\nExamples of the policies reinsured by the Group, include property damage and business interruption, general liability, and transportation.\n\nThe total amount retained for these risks is capped at EUR 20 million (except for USA and Canada).\n\nThe cost of the self-insured risks is not considered material at the Group level.\n\nThe Group assumes a deductible at a site/entity level though this is not regarded as self-insurance.\n\n## Cost of insurance programs\n\nThe cost (including tax) of the Group's main global insurance programs, excluding premiums paid to captives, totaled around EUR 24 million in 2021.\n\n3.",

These strong results, achieved amidst ongoing sanitary and supply constraints, were testament to the success and robustness of the strategy implemented under the leadership of Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman & CEO. This then led the Board to propose a dividend of \u20ac2.90, the 12 th year of consecutive dividend progression.\n\n2021 was also the year where we were recognized by Corporate Knights as the world's most sustainable corporation. In the year, the Board, in its commitment to continually raising the bar on sustainability, launched our new and ambitious Schneider Sustainability Impact 2021-25 program. We are off to a strong start achieving a score of 3.92 against a year-one target of 3.75.\n\nDuring the year, the Board continued to improve and reinforce its composition, and invites you to support the appointment of Ms. Nive Bhagat as a new Independent Director at the Shareholders' Meeting. On February 16, 2022, Ms. Nive Bhagat was appointed by the Board as an Observer upon the recommendation from the Governance & Remunerations Committee who conducted the search process for new candidates. Ms. Nive Bhagat is currently Global Chief Executive Officer for Global Cloud Infrastructure Services of Capgemini and a member of their Group Executive Committee. She will bring to the Board her experience and an additive skillset derived from her wide-ranging finance and business background in the digital space. She will further strengthen the Schneider Board through her excellent knowledge of the Asian market. I invite you also to renew the terms of office of Independent Directors Linda Knoll and Anders Runevad, both of them bringing many complementary skills to the Board.\n\nThroughout 2021, I had the opportunity to discuss our compensation policy and practices, engaging with many of Schneider Electric's shareholders, as well as investor representative bodies. I will continue this dialogue into 2022.\n\nFor 2021, the Board decided again to use the discretion clause provided in the existing Compensation Policy on annual variable compensation. Targets set at the beginning of 2021, which did not appear to be applicable anymore, were upgraded due to the much higher market growth than initially anticipated. This decision has been made to make targets more challenging and ensure a better alignment with the shareholder's experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor 2022, the Board of Directors wishes to maintain the overall stability of the Compensation Policy, which has markedly driven the right behaviors. It appears balanced, provides market competitive pay, ensures a strong link between pay and performance, solidifies alignment with both employees and shareholders, and incentivizes long-term focus. However, after taking into account shareholders' feedback, the Board also proposes to implement the following changes to the 2022 Compensation Policy: (i) strengthening the LTIP vesting scale relating to the relative TSR criterion, with no vesting below median; (ii) committing to disclose ex-post the LTIP targets inherent to adjusted earnings per share, which will allow shareholders to better assess their stringency as well as the link between pay and performance; and (iii) expressing the LTIP cap related to the Corporate Officer as a percentage of his remuneration instead of a number of shares as previously provided. The Board hopes that these improvements will garner strong support among shareholders on the two resolutions that are submitted in relation to (i) the Say on Pay on the Chairman & CEO Compensation Policy, and (ii) the Long-Term Incentive Plan.\n\nIn addition, you will be asked to approve the merger of our Company with its listed subsidiary IGE+XAO. This approval is requested in order to proceed with the plan to integrate IGE+XAO into the Schneider Electric Group following on the simplified public tender offer that was launched on the shares of IGE+XAO in November 2021.\n\nFurther to this letter, I invite you to read the governance and compensation report as well as the notice of meeting. They provide more details on the governance structure of the Company as well as all draft resolutions you are asked to approve at the 2022 Shareholders' Meeting. After these two last Shareholders' Meetings held digitally, I count on your attendance at this Shareholders' Meeting this year which will be held physically unless new pandemicrelated restrictions arise by then. We look forward to a successful AGM and sincerely hope that many of you will take part in the Company's decisions by voting on the resolutions submitted to your approval and by expressing your views during the Q&A session.\n\nThank you for your support and your trust,\n\n## Fred Kindle\n\nVice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director\n\nThis corporate governance report has been approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 16, 2022.

        "page_content": "## 4.1.1.3  Skills and diversity\n\n## Diversity policy within the Board of Directors and within the management of the Company\n\nThe Board of Directors pays due attention to its composition and that of its committees. It relies on the works of the Governance & Remunerations Committee which reviews regularly and proposes as often as required, the relevant changes to the composition of the Board of Directors and its committees depending on the Group's strategy.\n\nIn that respect, in conformity with its internal regulations, the Board of Directors ensures through its proposals and its decisions that:\n\n- \u00b7 its composition reflects the international nature of the Group's activities and of its shareholders by having a significant number of members of non-French nationality;\n- \u00b7 it protects the independence of the Board through the competence, availability, and courage of its members;\n- \u00b7 it ensures open and unrestricted speech;\n- \u00b7 it pursues its objective of diversifying the Board of Directors in compliance with the legal principle of attaining balanced representation between men and women on the Board;\n- \u00b7 it appoints persons with the expertise required for developing and implementing the Group strategy while considering the objectives of diversity based on criteria such as age, professional skills, nationalities, and background;\n- \u00b7 employee shareholders and employees shall continue to be represented on the Board in compliance with the provisions set forth in Articles 11.3 and 11.4 of the Articles of Association; and\n- \u00b7 it preserves the continuity of the Board by changing some of its members at regular intervals, if necessary, by anticipating the expiry of members' terms of office.\n\nThe gender diversity ratio of the Board of Directors, should the appointment of Mrs. Nive Bhagat be confirmed in the 2022 Annual Shareholder's Meeting, will reach 45% (excluding the employee Directors and the representative employee shareholders Director).\n\n## Chapter 4 - Corporate Governance Report\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nSchneider Electric is deeply committed towards diversity in general and gender diversity in particular. Schneider Electric focuses on taking proactive measures to encourage a balanced representation of men and women at the leadership level: the portion of women at the Executive Committee had been increased from 38% in 2020 to 44% in 2021. For the leadership pool comprising of the top leaders (around 1,000 employees), the female representation is 26% (+2% vs . 2020).\n\nAt its meetings of December 15, 2021 and February 16, 2022, the Board of Directors reviewed senior management's ambitions regarding the balanced representation of men and women at the leadership level and noted that the objectives are set to:\n\n- \u00b7 at least 40% of women at the Executive Committee;\n- \u00b7 at least 30% of women among the Leadership (VP and above, around 1,000 employees).\n\nTo achieve these objectives and further improve gender diversity, the Group aims at attracting female talents by offering a training leadership program and dedicated mentoring, an equal treatment policy and a tailored family leave policy.\n\n## Skills within the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors undertook a review of the skills to include in its skills matrix in order to meet the Company's strategic needs and some peer comparisons. It reviews its composition and expertise to identify skills that could be strengthened in the future or would deserve a stronger disclosure/narrative.\n\nSchneider Electric's Board, assessed against these skills, appears strong and balanced, and globally well positioned. The Board comprises individuals from diverse and complementary professional and cultural backgrounds, true to the Group's history and values. This enables it to perform its duties collectively and constructively.\n\nThe experience and expertise brought to the Board by each director at the date of this Universal Registration Document can be summarized as follows.\n\n|                                                  | Jea n -

Loss of the status of independent Director occurs on the date of the 12 th anniversary.\n\n## Criterion 7: status of non-executive Corporate Officer\n\nA non-executive Corporate Officer cannot be considered independent if he or she receives variable compensation in cash or in the form of securities or any compensation linked to the performance of the Company or Group.\n\n## Criterion 8: status of the major shareholder\n\nDirectors representing major shareholders of the Company or its parent company may be considered independent, provided these shareholders do not take part in the control of the Company. Nevertheless, beyond a 10% threshold in capital or voting rights, the Board, upon a report from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, should systematically review the qualification as independent in light of the Company's shareholding structure and the existence of a potential conflict of interest.\n\nUpon recommendation from the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors, during its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2022, reviewed the independence of each Board member in regard of the criteria reminded above.\n\n- \u00b7 With regard specifically to independence in terms of business relations, the Board of Directors noted that, due to:\n- (i)  The absence of business relations between the Directors and Schneider Electric;\n- (ii) The nature of Schneider Electric activities and those of the companies in which members of the Board of Directors are employed or serve as Directors;\n- (iii) The amounts, either unitary or global, of operations performed or that may be performed between Schneider Electric and these companies that are agreed at arm's length and that are by no means likely to be referred to the Board of Directors;\n\nthe existing business relations between Schneider Electric and these companies in which the members of the Board of Directors are employed or serve as officers are not likely to prejudice their independence, indeed, when such operations exist, they are agreed at arm's length and their amounts, representing less than 0.1% of the consolidated turnover of each group, are without a doubt insignificant for each party, in particular with regard to respective size of the groups concerned.\n\nAmong 15 Directors, 9 are independent according to the definition prescribed by the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code: Mrs. C\u00e9cile Cabanis, Mr. Fred Kindle, Mrs. Linda Knoll, Mrs. Jill Lee, Mrs. Anna Ohlsson-Leijon, Mrs. Fleur Pellerin, Mr. Anders Runevad, Mr. Gregory Spierkel, and Mr. Lip-Bu Tan.\n\n- \u00b7 Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire, as Chief Executive Officer, Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma, as employee shareholders representative, Mrs. Rita Felix and Mr. Bruno Turchet as employee Directors, Mr. L\u00e9o Apotheker, and Mr. Willy Kissling, who have served on the Board for over 12 years, are not considered to be independent Directors under the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code.\n- \u00b7 The AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code recommends that, in non-controlled companies, the Board comprises at least 50% independent Directors (Directors representing employee shareholders and employees are not computed in calculating this percentage). The proportion of independent Directors of the Company, excluding Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma, Mrs. Rita Felix and Mr. Bruno Turchet, is therefore 75%. The proportion would rise to 82% should the renewal of Mrs. Linda Knoll and M. Anders Runevad, and the appointment of Mrs. Nive Bhagat be voted in the Annual Shareholders' Meeting per respectively the 11 th , 12 th , and 13 th resolutions.\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n4.",

Calculation of the number of shares held is based on Schneider Electric SE shares and the equivalent in shares of the corporate mutual fund units invested in Schneider Electric shares held by the beneficiary. He has to retain at least 50% of the Performance Shares granted to him until this number of shares is reached.\n\nThe shareholding target described above is largely met by Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire who owns 793,239 Schneider Electric's shares.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 4 - Corporate Governance Report\n\n## 4.1  Governance Report\n\n## Directors selection process\n\nThe Independent Director selection process is led by the ViceChairman & Lead Independent Director and Chairman of the Governance & Remunerations Committee. When one or more directorships become vacant, or more broadly when the Board of Directors wishes to expand or modify its composition, the Governance & Remuneration Committee documents and ranks the selection criteria for potential candidates, taking into account of the desired balance and diversity in the Board's composition. The Committee takes into account the diversity policy and the objectives defined by the Board of Directors in term of skillset.\n\nBased on these criteria, the Committee steers the search for and selection of new directors, where appropriate with the assistance of an external consultant, and conducts the necessary verifications. The members of the Governance & Remunerations Committee then interview the candidates and issue a recommendation to the Board of Directors.\n\nIn preparation of the 2022 Shareholders' Meeting, the Governance & Remunerations Committee focused on furthering the international diversification of the Board of Directors and increasing the number of women directors, as well as adding digital expertise. A specific selection process exists for directors representing employees and directors representing employee shareholders, in accordance with prevailing regulations.\n\n## Succession planning of corporate officer\n\nSuccession plans at Schneider Electric correspond to a systematic, structured process for identifying and preparing employees with potential to fill key organizational positions, should the position become vacant. This process applies to all key positions including the Chairman & CEO position. Succession plans aim at ensuring a continued effective performance of the organization by providing for the availability of experienced and capable employees who are prepared to assume these roles as they become available. Succession plans are necessary processes to reduce risk of vacant positions or skill gap transitions, create a pipeline of future leaders, ensure full business continuity and improve employee motivation and engagement.\n\nThe mission of the Governance & Remunerations Committee includes preparing for the future of the Company's executive bodies, in particular through the establishment of a succession plan for the executive officers. The plan, which is reviewed at meetings of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, addresses various scenarios:\n\n- \u00b7 unplanned vacancy due to prohibition, resignation or death;\n- \u00b7 planned vacancy due to retirement or expiration of term of office.\n\nThrough its work and discussions, the Committee seeks to devise a succession plan that is adaptable to situations arising in the short, medium or long term. The Governance & Remunerations Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 provides the Board with progress reports, in particular at executive sessions;\n- \u00b7 works closely with the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer to (i) ensure the plan is consistent with the Company's own practices and market practices, (ii) ensure high-potential internal prospects receive appropriate support and training, and (iii) check there is adequate monitoring of key posts likely to fall vacant;\n- \u00b7 meets with key executives.\n\nThe succession plan is being reviewed and examined in light of the wish expressed last year by the Board to separate the roles of Chairman & Chief Executive Officer during Mr. Tricoire's current term.\n\n## Proposals to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on the composition of the Board of Directors\n\nMr. Willy Kissling, member of the Board of Directors for twenty-one years, and Mrs. Fleur Pellerin, member of the Board of Directors since 2018, have decided not to seek the renewal of their terms of office which expire at the closing of this Shareholders' Meeting. The Board of Directors expressed its gratitude to Mr. Willy Kissling's and Mrs. Fleur Pellerin's dedication to the Board of Directors' work and to their long-term commitment.\n\nAs part of the Board's continuous review of its composition, the Board of Directors asked the Governance & Remuneration Committee to make some recommendation on the renewal of Mrs. Linda Knoll and Mr. Anders Runevad, and search for complementary candidates in line with the skillset highlighted by its Board skills matrix and the challenges of the Company.\n\nIn that respect, the Committee has analyzed Mrs. Linda Knoll's and Mr. Anders Runevad's situation with regards to their time commitment and availability to fulfill their duties. Neither of them holds an excessive number of directorships, and their individual attendance rates at Board and Committee meetings are high as indicated in their biography (see section 4.1.1.2 of this Chapter 4 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document). The Board also assessed their respective contributions to the work of the Board and of the Committees to which they belong, and decided that keeping them as directors was in the interests of the Company and consistent with the targeted composition of the Board as identified in the process described above. As a Director, Mrs. Linda Knoll brings the Board of Directors experience in senior Human Resources executive roles with international groups. Mr. Anders Runevad brings to the Board the benefit of his experience as the former CEO of Vestas Wind Systems A/S and a strong profile on sustainability matters.\n\nThe Governance & Remunerations Committee also identified the skills that would be necessary to diversify and strengthen the Board composition and hired an external recruitment firm (Heidrick & Struggles) to search for suitable candidates. Among these candidates, the Governance & Remuneration Committee preselected a short list and the members of the Committee interviewed the short-listed candidates. Following these interviews, the Committee recommended a candidate to the Board of Directors, Mrs. Nivedita Krishnamurthy Bhagat, also known as Nive Bhagat, who, on February 16, 2022, was appointed as an Observer with the aim to propose her appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting. Mrs. Nive Bhagat, a British citizen, is currently Global Chief Executive Officer for Global Cloud Infrastructure Services of Capgemini and a member of its group executive committee. The board has analysed her situation with regards to her global timecommitment and concluded she has sufficient time to dedicate and fulfill her role at the Board. She will bring to the Board the experience and additional skillset based on her wide-ranging finance and business background especially in the field of digital and will further add to the gender diversity of the Board of Directors. She will also strengthen the profiles of the Schneider Electric Board by her excellent knowledge of the Asian market. She will qualify as an independent Director with regard to all the criteria set by Article 9.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code and, if appointed, will join the Digital Committee.",

The functions of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are carried out by Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire, who was appointed Chairman & Chief Executive Officer on April 25, 2013 and renewed on April 25, 2017 and lastly on April 28, 2021.\n\nThe performance by Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire of the duties of Chairman & Chief Executive Officer seems particularly appropriate to the Board of Directors for all the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 The results of the external Board assessment conducted in October 2020 and the internal one performed in 2021 that both confirmed that (i) all Board members individually support the current leadership structure and (ii) the level of transparency between management team and the Board of Directors is considered as excellent;\n- \u00b7 Jean-Pascal Tricoire's profile, his excellent track record within the Company, his leadership, and his openness to the Board members' recommendations;\n- \u00b7 The governance mechanisms in place to safeguard the balance of power between the Board and the management (appointment of a Lead Independent Director with specific powers, high rate of independent Directors within the Board (75%), independence of the committees mainly chaired by independent Directors, executive session proposed systematically at the end of each Board meeting);\n- \u00b7 The requirement for the Board to deliberate each year on the unification of the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in pursuance of its internal regulations.\n\nAll these considerations conducted the Board to renew Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire's office as Chairman & CEO further to his reappointment as a Director by the Annual General Meeting held on April 28, 2021 where 94.92% of the shareholders supported his re-election.\n\nThe Chairman & Chief Executive Officer represents the Company in its dealings with third parties. He is vested with the broadest authority to act in any and all circumstances in the name and on behalf of the Company. He exercises this authority within the limits of the corporate purpose, except for those matters that are reserved by law expressly to the Annual Shareholders' Meetings or the Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition, the internal regulations of the Board of Directors provide that the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer must submit for approval to the Board any acquisition transactions or disposal of assets amounting to more than \u20ac250 million as well as any strategic partnership agreement.\n\n4.",

The Board of Directors may appoint a Vice-Chairman. The Vice-Chairman shall be appointed for a period that may not be any longer than his term of office as a Director. The Vice-Chairman is eligible for re-election. The Vice-Chairman may be removed from office by the Board of Directors at any time.\n- 2. The Vice-Chairman shall preside over Board meetings in the absence of the Chairman.\n- The Vice-Chairman shall be called upon to replace the Chairman of the Board of Directors in the event of any temporary inability of the latter to fulfill his functions or his death. In the event of the Chairman's inability to fulfill his functions, he will be replaced by the Vice-Chairman as long as his inability may last and, in the case of his death, until the election of a new Chairman.\n- 3. In exception to 1 above, and in compliance with Article 12.2 of the Articles of Association, the appointment of a Vice-Chairman is compulsory if the roles of Chairman and CEO are combined. In this case, the Vice-Chairman also takes on the role of Lead Independent Director. In this respect:\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman is kept informed of major events in Group life through regular contacts and monthly meetings with the Chairman serving as CEO;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman is consulted by the Chairman serving as CEO on the agenda and the sequence of events for every Board meeting as well as on the schedule for Board meetings;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman may convene executive sessions with non-executive members of the Board of Directors, over which he will preside. An executive session shall be included on the agenda of every Board meeting. It is the Vice-Chairman's responsibility to decide whether it should be held or not. It is therefore held as decided by the Vice-Chairman, either directly before or after each Board meeting. In addition, the Vice-Chairman may convene an executive session between 2 Board meetings. Any Director may ask the Vice-Chairman to convene an executive session;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman shall promptly report to the Chairman serving as CEO on the conclusions of executive sessions;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman shall draw the attention of the Chairman and of the Board of Directors to any possible conflicts of interest that he may have identified;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman is Chairman of the Governance Committee;\n- \u00b7 like any other member of the Board, the Vice-Chairman may attend any meetings of committees of which he is not a member;\n- \u00b7 in order to complement his knowledge, the Vice-Chairman may meet the Group's leading managers and visit company sites;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman carries out annual and biennial assessments of the Board of Directors and, in this context, assesses the actual contribution of every member of the Board to the Board's works;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman shall report on his actions at Annual General Shareholders' Meetings;\n- \u00b7 the Vice-Chairman shall meet any shareholder who wishes so and inform the Board of their concerns on governance matters.\n- 4.

Statutory auditors attend the portion of the Board's meetings at which the full year and half year financial statements are reviewed.\n\nIn addition, each year a Board meeting called 'strategy week' is held in the form of a seminar and invites key executives of the Group to contribute to Board discussions. These seminars also enable directors to constantly refine their understanding of the challenges facing the Group through themed-based presentations and site visits.\n\nFurthermore, the Board organizes a range of specific training sessions throughout the year to help directors increase their knowledge of the Group (through presentations of its ecosystem, challenges, businesses and certain of its regions) and its competitive environment, as well as recent market disruption trends and technological developments. In 2021, four training sessions were organized on subjects like Climate change, Talents or Supply Chain.\n\nBetween each meeting of the Board of Directors, aside from meetings that they may have with the Chairman & CEO, Directors receive information through relevant financial analysts' reports, and other documents. Board members also have the opportunity to meet informally with key members of senior management.\n\nBoard of Director dinners are organized in order to offer more opportunities to interact with investors, customers, experts, etc . These dinners are meant to provide the Board members with external views on the Group, to increase their understanding of the changes in its business environment, and to gain more insight on the needs and motivations of all stakeholders. In 2021, due to COVID-19 sanitary crisis and the lockdown in France, only two dinners were organized.\n\n4.",

As such, new Directors are offered a training and information program on the Group's strategy and businesses designed around a common core which comprises of:\n\n- \u00b7 a set of documents including, in particular, the last registration document and integrated report, the Company's Articles of Association, the internal regulations of the Board of Directors, the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, the compliance Code governing stock- market transactions (see below), the minutes of the Board's and committees' meetings for the period starting from the appointment back to the full year before, Directors' and officers' liability master policy and the last three periodic information letters;\n- \u00b7 a summary relating to the Group organization;\n- \u00b7 working meetings with the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice-Presidents of Strategy, Energy Management, Industrial Automation, and other EVPs as the case may be;\n- \u00b7 a work session with the secretary of the committee(s) he/she will join;\n- \u00b7 concerning governance and values: work session with the ViceChairman & Lead Independent Director; the Chief Governance Officer, the Secretary of the Board of Directors, as well as with the persons in charge of compliance and ethics and sustainable development;\n- \u00b7 to know more about Schneider Electric's shareholding structure and shareholders' expectations, an interview with the senior Vice-President Investors Relations;\n- \u00b7 training on the use of the secure dedicated platform on which all the Board's files are filed and kept;\n- \u00b7 the designation of a mentor for any new Director to facilitate his/ her integration;\n- \u00b7 as the case may be, visits to sites which are particularly illustrative of Schneider Electric's activities.\n\nIn addition, the Directors representing employees, Mrs. Rita Felix and Mr. Bruno Turchet, benefit from a training program compliant with legal requirements and approved by the Board of Directors. In pursuance of new French regulations coming from law n\u00b0 2019-486 of May 22, 2019 relating to companies' growth and transformation, known as PACTE law, the Director representing the employee shareholders, Mrs. Xiaoyun Ma, was offered a tailored training session to address her needs.\n\n## Compliance Code governing stock-market transactions\n\nSchneider Electric has adopted a compliance Code governing stock-market transactions for members of the Board of Directors and Group employees designed to prevent insider trading. Under these provisions, both Directors and relevant employees are barred from trading in the Company shares and shares in companies for which they have inside information that has not yet been made public. In addition, they may not trade in Schneider Electric SE shares during the 31 days preceding the day following publication of the annual and interim financial statements, nor during the 16 days preceding the day following publication of a quarterly update, nor may they engage in any type of speculative trading involving Schneider Electric SE shares (including margin trading, purchasing, and selling shares in a period of less than four months). In addition, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, Corporate Officers also undertake not to enter into hedges of shares resulting from exercise of options and of Performance Shares they are required to hold (see section 4.1.1.5 of Chapter 4 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document). These restrictions supplement the prohibition against hedging unvested stock options and Performance Shares during their vesting period.\n\nThe compliance Code governing stock-market transactions was revised when the European 'Market Abuse Regulation' n\u00ba 2014/596 of April 16, 2014 entered into force, and subsequently updated in December 2018. The regulation obliges companies to draw up insider lists, and market operators to put in place mechanisms aimed at preventing and detecting suspicious transactions, enabling them to report to the Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers those that seem to them to constitute insider dealing.\n\n## 4.1.2.6  Self-assessment of the Board of Directors\n\nPursuant to its internal regulations, Schneider Electric SE's Board of Directors annually reviews its composition, organization, and operations, as well as those of its committees. This yearly assessment is carried out through a written questionnaire sent to Board members or an interview with the Board member. The evaluation is conducted under the leadership of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director by the Secretary of the Board of Directors. In addition, as per the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code, the Board of Directors shall undertake at least once every three years, a formal self-assessment, which may be conducted with the assistance of an external consultant.\n\n## Internal self-assessment conducted in September and October 2021\n\nAn internal assessment was conducted by the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, who guaranteed the confidentiality of opinions expressed, based on (i) a questionnaire answered anonymously by Board members and (ii) another anonymous questionnaire answered by Executive Committee members to know better their expectations toward the Board of Directors.\n\nThe report was presented and discussed in detail at the Governance & Remunerations Committee on October 25, 2021 and a summary report was presented to the Board of Directors on October 26, 2021. The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director provided individual feedback on the assessments of the effective contribution of each Director.\n\n## Themes\n\n(i) Membership and dynamics of the Board; (ii) Mission, organization, and operation of the Board; (iii) Works of the committees; (iv) On-boarding program of the new members; (v) 2022 top Board priorities; and (vi) Effective contribution of each Director.",

He was appointed as Vice-Chairman on April 23, 2020 in replacement of Mr. L\u00e9o Apotheker.\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is appointed by the Board of Directors in pursuance of Article 12 of the Articles of Association, which provide for the appointment of a Vice-Chairman with the function of a Lead Independent Director if the roles of Chairman & CEO are combined. In compliance with Article 12 of the Articles of Association, the duties of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director are defined by the internal regulations of the Board of Directors. Those internal regulations and the charter for the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director can be found on section 4.1.2.4 of Chapter 4 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Information of the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director\n\nTo be able to carry out his duties, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director must have excellent knowledge of the Group and be particularly well informed about its business performance.\n\nAs such, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is apprised of current events and the performance of the Group through weekly exchanges with the Chairman & CEO. He meets regularly with members of the Group Executive Committee and pursues regular interactions with managers and other employees of the Group in various sites of Schneider Electric.\n\nHe is continuously kept informed of the evolution of the competitive environment, technological breakthroughs, and business opportunities. Additionally, he is the Chairperson of the Governance & Remunerations Committee and a member of the Investment Committee.\n\n## Participation in the preparation of the meetings of the Board\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director participated in the preparation for meetings of the Board of Directors. As a result, he has participated in all the 'pre-Board' meetings. As a matter of fact, each meeting of the Board of Directors is preceded by one or two pre- Board meetings, in which the Chairman & CEO, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Governance Officer, and the Secretary of the Board of Directors review the topics and issues addressed by the committees, and establish the agenda prepared by the Chairman & CEO and the content of the meeting file.\n\n## Executive sessions\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director chairs the executive sessions ( i.e ., the meetings where Board members meet without the presence of the Corporate Officer), convened at the end of each Board meeting. The employee Directors are invited to attend all executive sessions following meetings of the Board at which they are present.\n\nThe Board of Directors held five executive sessions in 2021 during which its members expressed their views and observations on, among others, the Group's strategic options and the succession planning of the Corporate Officer. The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director reported the conclusions thereof to the Chairman & CEO.\n\n## Interaction with shareholders\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is the designated contact for the shareholders on matters pertaining to corporate governance. He carried out two shareholder engagement campaigns in 2021: one before the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to present to those who so wished, the resolutions submitted to the shareholders' approval; the other one, in the fall semester, to freely exchange views on topical themes of corporate governance that do not materialize in resolutions submitted to the shareholders' approval and thus, are excluded from the usual dialog. On this occasion, the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director explained to the investors' representatives the growing importance of social and environmental topics at the Board of Directors and their reflection in the Corporate Officers' compensation. Overall, these two campaigns comprised 24 face-to-face or phone meetings with analysts from a wide range of corporate governance cultures and covered around 35% of the share capital. The conclusions of these discussions have been reported in detail to the Governance & Remunerations Committee and contributed to its on-going thought process on governance matters. A report thereon was subsequently made to the Board.\n\n## Other duties\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director conducted the annual deliberation of the Board on its composition, organization, and operations as well as those of its committees. In 2021, this self-assessment was carried out internally. The conclusions of this assessment, which highlighted the quest for continuous improvement, are presented in section 4.1.2.6 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director has also had frequent contacts with each of the Directors. He ensured that there was no conflict of interest within the Board of Directors, which he would have been responsible for bringing to the attention of the Chairman.",

The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director met with 24 investors, representing ~35% of the share capital during two shareholders engagement campaigns dedicated to Governance and Remuneration topics, one in March ahead of the AGM and one in the fall, and reported back to the Governance & Remunerations Committee and to the Board thereafter. This dialogue will be pursued in 2022 to ensure that the Board takes the feedback into account to determine the compensation policy of the Corporate Officers.\n\nThe compensation paid or granted to the Corporate Officer in 2020 was approved by more than 87% of our shareholders at the 2021 Annual General Meeting and the 2021 compensation policy\n\n## Key changes proposed in the Compensation policy\n\nwas supported by 81% of the shareholders at the 2021 Annual Shareholders' meeting. The Board listened carefully to some comments made by the shareholders during the subsequent engagement with the shareholders. No major concerns were raised. Institutional shareholders have different guidelines and sensitivities which the Board tries to incorporate as much as possible.\n\nFor 2022, the Board of Directors wishes to maintain the overall stability of the compensation policy which demonstratedly drives the right behaviours, appears balanced, provides market competitive pay, ensures a strong link between pay and performance, strong alignment with both employees and shareholders, and long-term focus, while at the same time taking into account the shareholders' feedbacks. The Board proposes the following changes for 2022:\n\n| Stringency of the TSR criterion   for the LTIP                                                       | The vesting for the criterion of TSR compared to a bespoke industry panel of 11 companies would   be made more stringent, with no vesting at ranks 7 and below in the bespoke peer group.

All criteria have measurable targets approved by the Board at the beginning of the performance period, ensuring targets are achievable but demanding.\n\n## Principle 3: Financial and Sustainability objectives are fairly balanced and distributed between short-term (annual incentive) and medium-term (long-term incentive) components.\n\n2021 Annual Incentive (80% financial/ 20% sustainability):\n\n- \u00b7 40% Group organic sales growth\n- \u00b7 30% Adjusted EBITA margin (organic) improvement\n- \u00b7 10% Group cash conversion rate\n\n2021 Long-term incentive (75% financial/ 25% susutainability):\n\n- \u00b7 40% Adjusted Earning per Share (EPS)\n- \u00b7 35% Relative Total Shareholder Return\n- \u00b7 25% Schneider Sustainability External & Relative Index (SSERI)\n- \u00b7 20% Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI)\n\n## Principle 4: Significant proportion of the total compensation delivered in shares.\n\nThe Corporate Officer's target package consists of approximately 60% long-term share-based compensation, meaning their compensation is subject to the same share price volatility that shareholders experience.\n\n## Principle 5: Performance conditions aligned to shareholders' expectations and Schneider Electric's strategic priorities.\n\nPerformance criteria were selected from financial indicators that are most representative of Group performance and that are closely linked to shareholder value creation. Performance levels required to reach targets were set at the beginning of the performance period in line with the objectives disclosed to the market at the same time as the results of the previous fiscal year and were supplemented by factors that enable the Group to offer a long-term and satisfactory development outlook for all stakeholders in the Company's success.\n\n4.",

Most of the Group's key competitors are headquartered outside France. To reflect this, the International Peer group consists of 24 French, European, and US companies that are comparable to Schneider Electric in size or industry sector, or that represent a potential source of recruitment or attrition. Compensation levels for Corporate Officer are reviewed annually and benchmarked by reference to the median of this peer group to ensure they remain reasonable and appropriately competitive. This benchmarking is primarily used to establish a frame of reference for what competitors are paying to comparable roles, rather than as the main factor for making compensation decisions.\n\nThe 2021 peer group comprises European and US-based companies:\n\n- \u00b7 Business competitors (in particular, those identified in the Long-term incentive plan as performance peers for TSR comparison purposes);\n- \u00b7 Talent competitors for operational and functional roles; and\n- \u00b7 'Acceptance' peers ( i.e. similar groups in terms of size, business, or structure).\n\nFor 2021, the Board decided to replace Thyssenkrupp by BASF which size and geographical markets are more similar to Schneider Electric.\n\n| Group 1:  European  (Capital Goods)                 | Group 2:  European  (Construction)       | Group 3:  European  (Technology  Hardware  & Software)   | Group 4:  European  (Industrial B2B)   | Group 5:  US  (Capital Goods)                | Group 6:  US  (Technology  Hardware  & Software) Autodesk   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ABB  Atlas Copco  Legrand  Siemens   CNH Industrial | ACS  Lafarge Holcim  Saint-Gobain  Vinci | Dassault  Syst\u00e8mes  Hexagon  SAP  TE Connectivity        | Airbus Group  Air Liquide  Bayer  BASF | Eaton  Emerson  Honeywell  Johnson  Controls | PTC                                                         |\n\n## Principle 7: To reference the CAC 40 third quartile and the Stoxx Europe 50 median.\n\nThe Board reviews Corporate Officer's compensation with reference to the upper quartile of the CAC 40 companies and the median of the Stoxx Europe 50 companies, in line with the Group's position within these panels.\n\nPositioning relative to the market benchmarks\n\n## Chairman and CEO compensation relative to the market benchmarks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal compensation includes base salary, annual incentive at target, and IFRS value of Performance Shares granted during the year.",

The targets set at the beginning of 2021 did not appear adequate anymore considering the market's growth which was much higher than expected. Therefore, the Board resolved to adjust and increase the targets linked to revenue growth and Adjusted EBITA margin improvement in order to align them with the new guidance announced to the market at that time:\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue growth of +8% to +11% organic;\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITA margin up +90bps to +130bps organic.\n\nThis decision has been made to ensure a better alignment with the shareholders experience.\n\nThe 2021 results having exceeded the targets disclosed to the market in April 2021, the total achievement rate of the annual variable compensation of the Corporate Officer was set by the Board at 153.1% of the targeted variable compensation, reflecting strong performance of Schneider Electric in 2021 as was also reflected in the excellent Total Shareholder Return of Schneider Electric.\n\nWhen the targets disclosed to the market were, once again, upgraded in July 2021, the Board resolved not to review the compensation targets as it was considered that this new guidance could not anymore be attributed to external factors, such as improved market conditions, but was instead linked to the company's intrinsic performance.\n\n## Detailed achievement of each criterion:\n\n- \u00b7 Organic Sales growth: The Group delivered an organic sales growth of +12.7%, which was above the guidance communicated to the market in April 2021 of +8% to +11%. Therefore, this good performance resulted in the maximum achievement rate of this criterion, i.e., 80% on the range between 0% to 80%.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITA margin improvement: In 2021, Adjusted EBITA margin rate improved by +140bps organically to reach 17.3%, thanks to a combination of strong top line performance, pricing actions and productivity. This performance is above the guidance objective of +90bps to +130bps communicated to the market in April 2021. As a result, the achievement rate on this criterion is set at 45% on a scale from 0% to 60%.\n- \u00b7 Cash conversion: free cash-flow was \u20ac2.8bn with operating cash flow impacted by working capital requirements, as trade receivables rebounded and inventory increased both as a consequence of the strong external demand environment, and the supply chain pressures (some components shortages leading to higher safety stocks). Therefore, cash conversion was only 87% in 2021 which represented an achievement rate of 1.3% on this criterion, on a scale from 0% to 20%.\n\n4.",

He undertook to redirect these complementary payments, net of taxes, to investment vehicles devoted to financing his additional pension. To determine this authorized complementary compensation, the Board of Directors sought the recommendation of an independent expert, namely the firm Willis Towers Watson, and ensured that the mechanism implemented therefore, was in line with shareholders' interests.\n\nAccordingly, Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is entitled to receive annually a complementary component, split into a fixed and variable portion as follows:\n\n|               | Variable portion    | Variable portion   | Variable portion   | Variable portion   | Variable portion   |\n|---------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Fixed portion | Target (% of Fixed) | Minimum            | At target          | Maximum            | Total at Target    |\n| \u20ac191,600      | 130%                | \u20ac0                 | \u20ac249,080           | \u20ac498,160           | \u20ac440,680           |\n\nThe variable part is dependent on performance criteria aligned with the variable annual compensation (see above).\n\n## Application of the 2021 compensation policy\n\nAt the meeting held on February 16, 2022, the annual complementary variable portion for pension for 2021 to be paid after the Annual Shareholders' Meeting if the latter approves it, was set by the Board of Directors at 199% of the annual complementary fixed portion, i.e. an achievement rate of 153.1%.\n\nFor 2021, Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire is entitled to receive:\n\n| Fixed amount   | Target achievement rate   | Variable amount (1)   | Total due for 2021   |\n|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| \u20ac191,600       | 130%                      | \u20ac 381,341             | \u20ac 572,941            |\n\nIn compliance with applicable law, the payment of the variable amount will be subject to shareholders' approval (see 8 th resolution submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 5, 2022).\n\nReminder: an amount of \u20ac229,652 was paid in 2021 to Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire for the variable portion of his pension due for the fiscal year 2020 after its approval by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on April 28, 2021 (see page 273 of the 2020 Universal Registration Document).\n\n4.",

Schneider Electric ranked 1 st on relative TSR, delivering 213% return to shareholders over the same three-year period, demonstrating a strong value creation for the shareholders. Schneider Electric delivered robust organic adjusted EBITA margin improvement year-on-year, largely beating initial targets, exceeding the cash conversion rate three-year target, and demonstrating consistent progress on the Group's sustainability targets which are at the heart of the Group's strategy. These strong results across the range of performance criteria led to a vesting outcome of 96.86% out of 100%.\n\n## LTIP 2019 Performance criteria achievement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Organic adjusted EBITA margin improvement (40%) - During the 3 years plan, the adjusted EBITA organic margin improved by more than +0.7pts on average, reflecting the successful execution of the strategy combining top line growth, positive net pricing, better mix, industrial productivity, and better efficiency to reduce SFCs. Overall, the achievement rate for this criterion was 31.5% (out of 40%).\n- \u00b7 Cash conversion (25%) - Our efforts on cash management delivered outstanding results consistently over the threeyear period with an average cash conversion rate c. 122.3%, outperforming the target of 100% average cash conversion.\n\nThe achievement rate for this criterion was set at 37.5%, including the over-performance of 12.5%, which contributed to the offsetting of the non-achievement of the adjusted EBITA margin criterion.\n\n- \u00b7 Relative TSR (15%) - The Group's performance was acknowledged by the market and reflected in the stock price increase, which, combined with a robust dividend distribution policy and consistent share buy-back program to balance the dilution coming from allocation of Performance Shares and employee shareholding schemes, generated strong returns to shareholders over the period. Schneider Electric's TSR was ranked 1 st versus the selected peers (ABB, Legrand, Siemens, Eaton, Emerson, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, and Yokogawa). The achievement rate for this criterion was set at 22.5%, including the over-performance of 7.5%, which contributed to the offsetting of the non-achievement of the adjusted EBITA margin criterion.\n- \u00b7 Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI) (20%) - The SSI provides, on a scoring scale of 10, an overall measure of the Group's progress on sustainability issues. Over the last three years, Schneider Electric demonstrated strong delivery and continuous improvement on its sustainability programs. The SSI reached a score of 3.92/10 end of 2021 exceeding its 3.75/10 target set by the Board for this criterion, which resulted in an achievement rate of 80.2% for 2021 with overall 16.86% shares vesting out of 20% allocated to this criterion.\n\nThe fact that the compensation mechanism has materialized this year does not create any disconnection between pay and performance considering that the payout rate actually reflects the good performance of the Company over the last 3 years and the strong 2021 results. In addition, this result is aligned with the shareholders' experience, the TSR being 213% over this period.\n\nHistorical vesting of the Corporate Officers' Performance Share plans:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLTIP 2018 98.18%\n\nLTIP 2017 99.54%\n\nLTIP 2016 91.46%\n\nLTIP 2015 71%\n\nLTIP 2014 78%\n\n## 25%\n\nCash conversion rate\n\n## Average achievement rate for 2019, 2020 & 2021\n\n## 2019\n\nActual result: 121%\n\n## 2020\n\nActual result: 159%\n\n## 2021\n\nActual result: 87%\n\n## 20%\n\nSchneider Sustainability Impact\n\n## Note in 2019, 2020 & 2021\n\n## 2019\n\nActual result: 7.77\n\n## 2020\n\nActual result: 9.32\n\n## 2021\n\nActual result: 3.92\n\n4.",

        "page_content": "## 4.2.2.4  Pay Equity ratio\n\n## Employees experience at Schneider Electric\n\nDelivery of the strategy, both short term and long term, depends upon Schneider Electric's success in attracting and engaging a highly talented workforce, and on equipping people with the skills for the future. The Group is committed to fair pay, which is at the forefront of the Group's and executives' agenda, ensuring that all Schneider Electric employees are appropriately and fairly rewarded for their contribution. The progress is monitored via the Schneider Sustainability Impact Indicators. More information can be found in the Sustainable Development (chapter 2) of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Pay Equity\n\n## Living wage\n\n## Recognition\n\n## Well-being\n\n## Engagement\n\nFair and equitable pay is a core component of the Group's compensation philosophy. Since 2015, the Company has adopted a Global Pay Equity Framework. With the help of this Framework, Schneider Electric has committed to reaching <1% pay gap for both females and males by 2025. Furthermore, the pay equity adjustment is fully integrated into the annual global salary review and its principles leveraged during the promotion and hiring processes.\n\nSchneider Electric believes earning a decent wage is a basic human right and a key element to decent work. The Group is committed to paying employees in the lower salary ranges at or above the living wage to meet their family's basic needs. By basic needs, the Group considers food, housing, sanitation, education, and healthcare, plus discretionary income for a given local standard of living.\n\nSchneider Electric is committed to creating a culture where employees receive regular feedback and coaching from their managers and colleagues, celebrating people who constantly demonstrate the Company's Core Values and go above and beyond - using global recognition portal 'Step Up' and encouraging the recognition of small and big achievements by simply saying 'Thank you'.\n\n## Pay Equity Ratio\n\nEquity pay ratio measures the ratio between the level of compensation of the Chairman and CEO and the average and median compensation of the employees, as required by Article L.22-10-9-3 6\u00b0 and 7\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## Calculation methodology\n\nThe compensation comparisons and pay ratios set out below were calculated based on the fixed and variable compensation paid and relevant benefits during the fiscal years indicated, and Performance Shares granted during the same periods valued at their fair value (IFRS) on the grant date. The calculation includes employees who were continously employed during the financial years concerned. For part-time employees, compensation was established on a full-time equivalent basis.\n\n## Scope\n\n## France perimeter:\n\nThe legal scope, the issuer, comprises of only one employee, therefore, an alternate 'relevant scope' was defined to reflect a larger representative employee population in France as prescribed\n\nHealth and wellbeing are embedded in the Schneider Electric strategic people priorities and contribute to its core sustainability mission. The Company has a commitment to comprehensive well-being at work program translated into dual standard of access to healthcare and well-being training programs.\n\nThe Group listens to employees through a number of different channels, both formally and informally. Two of the Board directors are employees of the Company, appointed through a formal designation process. the Group runs OneVoice internal survey designed to measure employee satisfaction and engagement; the Group also recognizes the importance of dialog and engages with the local work councils on compensation matters on a regular basis.\n\nby article 26.2 of AFEP-MEDEF Code. It is based on the French holding entity Schneider Electric Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (SESE) (the issuer) as well as all employees in France of the operational company Schneider Electric Industries (SAS). This group of employees is employed on comparable terms to the Corporate Officer and represents more than 4,000 employees in France on a full time equivalent basis.\n\n## Global perimeter:\n\nIn addition, from 2021 the Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee and of the Human Resources & CSR Committee, decided to voluntarily report the evolution of the pay ratio between the Chairman and CEO and the average and median compensation of the employees on a broader scope which includes approximately 117,000 Schneider Electric employees across the top 30 countries ('Global Scope'). This represents circa 84% of all Schneider Electric employees globally. There is no historical data for this ratio as the HR Information System was not ready before to report on this extended scope.\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n4.",

Set out below is the Corporate Officer and non-executive Directors' compensation policy for 2022. It will be submitted to the shareholders at the 2022 Annual Shareholders' Meeting (9 th and 10 th resolutions) and, subject to shareholders approval, will remain in force until the next policy is approved by the shareholders.\n\n## 4.2.3.1  Executive Compensation policy\n\nSchneider Electric follows a rigorous process for determining executive compensation, under the leadership of committed and independent Directors.\n\n## Role of the Governance & Remunerations Committee\n\nThe general principles and criteria forming part of the compensation policy for Corporate Officer, and their individual compensation packages are prepared and reviewed by the Governance & Remunerations Committee which makes recommendations to the Board of Directors for decision. The Board receives inputs and recommendations from the Human Resources & CSR Committee on the incentive structure and performance criteria (annual variable compensation and Long-term incentive plan) applied to the members of the Executive Committee (see section 4.2.4 of the Universal Registration Document), as well as the Group's other employees.\n\nTo help the Board in the decision process, the Governance & Remunerations Committee and the Human Resources & CSR Committee are authorized to call upon external experts for specific topics, benchmarking data and analyses. The Committees hold at least one joint meeting every year to discuss the compensation structure applicable to Corporate Officer and other employees of the Group.\n\nThese joint committee meetings are attended by one of the two employee Directors and the Director representing the employee shareholders who are members of the Human Resources & CSR Committee.\n\nAs part of its preparatory work for its proposals to the Board, the Committee:\n\n## Defines performance criteria\n\nDefines performance criteria based on Schneider Electric's executive compensation pillars and business strategy. Targets are determined at the beginning of the performance period in accordance with the goals of the Strategic Plan.\n\nBased on circumstances and priorities, the targets also encompass risks raised by the Audit & Risks Committee as well as the recommendations of the Human Resources & CSR Committee.\n\n## Benchmarks Corporate Officers' pay\n\nBenchmarks Corporate Officer's pay against the median of a peer group consisting of 24 French and international companies that are comparable to Schneider Electric in terms of market capitalization, revenue, and industry, or that represent a potential source of recruitment or attrition.\n\nThis benchmarking is used as an indicator, not as a target, and is done ex-post only for reference.\n\n## Engages with shareholders\n\nRelies on the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director to directly engage with shareholders to ensure their perspectives and feedbacks on Schneider Electric's compensation policy are heard and considered in decision-making.\n\nThe topic of Corporate Officer's compensation is usually discussed at four Board meetings every year. Corporate Officers do not take part in the debates of the Board concerning their own compensation.\n\nThis process ensures consistency and alignment between the compensation policy applied to the other executives and employees and the compensation policy applied to Corporate Officer. They share the same objectives and priorities and their rewards are aligned with the Group's performance and shareholder value creation.\n\n4.",

This discretion is available to the Board to ensure successful execution of the policy and to reflect the fact that there are no qualitative objectives in Corporate Officer's compensation:\n\n- \u00b7 Flexibility to take into account unexpected changes in the industry environment and in compensation practice generally, this allows to respond to changes in circumstances, for example in modifying the benchmarking peer groups.\n- \u00b7 Exercise discretion, upwards or downwards, to adjust the formulaic outcome for annual or long-term incentive awards resulting from the strict application of the approved policy, where a qualitative assessment of performance is required to ensure that the awarded compensation is fair in light of the Corporate Officer's actual contribution to the Company's overall performance, its positioning vs. competition, and the outcomes for shareholders and employees.\n\n## Changes in the 2022 Compensation policy\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the existing policy and reassessed the pillars and principles formulated in 2018, the compensation elements and criteria considering the feedback of shareholders received during the shareholder engagement process described above. Upon recommendations of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board wishes to overall maintain the stability of the compensation policy which appears balanced and provides market competitive pay, ensuring a strong link between pay and performance, strong alignment with both employees and shareholders, and long-term focus, while at the same time taking into account the shareholders' feedbacks.\n\nTherefore, based on the Committee's analyses and recommendations, the Board proposes to implement the following changes for the 2022 Compensation policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Stringency of the TSR criterion for the LTIP: The vesting scale of the criterion of TSR compared to a bespoke industry panel consisting of 11 companies would be made more stringent, with no vesting at ranks 7 and below in the bespoke peer group, no vesting below the median of the group would therefore be allowed;\n- \u00b7 Disclosure of the targets set for the improvement of the adjusted Earnings per share criterion: the Board would also commit to disclose ex-post the targets of improvement of the adjusted Earnings per share set by the Board which will allow shareholders assess their stringency and the link between pay and performance;\n- \u00b7 Cap of the LTIP granted to the Corporate Officer: The cap of long-term instruments that could be granted to the Corporate Officer was previously expressed in number of shares, capped at 60,000 shares. The Board proposes that the cap be now expressed as a percentage of his remuneration (fixed and variable short-term compensation at target). Notably, the long-term instruments granted to the Corporate Officer, valued in accordance with IFRS standards, should not represent a disproportionate percentage of his overall compensation, and should be no more than 200% of the combined fixed and short-term variable compensation at target.\n\n## Balance between compensation elements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1)  LTIP granted during 2021 fiscal year valued in accordance with IFRS standards\n- (2)  Between 0% and 260%",

For the annual variable compensation and the Performance Shares, the approach to performance measurement is intended to provide a balance of measures to assess performance focusing on execution of the Group's strategic priorities.\n\n## Considerations of wider workforce compensation and shareholders' views\n\nThe Board monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the compensation policy for Corporate Officer and senior management\n\n2021 Compensation Pillars and Principles\n\n## Pay for Performance\n\n- \u00b7 Principle 1: Prevalence of variable components: circa 80% for CEO (at target).\n- \u00b7 Principle 2: Performance is evaluated via economic and measurable criteria.\n- \u00b7 Principle 3: Financial and Sustainability objectives are fairly balanced and distributed between short-term (annual variable compensation) and medium-term (long-term incentive) components.\n\n## Alignment with shareholders' interest\n\n- \u00b7 Principle 4: Significant proportion of the total compensation delivered in shares.\n- \u00b7 Principle 5: Performance conditions support Schneider Electric's strategic priorities and are aligned with shareholders' expectations.\n\nRelative Total Shareholder Return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSchneider Sustainability Relative & External Index\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand has regard to its impact and consistency with compensation policies in the wider workforce. During the year, the Board is provided with information and context on pay in the wider workforce and various HR initiatives to enable its decision-making. This includes the approach to gender pay gap and living wage programs rolled out globally, the annual variable compensation results, and the total cost of LTIP awards.\n\nThe Board is committed to an open and transparent dialogue with Schneider Electric's shareholders through the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director. Where appropriate, Schneider Electric actively engages with shareholders and shareholder representative bodies, taking their views into account when making any decisions about the Corporate Officers' compensation. The Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director is also available to answer questions at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Competitiveness\n\n- \u00b7 Principle 6: To benchmark the Corporate Officer's compensation package 'at target' in the median range of the Company's updated peer group.\n- \u00b7 Principle 7: To reference the CAC 40 third quartile and the Stoxx Europe 50 median.\n\n## Chapter 4 - Corporate Governance Report\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n4.",

The Board ensures that the Chairman and CEO's salary is set reasonably compared to similar roles in the market.\n\nConsidering the positioning of the Corporate Officer's salary on the relevant markets, the Company performance, and also pay conditions for other employees, the Board decided that there were no special circumstances that would call for a salary increase in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Corporate Officer                      | FY 2022 (January 1, 2022)   | FY 2021   (January 1, 2021)   | % Change   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|\n| Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO | \u20ac1,000,000                  | \u20ac1,000,000                    | 0%         |\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nAnnual variable compensation provides variable cash compensation which rewards achievement of the short-term financial and sustainability targets of the Group.\n\nAt the start of the fiscal year, financial and sustainability performance criteria, weightings, and annual targets are reviewed in detail by the Committee and recommended to the Board for approval.

        "page_content": "## Chapter 4 - Corporate Governance Report\n\n## 4.2 Compensation Report\n\n## \u00b7 Adjusted EPS (40%)\n\nAdjusted EPS is a key long-term performance metric which promotes the execution of Schneider Electric's strategy to deliver profitable growth, thus reinforcing alignment with shareholders. Performance Shares could vest subject to the achievement of the following targets as set by the Board of Directors at the beginning of each year:\n\n- \u00b7 a minimum Adjusted EPS improvement threshold under which there will be no vesting;\n- \u00b7 an intermediary targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objective that the Company will have to achieve in order to vest 75% of the shares under this condition;\n- \u00b7 a targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objective that the Company will have to achieve in order to vest all shares under this condition;\n- \u00b7 the Performance Shares will vest progressively, on a linear basis, if the Adjusted EPS improvement is between these objectives.\n\nAs explained above, the Board commits to disclose ex-post, at the end of each Long-Term Incentive Plan, the minimum Adjusted EPS improvement thresholds and the targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objectives.\n\nAdjusted EPS performance is published in the external financial communications and its annual variance will be calculated using adjusted EBITA at constant FX from year N-1 to year N. Foreign exchange impacts below adjusted EBITA will be taken in full. Significant unforeseen scope impact could be restated from this calculation upon decision of the Board.\n\n## \u00b7 Relative TSR (35%)\n\nThis criterion strengthens the alignment between the shareholders' interests and compensation of the Corporate Officer.\n\n- \u00b7 For 17.5% of the shares, Schneider Electric TSR will be compared to a bespoke industry panel consisting of 11 companies (ABB, Legrand, Siemens, Eaton, Emerson, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric and Yokogawa) with a vesting scale as follows: 0% at rank 7 or below, 50% at median (rank 6), 100% at rank 4, 150% for ranks 3 to 1, and linear between these points, as explained above, the Board proposes to strengthen the vesting scale for a better alignment with performance.\n- \u00b7 For the remaining 17.5%, Schneider Electric TSR will be compared with the TSR of the companies in CAC 40 index to reflect the macro-economic and stock-market specific trends which influence the performance of the share and in turn, the return to shareholders with a vesting scale as follows: 0% below median, 50% at median (rank 20), 100% at rank 10, 120% in ranks 1 to 4, and linear between these points.\n\nIn case of over-performance, if Schneider Electric's TSR ranks first to third of the bespoke industry panel or within top 9 of the CAC 40 companies, this criterion may compensate the under-performance under the Adjusted EPS criterion up to the same number of shares. If the Schneider Electric TSR is closely clustered with that of other companies in the panel, then the Board of Directors will apply its judgment to decide whether Schneider Electric's TSR shall be deemed to be ranked in the same position as those companies.\n\n## \u00b7 Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index (SSERI) (25%)\n\nThe Schneider Sustainability External and Relative Index measures the long-term sustainability performance of the Group in terms of relative performance, through a combination of external indices which cover a range of environmental, social, and governance indicators wider than and different from the Schneider Sustainability Impact (SSI). Using external indices would also ensure that the sustainability priorities governing the assessment of the long-term sustainability performance of the Group are at all times those which matter the most to the stakeholders. As their content is dynamic and includes new and more relevant topics as they emerge, it forces participants to constantly anticipate the most demanding trends in global sustainability. The Board has selected some of the most challenging external indices which are objective, recognized, and independent, covering main geographies in line with the Group's global footprint and which complement each other as they cover different sustainability dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 DJSI World which covers three dimensions: economic, environmental, and social;\n- \u00b7 Euronext Vigeo which covers environment, community involvement, business behavior, human rights, corporate governance, and human resources;\n- \u00b7 Ecovadis which covers four dimensions: environment, labor and human rights, sustainable procurement and ethics; and\n- \u00b7 CDP Climate Change which covers climate change, water, and forests and represents a major reference for climate change leadership globally.",

The cash payments are a combination of fixed and variable payments that are considered 'other benefits' to ensure consistency and comparability with other French or international companies. The maximum annual Complementary Pension Cash Benefit for 2022 remains unchanged and is detailed in the table below. Variable portion is subject to the same performance criteria and targets as the annual variable compensation. The Chairman & CEO has committed to depositing these additional payments, after taxes, into investment vehicles dedicated to the supplementary financing of their pensions.\n\n|                                        |               | Variable portion                   | Variable portion   | Variable portion   | Variable portion   | Variable portion   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Corporate Officer                      | Fixed portion | Target  (% of fixed  compensation) | Minimum            | At target          | Maximum            | Total at target    |\n| Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chairman and CEO | \u20ac191,600      | 130%                               | \u20ac0                 | \u20ac249,080           | \u20ac498,160           | \u20ac440,680           |\n\n4.",

In the event of an accident, the Group insurance covering the executive's accident risk, stipulating the payment of a benefit the sum of which may be up to four times the annual compensation based on the type and circumstances of the accident.\n\nEligibility for benefits (ii) through (v) above is conditional on the fulfilment of one of the following conditions:\n\n- \u00b7 the average of the net income of the last five fiscal years preceding the event is positive;\n- \u00b7 the average of the free cash flow of the last five fiscal years preceding the event is positive.\n\n## Director's fee\n\nThe Chairman and CEO has waived the attendance fees to which he is entitled in his capacity of Board member.\n\n## Extraordinary awards\n\nThe Compensation policy does not include any provisions for extraordinary payments. The Board decided to maintain the prohibition of one-off payments that are not provided for in the compensation policy approved by the shareholders.",

If the Board determines that it is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders to secure the services of a particular individual not promoted within the Group, it may require considering the terms of that individual's existing employment and/ or their personal circumstances.\n\nThe table below summarizes the policy on appointment of a new Corporate Officer.\n\n| Fixed compensation           | Salaries are set by the Board, taking into consideration a number of factors including the current  pay for other Corporate Officers, the experience, skill and current pay level of the individual, and  external market forces.

Fiscal year 2021 saw a return to growth in business activity, in a context of continued global supply chain pressures.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties\n\nThe Group demonstrated the agility and resilience of its global supply chain while coordinating and regionally managing supply chain organization to maintain quick decision making and flexibility in 2021.\n\n## Balance sheet positions\n\nThe Group working capital was assessed with the same accounting policies, principles and methodologies used for the full year 2020 consolidated financial statements. There was no material impairment booked in the income statement as at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Impairment of assets\n\nThe Group performed the annual impairment test of all the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) using the same methodology as the one used on previous periods, and described in Note 1.11. Following the performance of these tests, the Group concluded that there was no risk of impairment at December 31, 2021.\n\n5.",

        "page_content": "## 5.5  Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 1: Accounting policies\n\n## 1.1 - Accounting standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in compliance with the international accounting standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union as of December 31, 2021. The same accounting methods were used as for the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe following standards and interpretations that were applicable during the period did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 ;\n- \u00b7 amendments to IFRS 16 Leases COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions ;\n\nThe Group did not apply the following standards and interpretations for which mandatory application is subsequent to December 31, 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 standards adopted by the European Union:\n- - amendments to IFRS 16 Leases COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 ;\n- - amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: Reference to the Conceptual Framework ;\n- - amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use ;\n- - amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract ;\n- - Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020.\n- \u00b7 standards not yet adopted by the European Union:\n- - amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Deferral of Effective Date ;\n- - amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting policies ;\n- - amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates ;\n- - amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction ;\n\nThe Group is currently assessing the potential effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements of the standards not yet applicable as of December 31, 2021. At this stage of analysis, the Group does not expect any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group is also looking at the potential effect of the final agenda decision issued by the IFRIC in the first half of 2021 with regards to recognition of the cost of configuring and customising software provided in the cloud as part of a software as a service (SaaS) agreement.\n\nAt this stage of analysis, the Group does not expect any material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n\nOn September 26, 2019 and August 27, 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 related to the reform of interest rate benchmarks used in many financial instruments. Those amendments are divided into two phases:\n\n- \u00b7 phase 1, applicable starting January 1, 2020, allows uncertainties about the future of reference rates to be disregarded while assessing the effectiveness of hedging relationships and/or while evaluating the highly probable nature of the hedged risk;\n- \u00b7 phase 2, applicable starting January 1, 2021, specifies the accounting impacts of the effective replacement of interest rate benchmarks. The application of phase 2 has no impact for the Group in the absence of any effective change in the benchmark indexes in the Group's contracts as of December 31, 2021. The transition to the new benchmarks will not have a material impact on the Group financial statements.\n\n## IFRIC decision - Attribution of benefits to periods of service IAS 19 - Employee Benefits\n\nThe Group has taken into account the impact of the IFRIC agenda decision issued in April 2021 when measuring employee benefit obligations. This decision clarifies the periods over which employee benefits should be attributed in allocating the IAS 19 expense. The impact as of December 31, 2021 represents a non-material decrease in this commitment (Note 20).\n\n## COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions amendments to IFRS 16 - Leases\n\nOn May 28, 2020, the IASB issued COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions amendment to IFRS 16 Leases . The amendment provides relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn March 31, 2021, the IASB published a second amendment to IFRS 16, extending by one year the period of application of the COVID-19Related Rent Concessions amendment to IFRS 16 Leases published in May 2020. The amendment applied to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January, 1, 2021.\n\nAs a practical expedient authorized by the amendment, the Group elected, for the concessions that meet the amendment's criteria, not to assess whether a COVID-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification.\n\nThis amendment had no significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 5 - Consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2021\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n## Climate-related matters\n\nThe impacts of potential climate-related matters (including risks & opportunities, and legislation changes) which may affect the measurement of assets & liabilities in the financial statements, as well as the impacts from the group Carbon Pledge to reach carbon neutral operations in 2025, have been analysed. The Group will adjust the key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations and sensitivity, should a change be required. At present, the impact of climate-related matters is not material to the Group's financial statements.\n\n## 1.2 - Basis of presentation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative instruments and certain financial assets, which are measured at fair value. Financial liabilities are measured using the amortized cost model. The book value of hedged assets and liabilities, under fair-value hedge, corresponds to their fair value, for the part corresponding to the hedged risk.\n\n## 1.3 - Use of estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires Group and subsidiary management to make estimates and assumptions that are reflected in the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheet, the revenues and expenses in the statement of income and the commitments created during the reporting period. Actual results may differ.\n\nThese assumptions mainly concern:\n\n- \u00b7 the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (Note 1.8 and 1.9) and the measurement of impairment losses (Note 1.11);\n- \u00b7 the measurement of the recoverable amount of non-current financial assets (Note 1.12 and 13);\n- \u00b7 the realizable value of inventories and work in progress (Note 1.13);\n- \u00b7 the recoverable amount of trade and other operating receivables (Note 1.14);\n- \u00b7 the valuation of share-based payments (Note 1.20);\n- \u00b7 the calculation of provisions or risk contingencies (Note 1.21);\n- \u00b7 the measurement of pension and other post-employment benefit obligations (Note 1.19 and Note 20);\n- \u00b7 the recoverability of deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforward (Note 14).\n\n## 1.4 - Consolidation principles\n\nSubsidiaries, over which the Group exercises exclusive control, either directly or indirectly, are fully consolidated.\n\nGroup investments in entities controlled jointly with a limited number of partners, such as joint ventures and companies over which the Group has significant influence ('associates') are accounted for by the equity method. Significant influence is presumed to exist when more than 20% of voting rights are held by the Group.\n\nCompanies acquired or sold during the year are included in or removed from the consolidated financial statements as of the date when effective control is acquired or relinquished.\n\nIntra-group balances and transactions are eliminated.\n\nThe list of consolidated main subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates can be found in Note 29.\n\nThe reporting date for all companies included in the scope of consolidation is December 31, with the exception of certain immaterial associates accounted for by the equity method. For the latter however, financial statements up to September 30 of the financial year have been used (maximum difference of three months in line with the standards).\n\n## 1.5 - Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations . Acquisition costs are presented under 'Other operating income and expenses' in the statement of income.\n\nAll acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date, the fair value can be adjusted during a measurement period that can last for up to 12 months from the date of acquisition.\n\nThe excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share in the fair value of assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition is recognized in goodwill. When the cost of acquisition is lower than the fair value of the identified assets and liabilities acquired, the badwill is immediately recognized in the statement of income.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that it may be impaired (see Note 1.11 below). Any impairment losses are recognized under 'Amortization expenses and impairment losses of purchase accounting intangible assets'.\n\n5.",

The impacts are not significant for the Group in 2021.\n\n## 1.7 - Foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign currency transactions are recorded using the exchange rate in effect at the transaction date or at the hedging rate. At the balance sheet date, monetary items in foreign currency (eg. payables, receivables, etc.) are translated into the functional currency of the entity at the closing rate or at the hedging rate. Gains or losses on translation of foreign currency transactions are recorded under 'Net financial income/ (loss)'. Foreign currency hedging is described below, in Note 1.23.\n\nHowever, certain long-term receivables and loans to subsidiaries are considered to be part of a net investment in a foreign operation, as defined by IAS 21 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates . As such, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations is recorded in equity and recognized in the statement of income when the investment is sold or when the long-term receivable or loan is reimbursed.\n\n## 1.8 - Intangible assets\n\n## Intangible assets acquired separately or as part of a business combination\n\nIntangible assets acquired separately are initially recognized in the balance sheet at historical cost. They are subsequently measured using the cost model, in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets .\n\nIntangible assets (mainly trademarks, technologies and customer lists) acquired as part of business combinations are recognized in the balance sheet at fair value at the combination date, appraised externally for the most significant assets and internally for the rest, and that represents its historical cost in consolidation. The valuations are performed using generally accepted methods, based on future inflows.\n\nIntangible assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life or, alternatively, over the period of legal protection. Amortized intangible assets are tested for impairment when there is any indication that their recoverable amount may be less than their carrying amount.\n\nAmortization expenses and impairment losses on intangible assets acquired in a business combination are presented on a separate statement of income line item, 'Amortization expenses and impairment losses of purchase accounting intangible assets'.\n\n## Trademarks\n\nThe trademarks fair value is determined using the royalty method at the date of acquisition.\n\nTrademarks acquired as part of a business combination are not amortized when they are considered to have an indefinite life.\n\nThe criteria used to determine whether or not such trademarks have indefinite lives and, as the case may be, their lifespan, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 brand awareness;\n- \u00b7 outlook for the brand in light of the Group's strategy for integrating the trademark into its existing portfolio.\n\nNon-amortized trademarks are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication they may be impaired. When necessary, an impairment loss is recorded.\n\n## Internally-generated intangible assets\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs are expensed in the statement of income when incurred. Development costs for new projects are capitalized if, and only if:\n\n- \u00b7 the project is clearly identified and the related costs are separately identified and reliably monitored;\n- \u00b7 the project's technical feasibility has been demonstrated and the Group has the intention and financial resources to complete the project and to use or sell the resulting products;\n- \u00b7 the Group has allocated the necessary technical, financial and other resources to complete the development;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the future economic benefits attributable to the project will flow to the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 5 - Consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2021\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nDevelopment costs that do not meet these criteria are expensed in the financial year in which they are incurred.\n\nBefore the commercial launch, capitalized development projects are tested for impairment at least annually. From the date of the commercial launch, capitalized development projects are amortized over the lifespan of the underlying technology, which generally ranges from three to ten years. The amortization expenses of such capitalized projects are included in the cost of the related products and classified into 'Cost of sales' when the products are sold.\n\nAs for development-related assets which are in the amortization period, they are tested for impairment in case an impairment risk has been identified.\n\n## Software implementation\n\nExternal and internal costs relating to the implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications are capitalized when they relate to the programming, coding and testing phase. They are amortized over the applications' useful lives. In accordance with paragraph 98 of IAS 38, the SAP bridge application currently being rolled out within the Group is amortized using the production unit method to reflect the pattern in which the asset's future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. Said units of production correspond to the number of users of the rolled-out solution divided by the number of target users at the end of the roll-out.\n\n## 1.9 - Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is primarily comprised of land, buildings and production equipment and is carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, in accordance with the recommended treatment in IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment .\n\nEach component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a useful life that differs from that of the whole item is depreciated separately on a straight-line basis. The main useful lives are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 buildings: 20 to 40 years;\n- \u00b7 machinery and equipment: 3 to 10 years;\n- \u00b7 other: 3 to 12 years.\n\nThe useful life of property, plant and equipment used in operating activities, such as production lines, reflects the related products' estimated life cycles.\n\nUseful lives of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed periodically and may be adjusted prospectively if appropriate. The depreciable amount of an asset is determined after deducting its residual value, when the residual value is material.\n\nDepreciation is expensed in the period and included in the production cost of inventory or the cost of internally-generated intangible assets. It is recognized in the statement of income under 'Cost of sales', 'Research and development costs' or 'Selling, general and administrative expenses', as the case may be.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever there is an indication they may be impaired. Impairment losses are charged to the statement of income under 'Other operating income and expenses'.\n\nSince 2019, property, plant and equipment also includes right-of-use assets, in accordance with the recommended treatment in IFRS 16 Leases , and as described in the following note.\n\n## 1.10 - Leases\n\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 16 Leases on January 1, 2019, according to the modified retrospective approach.\n\n## Scope of the Group's contracts\n\nThe lease contracts identified within all the Group entities fall under the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 real estate: office buildings, factories, and warehouses;\n- \u00b7 vehicles: cars and trucks;\n- \u00b7 forklifts used mainly in factories or storage warehouses.\n\nThe Group has retained the exemption for low-value assets (i.e. assets with a cost lower than USD 5,000). Thus, the defined scope does not include small office or IT equipment, mobile phones or other small equipment, which all correspond to low-value equipment. Short term contracts (i.e. less than 12 months without purchase option) are also exempted under the standard. In this case, for example, for occasional vehicle or accommodation rentals.\n\n## Rental obligation:\n\nAt the inception date of the lease, the Group recognizes the lease liabilities, measured at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease. The present value of payments is calculated mainly using the marginal borrowing rate of the contracting entity's country, at the contract starting date.\n\n5.",

Therefore, only the rents are taken into account in the lease payments.\n\nLease payments also include, when applicable, the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and the payment of penalties for the termination of a lease, if the term of the lease takes into account the fact that the Group has exercised the termination option.\n\nVariable lease payments that are not dependent on an index or rate are recognized as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nAfter the start date of the contract, the amount of rental obligations is increased to reflect the increase in interest and reduced for lease payments made.\n\nIn addition, the carrying amount of the lease liabilities is revalued in the event of a reassessment or modification in the lease (e.g. change in the term of the lease, change in lease payments, application of annual indexation, etc.).\n\nThe obligation is recorded under other current and other non-current liabilities.\n\n## Right-of-use assets:\n\nThe Group accounts for the assets related to the right-of-use on the lease starting date (i.e. the date on which the underlying asset is available).\n\nAssets are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for the revaluation of lease liabilities.\n\nThe cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities, initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made on or before the effective date, minus lease inducements received. They are recognized as tangible assets, in the Balance Sheet.\n\nUnless the Group is reasonably certain that it will become the owner of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recorded right-ofuse assets are depreciated using the linear method over the shortest period of time between estimated life of the underlying asset and the duration of the lease. The assets related to the right-of-use are subject to depreciation.\n\n## Determining the duration of contracts:\n\nThe duration of the Group's contracts varies according to geographies.\n\nThe real estate contracts have variable durations depending on the countries and local regulations. Vehicles and forklifts are generally contracted between 3 and 6 years.\n\nIn certain geographies, the Group's real estate contracts offer unilateral options for termination of contracts (particularly in France with contracts 3-6-9).\n\nAccording to the recommendation of IFRIC, on a case by case analysis and based on Real Estate teams' expertise, experience strategy and projects, the Group is determining the most probable duration to perform our calculations. In most of cases, the duration chosen is the enforceable duration of the real estate contracts, in particular on the most strategic buildings and factories.\n\n## IFRS 16 debt by maturity:\n\n| (in millions of euros)   | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| 2021                     | -               | 250             |\n| 2022                     | 248             | 208             |\n| 2023                     | 235             | 165             |\n| 2024                     | 181             | 122             |\n| 2025                     | 132             | 86              |\n| 2026                     | 102             | 67              |\n| 2027                     | 72              | 55              |\n| 2028                     | 50              | 39              |\n| 2029 and beyond          | 112             | 86              |\n| TOTAL                    | 1,132           | 1,078           |",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## 1.11 - Impairment of assets\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets , the Group assesses the recoverable amount of its long-lived assets as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 for all property, plant and equipment subject to depreciation and intangible assets subject to amortization, the Group carries out a review at each balance sheet date to assess whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. Indications of impairment are identified based on external or internal information. If such an indication exists, the Group tests the asset for impairment by comparing its carrying amount to the higher of fair value minus costs to sell and value in use;\n- \u00b7 non-amortizable intangible assets and goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired.\n\nValue in use is determined by discounting future cash flows that will be generated by the tested assets. These future cash flows are based on Group management's economic assumptions and operating forecasts presented in business plans over a period generally not exceeding five years, and then extrapolated based on a perpetuity growth rate. The discount rate corresponds to the Group's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) at the measurement date. The WACC stood at 6.8% at December 31, 2021 (6.8% at December 31, 2020). This rate is based on (i) a long-term interest rate of 0.0%, corresponding to the average interest rate for 10-year OAT treasury bonds over the past year, (ii) the average premium applied to financing obtained by the Group in 2021, and is completed by, for CGUs WACC only, (iii) the weighted country risk premium for the Group's businesses in the countries in question.\n\nThe perpetuity growth rate is 2.0%, unchanged from the previous financial year.\n\nImpairment tests are performed at the level of the Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. A cash-generating unit is the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. The cash-generating units are Low Voltage , Medium Voltage , Industrial Automation and Secure Power . CGUs net assets were allocated to the CGUs at the lowest possible level on the basis of the CGU activities to which they belong; the assets belonging to several activities were allocated to each CGU ( Low Voltage , Medium Voltage and Industrial Automation mainly).\n\nThe WACC used to determine the value in use of each CGU was 7.5% for Low Voltage , 7.8% for Medium Voltage , 7.6% for Secure Power , and 7.6% for Industrial Automation .\n\nGoodwill is allocated when initially recognized. The CGU allocation is done on the same basis as used by Group management to monitor operations and assess synergies deriving from acquisitions.\n\nWhere the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is lower than its book value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the book value over the recoverable value. The recoverable value is defined as the highest value between the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Where the tested CGU comprises goodwill, any impairment losses are firstly deducted from goodwill.\n\n## 1.12 - Non-current financial assets\n\nInvestments in non-consolidated companies are initially recorded at their cost of acquisition and subsequently measured at fair value. The fair value of investments listed in an active market may be determined reliably and corresponds to the listed price at balance sheet date (Level 1 from the fair value hierarchy as per IFRS 7).\n\nIFRS 9 standard allows two accounting treatments for equity instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 change in fair value is recognized through 'Other Comprehensive Income' in the comprehensive income statement, and in equity under 'Other reserves' in the balance sheet, with no subsequent recycling in the income statement even upon sale.\n- \u00b7 change in fair value, as well as gain or loss in case of sale, are recognized in the income statement.\n\nThe election between those two methods is to be made from inception for each equity investment and is irrevocable.\n\nVenture capital (FCPR)/Mutual funds (SICAV) are recognized at fair value through income statement, in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nLoans, recorded under 'Non-current financial assets', are carried at amortized cost. In accordance with IFRS 9, a depreciation is booked from inception to reflect the expected credit risk losses within 12 months. In case of significant degradation of the credit quality, the initial level of depreciation is modified to cover the entire expected losses over the remaining maturity of the loan.\n\n## 1.13 - Inventories and work in progress\n\nInventories and work in progress are measured at the lower of their initial recognition cost (acquisition cost or production cost generally determined by the weighted average price method) or of their estimated net realizable value.\n\nNet realizable value corresponds to the estimated selling price net of remaining expenses to complete and/or sell the products. Inventory impairment losses are recognized in 'Cost of sales'.\n\nThe cost of work in progress, semi-finished and finished products, includes the cost of materials and direct labor, subcontracting costs, all production overheads based on normal manufacturing capacity and the portion of research and development costs that are directly related to the manufacturing process (corresponding to the amortization of capitalized projects in production and product and range of products maintenance costs).\n\n5.",

From inception, trade receivables are depreciated to the extent of the expected losses over their remaining maturity.\n\nThe credit risk of trade receivables is assessed on a collective basis country by country, as the geographical origin of receivables is considered representative of their risk profile. Countries are classified by risk profile using the assessment provided by an external agency. The provision for expected credit losses is evaluated using (i) the probabilities of default communicated by a credit agency, (ii) historical default rates, (iii) aging balance, (iv) as well as the Group's assessment of the credit risk considering actual guarantees and credit insurance.\n\nOnce it is known with certainty that a doubtful receivable will not be collected, the doubtful account and its related depreciation are written off through the income statement.\n\nAccounts receivable are discounted in cases where they are due in over one year and the discounting impact is significant.\n\n## 1.15 - Assets held for sale and liabilities of discontinued operations\n\nAssets held for sale are no longer amortized or depreciated and are recorded separately in the balance sheet under 'Assets held for sale' at the lower of its amortized cost and net realizable value.\n\n## 1.16 - Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred taxes, related to temporary differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of consolidated assets and liabilities, are recorded using the balance sheet liability method, based on tax rates and tax rules enacted before the balance sheet date. The effect of any change in the tax rate is recognised in the income statement, apart from changes relating to items initially recognised directly in equity.\n\nFuture tax benefits arising from the utilization of tax loss carry forwards (including amounts available for carry forward without time limit) are recognized only when they can reasonably be expected to be realized. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date and an impairment loss is recognised to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax asset can be fully or partially offset.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are recorded in the balance sheet under non-current assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the same unit and which are expected to reverse in the same period are offset.\n\n## 1.17 - Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents presented in the balance sheet consist of cash, bank accounts, term deposits of three months or less and marketable securities traded on organized markets. Marketable securities are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash at maturity. They notably consist of bank deposits, commercial paper, mutual funds and equivalents. Considering their nature and maturities, these instruments represent insignificant risk of changes in value and are treated as cash equivalents.\n\n## 1.18 - Treasury shares\n\nSchneider Electric SE shares held by the parent company or by fully consolidated companies are measured at acquisition cost and deducted from equity.\n\nGains/(losses) on the sale of own shares are canceled from consolidated reserves, net of tax.\n\n## 1.19 - Pensions and other employee benefit obligations\n\nDepending on local practices and laws, the Group's subsidiaries participate in pension, termination benefit and other long-term benefit plans. Benefits paid under these plans depend on factors such as seniority, compensation levels and payments into mandatory retirement programs.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nPayments made under defined contribution plans are recorded in the income statement, in the year of payment, and are in full settlement of the Group's liability. As the Group is not committed beyond these contributions, no provision related to these plans has been booked.\n\nIn most countries, the Group participates in mandatory general plans, which are accounted for as defined contribution plans.\n\n## Defined Benefit plans\n\nDefined Benefit plans are measured using the projected unit credit method.",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 5 - Consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2021\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nExpenses recognized in the statement of income are split between operating income (for service costs rendered during the period) and net financial income/(loss) (for financial costs and expected return on plan assets).\n\nThe amount recognized in the balance sheet corresponds to the present value of the obligation, and net of plan assets.\n\nWhen this is an asset, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefit due in the form of plan refunds or reductions in future plan contributions.\n\nChanges resulting from periodic adjustments to actuarial assumptions regarding general financial and business conditions or demographics (i.e., changes in the discount rate, annual salary increases, return on plan assets, years of service, etc.) as well as experience adjustments are immediately recognized in the balance sheet as a separate component of equity in 'Other reserves' and in comprehensive income as 'Other comprehensive income/loss'.\n\n## Other commitments\n\nProvisions are funded and expenses recognized to cover the cost of providing health-care benefits for certain Group retirees in Europe and the United States. The accounting policies applied to these plans are similar to those used to account for Defined Benefit pension plans.\n\nThe Group also funds provisions for all its subsidiaries to cover seniority-related benefits (primarily long service awards for its French subsidiaries). Actuarial gains and losses on these benefit obligations are fully recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 1.20 - Share-based payments\n\nThe Group grants performance shares to senior executives and certain employees.\n\nPursuant to the application of IFRS 2 Share-based payments , these plans are measured on the date of grant and an employee benefits expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, in general three or four years depending on the country in which it is granted.\n\nThe Group uses the Black & Scholes model to measure these plans.\n\nFor performance shares and stock options, this expense is offset in the equity. In the case of stock appreciation rights, a liability is recorded corresponding to the amount of the benefit granted, re-measured at each balance sheet date.\n\nAs part of its commitment to employee share ownership, Schneider Electric gave its employees the opportunity to purchase shares at a discounted price (Note 19).\n\n## 1.21 - Provisions and risk contingencies\n\nA provision is recognized when it is probable that the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the loss or liability is not likely and cannot be reliably estimated, but remains possible, the Group discloses it as a contingent liability. Provisions are calculated on a case-by-case or statistical basis, and discounted when the impact from discounting is significant.\n\nProvisions are primarily set aside to cover:\n\n- \u00b7 economic risks : these provisions relate to probable tax risks arising on positions taken by the Group or its subsidiaries. Each position is assessed individually and not offset, and reflects the best estimate of the risk at the end of the reporting period. Where applicable, it includes any late-payment interest and fines. In accordance with IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments , provisions covering uncertainties over income tax treatment are presented under 'Accrued taxes and payroll costs' as of 1 st of January 2019;\n- \u00b7 customer risks : provisions for customer risks mainly integrate the provisions for losses at completion for some of long-term contracts. Provisions for expected losses are fully recognized as soon as they are identified;\n- \u00b7 product risks : these provisions comprise\n- - statistical provisions for warranties: the Group funds provisions on a statistical basis for the residual cost of Schneider Electric product warranties not covered by insurance. The provisions are estimated with consideration of historical claim statistics and the warranty period;\n- - provisions to cover disputes concerning defective products and recalls of clearly identified products.\n- \u00b7 environmental risks : these provisions are primarily funded to cover clean-up costs. The estimation of the expected future outflows is based on reports from independent experts;\n- \u00b7 restructuring costs , when the Group has prepared a detailed plan for the restructuring and has either announced or started to implement the plan before the end of the year. The estimation of the liability includes only direct expenditure arising from the restructuring.\n\n## 1.22 - Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities primarily comprise bonds, commercial paper and short and long-term bank borrowings. These liabilities are initially recorded at fair value, from which any direct transaction costs are deducted. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost based on their effective interest rate.\n\n5.",

The Group's policy is to use derivative financial instruments exclusively to manage and hedge changes in exchange rates, interest rates or prices of certain raw materials. The Group uses instruments such as foreign exchange forwards, foreign exchange options, cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and commodities future, swaps or options, depending on the nature of the exposure to be hedged.\n\nAll derivatives are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of income, except when they are qualified in a hedging relationship.\n\nCash flows from financial instruments are recognized in the consolidated statement of cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions.\n\n## Foreign currency hedges\n\nThe Group periodically enters into foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the currency risk associated with foreign currency transactions.\n\nWhenever possible, monetary items (except specific financing items) denominated in foreign currency carried in the balance sheet of Group companies are hedged by rebalancing assets and liabilities per currency through foreign exchange spots realized with Corporate Treasury (natural hedge). The foreign exchange risk is thus aggregated at Group level and hedged with foreign exchange derivatives. When foreign exchange risk management cannot be centralized, the Group contracts foreign exchange forwards to hedge operating receivables and payables carried in the balance sheet of Group companies. In both cases, the Group does not apply hedge accounting because gains and losses generated on these foreign exchange derivatives naturally offset within 'Net financial income/(loss)' with gains or losses resulting from the translation at end-of-year rates of payables and receivables denominated in foreign currency.\n\nThe Group also hedges future cash flows, including recurring future transactions and planned acquisitions or disposals of investments. In accordance with IFRS 9, these are treated as cash flow hedges. These hedging instruments are recognized at fair value in the balance sheet. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is accumulated in equity, under 'Other reserves', and then recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects profit or loss.\n\nThe Group also hedges foreign exchange risk financing receivables or payables (including current accounts and loans with subsidiaries) using foreign exchange derivatives than can be documented either in Cash Flow Hedge or Fair Value Hedge depending on the nature of the derivative.\n\nThe Group may also designate foreign exchange derivatives or borrowings as hedging instruments of its investments in foreign operations (net investment hedge). Changes of value of those hedging instruments are accumulated in equity and recognized in the statement of income symmetrically to the hedged items.\n\nThe Group documents foreign exchange derivative based on the spot rate. The Group adopted the cost of hedging option offered by IFRS 9 to limit volatility in the statement of income related to forward points:\n\n- \u00b7 For foreign exchange derivatives hedging an item on the balance sheet: Forward points are amortized in statement of income on a straightline basis. Forward points related to foreign exchange derivatives hedging financing transactions are included in 'Finance costs, net';\n- \u00b7 For foreign exchange derivatives hedging future transactions not yet recorded on the balance sheet: Forward points are recorded in the statement of income when the hedged transaction impacts the statement of income.\n\n## Interest rate hedges\n\nInterest rate swaps allow the Group to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. The derivative instruments used are financially adjusted to the schedules, rates and currencies of the borrowings they cover. They involve the exchange of fixed and floating-rate interest payments. The differential to be paid (or received) is accrued as an adjustment to interest income or expense over the life of the agreement. The Group applies hedge accounting as described in IFRS 9 for interest rate swaps. Gains and losses on re-measurement of interest rate swaps at fair value on the balance sheet are recognized in equity (for Cash Flow Hedges) or in profit or loss (for Fair Value Hedges).\n\nBorrowings hedged by an interest rate derivative in a fair value hedge are reevaluated at fair value for the portion of risk being hedged, with offsetting entry in the statement of income.\n\nCross-currency swaps may be presented both as foreign exchange hedges and interest rate hedges depending on the characteristics of the derivative.\n\n## Commodity hedges\n\nThe Group also purchases commodity derivatives including forward purchase contracts, swaps and options to hedge price risks on all or part of its forecast future purchases. Under IFRS 9, these qualify as cash flow hedges. These instruments are recognized in the balance sheet at fair value at the period-end (mark to market). The effective portion of the hedge is recognized separately in equity (under 'Other reserves') and then recognized in income (gross margin) when the underlying hedge affects consolidated income. The effect of this hedging is then incorporated in the cost price of the products sold.\n\n## 1.24 - Revenue recognition\n\nThe Group's revenues primarily include transactional sales and revenues from services, and system contracts (projects).",

        "page_content": "## Chapter 5 - Consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2021\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSome contracts may include the supply to the customer of distinct goods and services (for instance contracts combining build followed by operation and maintenance). In such situations, the contract is analyzed and segmented into several components ('performance obligations'), each component being accounted for separately, with its own revenue recognition method and margin rate. The selling price is allocated to each performance obligation in proportion to the specific selling price of the underlying goods and services. This allocation should reflect the share of the price to which Schneider Electric expects to be entitled in exchange for the supply of these goods or services.\n\nRevenue associated with each performance obligation identified within a contract is recognized when the obligation is satisfied, i.e. when the control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer.\n\nThe following revenue recognition methods can be applied:\n\n## Recognition of revenue at a point of time\n\nRevenue from sales is recognized at a point of time, when the control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. This method is applicable for all transactional sales and for specific services such as spare parts deliveries, or on-demand services.\n\n## Recognition of revenue over time\n\nTo demonstrate that the transfer of goods is progressive and recognize revenue over time, the following cumulative criteria are required:\n\n- \u00b7 the goods sold have no alternative use, and\n- \u00b7 enforceable right to payment (corresponding to costs incurred, plus a reasonable profit margin) for the work performed to date exists, in the event of early termination for convenience by the customer.\n\nWhen these criteria are fulfilled, revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method, based on the percentage of costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs of the performance obligation. The cost incurred includes direct and indirect costs relating to the contracts.\n\nExpected losses on contracts are fully recognized as soon as they are identified.\n\nPenalties for late delivery or for the improper execution of a contract are recognized as a deduction from revenue.\n\nThis method is applicable for systems contracts (projects) as the constructed assets are highly customized, and thus the Group would incur significant economic losses to redirect the built solutions to other customers.\n\nRevenue from most services contracts is recognized over time, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services provided. When costs incurred are stable over the contract's period, revenue is linearized over the contract's length.\n\nProvisions for the discounts offered to distributors are accrued when the products are sold to the distributor and recognized as a deduction from revenue. Certain Group subsidiaries also offer cash discounts to distributors. These discounts and rebates are deducted from sales.\n\nConsolidated revenue is presented net of these discounts and rebates.\n\n## Backlog and balance sheet presentation\n\nBacklog (as disclosed in Note 3) corresponds to the amounts of the selling price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at closing date.\n\nThe cumulated amount of revenue accounted for, less progress payments and accounts receivable (presented on a dedicated line of the balance sheet) is determined on a contract-by-contract basis. If this amount is positive, the balance is recognized under 'contract assets' in the balance sheet. If it is negative, the balance is recognized under 'contract liabilities' (see Note16). Reserves for onerous contracts (so called reserves for loss at completion) are excluded from contract assets and liabilities and presented among the 'provisions for customer risks' item.\n\n## 1.25 - Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share are calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings Per Share .\n\nDiluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting profit attributable to equity holders of the parent and the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of the exercise of stock options outstanding at the balance sheet date. The dilutive effect of stock options is determined by applying the 'treasury stock' method, which consists of taking into account the number of shares that could be purchased, based on the average share price for the year, using the proceeds from the exercise of the rights attached to the options.\n\n## 1.26 - Statement of cash flows\n\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows has been prepared using the indirect method, which consists of reconciling net profit to net cash provided by operations. The opening and closing cash positions include cash and cash equivalents, comprised of marketable securities, net of bank overdrafts and facilities.\n\n5.",

OSIsoft is fully consolidated since the acquisition date, and reports within the Industrial Automation reporting segment.\n\nThe consideration paid was funded by EUR 3.9 billion (USD 4.4 billion) of cash, and by a EUR 0.5 billion (USD 0.6 billion) issue of 13,655,570 ordinary shares from AVEVA Group Plc to Estudillo Holdings Corp.\n\nThe purchase accounting as per IFRS 3R is not completed as of December 31, 2021. OSIsoft carrying value at acquisition date for net identifiable assets was EUR (1) million. The net adjustment of the opening balance sheet is EUR 1,460 million, resulting mainly from the booking of identifiable intangible assets (technology for EUR 998 million, customer relationship for EUR 288 million and trademark for EUR 150 million) and from a decrease in contract liabilities for EUR 71 million resulting from the remeasurement at fair value of the deferred revenue following the business combination under IFRS 3R. The preliminary goodwill recognized amounts to EUR 3,001 million at acquisition date.\n\n## ETAP\n\nOn June 28, 2021, the Group completed the transaction to purchase a controlling stake in Operation Technology Inc. ('ETAP'). As of June 30, 2021, the Group has acquired 80% of the capital of ETAP for a consideration of EUR 216 million, fully paid in cash. ETAP is consolidated within Energy Management reporting segment. The Group holds an agreement to acquire the remaining 20% minority interests in 2025. The related debt has been recognised in 'Other non-current liabilities'.\n\nThe purchase accounting as per IFRS 3R is not completed as of December 31, 2021. ETAP carrying value at acquisition date for net identifiable assets was EUR 13 million. The net adjustment of the opening balance sheet is EUR 26 million, resulting mainly from the booking of a preliminary amount of identifiable intangible assets (technology, customer relationship and trademark).

Employees in countries that meet legal and fiscal requirements have been proposed the classic plan.\n\nUnder the classic plan, employees may purchase Schneider Electric shares at a 15% discount to the price quoted for the shares on the stock market. Employees must then hold their shares for five years, except in certain cases provided for by law. The share-based payment expense recorded in accordance with IFRS 2 is measured by reference to the fair value of the discount on the locked-up shares. The lockup cost is determined on the basis of a two-step strategy that involves first selling the locked-up shares on the forward market and then purchasing the same number of shares on the spot market (i.e., shares that may be sold at any time) using a bullet loan.\n\nThis strategy is designed to reflect the cost the employee would incur during the lock-up period to avoid the risk of carrying the shares subscribed under the classic plan. The borrowing cost corresponds to the cost of borrowing for the employees concerned, as they are the sole potential buyers in this market. It is based on the average interest rate charged by banks for an ordinary, non-revolving personal loan with a maximum maturity of five years granted to a natural person with an average credit rating.",

This represented a 15% discount to the reference price of EUR 129.64 calculated as the average opening price quoted for the share during the 20 days preceding the Management Board's decision to launch the employee share issue.\n\nAltogether, 2.0 million shares were subscribed, increasing the Company's capital by EUR 216 million as of July 6, 2021. Due to significant changes in valuation assumptions, specifically the interest rate available to market participant, the value of the lock-up cost is higher than the discount cost since 2012. Therefore, the Group did not recognize any cost related to the transaction.\n\n## Year 2020\n\nOn April 20, 2020, the Management Board took the exceptional decision to cancel this year employee share issues as part of its strategy to deal with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## 19.5 - Schneider Electric SE shares\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Group held 12,456,882 Schneider Electric shares in treasury stock, which have been recorded as a deduction from retained earnings.\n\nThe Group has repurchased 1,809,054 shares for a total amount of EUR 262 million in 2021.\n\n## 19.6 - Income tax recorded in equity\n\nTotal income tax recorded in Equity amounts to EUR 130 million as of December 31, 2021 and can be analyzed as follows:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                   | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   | Change in tax   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Cash-Flow hedges                                         | 23              | 30              | (7)             |\n| Available-for-sale financial assets                      | (15)            | (6)             | (9)             |\n| Actuarial gains/(losses) on defined benefits obligations | 125             | 230             | (105)           |\n| Other                                                    | (3)             | (3)             | -               |\n| TOTAL                                                    | 130             | 251             | (121)           |\n\n## 19.7 - Non-controlling interests\n\nThe main contributor is AVEVA subgroup's, for which 41% of the shares correspond to non-controlling interests for the Group.

        "page_content": "## Chapter 5 - Consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2021\n\n## 5.5  Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 20: Pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations\n\nThe Group has set up various post-employment benefit plans for employees covering pensions, termination benefits, healthcare, life insurance and other benefits, as well as long-term benefit plans for active employees.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans\n\nThe Group's main Defined Benefit pension plans are located in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US). They respectively represent 62% (2020: 64%) and 22% (2020: 21%) of the Group's total Defined Benefit Obligations (DBO) on pensions. The majority of benefit obligations under these plans, which represent 93% of the Group's total commitment at December 31, 2021, are partially or fully funded through payments to external funds. These funds are never invested in Group assets.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nThe Group companies operate several Defined Benefit pension plans in the UK. The main one is related to the Invensys Pension Scheme. Pensions payable to employees depend on average final salary and length of service within the Group. These plans are registered schemes under UK tax law and managed by independent Boards of Trustees. They are closed to new entrants, and for most of them, the vested rights were frozen as they have been replaced by Defined Contributions plans.\n\nThese plans are funded by employer contributions, which are negotiated every three years based on plan valuations carried out by independent actuaries, so that the long-term financing services are ensured.\n\nIn relation to risk management and asset allocation, the Board of Trustees' aims of each plan are to ensure that it can meet its obligations to the plan's beneficiaries both in the short and long-term. The Board of Trustees is responsible for the plan's long-term investment strategy and defines and manages long-term investment strategies to reduce risks, including interest rate risks and longevity risks. A certain proportion of assets hedges the liability valuation change resulting from the interest rates evolution. Those assets are primarily invested in fixed income investments, particularly intermediate and longer-term instruments.\n\nFollowing the agreement reached with the Trustee of the Invensys Pension Scheme on February 2014, Schneider Electric SE guaranteed all obligations of the Invensys subsidiaries which participate in the scheme, up to a maximum amount of GBP 1.75 billion. As of December 31, 2021, plan assets exceed the value of obligations subject to this guarantee and thus this guarantee cannot be called.\n\nSchneider UK pension plans contain provisions of pension called Guaranteed Minimum Pension ('GMP'). GMPs were accrued for individuals who subscribed to the State Second Pension prior to April 6, 1997. Historically, there was an inequality in the benefits between male and female members concerning GMP.\n\nA High Court case concluded on October 26, 2018, confirmed that all UK pension plans must equalize 'GMPs' between men and women. In the light of these events and new information, the Group updated the related assumptions, leading to a net experience adjustment in 'Other Comprehensive Income' of EUR 56 million. Following a further High Court ruling in November 2020, an additional net experience adjustment of EUR 7 million was recognized in other comprehensive income in 2020.\n\n## United States\n\nThe United States' subsidiaries operate several Defined Benefit pension plans. These plans are closed to new entrants, frozen to future accruals and have been replaced by Defined Contributions plans. Pensions payable to employees depend on the average final salary and the length of service within the Group.\n\nEach year, the Group companies contribute a certain amount to the Defined Benefit pension plans. This amount is determined actuarially and is comprised of service costs, administrative expenses and payments toward any existing deficits. Since the plans are closed and frozen, there is generally no service cost component.\n\nThe companies delegate various responsibilities to Pension Committees. These committees define and manage long-term investment strategies to reduce risks, including interest rate risks and longevity risks. A certain proportion of assets hedges the liability valuation change, resulting from the interest rates evolution. Those assets are primarily invested in fixed income investments, particularly intermediate and longer-term instruments.",

The assumptions used vary according to the economic conditions prevailing in the country concerned, as follows:\n\n|                                | Group weighted average rate   | Group weighted average rate   | Of which United Kingdom   | Of which United Kingdom   | Of which United States   | Of which United States   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                | Dec. 31, 2021                 | Dec. 31, 2020                 | Dec. 31, 2021             | Dec. 31, 2020             | Dec. 31, 2021            | Dec. 31, 2020            |\n| Discount rate                  | 2.12%                         | 1.57%                         | 2.05%                     | 1.40%                     | 2.77%                    | 2.42%                    |\n| Rate of compensation increases | 2.60%                         | 2.52%                         | 3.64%                     | 3.46%                     | n.a.                     | n.a                      |\n\nThe discount rate is determined based on the interest rate for investment-grade (AA) corporate bonds or, if a liquid market does not exist, government bonds with a maturity that matches the duration of the benefit obligation. In the United States, the average discount rate is determined based on a yield curve for AA and AAA investment-grade corporate bonds.\n\nIn the Euro zone, the discount rate currently stands at 0.80%.\n\n## 20.1 -

If the Group is not able to hedge these risks, fluctuations in exchange rates between the functional currency and other currencies can have a significant impact on its results and distort year-on-year performance comparisons. As a result, the Group uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to exchange rates mainly through FX forwards and natural hedges. Furthermore, some long-term loans and borrowings granted to the affiliates are considered as net investment in foreign operations according to IAS 21.\n\nSchneider Electric's currency hedging policy is to protect its subsidiaries against risks on transactions denominated in a currency other than their functional currency. Hedging approaches are detailed in Note 1.23.\n\nThe breakdown of the nominal of foreign change derivatives related to operating and financing activities is as follows:\n\n|                        | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| (in millions of euros) | Sales           | Purchases       | Net             |\n| US Dollar              | 2,022           | (685)           | 2,926           |\n| Chinese Yuan           | 4               | (529)           | 656             |\n| Euro                   | 264             | (206)           | 859             |\n| Danish Crown           | 3               | (120)           | 156             |\n| Singapore Dollar       | 383             | (383)           | 599             |\n| Swedish Crown          | 16              | (206)           | 152             |\n| Japanese Yen           | 14              | (114)           | 53              |\n| Swiss Franc            | 4               | (136)           | 253             |\n| UAE Dirham             | 1               | (67)            | 77              |\n| Canadian Dollar        | 66              | (15)            | 107             |\n| Australian Dollar      | 17              | (65)            | 87              |\n| Saudi Riyal            | 11              | (17)            | 46              |\n| Russian Ruble          | 82              | (4)             | 68              |\n| Norwegian Krone        | -               | (14)            | 19              |\n| British Pound          | 15              | (455)           | 202             |\n| South African Rand     | 38              | (6)             | 48              |\n| Hong Kong Dollar       | 4               | (34)            | 54              |\n| Others                 | 216             | (256)           | 470             |\n| TOTAL                  | 3,160           | (3,312)         | (152)           |",

The Group has, however, implemented certain procedures to limit exposure to rising non-ferrous and precious raw material prices. The Purchasing departments of the operating units report their purchasing forecasts to the Corporate Finance and Treasury department.

These conditional offsetting agreements do not meet the eligibility criteria within the meaning of IAS 32 for offsetting derivative instruments recorded under assets and liabilities. However, they do fall within the scope of disclosures under IFRS 7 on offsetting.\n\n## 23.7 - Counterparty risk\n\nFinancial transactions are entered with carefully selected counterparties. Banking counterparties are chosen according to the customary criteria, including the credit rating issued by an independent rating agency.\n\nGroup policy consists of diversifying counterparty risks and periodic controls are performed to check compliance with the related rules. In addition, the Group takes out substantial credit insurance and uses other types of guarantees to limit the risk of losses on trade accounts receivable.\n\n5.",

These exposures arise from sales in currencies other than the Group's presentational currency of Euro.\n\nThe main exposure of the Group in terms of currency exchange risk is related to the US dollar, Chinese Yuan and currencies linked to the US dollar. In 2021, revenue in foreign currencies amounted to EUR 23.0 billion (EUR 20.1 billion in 2020), including around EUR 7.4 billion in US dollars and EUR 4.4 billion in Chinese yuan (respectively EUR 6.6 and EUR 3.7 billion in 2020).\n\nThe Group manages its exposure to currency risk to reduce the sensitivity of earnings to changes in exchange rates.

Transactions with these related parties are carried out on arm's length terms.\n\nRelated party transactions were not material in 2021.\n\n## 25.2 - Transactions with key management personnel\n\nNo transactions were carried out during the year with members of the supervisory board or management board. Compensation and benefits paid to the Group's top senior executives are described in Note 24.\n\n## Note 26: Commitments and contingent liabilities\n\n## 26.1 - Guarantees and similar undertakings\n\nThe following table discloses the maximum exposure on guarantees given and received:\n\n| (in millions of euros)               | Dec. 31, 2021   | Dec. 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Market counter guarantees*           | 3,702           | 3,367           |\n| Pledges, mortgages and sureties**    | 81              | 117             |\n| Other commitments given              | 314             | 253             |\n| GUARANTEES GIVEN                     | 4,097           | 3,737           |\n| Endorsements and guarantees received | 64              | 54              |\n| GUARANTEES RECEIVED                  | 64              | 54              |\n\n- * On certain contracts, customers require some commitments to guarantee that the contract will be fully executed by the subsidiaries of the Group. The risk linked to the commitment is assessed and a provision for contingencies is recorded when the risk is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Market counter guarantees also include the guaranteed obligations towards pension schemes.\n- ** Some loans are secured by property, plant and equipment and securities lodged as collateral.\n\n## 26.2 - Contingent liabilities\n\nAs part of its normal operations, the Group is exposed to a number of potential claims and litigations. Except for those for which it is probable that the Group will incur a liability and for which a provision is established for such outcome (see Note 21), the Group is not aware of other potentially material claims and litigations.\n\nInvestigations were conducted in September 2018 by the French judicial and antitrust authorities at Schneider Electric's head office and other premises concerning electrical distribution activities in France. Schneider Electric is cooperating with the French authorities. Such investigations could lead to formal proceedings against the Group for which the probability and the potential impact, which could be significant on the consolidated financial statements, cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Note 27: Subsequent events\n\n## 27.1 - IGE+XAO\n\nFollowing the completion of a simplified public tender offer, the Group now holds 83.93% of the issued capital of IGE+XAO. In accordance with the Group's intentions as presented in the Information Note and the previously stated strategy to consolidate the various independent software entities within the Energy Management Software Division, the Group intends to implement a merger of IGE+XAO with Schneider Electric during fiscal year 2022.\n\nThe Boards of Directors of Schneider Electric and IGE+XAO have met on February 16, 2022 and approved the economic, financial and legal terms of the merger, including the merger parity of 5 Schneider Electric shares for 3 IGE+XAO shares. The merger agreement as well as the merger appraisers' reports will be available on the websites of Schneider Electric and IGE+XAO.\n\nThe Group will seek confirmation from the AMF that the merger would not require Schneider Electric to file a buy-out offer for the shares of IGE+XAO. In addition, the merger will be subject to the approval of the annual general shareholder meetings of the shareholders of IGE+XAO and Schneider Electric to be held on May 4 and 5, 2022 respectively.\n\n5.",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with with independence requirement rules required by the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and the French Code of Ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1 st , 2021 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organisation and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of goodwill\n\nNotes 1.3, 1.8, 1.11, 5 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Risk identified\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the carrying amount of goodwill is M\u20ac 24,723, totaling 45% of the group consolidated assets.\n\nAs described in note 1.11 'Impairment of assets' to the consolidated financial statements, the Cash Generating Units (CGUs), to which the goodwill is allocated, are tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication of impairment risk.\n\nThe group's CGUs are Low Voltage, Medium Voltage, Industrial Automation, and Secure Power, and correspond to the smallest identifiable groups of assets generating cash inflows that are largely independent from the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.\n\nThe recoverable value of a CGU is defined as the highest value between its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. The value in use of a CGU is determined by discounting future cash flows that will be generated by its underlying assets and which are based on the Group management's economic assumptions and operating forecasts.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized when the recoverable value of a CGU is lower than its book value, for the excess amount of the book value over the recoverable value. When the tested CGU comprises goodwill, any impairment loss is primarily deducted there from.\n\n5.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report to the audit and risks committee\n\nWe submit a report to the audit and risks committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the audit and risks committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the audit and risks committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the audit and risks committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, March 11, 2022\n\nThe Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\n## MAZARS\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nLo\u00efc Wallaert\n\nMathieu Mougard\n\nAlexandre Resten\n\n5.",

On July 10, 2020, the Group announced the successful completion of the voluntary public takeover offer. As of December 31, 2020, the Group owned 87.64% of the capital of RIB Software, fully consolidated within Energy Management reporting segment. The Group held a put option agreement on 9.1% of minority interests, valued at EUR 137 million, with a maturity date in 2024.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, the Group purchased 9.1% of the non-controlling interests for a consideration of EUR 223 million. The previous put agreement and related debt have been cancelled.\n\nOn July 5, 2021, the Group submitted the formal request to RIB Software SE that the General Meeting of RIB Software SE shall resolve to transfer the shares of the remaining shareholders (minority shareholders) to Schneider Electric Investment AG for an appropriate cash compensation (so-called squeeze out under stock corporation law).\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the squeeze out has been completed and the Group owns 100% of RIB Software SE.\n\nThe purchase accounting resulting from the acquisition is completed at the closing date. As of December 31, 2021, the purchase accounting adjustments amount to EUR 211 million, and resulted mainly in the identification of intangible assets (technologies, trademark and customer relationship). The Goodwill recognized amounts to EUR 1,128 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## Larsen & Toubro\n\nOn May 1 st , 2018, Schneider Electric, partnering with Temasek, a global investment company headquartered in Singapore, reached an agreement to buy Larsen & Toubro's Electrical & Automation business.\n\nOn August 31, 2020, the Group completed the transaction to combine Schneider Electric India's Low Voltage and Industrial Automation Products business and Larsen and Toubro ('L&T') Electrical and Automation business, for a consideration paid of EUR 1,571 million.\n\nTemasek took 35% stake in the combined business for EUR 530 million. The partnership with Temasek resulted in the dilution of the Group's interests within Schneider Electric India's Low Voltage and Industrial Automation Products business, and in the recognition of a gain of EUR 191 million in the Group's share of equity in 2020.\n\nL&T is fully consolidated since September 1, 2020, and reports within both Energy Management and Industrial Automation reporting segments.\n\nThe purchase accounting as per IFRS 3R is completed as of December 31, 2021. At acquisition date, the net adjustment of the opening balance sheet is EUR 286 million. The main identifiable intangible assets recognized as of December 31, 2021 are technology for EUR/uni00A0111/uni00A0million, customer relationship for EUR 380 million and trademark for EUR 83 million. Contingent liabilities assumed mainly relates to environment, health and safety (EHS) risk for EUR 78 million as of December 31, 2021. The goodwill recognized amounts to EUR 1,117 million as of December 31,2021.\n\n## Exchange rate changes\n\nFluctuations in the euro exchange rate in 2021 led to an impact of EUR (273) million on consolidated revenue and of EUR (40) million on adjusted EBITA mainly due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar against Euro.\n\n5.",

22,179 million, equivalent to 77% of the Group's revenues and was up 13.3% organically, with double-digit growth across all regions. Sales growth was supported by price actions taken throughout the year, though impacted by supply chain pressures mainly in the second half of the year. Residential buildings remained one of the group's strongest markets. Demand for the Group's offers in non-residential buildings also remained strong, including recovery in hotels and commercial offices. Data centers & networks showed double-digit growth with continued strong demand. Energy Management benefited from cross-sells offers into Infrastructure and Industry end-markets. The Group benefited throughout the year from execution on a large project in Egypt. In industrial end-markets, growth was strongest in discrete automation, particularly in OEMs. Later cycle industrial markets remained challenged although with positive demand trends including in Metal, Mining and Minerals (MMM) and Oil and Gas (O&G).",

Sales growth was supported by price actions taken throughout the year, although impacted by supply chain pressures. Discrete automation markets saw strong demand with growth in many markets including packaging and material handling and across all regions. Sales into Process & Hybrid markets remained challenged, impacted by a slower recovery in mid-to-late cycle industries, although second semester saw a strong evolution in demand trends including in Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) and O&G.\n\n## Gross profit\n\nGross profit was up 12.5% organic with Gross margin reaching 41.0% in 2021 (down 10 bps organically) mainly driven by the pricing actions, positive mix and industrial productivity, notwithstanding additional costs incurred due to raw material inflation and continued pressures on global supply chains.\n\n## Support Function costs: Research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses, net of capitalized development costs and excluding research and development costs booked in costs of sales, increased by 19.1% from EUR 718 million for 2020 to EUR 855 million for 2021. As a percentage of revenues, the net cost of research and development increased slightly to 3.0% in 2021 (2.9% for 2020).\n\nTotal research and development expense, including capitalized development costs and development costs reported as cost of sales (see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) increased by 9.4% from EUR 1,407 million for 2020 to EUR 1,539 million for 2021. As a percentage of revenues, total research and development expenses decreased slightly to 5.3% for 2021 (5.6% for 2020).\n\nIn 2021, the net effect of capitalized development costs and amortization of capitalized development costs amounts to EUR 68 million on operating income (EUR 66 million in 2020).\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by 8.9% to EUR 6,001 million for 2021 (EUR 5,512 million for 2020). As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to 20.8% for 2021 (21.9% for 2020).\n\nCombined, total support function costs, that is, research and development expenses together with selling, general and administrative costs, totaled EUR 6,856 million for 2021 compared to EUR 6,230 million for 2020, an increase of 10.0%. Support functions costs to sales ratio decreases at 23.7%.\n\n## Other operating income and expenses\n\nFor 2021, other operating income and expenses amounted to a net expense of EUR 21 million. This is mainly due to gains on disposal of business for EUR 196 million being partially compensated by costs of acquisitions and integrations for EUR 166 million. The main scope changes of the year are described in the 2021 highlights.\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nFor 2021, restructuring costs amounted to EUR 225 million compared to EUR 421 million for 2020. In 2020, these costs were mainly attributed to initiatives to decrease support function costs.\n\n## EBITA and Adjusted EBITA\n\nEBITA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes and amortization of purchase accounting intangibles. EBITA comprises operating profit before amortization and impairment of purchase accounting intangible assets and before goodwill impairment. Adjusted EBITA is adjusted as EBITA before restructuring costs and before other operating income and expenses, which includes acquisition, integration and separation costs.\n\nAdjusted EBITA amounted to EUR 4,987 million for 2021, compared to EUR 3,926 million for 2020, an organic increase of 23.2%. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted EBITA increased at 17.3% with margin improving 140 bps organically.\n\nEBITA increased from EUR 3,295 million for 2020 to EUR 4,741 million in 2021. As a percentage of revenues, EBITA increases at 16.4% in 2021 (13.1% for 2020).\n\n## Adjusted EBITA by business segment\n\nThe following table sets out EBITA and adjusted EBITA by business segment:\n\n|                        | Full Year 2021    | Full Year 2021        | Full Year 2021                    | Full Year 2021   |\n|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|\n| (in millions of euros) | Energy Management | Industrial Automation | Central functions & digital costs | Total            |\n| Backlog                | 9,088             | 2,688                 | -                                 | 11,776           |\n| Revenue                | 22,179            | 6,726                 | -                                 | 28,905           |\n| Adjusted EBITA         | 4,501             | 1,242                 | (756)                             | 4,987            |\n| Adjusted EBITA (%)     | 20.3%             | 18.5%                 |                                   | 17.3%            |\n\nOn December 31, 2021, the total backlog to be executed in more than a year amounts to EUR 640 million.\n\n5.",

The increase is mostly driven by additional amortization linked with acquisitions completed in the second semester 2020 and the first semester 2021 (mainly RIB Software SE, Larsen & Toubro and OSIsoft LLC).\n\n## Operating income (EBIT)\n\nOperating income or EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes), increased from EUR 3,088 million for 2020 to 4,331 million for 2021, an increase of 40.3%.\n\n## Net financial income/loss\n\nNet financial loss amounted to EUR 176 million for 2021, compared to EUR 278 million for 2020. Financial result has been improved significantly, thanks to the decrease of the cost of net financial debt (from EUR 112 million in 2020 to EUR 95 million in 2021), as well as a reduced impact from forex exchange fluctuations (from EUR 36 million in 2020 to EUR 8 million in 2021).\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nThe effective tax rate was 23.2% for 2021, and 22.7% for 2020. The corresponding income tax expense increased from EUR 638 million for 2020 to EUR 966 million for 2021.\n\n## Share of profit/ (loss) of associates\n\nThe share of associates was a EUR 84 million profit for 2021, compared to EUR 66 million profit for 2020.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests in net income for 2021 totaled EUR 69 million, compared to EUR 112 million for 2020. This represents the share in net income attributable to the non-controlling interests, mainly coming from the Group Chinese subsidiaries and AVEVA subgroup.\n\n## Profit for the year (attributable to owners of the parent)\n\nProfit for the year attributable to the equity holders of our parent company amounted to EUR 3,204 million for 2021, compared to EUR 2,126 million profit for 2020.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nBasic Earnings per share amounted to EUR 5.76 per share for 2021 and EUR 3.84 per share for 2020.",

As a consequence, the provision for expenses on shares distribution has been adjusted to EUR 348 million.\n\n## 6.3.2 Accounting principles\n\nAs in the prior financial year, the financial statements for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 have been prepared in accordance with French generally accepted accounting principles and with the ANC no. 2014-03 code updated by ANC no. 2016-07 code on Nov. 04, 2016.\n\n## Non-current assets\n\nNon-current assets of all types are stated at historical cost.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible rights are amortized over a maximum of 5 years.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nAmortizable Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight- line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 10 years. Lands are not depreciated.\n\n## Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates\n\nShares in subsidiaries and affiliates are stated at acquisition cost.\n\nProvisions for impairment may be funded where the carrying amount is higher than the estimated value in use at the end of the financial year. This estimate is primarily determined on the basis of the underlying net assets, earnings outlook and economic forecasts. For listed securities, the average stock price over the month before the closing is used.\n\nProvisions may be reversed if the estimated value becomes higher than the carrying amount.\n\nUnrealized gains resulting from such estimates are not recognized.\n\n6.",

Provisions are funded for the supplementary pension benefits provided by the company on the basis of the contractual terms of top-hat agreements, granting a level of benefits exceeding the general regimes. The company applies the corridor method to actuarial gains and losses arising from changes in estimates. Under this method, the portion of net cumulative actuarial gains and losses exceeding 10% of the projected benefit obligation is amortized over 10 years.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nWhen necessary, a contingency provision is put in place for unrealized exchange losses. However, when there are unrealized exchange gains and losses on back-to-back transactions in the same currency and with the same maturity, the amount of the provision is then limited to the net loss.\n\n## Bonds\n\nIssue costs are amortized over the life of the bonds and are booked under 'deferred expenses'.Issuance premiums are booked under 'Call premiums' & amortized over the duration of the bonds.\n\nIn the case of convertible bond (OCEANE), at conversion, the bond will be reclassified as equity for its nominal conversion amount.\n\n## 6.3.3 Notes\n\n## Note 1: Non-current assets\n\n## 1.1 - Intangible assets\n\nThis item primarily consists of share issue and merger expenses, which are fully amortized.\n\n## 1.2 - Property, plant and equipment\n\n(in thousands of euros)\n\n| Property, plant and equipment   | Dec. 31, 2020   | Additions   | Disposals   | Dec. 31, 2021   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Cost                            | 4,301           | -           | (247)       | 4,054           |\n| Depreciation                    | (290)           | -           | 242         | (48)            |\n| NET                             | 4,011           | -           | (5)         | 4,006           |\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are mainly comprised of land not built.",

Except for those for which it is probable that the Group will incur a liability and for which a provision is established for such outcome, the Group is not aware of other potentially material claims and litigations.\n\nInvestigations were conducted in September 2018 by the French judicial and antitrust authorities at Schneider Electric's head office and other premises concerning electrical distribution activities in France. Schneider Electric is cooperating with the French authorities. Such investigations could lead to formal proceedings against the Group for which the probability and the potential impact, which could be significant on the financial statements of Schneider Electric SE, cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Note 20: Other information\n\n## 20.1 - Workforce\n\nThe average number of employees is 1 over 2021.\n\n## 20.2 - Consolidated financial statements\n\nSchneider Electric SE is the parent company of the Group and accordingly publishes the consolidated financial statements of the Schneider Electric Group.\n\n## 20.3 - Subsequent events\n\n## Trademark Schneider Electric\n\nAs the temporary transfer of usufruct for the Schneider Electric trademark made by Schneider Electric SE in 2007 to the Belgian company Schneider Electric Services International ends contractually on 31 December 2021, Schneider Electric SE once again holds full ownership of the Schneider Electric trademark. Consequently, as of 1 January 2022, the royalties for the Schneider Electric trademark will be invoiced to all group companies by Schneider Electric SE.\n\n## IGE+XAO\n\nFollowing the completion of a simplified public tender offer, the Group now holds 83.93% of the issued capital of IGE+XAO. In accordance with the Group's intentions as presented in the Information Note and the previously stated strategy to consolidate the various independent software entities within the Energy Management Software Division, the Group intends to implement a merger of IGE+XAO with Schneider Electric during fiscal year 2022.\n\nThe Boards of Directors of Schneider Electric and IGE+XAO have met on February 16, 2022 and approved the economic, financial and legal terms of the merger, including the merger parity of 5 Schneider Electric shares for 3 IGE+XAO shares. The merger agreement as well as the merger appraisers' reports will be available on the websites of Schneider Electric and IGE+XAO.\n\nThe Group will seek confirmation from the AMF that the merger would not require Schneider Electric to file a buy-out offer for the shares of IGE+XAO. In addition, the merger will be subject to the approval of the annual general shareholder meetings of the shareholders of IGE+XAO and Schneider Electric to be held on May 4 and 5, 2022 respectively.\n\n6.",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of rules required by the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and the French Code of ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1 st , 2021 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organisation and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n## Valuation of investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and advances to subsidiaries and affiliates\n\nParagraph 'Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates' of the section 'Accounting principles' and note 2 'Investments' of the notes to the parent company financial statements\n\n| Risk identified   | As at December 31, 2021, investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and the related advances amount to M\u20ac 5,358 and  M\u20ac 3,218 respectively in the balance sheet of Schneider Electric SE, net of any impairment loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                   | As described in the paragraph  'Shares in subsidiaries and affiliates' of the section 'A ccounting principles' of the notes  to the financial statements, investments are recognized at their acquisition cost and impaired, should their carrying  amount exceed their estimated value in use at closing date. The estimated value in use of investments is determined  primarily based on the subsidiaries' and affiliates' net assets as well as on their earnings outlook and the underlying  economic forecasts.

Our work consisted in:\n\n- \u00b7 comparing the shares in the subsidiaries' and affiliates' net assets, when used as a proxy for their value in use, with their underlying accounting data, which were subject to an audit or to analytical procedures;\n- \u00b7 assessing the appropriateness of the valuation method used to determine the value in use when based on forecasts;\n- \u00b7 assessing the reasonableness of key assumptions used to estimate values in use, mainly the long-term growth rate and the discount rate, with the assistance of our experts, when needed;\n- \u00b7 verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the computations performed by your Company.\n\nWe also assessed the recoverability of advances to subsidiaries and affiliates, based on the impairment tests results of the corresponding investments.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law and regulations.\n\n## Information provided in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the Board of Directors' management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders.\n\nIn accordance with French law, we report to you that the information relating to payment times referred to in Article D. 441-6 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) is fairly presented and consistent with the financial statements.\n\n## Information relating to corporate governance\n\nWe attest that the Board of Directors' section of the management report devoted to corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles L.225-37-4, L.22-10-10 et L.22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) relating to remunerations and benefits received by or allocated to the directors and any other commitments made in their favor, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from controlled companies which are part of its consolidation perimeter. Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), we have verified their compliance with the source documents communicated to us. Based on our work, we have no observation to make on this information.\n\n## Other information\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), prepared under the responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Schneider Electric S.E. by the Annual General Meetings held on May 6, 2004 for MAZARS and on June 25, 1992 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, MAZARS was in the eighteenth year of its engagement without interruption and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres in the thirtieth year.\n\n6.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the audit and risks committee\n\nWe submit a report to the audit and risks committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the audit and risks committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the audit and risks committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie ) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the audit and risks committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, March 11, 2022\n\nThe Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\n## MAZARS\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nLo\u00efc Wallaert\n\nMathieu Mougard\n\nAlexandre Resten",

In countries where regulations permit, Schneider Electric offers its employees the opportunity to invest during share capital increases reserved for its employees.\n\nIn 2021 the Group reintroduced WESOP in 40 countries, after cancelling 2020 operation due to the COVID-19 crisis. Success has been confirmed for this 25th campaign achieving 59% subscription rate; a higher rate than in 2019 at 50%.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, Group employees were holding a total of 20.3 million Schneider Electric SE shares either directly, through the corporate mutual funds (FCPE), or through Performance Share plans, representing 3.6% of the share capital and 6.3% of the voting rights, taking into account double voting rights.\n\nVoting rights attached to shares held by corporate mutual funds are exercised by the supervisory boards of these corporate mutual funds.\n\nThe Group's employee shareholders are spread across over 50 countries, as follows: 23% in France, 13% in China, 15% in India, 10% in the United States, and 39% elsewhere. Approximately 60% of all employees are shareholders of the Group.\n\n7.",

The program has been launched under the 15 th resolution approved at the 2018 Annual Shareholders' Meeting and pursued under the 14 th , 17 th , and 15 th resolutions approved respectively at the 2019, 2020, and 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meetings. These buybacks were part of a policy to neutralize the dilution resulting from capital increases reserved for employees or from Long-term Incentive Plans. All the shares acquired by the Company as part of the share buyback program are held to cover Long-term Incentive Plans.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, due to the economic uncertainty, and considering the on-going acquisitions, the share buyback program remained on-hold after its suspension due to the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. The share buyback program re-started at the end of July 2021 with the time frame for completion extended by 12 months, to run until the end of 2022. Since the beginning of the program in 2019, a total of \u20ac577,499,243 of share buyback corresponding to 5,941,783 shares bought back by the Company had been completed including \u20ac261,659,633 of share buyback in 2021 corresponding to 1,809,054 shares bought back by the Company pursuant to the last authorizations.\n\n## 7.2.5.2  Share buyback program to be submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May 5, 2022\n\nDetails of this share buyback program are as follows:\n\n| Number of shares and percentage of share capital held   directly and indirectly by Schneider Electric SE*                                             | \u00b7  own shares: 12,455,824 shares,  i.e.  2.19% of share capital \u00b7  treasury shares: 1,058 shares \u00b7  total: 12,456,882 shares,  i.e.  2.19% of share capital                                                                                               |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Overview of purposes for which shares have been held*                                                                                                 | \u00b7  for all own shares* held: allocation of Performance Shares                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Share buyback program objectives                                                                                                                      | \u00b7  allotment to employees or Corporate Officers as a long-term  compensation tool \u00b7  delivery as a result of the exercise of rights attached to securities  giving access to the Company's capital \u00b7  cancellation                                        |\n| Maximum number of shares that may be acquired                                                                                                         | \u00b7  10% of the issued share capital at any moment: -  on the basis of the issued share capital*: 56,903,344   Schneider Electric SE shares with a nominal value of \u20ac4  -  taking into account treasury stock and own shares*:   44,446,462 shares or 7.80% |\n| Maximum purchase price and maximum aggregate amount   of share purchases                                                                              | \u00b7  the maximum purchase price is set at \u20ac250 per share,   i.e.  \u20ac14,225,836,000                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Duration of the buyback program                                                                                                                       | \u00b7  18 months maximum, expiring on November 4, 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Transactions carried out pursuant to the program authorized   by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting 2021 between April 29,   2021 and February 16, 2022 | \u00b7  Number of shares acquired: 1,809,954  \u00b7  Average purchase price: \u20ac144.64  \u00b7  Number of shares transferred: 27,287  \u00b7  Average transfer price: \u20ac61.01                                                                                                   |\n\n## 7. 2 . 6  Pl e d g e\n\n## Pledges on Schneider Electric SE shares\n\n391,184 shares are pledged.\n\n## Pledges on subsidiaries' shares\n\nSchneider Electric SE has not pledged any shares in significant subsidiaries.",

The Board may decide, when each meeting is called, to organize the public transmission of all or part of the meeting by video conference and/or using teletransmission techniques.\n\nAll shareholders may attend meetings, in person or by proxy, after providing proof of identity and share ownership in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nWhen the decision is made to call an Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors may also decide to allow shareholders to participate or vote at Annual Shareholders' Meetings using video conferencing facilities and/or any other telecommunication medium allowed under applicable legislation.\n\nRemote voting procedures are governed by the applicable laws and regulations. In particular, shareholders may send proxy and mail ballot forms before Annual Shareholders' Meetings either in paper form or, if approved by the Board of Directors and stated in the meeting announcement and/or notice, electronically.\n\nWhen the decision is made to call an Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors may authorize shareholders to fill out and sign these forms electronically through a secure site set up by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting organizer using a process that complies with applicable laws and regulations (Paragraph 2 of Article 1367 of the French Civil Code) and consisting of a username and password.\n\nProxies or votes so submitted electronically before the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, as well as the related acknowledgments of receipt, will be considered irrevocable and binding documents. However, in the event that shares are sold before the applicable record date (midnight Paris time two business days before the meeting date), the Company will cancel or amend, as appropriate, any related proxy or electronic votes submitted before the Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nMeetings shall be chaired by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or in his absence by the Vice-Chairman, or in his absence by a member of the Board of Directors specially appointed for that purpose by the Board of Directors. In the event that no chairman has been selected, the Annual Shareholders' Meeting elects its chairman.\n\nThe two shareholders present who hold the largest number of votes and who accept shall act as scrutineers. The Board appoints a secretary, who is not required to be a shareholder.\n\nAs required by law, a register of attendance is kept.\n\nCopies or extracts of the meeting's minutes are certified either by the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the Annual Shareholders' Meeting's secretary.\n\n## 7. 4 . 2  Vot i n g  r i g h t s\n\nThis section is part of the Board of Directors' Corporate Governance Report.\n\n## 7.4.2.1  Double voting rights (Article 20 of the Articles of Association)\n\nVoting rights attached to shares are proportionate to the equity in the capital they represent, assuming that they all have the same nominal value. Each capital share or dividend share confers the right to one vote except where compulsory legal provisions limit the number of votes a shareholder may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, double voting rights are attributed to fully paid-up shares registered in the name of the same holder for at least two years prior to the end of the calendar year preceding that in which the Annual Shareholders' Meeting takes place, subject to compliance with the provisions of the law. In the case of a bonus share issue paid up by capitalizing reserves, earnings, or additional issue premiums, each bonus share allotted in respect of shares carrying double voting rights will also have double voting rights.\n\nThe shares are stripped of their double voting rights if they are converted into bearer shares or transferred, except in the case of the transfer from one registered holder to another as part of an inheritance or family gift.\n\nDouble voting rights may also be stripped by a decision of the Extraordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting after ratification by a Special Shareholders' Meeting of beneficiaries benefiting from double voting rights.\n\nThe minimum holding period to qualify for double voting rights was reduced from four to two years by decision of the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of June 27, 1995.",

        "page_content": "Shareholder Information\n\n## 7.4.2.2  Ceiling on voting rights (Article 20 of the Articles of Association)\n\nAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, no shareholder may exercise, either in person or through a proxy, by virtue of single voting rights conferred by the shares they hold directly and indirectly and by virtue of the proxy votes entrusted to them, more than 10% of the total number of the voting rights conferred by shares in the Company. However, if a shareholder also holds double voting rights directly or indirectly and/or as proxy, the limit set may be exceeded taking into consideration only the resulting additional voting rights, without the total voting rights thereby held exceeding 15% of the total number of the voting rights conferred by the shares in the Company.\n\nTo apply these provisions:\n\n- \u00b7 the total number of voting rights allowed are calculated as of the date of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting and announced to the shareholders at the beginning of such Annual Shareholders' Meeting;\n- \u00b7 the number of voting rights held directly and indirectly are understood to include those conferred by shares held personally by a shareholder, those conferred by shares held by a legal entity controlled by a shareholder as defined by Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, and those shares that are assimilated to the shares owned, as defined by the provisions of Articles L. 233-7 et seq. of the Code; and\n- \u00b7 shareholders' proxies returned to the Company that do not appoint a representative are subject to the above ceilings. However, these ceilings do not apply to the meeting chairman voting on behalf of such proxies.\n\nThe above ceilings will no longer apply, without it being necessary to put the matter to the vote again by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, if any individual or legal entity, acting alone or jointly with one or other individuals or legal entities, acquires or increases its stake to at least two-thirds of the Company's capital through a public tender offer for all the Company's shares. The Board of Directors takes note of this nullity and undertakes the formalities necessary to amend the Articles of Association. The ceiling on voting rights was approved by the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings of June 27, 1995.\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 225-96, Paragraph 1 of the French Commercial Code, any amendment to the Articles of Association must be approved by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, by a majority of at least two-thirds of the voting rights represented by shareholders in attendance or participating by proxy.\n\n## 7.4.3  Allocation of income (Article 22 of the Articles of Association)\n\nNet income for the year less any losses brought forward from prior years is appropriated in the following order:\n\n- \u00b7 5% to the legal reserve (this appropriation is no longer required once the legal reserve represents one-tenth of the capital, provided that further appropriations are made in the case of a capital increase);\n- \u00b7 to discretionary reserves, if appropriate, and to retained earnings; and\n- \u00b7 to the payment of the balance in the form of a dividend.\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting may decide to offer shareholders the opportunity to receive the dividend in cash or in the form of new shares. Dividends not claimed within five years from the date of payment are forfeited and paid to the government, in accordance with the law.\n\n## 7.4.4  Holding of shares (Article 7 Paragraph 1 of the Articles of Association)\n\nShareholders may elect to hold their shares in registered or bearer form. To establish proof of ownership, the shares must be recorded in the shareholder's account in accordance with the procedures and conditions defined by current legislation and regulations.\n\n## 7.4.5  Disclosure thresholds (Article 7 Paragraph 2 of the Articles of Association)\n\nThe Articles of Association stipulate that any individual or legal entity that owns or controls (as these terms are defined in Article L. 233-9 of the French Commercial Code) directly or indirectly, shares or voting rights representing at least 1% of the total number of shares or voting rights outstanding, or a multiple thereof, is required to disclose the total number of shares, voting rights and share equivalents held directly, indirectly or in concert to the Company by registered letter with return receipt requested, within five trading days of the disclosure threshold being crossed. In addition, effective November 1, 2009 the shareholder must notify the Company, in the disclosure letter, the number of existing shares it is entitled to acquire by virtue of agreements or financial instruments referred to in point b) of the third paragraph of Article L. 233-7 of the French Commercial Code and of the number of existing shares covered by any agreement or financial instrument referred to in point c) of said paragraph. Shareholders are also required to notify the Company if the number of shares or voting rights held falls below one of the thresholds defined above. In the case of failure to comply with these disclosure obligations, the shares in excess of the disclosure threshold will be stripped of voting rights at the request of one or several shareholders owning at least 2.5% of the share capital, subject to compliance with the relevant provisions of the law. These provisions are from the Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings of June 27, 1995, May 5, 2000, and April 23, 2009.\n\n7.",

No dividend will be paid on treasury shares held by the Company on the payment date. This distribution will be paid out of the distributable earnings amounting to \u20ac1,943,015,112.95. The proposed dividend is an integral part of Schneider Electric's policy to reward shareholders over the long term. It represents an increase of 11.5 % versus last year (and of more than 70% since 2012).\n\nThe distribution will be paid according to the following schedule:\n\n- \u2022 Dividend ex-date: May 17, 2022\n- \u2022 Record date:\n\nMay 18, 2022\n\n- \u2022 Dividend payment date: May 19, 2022\n\nFor individual beneficiaries who are tax resident in France, the dividend is subject upon payment to a social security tax of 17.2% and, in principle, to a mandatory non-definitive levy of 12.8%. This tax is levied at source and is computed on the gross amount of the dividend.\n\nFor its taxation in 2023, this dividend will fully be eligible for the 40% tax rebate referred to in Article 158.3.2\u00b0 of the French Tax Code where an express, global, and irrevocable election is made for taxation under the progressive scale of personal income tax. Where this option is not made, the dividend will be taxed at a final flat-rate income 12.8% and will not be eligible for this 40% rebate. In both cases, the levy of 12.8% borne at the time of the payment of the dividend is deducted from the individual income tax due.\n\n## Text of the first resolution\n\n## (Approval of statutory financial statements for the 2021 fiscal year)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Board of Directors' report and the statutory auditors' report, approves the statutory financial statements for the 2021 fiscal year as presented, as well as the transactions reflected in these statements or summarized in these reports showing a net profit of \u20ac1,498,235,274.60.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to Article 223 quater of the French Tax Code (Code g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des imp\u00f4ts), the Shareholders' Meeting approves the value of expenses and charges non-deductible from taxable result liable to corporate income tax and amounting to \u20ac2,508.02 as well as the theoretical tax borne as a result of these charges amounting to \u20ac666.89.\n\n## Text of the second resolution\n\n## (Approval of consolidated financial statements for the 2021 fiscal year)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Board of Directors' report and the statutory auditors' report, approves the consolidated statements for the 2021 fiscal year as presented, as well as the transactions reflected in these statements or summarized in these reports.\n\n## Text of the third resolution\n\n## (Appropriation of profit for the financial year and setting the dividend)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having noted that the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 closed with a net profit of \u20ac1,498,235,274.60 and, considering the retained earnings amounted to \u20ac444,779,838.35, the distributable earnings amounted to \u20ac1,943,015,112.95, upon proposal of the Board of Directors, decides:\n\n- \u00b7 the distribution to the shareholders of a dividend of \u20ac2.90 per share, i.e., \u20ac1,614,075,092.20 (1) on the basis of the number of shares ranking for dividends at December 31, 2021 paid from the distributable earnings; and\n- \u00b7 the allocation of the balance of the distributable earnings after distribution to the retained earnings.\n- (1)  This amount is calculated based on the number of shares ranking for dividends at December 31, 2021 and could therefore change if this number varies between January 1, 2022 and the ex-dividend date.\n\n8.",

In particular, the Board seeks to ensure gender balance and broad diversity in terms of skills, experience, nationality, and age, as described in its diversity policy (see section 4.1.1.2 of Chapter 4 of the Universal Registration Document). The Board investigates and evaluates not only potential candidates, but also whether existing directors should seek reappointment based on their performance assessment. Above all, the Board seeks directors who show independence of mind and are competent, dedicated and committed, with compatible and complementary personalities.\n\nMr. Willy Kissling, member of the Board of Directors for 21 years, and Mrs. Fleur Pellerin, member of the Board of Directors since 2018, have decided not to seek the renewal of their terms of office which expire at the closing of this Shareholders' Meeting. The Board of Directors expressed its gratitude to Mr. Willy Kissling's and Mrs. Fleur Pellerin's dedication to the Board of Directors' work and to their long-term commitment.\n\nAs part of the Board's continuous review of its composition, the Board of Directors asked the Governance & Remunerations Committee to make a recommendation on the renewal of Mrs. Linda Knoll and Mr. Anders Runevad, as well as search for complementary candidates in line with the skillset highlighted by its Board skills matrix and the challenges of the Company (see section 4.1.1.6 of Chapter 4 of the Universal Registration Document describing the directors recruitment process).\n\nIn that respect, the Committee has analyzed Mrs. Linda Knoll's and Mr. Anders Runevad's situation with regards to their time commitment and availability to fulfill their duties. Neither of them holds an excessive number of directorships, and their individual attendance rates at Board and Committee meetings are high as indicated in their biography (see section 4.1.1.2 of Chapter 4 of the Universal Registration Document). The Board also assessed their respective contributions to the work of the Board and of the committees to which they belong, and decided that keeping them as directors was in the interests of the Company and consistent with the targeted composition of the Board as identified in the process described above. As a Director, Mrs. Linda Knoll brings to the Board of Directors experience in senior Human Resources executive roles with international groups. Mr. Anders Runevad brings to the Board the benefit of his experience as the former CEO of Vestas Wind Systems A/S and a strong profile on sustainability matters.\n\nThe Governance & Remunerations Committee also identified the skills that would be necessary to diversify and strengthen the Board composition and hired an external recruitment firm (Heidrick & Struggles) to search for suitable candidates. Among these candidates, the Governance & Remunerations Committee preselected a short list and the members of the Committee interviewed the shortlisted candidates. Following these interviews, the Committee recommended a candidate to the Board of Directors, Mrs. Nivedita Krishnamurthy Bhagat, also known as Nive Bhagat, who, on February 16, 2022, was appointed as an Observer with the aim to propose her appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting. Mrs. Nive Bhagat, a British citizen, is currently Global Chief Executive Officer for Global Cloud Infrastructure Services of Capgemini and a member of its group executive committee. She will bring to the Board the experience and additional skillset based on her wide-ranging finance and business background especially in the field of digital and will further add to the gender diversity of the Board of Directors. She will also strengthen the profile of the Schneider Electric Board through her excellent knowledge of the Asian market. She will qualify as an independent Director with regard to all the criteria set by Article 9.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code and, if appointed, will join the Digital Committee.\n\nActing upon recommendation of the Governance & Remunerations Committee, the Board of Directors propose to shareholders:\n\n- \u00b7 in the 11 th resolution, to renew the term of office of Mrs. Linda Knoll for a four-year (4) term;\n- \u00b7 in the 12 th resolution, to renew the term of office of Mr. Anders Runevad for a four-year (4) term; and\n- \u00b7 in the 13 th resolution, , to appoint Mrs. Nive Bhagat as a Director for a four-year (4) term.\n\nShould these resolutions be approved, the Board of Directors would consist of 14 members (including one Director representing the employee shareholders and two Directors representing the employees), with an independence rate of 82% and 45% of women (excluding the three Directors who are also employees) and 79% being of non-French origin or nationalities.\n\nMrs. Linda Knoll, Mr. Anders Runevad, and Mrs. Nive Bhagat's biographies are provided in section 4.1.1.2 of Chapter 4 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Text of the eleventh resolution\n\n## (Renewal of the term of office of Mrs. Linda Knoll)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for ordinary meetings, having heard the Board of Directors' report, takes note that the term of office of Mrs. Linda Knoll as a Director expires at the closing of this Shareholders' Meeting and decides to renew it for a four-year (4) term expiring at the closing of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2026 to approve the financial statements for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\n8.",

The program has been launched under the 15 th resolution approved at the 2018 Annual Shareholders' Meeting and pursued under the 14 th , 17 th , and 15 th resolutions approved respectively at the 2019, 2020, and 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meetings. These buy-backs were part of a policy to neutralize the dilution resulting from capital increases reserved for employees or from Longterm Incentive Plans. All the shares acquired by the Company as part of the share buy-back program are held to cover Long-term Incentive Plans.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, due to the economic uncertainty, and considering the on-going acquisitions, the share buy-back program remained on-hold after its suspension due to the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. The share buy-back program re-started at the end of July 2021 with the timeframe for completion extended by 12 months, to run until the end of 2022. Since the beginning of the program in 2019, a total \u20ac577,499,243 of share buy-back corresponding to 5,941,783 shares bought back by the Company had been completed including \u20ac261,659,633 of share buyback in 2021 corresponding to 1,809,054 shares bought back by the Company pursuant to the last authorizations.\n\nAll the 12,455,824 treasury shares held on December 31, 2021 (representing 2.19% of the share capital) are allocated to employees and Corporate Officers as a long-term compensation tool.\n\nThe authorization that you would give to the Board would allow to proceed to purchase shares for the purposes, amongst others, of:\n\n- \u00b7 their allotment to employees or Corporate Officers as a long-term compensation tool;\n- \u00b7 their delivery as a result of the exercise of rights attached to securities giving access to the Company's capital;\n- \u00b7 their cancellation;\n- \u00b7 their delivery in connection with external growth operations; and\n- \u00b7 their disposal in the course of a share management agreement.\n\nShares bought back may be canceled under the authorization adopted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of April 28, 2021 (24 th resolution).\n\nThe number of shares thus purchased, and the number of shares held may not exceed 10% of the share capital at any time (for reference purposes, based on the issued capital on December 31, 2021: 56,903,344 shares). The maximum purchase price of the shares would be set at \u20ac250 and the total amount allocated to the share repurchase program will not exceed \u20ac14.2 billion. As for previous years, the resolution prevents that the authorization be used during a public offering on the Company's shares.\n\nFurther information on the Company's share buy-back programs can be found in section 7.2.5 of Chapter 7 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document.",

In such a case, the Company would inform its shareholders through a public release.\n\nShares acquired may also be canceled, subject to compliance with the provisions of Articles L. 225-204 and L. 225-205 of the French Commercial Code and in accordance with the 24 th resolution of the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of April 28, 2021.\n\nThe number of shares that may be purchased shall be subject to following limits:\n\n- (i) the number of shares that the Company may purchase during the term of the buy-back program should not exceed 10% of the Company's share capital at any time (i.e. for information purposes, 56,903,344 shares, on the basis of the share capital as of December 31, 2021), it being specified that the number of shares acquired in view of their retention and their future delivery for the purpose of an external growth operation cannot exceed 5% of the Company's share capital; and\n- (ii) the number of shares that the Company can hold at any time may not exceed 10% of the Company's share capital.\n\nThe maximum share purchase price is set at \u20ac250 per share (excluding acquisition costs) without exceeding the maximum price set by applicable laws and regulations. The total amount allocated to the share repurchase program will not exceed \u20ac14.2 billion (excluding acquisition costs).\n\nThe purchase, exchange, disposal or transfer of shares can be decided by the Board of Directors on one or more occasions, at any time except during takeover bid involving the Company's shares, and by any means, provided that laws and regulations in force are complied with, on or off the stock market, over the counter, in whole or in part in blocks of shares, by takeover bid in cash or in shares, by using options or derivatives, either directly or indirectly through the intermediation of an investment services provider, or in any other way.\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting grants authority to the Board of Directors, which may further delegate as permitted by law, to adjust the price set forth above in the event of transactions on the Company's share capital, and in particular an increase in capital through the capitalization of reserves, the allocation of free shares, a stock split or reverse stock split, the distribution of reserves or any other assets, impairment of share capital or any other transaction involving share capital or shareholders' equity, to take into account the impact of these transactions on the stock value.\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting gives full powers to the Board of Directors with powers to subdelegate under the conditions set out by law, to use this authorization, in particular to give any and all orders, enter into any and all agreements, allocate or reallocate the shares acquired to the objectives pursued under the applicable legal and regulatory conditions, set the terms and conditions under which the rights of holders of securities giving access to the share capital or other rights giving access to the share capital will be preserved, if applicable, in accordance with legal and regulatory provisions and, if applicable, contractual provisions providing for other cases of adjustment, prepare all documents and press releases, carry out any and all formalities and make all appropriate declarations to the authorities, and in general take all necessary measures.\n\nThis authorization supersedes, for the unused portion, the authorization given to the Board of Directors by the Shareholders' Meeting of April 28, 2021 in its 15 th resolution and is granted for an eighteen (18)-month period as from this Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n8.",

The Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Human Resources & CSR and Governance & Remunerations Committees, has determined the following guidelines for granting free shares under this resolution.\n\n## Context of the request for authorization\n\nThe Company wishes to mobilize its management in order to carry out its 2022-2024 Strategic Plan announced in November 2021, upon which the development of the Group relies. In this context, the requested authorization would make it possible for the Board of Directors to put in place plans for the grant of shares, to the benefit of Corporate Officers and employees of the Group, both in France and abroad, and to involve the employees in the Group's performance and development as part of the 2022-2024 Strategic Plan. These plans would also allow to ensure the competitiveness of the compensation offered by the Group, in dynamic and competitive international markets, and in sectors where the ability to attract talents is a key factor to success.\n\nOverall, the Board decided to keep the same design as the one of the previous Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by more than 93% of the shareholders during the 2019 Annual Shareholders' meeting where a complete new framework of the plan had been proposed. The Board considers that the design of the plan is well balanced and ensures the alignment of the management with the shareholders' long-term interests and that is why it wishes to favor the stability of the compensation principle of the Group. Nevertheless, hearing the concerns expressed by some shareholders during the governance roadshow conducted by the Vice-Chairman & Lead Independent Director, the Board proposes to introduce two important changes in order to further strengthen the alignment of pay and performance. If you approve this resolution:\n\n- \u00b7 the scale of vesting of the criterion of TSR compared to a bespoke industry panel of 11 companies would be made more stringent, with no vesting at ranks 7 and below in the bespoke peer group (with an anticipated application of this change in the 2022 LTIP to be issued), no vesting below the median of the group would therefore be allowed; and\n- \u00b7 the Board would also commit to disclose ex-post the targets of improvement of the adjusted Earnings per share set by the Board which will allow shareholders to ensure the stringency of these targets set by the Board.\n\n## Nature of the authorization\n\nYou are being asked to authorize the Board of Directors to proceed, on one or more occasions, with the grant of shares of the Company, issued or to be issued, to the benefit of employees and Corporate Officers of the Group.\n\nAs part of the long term compensation plans of the Company, two different types of grant would be made:\n\n- \u00b7 a maximum of 30% of the shares granted would be subject only to a presence condition, without performance condition (the ' Restricted Shares '); and\n- \u00b7 all other shares granted would be subject to a presence condition and to performance conditions (the ' Performance Shares ').\n\nThe Corporate Officer and members of the Executive Committee would be entitled to receive only Performance Shares.\n\nIt is envisaged that the number of persons benefiting from such grants will be around 3,500 people.\n\nBesides, the Board of Directors could decide the grant of Restricted Shares as part of the shareholding plans of the Company, in addition to the shares subscribed.\n\n## Term of the authorization\n\nThe authorization would be valid for a duration of 36 months, as from the date of this Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Maximum amount of the authorization\n\nThe grants of shares carried out pursuant to this authorization should not involve a number of shares, issued or to be issued, exceeding 2% of the Company's share capital on the date of this Annual Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe Board of Directors reminds you that the Group's policy regarding grant of stock options, share purchase, and free and performance shares is to have a limited impact over time in terms of dilution of the share capital. For information purposes, we remind you that, as of December 31, 2021, a total of 5,863,887 shares could be vested to employees and Corporate Officers subject to performance conditions set under the performance share plans (for details of these plans, see section 4.2.5 of Chapter 4 of the Universal Registration Document).",

        "page_content": "Shareholder Information\n\nIf all shares in the plans were delivered, this would lead to the issuance of 293,071 shares (other plans are already qualified and will be delivered from existing shares) and Schneider Electric's share capital would be composed of 569,326,513 ordinary shares, i.e ., a 0.05% increase in the number of shares from December 31, 2021.\n\nUnder the Long-Term Incentive Plan, Performance Shares allocated to the Corporate Officer could not exceed each year 0.03% of the total share capital and allocation to the members of the Executive Committee would not represent more than 20% of the grant. In addition, the Corporate Officer's compensation policy provides that the long-term instruments, valued in accordance with IFRS standards, should not represent a disproportionate percentage of his overall compensation (meaning no more than 200% of the combined fixed and targeted variable compensations at the date of grant).\n\n## Vesting period\n\nThe grant of shares to their beneficiaries would become final at the end of a vesting period, the duration of which would be set by the Board of Directors, it being understood that such duration will be of no less than three (3) years.\n\nThe Board of Directors would submit the Corporate Officer to an obligation of retaining a significant number of their shares. He would have to retain at least 50% of the Performance Shares granted to him until he holds a number of shares representing 5 years of fixed compensation.\n\n## Presence condition in the Group\n\nThe vesting of Restricted and Performance Shares would be subject to achievement of a presence condition in the Group. Restricted and Performance Shares granted to a beneficiary who would leave the Group before the expiry of a minimum three-year vesting period would be forfeited, except in case of death, retirement or other customary exceptions decided upon by the Board of Directors. For the Corporate Officer, the case of retention of unvested Performance Shares awards would be determined by the Compensation policy applicable to him at the date of his departure.\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nThe final vesting of Performance Shares would be subject to performance conditions, to be set by the Board of Directors (the 'Performance Conditions') the outline of which would be as follows:\n\n## \u00b7 40%, improvement of Adjusted Earnings per share (EPS):\n\nAdjusted EPS is a key long-term performance metric which promotes the execution of Schneider Electric's strategy to deliver profitable growth, thus reinforcing alignment with shareholders. 40% of the Performance Shares could vest subject to the achievement of the following targets as set by the Board of Directors:\n\n- - a minimum Adjusted EPS improvement threshold under which there would be no vesting;\n- - an intermediary targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objective that the Company would have to achieve in order to vest 75% of the shares under this condition;\n- - a targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objective that the Company would have to achieve in order to vest all shares under this condition; and\n- - the Performance Shares would vest progressively, on a linear basis, if the Adjusted EPS improvement is between these objectives.\n\nAs explained above, the Board commits to disclose ex-post , at the end of each Long-Term Incentive Plan, the minimum Adjusted EPS improvement thresholds and the targeted Adjusted EPS improvement objectives.\n\nAdjusted EPS performance is published in the external financial communications and its annual variance will be calculated using adjusted EBITA at constant FX from year N-1 to year N. Foreign exchange impacts below adjusted EBITA will be taken in full. Significant unforeseen scope impact could be restated from this calculation upon decision of the Board.\n\n## \u00b7 35%, relative TSR performance:\n\nThis criterion strengthens the alignment between the shareholders' interests and compensation of the beneficiaries of LTIP.\n\n- - For 17.5% of the shares, Schneider Electric TSR would be compared to a bespoke industry panel of 11 companies (ABB, Legrand, Siemens, Eaton, Emerson, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, and Yokogawa) with a vesting scale as follows: 0% at rank 7 or below, 50% at median (rank 6), 100% at rank 4, 150% for ranks 3 to 1, and linear between these points, as explained above, the Board proposes to strengthen the vesting scale for a better alignment with performance.\n- - For the remaining 17.5%, Schneider Electric TSR would be compared with the TSR of the companies in CAC 40 index to reflect the macro-economic and stock-market specific trends which influence the performance of the share and in turn, the return to shareholders with a vesting scale as follows: 0% below median, 50% at median (rank 20), 100% at rank 10, 120% in ranks 4 to 1, and linear between these points.\n\nIn case of over-performance, if Schneider Electric's TSR is ranked within the top quartile of the bespoke industry panel or within the top 9 of the CAC 40 companies, this criterion could compensate the under-performance under the criterion of improvement of the Adjusted EPS up to the same number of shares. If the Schneider Electric TSR is closely clustered with that of other companies in the panel, then the Board of Directors would apply its judgment to decide whether Schneider Electric's TSR shall be deemed to be ranked in the same position as those companies.\n\n8.",

Using external indices would also ensure that the sustainability priorities governing the assessment of the long-term sustainability performance of the Group are at all times those which matter the most to the stakeholders. As their content is dynamic and includes new and more relevant topics as they emerge, it forces participants to constantly anticipate the most demanding trends in global sustainability. The Board has selected some of the most challenging external indices which are objective, recognized, and independent, covering main geographies in line with the Group's global footprint and which complement each other as they cover different sustainability dimensions:\n\n- - DJSI World which covers three dimensions: economic, environmental, and social;\n- - Euronext Vigeo which covers environment, community involvement, business behavior, human rights, corporate governance, and human resources;\n- - Ecovadis which covers four dimensions: environment, labor and human rights, sustainable procurement, and ethics; and\n- - CDP Climate Change which covers climate change, water, and forests and represents a major reference for climate change leadership globally.\n\nThe table below summarizes the Performance Conditions that would apply to the plan:\n\n|                                                                   | 40% Improvement of adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS)                                                                                                                             | \u00b7  threshold \u00b7  improvement objective \u00b7  100% at the targeted Adjusted EPS  improvement objective Vesting linear between these points   | 0% at the minimum Adjusted EPS improvement  75% at the intermediary Adjusted EPS          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 35% Relative TSR                                                  | 17.5% vs. CAC 40                                                                                                                                                                 | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  Vesting linear between these points                                                                                         | 0% below median 50% at median (rank 20) 100% at rank 10 120% at ranks 4 to 1              |\n|                                                                   | 17.5% vs. a panel of 11 companies (ABB, Legrand, Siemens, Eaton, Emerson,   Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell  Automation, Fuji Electric, Mitsubishi Electric and  Yokogawa) | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  Vesting linear between these points                                                                                         | 0% at rank 7 and below 50% at median (rank 6) 100% at rank 4 150% at ranks 3 to 1         |\n| 25% Schneider   Sustainability External &  Relative Index (SSERI) | 6.25% DJSIW                                                                                                                                                                      | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7                                                                                                                                 | 0%: not in World 50%: included in World 100%: sector leader                               |\n|                                                                   | 6.25% Euronext Vigeo                                                                                                                                                             | \u00b7  \u00b7                                                                                                                                    | 0%: out 50%: included in World 120 or Europe 120 100%: included in World 120 & Europe 120 |\n|                                                                   | 6.25% Ecovadis                                                                                                                                                                   | \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7  \u00b7                                                                                                                              | 0%: Silver Medal or less 50%: Gold Medal (top 5%) 100%: Platinum Medal (top 1%)           |\n\nFor each grant, the performance conditions will be determined by the Board. and, although the Board favors stability, they could be adapted from the ones presented above. Depending on the evolution of the Group's strategic objectives, should they cease to be relevant or new criteria be deemed more appropriate based on their review by the Board of Directors, the latter would elect for criteria with similar long-term stringency, that will ensure a strong link between pay and performance.\n\n## Best practices\n\nThe Board of Directors shall inform Shareholders every year of the number of shares granted or/and vested pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The grant of Performance Shares would also be consistent with the principles and best practices applied by the Board, including, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 involvement at each stage (allocation, review of the satisfaction of performance conditions, etc. ) of the Human Resources & CSR Committee;\n- \u00b7 demanding performance conditions in line with the Company's financial communication which provide incentive, for 100% of the shares granted to the Corporate Officer and members of the Executive Committee; and\n- \u00b7 demanding rules of business ethics, including, a prohibition for beneficiaries who are members of the Executive Committee to use hedging instruments for the Performance Shares.\n\nAll these elements, taken together, demonstrate that the Group is aligned itself with best market practices regarding Performance Shares and responds to the expectations of its shareholders.",

of 2% of the share capital)\n\nThe Annual Shareholders' Meeting, having satisfied the quorum and majority requirements for extraordinary shareholders' meetings, having heard the Board of Directors' report and the statutory auditors' special report:\n\n- 1. authorizes the Board of Directors, pursuant to the provisions of Articles L. 225-197-1 to L. 225-197-5 and L. 22-10-59 of the French Commercial Code, on one or several occasions, to allocate free shares, existing or to be created (other than preferred shares), to the beneficiaries that it shall determine among the employees of the

The Board of Directors wishes to continue making the Company's share capital accessible to a large number of employees, in particular through employee share ownership plans ('WESOP'). As of December 31, 2021, employees held 3.57% of the capital either directly or through the corporate mutual funds ( FCPE ).\n\nThe Company carried out capital increases reserved for Group employees in 2021 (WESOP 2021).

All IGE+XAO shares currently held by SEISAS would be reclassified by transferring them to Schneider Electric immediately before the Merger takes place.\n\nIn this context, the Board of Directors invites you, under the 18 th resolution , to approve the Merger. In accordance with applicable law, if the absorbing company holds less than 90% of the voting rights of the absorbed subsidiary, the merger must be approved by the Extraordinary General Meetings of both companies.\n\nAs provided in the draft merger agreement (the ' Draft Merger Agreement ') approved by the Schneider Electric's Board of Directors and IGE+XAO's Board of Directors, the Merger would imply the issuance of 342,023 Schneider Electric's shares representing an increase of 0.06% of the share capital (4) , it being specified that the amount of the capital increase would be adjusted in the event of a change in the number of IGE+XAO shares held by Schneider Electric and/or in the number of shares comprising the share capital of Schneider Electric that may impact the exchange ratio.\n\n- (1)  Based on its share capital comprising 1,427,800 shares, representing at most 1,428,855 voting rights, at January 31, 2018.",

The purpose of its range of software is to help manufacturers design and maintain the electrical component of any type of installation.\n\nIn the financial year ended December 31, 2021, IGE+XAO generated consolidated revenue of \u20ac36.4 million. It employs more than 389 people around the world across 30 sites in 22 countries, and has more than 98,649 licenses in force worldwide. IGE+XAO is a leading player in its sector.\n\nIGE+XAO shares are listed on Euronext Paris. Its shares are admitted to trading on Euronext Paris under the ISIN code FR0000030827, compartment B.\n\n## Reasons for and purpose of the Merger\n\nThe Merger is intended to (i) position the IGE+XAO group's entities as purely operational entities of Schneider Electric's Energy Management Software Division, it being stipulated that the IGE+XAO group would retain its main role as an agnostic software producer and (ii) extend the IGE+XAO group's remit, including pulling together software activities that are currently dispersed within the Schneider Electric Group and gradually becoming a center of excellence for R&D. The Merger would also enable non-controlling shareholders of IGE+XAO to continue benefiting from the value created by this strategy by holding shares in the Company.\n\n## Rules governing the Merger\n\nIn accordance with Articles L. 236-1 and following of the French Commercial Code, the Merger would entail the transfer of all of IGE+XAO's assets and liabilities to Schneider Electric (a ' transmission universelle du patrimoine ') and IGE+XAO would be dissolved but not liquidated.\n\n## Merger appraisers\n\nFinexsi, acting through Olivier P\u00e9ronnet, and BM&A, acting through Pierre B\u00e9al, were appointed as merger appraisers (certified public accountants appointed to assess M&A transactions) by order of the Presiding Judge of the Nanterre Commercial Court dated December 14, 2021, with the task of examining the terms of the Merger and more specifically assessing the value of the contributions in kind to be made and of any special privileges, as well as checking the accuracy of relative values attributed to IGE+XAO and Schneider Electric shares and the fairness of the exchange ratio.\n\nThe merger appraisers' reports which are available to shareholders on the Schneider Electric website (www.se.com) concluded that:\n\n- 'The exchange ratio of 5 Schneider Electric shares for 3 IGE+XAO shares (...) agreed by the parties is fair .\n\nThe value of the contributions retained, amounting to \u20ac38,693,042, is not overvalued and, consequently, that the net assets contributed are at least equal to the amount of the capital increase of the company receiving the contributions, plus the merger premium.'\n\n## Completion date and effective date\n\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to the following conditions precedent being met:\n\n- \u00b7 completion of the sale of IGE+XAO shares to Schneider Electric;\n- \u00b7 approval of the Merger by shareholders in IGE+XAO's extraordinary shareholders' general meeting (including approval of the decision to dissolve but not liquidate IGE+XAO and of the transfer of all of IGE+XAO's assets and liabilities to Schneider Electric); and\n- \u00b7 approval of the Merger by shareholders in Schneider Electric's extraordinary shareholders' general meeting (including approval of the net carrying amount of net assets transferred, the exchange ratio and the capital increase to be carried out by Schneider Electric as remuneration for the Merger).\n\nThe Merger and the resulting dissolution of IGE+XAO will take place on the day on which the last of the conditions precedent is fulfilled (the ' Completion Date '). That date must fall after the expiry of the creditor objection period and, unless the parties agree otherwise in writing, at the latest on June 30, 2022. If the Merger does not take place by that date, the Draft Merger Agreement will be void.\n\nIn accordance with Article 236-4(2) of the French Commercial Code, it is intended that the Merger will have retroactive effect from January 1, 2022 for accounting and tax purposes.\n\n- (2)  Based on an Enterprise Value of \u20ac286 million.\n- (3)  Based on its share capital comprising 1,304,381 shares, representing at most 2,256,580 voting rights at October 31, 2021.\n- (4)  Based on the number of IGE+XAO shares held by Schneider Electric amounting to 1,094,733.\n\n8.",

and determining the net assets transferred\n\nThe transfer values mentioned in the Draft Merger Agreement are based on the following financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 as regards Schneider Electric, the parent company financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, as finalized by the Board of Directors on February 16, 2022; and\n- \u00b7 as regards IGE+XAO, the parent company financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, as finalized by the Board of Directors on February 16, 2022.\n\nIn accordance with French accounting standard-setter ANC's regulation 2014-03 of June 5, 2014 relating to France's general accounting plan (5) , the assets and liabilities transferred by IGE+XAO to Schneider Electric as part of the Merger will be recognized in Schneider Electric's financial statements at their net carrying amounts at December 31, 2021.\n\nOn that basis, the net carrying amount of the net assets transferred by IGE+XAO would amount to \u20ac38,693,042, determined as follows:\n\n| Total amount of assets transferred:                                                                                                                                | \u20ac39,650,407

Schneider Electric (minus the net carrying amount of the 4,434 IGE+XAO shares held  in treasury by IGE+XAO at December 31, 2021): | \u20ac38,693,042   |\n\n## Exchange ratio and capital increase\n\nThe exchange ratio proposed to IGE+XAO and Schneider Electric shareholders is 5 (five) Schneider Electric shares for every 3 (three) IGE+XAO shares.\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 236-3 of the French Commercial Code, there will be no exchange of either the IGE+XAO shares held by Schneider Electric, i.e., 1,094,733 IGE+XAO shares at the signing date of the Draft Merger Agreement, nor of the IGE+XAO shares held by IGE+XAO itself, i.e., 4,434 IGE+XAO shares at the signing date of the Draft Merger Agreement, which will be canceled by operation of law after the Merger is completed.\n\nIn consideration for the assets transferred by IGE+XAO, Schneider Electric would carry out a capital increase, applying the exchange ratio, in a nominal amount of \u20ac1,368,092, taking its share capital from \u20ac2,276,133,768 to \u20ac2,277,501,860, through the creation of 342,023 new shares, with par value of \u20ac4 each, allotted to IGE+XAO shareholders in proportion to their interest in the share capital, with the exception of Schneider Electric (in respect of the IGE+XAO shares held by Schneider Electric) and IGE+XAO (in respect of the IGE+XAO shares held by IGE+XAO itself).\n\nHowever, it is provided in Article 7.2 of the Draft Merger Agreement that in the event of a change in the number of IGE+XAO shares held by Schneider Electric and/or in the number of shares comprising the share capital of Schneider Electric that may impact the exchange ratio, the number of Schneider Electric shares to be issued in consideration for the Merger and, correlatively, the nominal amount of the resulting share capital increase would be automatically adjusted accordingly.\n\nThus, in view of the adjustment related to the acquisition by SEISAS of 34,629 IGE+XAO shares after the signing date of the Draft Merger Agreement, the amount of the capital increase would amount, as of February 28, 2022, to \u20ac1,137,232 (i.e., 284,308 newly issued Schneider Electric shares) and the amount of the merger premium would amount to \u20ac3,940,246 and to \u20ac260,018,556 for the merger loss.\n\nThe final amounts will be communicated on the date of the combined shareholders' meeting.\n\nFollowing this capital increase and on the basis of information available to the Company, the distribution of capital would be, as of February 28, 2022, as follows:\n\n|                                | Before the capital increase   resulting from the Merger (resolution #18)   | Before the capital increase   resulting from the Merger (resolution #18)   | After the capital

        "page_content": "Shareholder Information\n\nThe valuation methods used and criteria adopted to value Schneider Electric and IGE+XAO in order to determine the exchange ratio are set out in Schedule 7 to the Draft Merger Agreement.\n\n## Merger premium\n\nThe merger premium is the difference between (i) the proportion of the net carrying amount of the transferred net assets corresponding to the IGE+XAO shares not held by Schneider Electric or IGE+XAO on the Completion Date, i.e., \u20ac6,108,214 at the signing date of the Draft Merger Agreement, and (ii) the nominal amount of Schneider Electric's capital increase, i.e., \u20ac1,368,092 at the signing date of the Draft Merger Agreement.\n\nThe amount of the merger premium would consequently be \u20ac4,740,122 based on the number of shares making up IGE+XAO's share capital (excluding IGE+XAO shares held by IGE+XAO itself) at the signing date of the Draft Merger Agreement, it being specified that this amount would be adjusted automatically in the event of a change in the number of IGE+XAO shares held by Schneider Electric and/or in the number of shares comprising Schneider Electric's share capital that may impact the exchange ratio.\n\nThe merger premium may be appropriated in any manner decided by shareholders in Schneider Electric's shareholders' general meeting that is consistent with principles in force. In particular, you will be asked to authorize the Board of Directors to make any appropriations from the merger premium with a view to (i) reconstituting, on the liabilities side of Schneider Electric's balance sheet, the regulated reserves and provisions existing on IGE+XAO's balance sheet, (ii) deducting from the merger premium all fees, duties and levies incurred or due with respect to the Merger, (iii) deducting from the merger premium all excess tax depreciation, (iv) deducting from the merger premium the sums necessary to ensure that the statutory reserve is fully constituted, and (v) deducting from the merger premium any liabilities relating to the transferred assets that were omitted or not disclosed.\n\n## Loss on canceled shares in the acquired company\n\nThe cancellation of IGE+XAO shares held by Schneider Electric will produce a loss equal to the difference between (i) the net carrying amount of the IGE+XAO shares held by Schneider Electric on the Completion Date, i.e., \u20ac284,630,580 at the signing date of the Draft Merger Agreement, and (ii) the portion of the net assets transferred by IGE+XAO that corresponds to the IGE+XAO shares held by Schneider Electric on the Completion Date, i.e., \u20ac32,584,828 at the signing date of the Draft Merger Agreement.\n\nThe amount of that loss would consequently be \u20ac252,045,752 based on the number of shares making up IGE+XAO's share capital (excluding IGE+XAO shares held by IGE+XAO itself) at the signing date of the Draft Merger Agreement, it being specified that this amount would be adjusted automatically in the event of a change in the number of IGE+XAO shares held by Schneider Electric.\n\nSince this is a technical merger loss which does not translate into a loss of value for the shareholders, it will be recognized on the asset side of Schneider Electric's balance sheet and appropriated according to French accounting and tax rules.\n\n## Double voting rights\n\nIGE+XAO shareholders holding double voting rights before the Completion Date would retain those double voting rights within Schneider Electric after the Merger.\n\nSimilarly, the holders of IGE+XAO registered shares who have not acquired double voting rights by the Completion Date would see, after the Merger, the amount of time for which they have held their shares as of the Completion Date count towards the ownership period required by Schneider Electric to qualify for double voting rights.\n\n## Consultation with staff representative bodies\n\nThe competent staff representative bodies of IGE+XAO and Schneider Electric have been consulted and have delivered the following opinions:\n\n- \u00b7 favorable opinion from the social and economic committee of the economic and social unit to which IGE+XAO belongs on December 8, 2021; and\n- \u00b7 favorable opinion from the social and economic committee of the economic and social unit to which SEISAS belongs on December 9, 2021.\n\nIn addition, the European committee of the group to which Schneider Electric belongs was informed of the Merger in a meeting on December 14, 2021.\n\n8.",

Similarly, the holders of IGE+XAO registered shares who have not acquired double voting rights by the Merger Completion Date will see, after the Merger, the amount of time for which they have held their shares as of the Merger Completion Date count towards the ownership period required by the Company to qualify for double voting rights;\n- \u00b7 the new shares in the Company issued as remuneration for the Merger (i) will rank for dividends from the time they are created and will be immediately fungible with existing shares in the Company, (ii) will confer the same rights and will be subject, from the time they are created, to all provisions of the articles of association, laws and regulations in force and of shareholders' general meetings and (iii) will confer an entitlement to distributions of any kind decided after they are issued;\n- \u00b7 the new shares in the Company will be fully paid up and free of any security interest and, as soon as possible after they are issued, admitted for trading on compartment A of Euronext Paris under the same identification number as the previously issued ordinary shares that make up the Company's share capital (ISIN FR0000121972);",

If applicable, it shall determine the final conditions of these operations.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the board of directors to prepare a report in accordance with articles R. 225-113 et seq. of the French Commercial code ( Code de commerce ). Our role is to report on the fairness of the financial information taken from the accounts, on the proposed cancellation of preferential subscription rights, and on other information relating to the share issues provided in this report.\n\nWe have performed those procedures which we considered necessary to comply with the professional guidance issued by the French national auditing body ( Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes ) for this type of engagement. These procedures consisted in verifying the information provided in the board of director's report relating to these operations and the methods used to determine the issue price of the equity securities to be issued.\n\nSubject to a subsequent examination of the conditions for the issues that would be decided, we have no matters to report as to the methods used to determine the issue price of the equity securities to be issued provided in the board of director's report.\n\nAs the final conditions for the issues have not yet been determined, we cannot report on these conditions and, consequently, on the proposed cancellation of preferential subscription rights.\n\nIn accordance with article R. 225-116 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), we will issue a supplementary report, if necessary, when your board of directors has exercised this authorization.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, March 11, 2022\n\nThe Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nMAZARS\n\nLo\u00efc Wallaert\n\nMathieu Mougard\n\nERNST & YOUNG et Autres\n\nAlexandre Resten",
