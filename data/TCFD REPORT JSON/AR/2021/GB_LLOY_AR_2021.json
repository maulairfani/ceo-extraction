        "page_content": "## Chair's statement\n\n## Becoming truly purpose-driven will deliver long-term sustainability and benefit all our stakeholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nIn my first year as Chair of Lloyds Banking Group I have been impressed by the continued progress the Group is making in supporting its customers and Helping Britain Recover. I am immensely proud of the continued support and dedication of our staff which has enabled us to play such a leading role in supporting the UK economy throughout the crisis and on behalf of the Board, I would like to thank them for their ongoing commitment.\n\nAt the same time 2021 has been a year of progress and transition for the Group, with a new management team in place, continued business momentum and solid financial performance enabling an increased ordinary dividend and further excess capital return. We made strong progress against our transitional strategy, Strategic Review 2021, building further foundations and strengthening our position as the UK's leading financial partner, whilst further enhancing key/uni00A0capabilities.\n\n## Purpose-driven business\n\nAs I mentioned last year, the role of the Chair is to help ensure that the Board and the Executive team are focusing on the right issues and developing the right purpose and strategy, executing it effectively and with the right culture and values as an organisation. Given the increasingly dynamic and competitive environment we have spent a lot of time this year with the new management team considering the most appropriate future strategy for the Group.\n\nI am really pleased with the outcome: a strategy directly aligned to our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, building on the existing strengths of the Group, that will deliver long-term and profitable growth whilst making a meaningful and positive difference for all stakeholders.\n\nWe are committed to Helping Britain Prosper by creating a more sustainable and inclusive future for people and businesses, shaping finance as a force for good. Further detail on our new strategy can be found on pages 06 to 21 .\n\nClimate change is one area where I think we can make a big difference. We want to be a leader in accelerating the UK's transition to a low carbon economy and are developing targets and plans to deliver our net zero ambitions in our own operations and financed emissions. With our full year results we have published our inaugural Climate Report and will continue to implement the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures in line with industry guidelines and regulatory requirements, whilst delivering in the near term.\n\nAs we move to become a truly purposedriven business, I am confident that our new strategy will provide the capabilities to deliver even better outcomes for customers, colleagues and shareholders whilst supporting the communities in which we operate.\n\n## Governance and culture\n\nThere are clearly strong links between governance and establishing a culture that supports long-term sustainable success. The Board and senior management have a vital role to play in shaping and embedding a healthy corporate culture and I am keen to ensure we build a strong reputation in this area. During the pandemic, there has been increased focus on ensuring customers are supported appropriately and the Board is determined that this will continue. More information on the Board oversight of our culture journey can be found on page 80 .\n\nThe values and standards of behaviour we set are an important guiding influence and, as I mentioned last year, we are determined to address and learn from historical failures, including those associated with HBOS Reading where we are committed to ensuring all those impacted are treated fairly and compensated appropriately.\n\nDiversity remains a priority from both a corporate and Board perspective. The Group was the first FTSE 100 company to set targets to increase both gender and ethnic diversity at senior levels, and implemented a Race Action plan to drive change. I am also keen to ensure the Board itself reflects diversity, not just gender or ethnic diversity but skills, experience, educational and professional background to provide the range of perspectives, insights and challenge needed to support good decisionmaking. Aligned to this I am pleased to say we meet the requirements of both the Hampton-Alexander Review and the Parker Review. Further detail on specific Board changes in the year can be found in our governance report on page 70 .\n\nIn summary I am confident that our new strategy and commitment to become a truly purpose-driven business will enhance the long-term future of the Group and benefit all our stakeholders. We have been playing our part in the national response to the pandemic and will continue to ensure the Group is at the heart of the UK recovery and Helping Britain Prosper.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRobin Budenberg\n\nChair\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Executive's review continued\n\n## Overview\n\n2021 was a year of continued delivery for the Group, with successful strategic execution, ongoing investment and continued franchise growth, enabling the Group to succeed in its customer focused ambitions set out in the Strategic Review 2021. This resulted in a solid financial performance, with continued business momentum and balance sheet growth. Given the Group's performance and strong capital position, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.33 pence per share, in line with our progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy and a share buyback of up to \u00a32.0 billion, marking 2021 as a very strong year of capital return to/uni00A0shareholders.\n\nDuring 2021 the Group focused on Helping Britain Recover, supporting customers and communities across the UK as they continued to deal with the pandemic. I am very proud of the positive impact that the Group was able to make. The dedication of colleagues and their ongoing support for customers, communities and businesses across the UK in these unique and challenging times is impressive. I would like to express my gratitude to all of our colleagues for their resilience, commitment and hard work throughout 2021.\n\n## 69pts\n\nOur digital channels have continued to perform well, attaining record levels of customer satisfaction with an all-channel net promoter score of 69 for the year.\n\nSince joining the Group in August 2021, I have been impressed by the Group's purpose-driven culture, real customer focus, its commitment to sustainability and diversity, as well as its disciplined risk management. Building on the Group's strong foundations and distinct competitive strengths, we are today launching our new strategy to deliver for all of our stakeholders, as detailed below. I very much look forward to working with my colleagues across the Group to drive our purpose, our growth opportunities and build higher, more sustainable Group returns and capital generation.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nIn the context of continued business momentum and balance sheet growth, the Group has delivered a solid financial performance with statutory profit after tax of \u00a35.9 billion, significantly higher than 2020. Increased profits benefitted from higher income and the net underlying impairment credit of \u00a31.2 billion in 2021 (2020: underlying impairment charge of \u00a34.2 billion), driven by improvements to the macroeconomic outlook for the UK, combined with robust observed credit performance. Underlying profit before impairment of \u00a36.8 billion was up 6 per cent on 2020, with increased average interest-earning assets, a strengthened banking net interest margin and early signs of recovery in other income, alongside a reduction in operating lease depreciation.\n\nCost discipline was sustained, with operating costs of \u00a37.6 billion, up 1 per cent compared to the prior year, including the impact of rebuilding variable pay in the context of stronger than expected financial performance. Remediation charges increased in the year to \u00a31,300 million, with \u00a3775 million in the fourth quarter. The/uni00A0full year remediation charges relate to a number of pre-existing legacy issues and include a \u00a3790 million charge relating to HBOS Reading which reflects the Group's estimate of its full liability, albeit significant uncertainties remain. We continue to support the independent Foskett Panel re-review and Dame Linda Dobbs' independent review process as we work to bring this matter to a conclusion.\n\nThe Group has benefitted from continued balance sheet growth during the year. Loans and advances to customers were up \u00a38.4 billion versus prior year at/uni00A0\u00a3448.6/uni00A0billion, driven by strong net growth in the open mortgage book of \u00a316.0 billion, the strongest in over a decade. Cards balances were down yearon-year but are showing signs of recovery with balances growing \u00a30.5 billion in the second half. These were offset by lower SME and Mid Corporate balances given clients' high levels of liquidity, as well as the continued reduction in the closed mortgage book. Customer deposits continued to increase during the year, with significant growth of \u00a325.6 billion since the end of 2020, including significant growth in retail current accounts and relationship savings balances, with continued inflows to our trusted brands. Deposit balances are now up c.\u00a365 billion since the end of 2019.\n\n## \u00a316bn\n\n+5.8%\n\nThe Group delivered net open book mortgage growth of \u00a316 billion during the year, the strongest in over a decade.\n\n## Strong progress made under Strategic Review 2021\n\nThe Group launched Strategic Review 2021 last February with a focus on Helping Britain Recover and further enhancing our core capabilities. We have invested c.\u00a30.9 billion to support our strategic initiatives, enabling us to succeed in our Helping Britain Recover commitments and achieving significant progress on our 2021 customer focused commitments. Highlights include strengthening our digital offering and attaining record levels of customer satisfaction, with the all-channel net promoter score maintained at 69 for the year; supporting over 93,000 start-ups and small businesses\u00b9, by providing our customers with online support, business advice and business banking accounts (target: 75,000); expanding the availability of affordable and quality homes by lending more than \u00a316 billion to over 80,000 first-time buyers (target: \u00a310 billion) and; expanding the funding available under the Group's discounted green finance initiatives from \u00a33 billion to \u00a35 billion.\n\n## \u00a35bn\n\nExpanded the funding available under the Group's discounted green finance initiatives from \u00a33 billion to \u00a35 billion.\n\nA further priority outlined in Strategic Review 2021 was for the Group to meet more of its customers' broader financial needs. Good progress was made, with over \u00a37 billion net new money in Insurance and Wealth open book Assets under Administration (AuA) over the period (\u00a3133 billion as at 31 December 2021). The/uni00A0Group also completed the acquisition of Embark early in 2022, contributing c.\u00a337 billion of AuA on behalf of c.354,000 consumer clients. This acquisition is important as it provides a digital, mass market, direct-to-consumer proposition, complementing the Group's existing advice offerings via Schroders Personal Wealth and Cazenove Capital.\n\nThe Group completes Strategic Review 2021 in a strong position.",

Core to our purpose and strategy is our focus on building an inclusive society and supporting the transition to a low carbon economy. This is where we can make the biggest difference, whilst creating new avenues for our future growth. It is only by doing right by our customers, colleagues and communities that we can achieve higher, more sustainable returns for/uni00A0shareholders.\n\nWe have a clear strategic vision to be a UK customer-focused digital leader and integrated financial services provider, capitalising on new opportunities, at scale. We will look to deepen relationships with our existing customers, both consumers and businesses of all sizes, and meet more of their financial needs by making our great products more relevant to them and our channels simpler and more personalised to use. This will set the Group on a higher growth trajectory with more diversified revenue streams while we retain our strong focus on cost and capital discipline. Enabled through maximising the potential of our dedicated people, technology and data capabilities, our strategy represents an exciting new chapter for Lloyds Banking Group.\n\nI am confident that the Group's purpose,/uni00A0customer focus, unique business model and significant competitive strengths, embodied in our ambitious strategy will ensure the Group is able to deliver higher, more sustainable long-term returns and capital generation for our shareholders, whilst meeting the needs of/uni00A0broader stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Building an inclusive society\n\n- \u00b7 Promoting financial inclusion and education\n- \u00b7 Improving access to quality housing\n- \u00b7 Enabling regional development\n- \u00b7 50 per cent female, 13 per cent Black, Asian and minority ethnic with 3 per cent Black heritage colleagues in senior roles by 2025\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic continues to have a significant impact on the people, businesses and communities of the UK and around the world. As we look forward into 2022, we are seeing early recovery and the macroeconomic outlook is improving, supported by the successful vaccine roll out in the UK. Although the outlook remains uncertain, particularly with regards to new virus variants, as well as the impact of inflation on the economy and households, I am confident that the Group is well-placed to deliver increased returns whilst Helping Britain Prosper, as embodied in our new strategy. This/uni00A0is/uni00A0reflected in the new guidance outlined below.\n\n## 2022 guidance\n\nReflecting confidence in the Group's business model and new strategy and based on our current macroeconomic assumptions, the Group now expects:\n\n- \u00b7 Operating costs of c.\u00a38.8 billion on the new basis, with the increase from the 2021 equivalent (\u00a38.3 billion) reflecting stable business-as-usual costs, incremental investment and new/uni00A0businesses\n- \u00b7 Banking net interest margin above 260/uni00A0basis points\n- \u00b7 Asset quality ratio to be c.20 basis points\n- \u00b7 Risk-weighted assets at the end of 2022 to be c.\u00a3210 billion\n- \u00b7 Return on tangible equity of c.10 per cent\n\n## Supporting the transition to a low carbon economy\n\n- \u00b7 Net zero own operations by 2030\n- \u00b7 Reduce carbon emissions we finance by more than 50 per cent by 2030, on the path to net zero by/uni00A02050 or sooner\n- \u00b7 Sustainability outcomes embedded across business priorities\n\n## 2024 and 2026 guidance\n\nBased on the Group's new strategy, reflecting focus on our growth potential, improved efficiency and realising the capabilities of our people, technology and data, the Group expects:\n\n- \u00b7 Additional revenues of c.\u00a30.7 billion by 2024 and more than double that of c.\u00a31.5 billion by 2026\n- \u00b7 Return on tangible equity in excess of 10/uni00A0per cent by 2024 and in excess of 12/uni00A0per cent by 2026, as the full benefits of our investment are realised\n- \u00b7 Business-as-usual costs flat in 2024 versus 2021, while costs increase only to finance new investment, enabling a cost:income ratio of less than 50 per cent by 2026\n- \u00b7 Capital generation of around 150 basis points per annum over 2022 to 2024, improving to 175 to 200 basis points by 2026.

Charlie Nunn joined the Group in August 2021 as our new Group Chief Executive, and shared his initial thoughts with the Board.\n\nWhilst our Group purpose of Helping Britain Prosper remains unchanged, the Board and the Executive Management team recognised that in order to further embed it at the heart of our strategy, we need to better articulate how it translates into the Group's strategy and how it drives our strategic decision-making through a compelling and active mission.\n\nDecember 2021 to February 2022\n\n2022 to 2024\n\nFollowing widespread engagement across the Group, our proposed mission, which provides the bridge between our purpose and strategy, was finalised with the Executive Management team and the Board to provide the guiding force for the/uni00A0organisation.\n\nStrategic priorities previously discussed were further refined based on the Board's feedback and developed into detailed strategic plans with measurable operating and financial metrics and targets which support our strategic aspirations for the next three years and beyond.\n\nThe Board reviewed the more detailed plan and final financial plan, placing particular emphasis on the effective management of the programme and the mitigation of potential execution risks. At the same time, a communication plan was developed with the Board's input, to ensure that all our stakeholders understand the role our purpose plays for/uni00A0the Group.\n\nThe Board and the Group Executive Committee will receive regular updates on delivery against strategic plans, with a monthly Strategic Delivery Forum established to ensure more detailed tracking of deliverables and milestones.\n\nOver the next few pages, we outline our purpose/uni00A0architecture, the evolving market trends and our new strategy.\n\nWe continued to develop our mission, engaging with colleagues representing different levels and functions of the Group through interactive sessions. We also tested our ideas with a number of personal and business customers, to ensure our mission was relevant and helped us meet their expectations.\n\nWith our purpose and mission shaping the developing strategy, emerging business visions were formulated together with key strategic choices. These were reviewed and discussed with the Board who provided input on the Group's future shape. More detailed initiatives were subsequently presented in the context of investment prioritisation and the Group's longer-term financial plan.",

Longerterm societal challenges remain: acceleration to net zero; inadequate retirement saving; lack of advice at retirement; growing intergenerational wealth transfer; increasing wealth concentration; lack of affordable homes and a long-term increase in private renting; and maintaining access to cash and banking services for vulnerable customers and the 11 million people in the UK lacking essential digital skills. These underline the role we have in supporting our customers' financial lives with our unique, broad business model.\n\nThe experience of the past two years has accelerated customer trends that will persist. Customers' use of digital channels has increased, particularly for small businesses, with increasing expectations for convenience, speed, and relevance shaped by frictionless experiences outside of financial services.\n\nNevertheless, we see customers continuing to value human support for complex financial needs, such as longterm financial planning. We also continue to see our highest-value customers using human support. Therefore, there is a compelling case for an all-channel distribution model.\n\nBusinesses are increasingly turning to digital ecosystem solutions, seeking propositions that simplify operations and that seamlessly integrate their financial services into their processes such as accounting and payroll. Younger customers have shown increasing willingness to try new financial services, such as buy-nowpay-later and higher risk investments, influenced by new forms of social media. These trends illustrate the need to provide highly integrated financial service experiences, as well as the importance of the role of trusted brands in guiding customers in an increasingly fragmented digital financial services market.\n\n## Our response\n\nIn 2021, we have continued to provide support to our personal and business customers, including repayment holidays and government-backed loan schemes for businesses. Our colleagues have provided our customers good access to banking services, despite operational challenges and heightened customer need, with dedicated phone lines and additional support for vulnerable customers in place.\n\nWe have significantly increased our funding support for social housing, while also exceeding our mortgage lending target for first-time buyers by over \u00a36 billion. Similarly, we have continued to support UK businesses in improving productivity and in achieving a sustainable recovery through a combination of digital skills training, mentoring and increased funding available under green finance initiatives.\n\nInvestment in our digital proposition continues to improve the experience of both our personal and business customers by modernising our technology architecture, with a focus on improving system resilience and efficiency, and responsiveness to fast evolving customer expectations. Consequently, our mobile apps are consistently rated ahead of our competitors by customers across 2021, with Lloyds Bank, Halifax and BoS all ranked in the top four on both Google Play and App Store. Similarly, our dual focus on improving our digital proposition and providing digital skills training has resulted in SME products originated via a digital source increasing by c.60 per cent year-on-year, exceeding our target.\n\nWe have invested in payments capability, successfully maintaining a market-leading share in card spending for personal customers and delivering a three-fold increase in the number of corporate clients onboarded to the new cash management and payments platform year-on-year.\n\nWe are uniquely positioned to serve our customers' lifetime banking, insurance and wealth needs in one place through a comprehensive product range. With ever increasing competition, we are investing in data capabilities to personalise and deepen our customer relationships and meet a broader range of needs, whilst ensuring we face the ethical considerations posed by new data uses. With this focus and our recent acquisition of the fast-growing investment and retirement platform Embark, we have increased our public target for net customer flows into our Insurance and Wealth business.\n\n## Change in Channel Usage versus 2016\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Card spend versus cash withdrawals\n\nIndexed 2017\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Includes credit and debit card spend.\n\n## Link to principal risks\n\nChange/execution, Data, Conduct, Credit, Operational resilience",

New business models based around ecosystems and networks are new sources of scale, enabled by a supportive regulatory environment and next-gen technology such as cloud and APIs.\n\nBanks have reduced branch networks in 2021, adapting to changing customer usage, and have made significant investment in technology to respond to new competition and to meet increasing customer expectations. Investment in data capability remains important, using insights to gain a better customer understanding and to deliver more personalised customer interactions. For banks with significant data assets, this represents a potential competitive benefit, as well as an integral responsibility in safeguarding this data against cyber threats. Deployment of new technology to automate manual processes and improve defences against fraud has allowed both customer experience enhancements and efficiency savings.\n\nBeyond this, the sector is increasing investment in new technologies that have the potential to transform customer offerings and deliver a step-change in efficiency, from the migration and simplification of legacy systems to the creation of new cloud-based architecture. While many of these initiatives are in their infancy and pose significant challenges in execution, successful adoption has the potential to deliver highly innovative customer propositions with a significantly reduced time to market, as well as a highly scalable, resilient and agile technology architecture at a significantly lower cost.\n\n## Our response\n\nThe Group continues to see significant value in its all-channel distribution model, maintaining a wide branch footprint to support our customers in accessing the channel of their choice.\n\nIn 2021 we have improved digital capabilities for both personal customers and commercial clients, adding features that our customers value such as variable contactless card limits. We have also been able to bring these to market more frequently than ever before, with mobile app releases increasing 1.8 times year-on-year. Importantly, despite the significant volume and pace of change this has not been at the expense of customer experience, with our record all-channel net promoter score maintained in 2021.\n\nWe are investing in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve customer and colleague experience, and to drive operational efficiencies through automation. This enables our colleagues to focus on more complex, value-adding tasks to better support our customers. Advanced analytics deployment is improving fraud detection rates, a growing challenge in a more digital world. We have significantly increased investment in improving our use of data, with a more customer-centric view enabling us to identify customer needs more quickly and effectively, for example in better identifying and meeting more of our customers' banking and insurance needs.\n\nWe continue to explore the potential of new technology architecture, supported by strategic partnerships, and in 2021 we increased investment in this area to assess these capabilities and opportunities. This included the safe migration of around 120,000 back book customer accounts in a pilot of new bank architecture, providing a proof-point for our investment and to build confidence in our ability to utilise new cloud-based architecture.\n\nIn 2022, and beyond, the Group remains focused on delivering improvements for customers and colleagues, with increased investment levels enabled by our continuing focus on efficiency, to improve our competitive positioning and deliver sustainable shareholder returns.\n\n## Customers are using the digital channel for simpler needs\n\n% volume of products originated digitally\n\n## 84%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2021 1   |   84 |\n|----------|------|\n| 2020 1   |   85 |\n| 2019 1   |   75 |\n| 2018 1   |   73 |\n| 2017     |   68 |\n| 2016     |   61 |\n| 2015     |   54 |\n| 2014     |   40 |\n\n- 1 Data includes MBNA data from 2018 onwards.\n\n## Online spend (transaction volumes)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Link to principal risks\n\nChange/execution, Conduct, Data, Model, Operational, Operational resilience, People",

        "page_content": "## Our strategy continued\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -  Given our focus on UK customers, the Group's prospects are closely linked to developments in the UK economy\n- -  The economic outlook remains uncertain, dependent on success of vaccines and treatments for emerging variants of COVID-19 in allowing a return to pre-pandemic patterns of household spending, and in resolving current disruption to global supply chains\n- -  We expect the UK economy to grow by 3.7 per cent in 2022 after a weak turn of the year, and return to pre-pandemic growth in 2023 at 1.5 per cent\n\n## Overview\n\nUK GDP grew by over 7 per cent in 2021, but recovery from the pandemic-driven 9/uni00A0per cent drop in 2020 was incomplete.\n\n'Lockdown' measures at the start of 2021 were largely removed by mid-year, but household spending has returned more slowly towards its pre-pandemic level. The emergence of the Omicron COVID-19 variant in late November resulted in the imposition of 'Plan B' restrictions during December in England and some further restrictions on household mixing elsewhere in the UK. Unemployment was, however, held down by the government's furlough scheme, and at 4.1 per cent in December after scheme closure was just 0.3 percentage points higher than prepandemic. Inflation, on the other hand, has risen recently to its highest in three decades and is likely to rise further by the second quarter of 2022. Disrupted global supply chains have struggled to match consumers' high demand for goods as spend has been diverted from services; energy prices jumped sharply due to supply disruptions and the labour force size has been reduced by elevated early retirement and sickness, and some return of EU citizens to their homelands.\n\nUK GDP is expected to recover further in 2022, despite mild pandemic-related restrictions in January and household spending squeezed by high inflation. The strength of further recovery depends crucially on the degree to which COVID-19 vaccines and treatments allow a return to pre-pandemic spending patterns. It will also depend on how much improving global production capacity and domestic labour supply might start to reduce high inflation, and how rapidly interest rates may have to rise to help ensure that inflation falls back towards its target level.\n\nOur forecast of 3.7 per cent UK GDP growth in 2022 assumes no further 'lockdowns', that elevated inflation will begin to fall gradually during the second half of the year, and that interest rates will rise only mildly above their pre-pandemic level. There is a high degree of uncertainty around those assumptions, however.\n\nThe pandemic has also increased uncertainty for the longer-term economic outlook, adding to existing uncertainties stemming from new business processes and costs resulting from Brexit, and impacts of climate change. Deeply unequal societal impacts of the COVID-19 recession, and the current period of elevated inflation, might provoke large changes to taxation and benefits policies.\n\n## Market dynamics\n\nThe very unusual depth of recession and recovery, together with new types of government support, the furlough scheme and lending guarantees for businesses, for example, have resulted in unusual trends in our markets across 2020 and 2021.\n\nRestricted spending opportunities, but incomes supported by furlough, has driven households' deposits to rise by a further 7.4 per cent in 2021 after 9.9/uni00A0per cent in 2020. Recovery in consumer credit began only in the second half of the year, market balances are estimated to have fallen a further 1 per cent in 2021 overall after their 9.5 per cent fall in 2020. However, the strength of deposits and falling consumer credit payments provided resources to support house purchases, encouraged by the temporary stamp duty holiday and shifting preferences for space and location due to the pandemic. As a result, house prices have risen strongly, increasing almost 10/uni00A0per cent in 2021 after a rise of 5 per cent in 2020, and mortgage market balances growth accelerated to 5.1 per cent in 2021, its strongest since 2008.\n\nBusinesses' borrowing and deposits market volumes have also performed very differently to previous recessions. Lending guarantee schemes have driven a strong rise in SME lending and deposit market balances, unlike falls in previous recessions. Non-financial corporate deposits rose by a further 5.0 per cent in 2021 after increasing 28.3 per cent in 2020, and lending balances are estimated to have fallen by only close to 1 per cent in 2021 after a strong 9.3 per cent rise in/uni00A02020.\n\nIf the economy does gradually return much closer to pre-pandemic conditions through 2022, then these abnormal trends in our markets should begin to unwind. Households' deposit accumulation will slow and consumer credit rise, as household spending gets closer to prepandemic levels, with disposable incomes under pressure from inflation.\n\nThe housing market is expected to quieten now stamp duty has returned to its normal rate, and as interest rates rise, we expect broadly flat house prices in 2022. Businesses are likely to begin to use some of their deposits to pay down some of the large increase in borrowing now that interest is becoming payable and the worst point of the economic crisis appears to have passed. We expect businesses' deposits to fall slightly in 2022, and their lending balances to rise only slightly, although that aggregate masks a significant fall expected for SME lending balances and a return to more normal rates of growth for borrowing by large companies.\n\n## Our response\n\nGiven our UK focus, the Group's prospects are closely linked to the performance of the UK economy. Our disciplined approach to risk, stable business model and focus on efficiency positions us well to continue to support customers irrespective of macro conditions.\n\n## UK economic growth\n\nGDP growth\n\n## 7.5%\n\n|   2021 |   7.5 |\n|--------|-------|\n|   2020 |  -9.4 |\n|   2019 |   1.7 |\n|   2018 |   1.7 |\n|   2017 |   2.1 |\n\nOffice for National Statistics\n\n## UK housing market\n\nHouse price growth (Dec versus.

The largest neo-banks have scaled to compete with long-established banks, due to strong digital functionality and high levels of customer satisfaction. Despite this, financial sustainability remains unproven for most. Indeed, those that have started to highlight emerging signs of profitability have tended to mirror more traditional banking models. Nevertheless, digital-only providers continue to disaggregate the traditional vertically integrated banking business model by targeting the most profitable elements with innovative new propositions and attracting significant valuations (for example buy-now-pay-later).\n\nLarge international peers have also entered the UK market through new digital-only brands, with UK entry a likely precursor to broader international expansion aims. While these businesses are currently in their infancy with limited product offerings, there is scope to significantly scale these businesses and provide a competitive offering over the longer term, supported by significant investment budgets.\n\nTraditional UK bank competitors have refocused on core business areas and improving their digital offerings. More diversified peers have delivered higher revenues during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to those with a greater gearing towards net interest income, although an improving rate outlook is likely to support these business models. Peers have also continued to accelerate restructuring exercises to offset revenue headwinds, including significant reductions in branch/uni00A0numbers.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur strong franchise, combined with ongoing focus on innovation, provides us with the ability to retain customer relevance and respond to changing expectations. Our all-channel, trusted brands and integrated model provides customers choice in how to interact with our services. While the usage of physical channels is reducing, they remain important for many of our customers and are a valuable channel for building trust and deepening customer relationships. We continue to respond to changing customer expectations and preferences, enhancing our functionality and increasing our speed to market, and maintaining our position as the largest UK digital bank.\n\nOur extensive customer offering as the UK's only integrated financial services provider is a compelling, competitive proposition which we continue to enhance, delivering holistic solutions in areas such as Insurance and Wealth management, alongside our traditional Retail and Commercial Banking activities. This includes the growth of our wealth joint-venture, Schroders Personal Wealth, as well as the acquisition of Embark. These businesses enhance our existing capabilities and allow us to meet more of our customers' broader financial needs.\n\nWe remain cognisant of the evolving competitive environment and recognise that we must continue to build on and develop our competitive strengths, through diversification of our business, expanding our offering to customers and capturing new growth opportunities.\n\n## Link to principal risks\n\nConduct, Operational, Regulatory and legal, Strategic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -  Addressing climate change and societal challenges requires urgent action\n- -  Stakeholders expect companies to play their role in developing a more sustainable and inclusive world\n- -  This is fully aligned with our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper and our strategy\n\n## Market dynamics\n\nThere is an expectation that companies help address broader societal and environmental challenges. The pandemic has accelerated this shift in expectations by exposing inequalities in our society but also demonstrating what we can achieve as a society if we work together. Similarly there is a growing urgency to tackle the global climate challenge. It is not only customers or society more broadly who demand action from companies to respond to these challenges, it is also our colleagues, shareholders and other stakeholders who recognise the role we can play in effecting change.\n\n## Our response\n\nWith our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper, we recognise we have a responsibility to help address the economic, social and environmental challenges the UK faces. As one of the largest UK financial institutions we are in a unique position to drive change.\n\nIn line with our commitments, to Help Britain Recover, we have in 2021, for example, helped over 193,000 small businesses to boost their digital capability, expanded the availability of quality and affordable homes by lending over \u00a316/uni00A0billion to first-time buyers, and supported the transition to low carbon by expanding the funding available under our discounted green finance initiatives from \u00a33/uni00A0billion to \u00a35 billion.\n\nWe believe that responding more actively to society's key challenges is the right thing to do and an important enabler to building a better business and delivering higher, more sustainable returns to our shareholders. Our purpose forms the basis of our new strategy, including a strong focus on environmental and social topics, creating value for all of our stakeholders.\n\n## Link to principal risks\n\nCapital, Climate, Conduct, Credit, Market, Operational, Operational resilience, People, Regulatory and legal",

Based on our capabilities versus our current customer engagement, there is significant potential for us to grow by meeting more of our existing customers' needs. Our relationship-led business should be the first place that customers in our priority segments turn to for all their financial needs across their lifetime.\n\n## Deepen and innovate in Consumer relationships\n\nWe will protect and grow our existing franchise by continuing to improve our offering in core product areas to maintain our leading market shares. In addition, we will further enhance and optimise our/uni00A0unsecured lending proposition to capture spend normalisation and drive balance growth.\n\n## Drive revenue growth and diversification\n\n## Why this is important\n\nGrowth is a core focus of our strategy.

Whilst we have a leading proposition and market share in mortgages, there are opportunities to significantly leverage our scale to grow in under-represented intermediary products such as motor finance, home insurance, protection, individual pensions and investments. By making it easier for intermediaries to do business with us, the Group can deliver high quality products and services to all customer segments via reliable, low-friction, intermediated customer journeys. We will look to emulate our success in workplace pensions where we have grown market share from 10 per cent to 19 per cent since 2017.\n\n## Innovate and broaden\n\n## our intermediary propositions\n\nWe will protect and grow our franchise to maintain our leading intermediary market shares with our specialist brands and partnerships with major distributors. In addition, we will strengthen our intermediary insurance offering to capture market share as we aim to become a top three protection provider by 2025.\n\nWe will deliver new platforms and propositions, including by embracing embedded finance propositions. Our intermediary proposition will build upon Embark's modern digital platform and contribute towards our target of generating more than \u00a355 billion of new open book net flows in long term investments and retirement products by 2024. We will differentiate our offering to capture value by innovating to develop new propositions such as a transport offering with more flexible finance solutions, with expanded manufacturer partnerships and services, and scaling Citra Living, our private rental housing/uni00A0business.\n\n## Opportunity for intermediary market share growth, %\n\nLBG intermediary market share\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2024 outcomes\n\n## >\u00a355bn\n\nnew Assets under Administration Investment and retirement open book net flows\u00b9\n\n## Top 3\n\nProtection provider by 2025\n\n## \u00a320bn-25bn\n\nInvested in climate-aware investment strategies\u00b2 through Scottish Widows by/uni00A02025\n\n## \u00a38bn\n\nFinancing and leasing for Electric Vehicles and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles\n\n- 1 Includes long-term savings and excludes Embark day one contribution of c.\u00a337bn, longstanding, unbundled investment only pensions, Cazenove and legacy Private Banking Trusts.\n- 2 Pre-defined funds that have an in-built bias or tilt towards companies that are transitioning their business models to be less carbonintensive and/or developing climate solutions.\n\n## Create a new mass affluent offering\n\n## Strong platform for growth\n\nMass affluent is an attractive and currently under-served segment of the market.

The Group is uniquely placed to do this. It starts with the largest mass affluent customer base in the UK of more than two million customers through its banking relationships and a complete product range at scale.\n\n## Opportunity to expand in growing mass affluent market\n\nWe intend to focus on the broader pool of mass affluent customers with income or wealth above \u00a375,000, with a scale digital offering and integrated banking solution.

It is a top three player across key purpose aligned sectors such as agriculture, real estate and healthcare. With a strong 20 per cent primary relationship market share of SMEs, we have an important role to play in driving growth in priority areas and regions, lifting UK productivity, supporting start-ups, growing quality jobs and supporting our clients on key issues, including sustainability.\n\n## Opportunity to meet more client needs with a digital-first model\n\nWe have scope to build a more diversified earnings base and grow our market share in other trading sectors and meet more of our customers' non term-lending and transactional needs. Our strong set of relevant transaction banking products and more than 1,000 relationship and product specialists across the UK, provides a firm foundation for growth.\n\nTo deliver our vision we must further build our digital SME banking capability. We need to digitise front-to-back to improve client experience and enable clients to conveniently and quickly self-serve and meet their day-to-day needs. This is essential given changing client expectations, increasing digital engagement and competition. In conjunction, we need to selectively build out key products like asset finance, invoice discounting, trade, merchant acquiring and e-commerce solutions. These are important relationship anchors in which we are currently underweight. For example, in merchant acquiring, where volumes are growing around 20 per cent year-on-year, where we have a c.5 per cent market share today.\n\n## Drive revenue growth and diversification continued\n\n## Business priorities\n\nWe will deliver a digital customer offering which caters to the growing preference for data enriched digitised service channels, with relationship managers focused on complex needs, delivering value for our customers and the Group.

The business has a significant role in delivering the Group's purpose, including contributing to regional development and transition to net zero. We have strong core capabilities in cash, debt and risk management products, such as transaction banking, lending and interest rate risk management. In addition, our Corporate and Institutional offering has important synergies with the broader Group, providing product capabilities such as foreign exchange and rates management to our Consumer and SME franchises, and generating \u00a30.5 billion of relationship income from Corporate and Institutional clients' use of the Group's motor, insurance and pension propositions.\n\n## Opportunity to strengthen a core business with focus on UK-linked clients\n\nIn recent years, we have improved returns and generated material capital for the Group through disciplined participation and optimisation. Maintaining our current prudent risk appetite, we can now significantly build on this to grow in key sectors aligned to our purpose and areas where we have deep capability. By enhancing our capabilities and sector coverage, there is significant headroom to grow other operating income as a proportion of total income by meeting more of our existing clients' needs. This is illustrated by our proportion of other operating income being 18 percentage points lower than top quartile peers.\n\n## Business priorities\n\nWe will strengthen our cash, debt and risk management offering with product enhancements in transaction banking, debt financing and targeted markets investments. We will drive growth and value from our new cash management and payments platform by continuing to build on the three-fold increase in corporate clients onboarded to the platform in 2021. Within transaction banking we will also launch a new supply chain proposition this year. Within debt financing, to meet the needs of our UK clients we will provide an expanded US dollar franchise and continue to invest in our foreign exchange and rates management capabilities. As we fulfil our clients' borrowing needs, we will increase our balance sheet velocity and capital efficiency through a scaled originate-to-distribute model.\n\nOur selective participation means that we are not looking to expand into regions where we do not have sufficient scale, capability or a clear UK link. Also, we will not participate outside of our core cashdebt-risk management capabilities.\n\nWe will maintain our disciplined sector focus, continuing to drive our purpose outcomes by supporting goals such as regional development and building our leading green financing capability to support more clients with their transition/uni00A0plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2024 outcomes\n\n\u00a315bn\n\nSustainable financing\u00b9\n\nTop 5\n\nGBP interest rate swaps ranking; deepen/uni00A0FX share of wallet\n\n>20%\n\nGrowth in other operating income\n\n## <\u00a33bn\n\nNet risk-weighted asset growth\n\n- 1 Includes Clean Growth Finance Initiative, Commercial Real Estate Green Lending, Renewable Energy Financing, Sustainability linked Loans and Green, ESG and Social Bond facilitation.

The Board's understanding of stakeholders' interests is central to these responsibilities, and informs key aspects of Board decisionmaking.\n\nAcknowledging the breadth of the Group's stakeholders and the size of the organisation, stakeholder engagement takes place at a number of levels.\n\nIn addition to direct engagement by members of the Board, the Board considers the stakeholder impacts of all proposals submitted to it from across the Group. Stakeholder interests are central to the Board's delegation of the management of the business to the Executive. Additional page references are included within each key decision to examples of action taken by the Executive under this delegation.\n\nIn turn the Executive, including the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, routinely provide the Board with details of non-Board stakeholder interaction and feedback from across the wider Group, through their regular business updates. Stakeholder interests are also identified by the Executive for consideration in all other proposals put to the Board.\n\nInteraction has again mostly been undertaken virtually this year where necessary, in compliance with the government's COVID-19 requirements.\n\n## Section 172(1) statement\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), the Directors provide this statement describing how they have had regard to the matters set out in section 172(1) of the Act, when performing their duty to promote the success of the Company under section 172. Further details on key actions are also contained within the Corporate Governance Report on pages 70 to 133 .\n\nThe Directors remain mindful in all their deliberations of the long-term consequences of their decisions, as well as the importance of the Group maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct and the Board engaging with, and taking account of the views of, key stakeholders.\n\n## Key stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Non-Executive Directors undertook an engagement programme which allowed them to hear directly from customers, clients and colleagues, to help understand what matters in their lives, the role the Group plays in supporting them and how the Group is performing in that regard. A range of activities took place, which will extend into 2022, including meeting with customers, attending client visits and sitting with colleagues to understand the Group's culture and discuss future ways of working. The NonExecutive Directors found these sessions to be of great benefit, giving many valuable insights which they take account of, as appropriate, in their decisionmaking.\n\n## Board meetings and activity in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Responsible Business Committee reports regularly to the Board on all of its activities, including colleague engagement.\n\nThe Board will continue to consider its arrangements in engagement with the Group's workforce to ensure the arrangements remain effective and continue to give a meaningful understanding of the views of the workforce and to encourage dialogue between the Board and the workforce.\n\nExamples of Board engagement included:\n\n- \u00b7 Consideration by the Responsible Business Committee of regular workforce engagement updates, covering key themes raised by colleagues, trends on people matters and updates on colleague sentiment\n- \u00b7 A further annual report summarising engagement activity, key themes and issues raised during the year\n\n## Investors\n\nThe Group has the largest shareholder base in the UK, with around 2.3 million shareholders including most of our employees, and is committed to understanding the needs and expectations of all shareholders, both private and institutional.

In addition, we further increased customer satisfaction in our multichannel model, with our record allchannel net promoter score of 69 points. This was made possible by continued improvements to our customer journeys while maintaining a wide branch footprint. We further enhanced our payments experience by launching new features, including subscription management tools and seamless integrations with Click to Pay, enabling a quicker and easier online checkout experience.\n\nEnhancing our wealth offering is a core element of our customer ambitions. We delivered over \u00a37 billion net new open book AuA in Insurance and Wealth. We announced the acquisition of Embark, a fast-growing investment and retirement platform business, with assets under administration of around \u00a337 billion, on behalf of c.354,000 customers.\n\nStrategic Review 2021 identified four capabilities/uni00A0that are critical to sustainable success: technology, payments, data and ways of/uni00A0working.

Our inclusion and diversity performance remains a critical focus area for the Group.\n\n## Ethnic diversity\n\nOur aim is to increase the ethnic diversity of our workforce and unlock the potential of our Black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues. We have a Race Action Plan to help us meet our goals. We have set aspirations to increase representation of Black, Asian and minority ethnic colleagues to 13 per cent at senior management levels, and increase Black heritage representation in senior roles to at least 3 per cent by 2025, aligning with the overall UK labour market. Leading from the top, the Board exceeded the Parker review recommendation of at least/uni00A0one Black, Asian or minority ethnic Board member.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\nWe champion gender equality through promoting a strong pipeline of executive female talent for the future. In 2021, we set new aspirations for a leadership team that reflects the society we serve, of 50 per cent women in senior roles by 2025. Our Board is committed to maintaining at least three female Board members and over time will aim to reach 50 per cent male and female representation on the Board to match the ambition that the Group has set for female senior executives. Reflecting these aspirations, the Board will aim to meet any recommendations set out by the FTSE Women Leaders review (formerly the Hampton-Alexander Review).\n\n## Sexual orientation and gender identity\n\nWe are proud to have created an inclusive and open working environment for our LGBT+ colleagues, and our LGBT+ colleague network, Rainbow, plays a pivotal role in our approach in supporting our LGBT+ colleagues, with over 5,000 members and supporters.\n\n## Supporting disability\n\nThe Group has the ambition of supporting our colleagues with disabilities and long-term health conditions to be the best that they can be, and to be valued for who they are. The Group holds the Business Disability Forum Gold Standard accreditation, and has retained Disability Confident status from the Department for Work and Pensions.\n\nThe Group offers bespoke training, career development and adjustments for colleagues and applicants with disabilities, including those who became disabled while employed.\n\n## Colleague engagement\n\nThe Group understands that engagement is a two-way process, so each year we ask colleagues to share their views via our independently run colleague surveys. We conducted our Pulse survey early in 2021 during which we identified that colleagues felt their wellbeing continued to be supported by the Group and their leaders.\n\nOur annual autumn survey was completed by 71 per cent of the Group and this survey also allowed colleagues to directly inform the future strategy of the Group with more than 44,000 comments about the areas for future focus.\n\n## Our inclusion and diversity performance\n\nDespite lower engagement in 2021, we have seen an increase in overall mood linked to better work-life balance, good teamwork and strong manager capabilities. The Financial Services Culture Board (FSCB) assessment also showed that on many metrics we performed better when compared to pre-pandemic levels, but had not retained the high scores of 2021; indeed the FSCB noted that the 'COVID glow' had faded across their respondents in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information related to our progress on our inclusion and diversity focus areas, societal initiatives and our Race Action Plan can be found in our 2021 ESG Report. www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/ responsible-business/downloads\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Gender                                                                            |                                                                                   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Board members                                                                     | Male                                                                              | 6      | 8      |\n|                                                                                   | Female                                                                            | 4      | 4      |\n| GEC and GEC direct reports                                                        | Male                                                                              | 78     | 86     |\n|                                                                                   | Female                                                                            | 42     | 41     |\n| Senior managers                                                                   | Male                                                                              | 4,368  | 4,540  |\n|                                                                                   | Female                                                                            | 2,640  | 2,670  |\n| Colleagues                                                                        | Male                                                                              | 27,216 | 28,948 |\n|                                                                                   | Female                                                                            | 37,256 | 39,817 |\n| Ethnicity                                                                         |                                                                                   |        |        |\n| % of Board members from an minority ethnic  background                            | % of Board members from an minority ethnic  background                            | 20%    | 8.3%   |\n| % of senior managers from an minority ethnic  background                          | % of senior managers from an minority ethnic  background                          | 8.8%   | 7.7%   |\n| % of colleagues from an minority ethnic background                                | % of colleagues from an minority ethnic background                                | 11.3%  | 10.6%  |\n| Disability                                                                        | Disability                                                                        |        |        |\n| % of colleagues who disclose that they have a disability                          | % of colleagues who disclose that they have a disability                          | 3.7%   | 3.2%   |\n| Sexual orientation                                                                | Sexual orientation                                                                |        |        |\n| % of colleagues who disclose that they are lesbian, gay,  bisexual or transgender | % of colleagues who disclose that they are lesbian, gay,  bisexual or transgender | 2.5%   | 2.3%   |\n\nAll data as at 31 December 2021.

The transition will require transformation of every sector at scale.\n\nWe want to play our part in supporting the transition and support the aims of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, the UK Government's net zero target, the Ten Point Plan for the Green Industrial Revolution and\n\n## Progress against TCFD recommendations\n\nWe have been continually making progress against the TCFD recommendations and enhancing our climate-related financial disclosures since our 2018 Annual Report and Accounts. We comply with the FCA's Listing Rule 9.8.6R(8) and make disclosures consistent with the 2017 TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures across all four of the TCFD pillars: Strategy; Governance; Risk Management; and Metrics and Targets.\n\nWe will continue to assess and develop our disclosures against the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures in 2022, taking into account relevant TCFD guidance and materials and/uni00A0evolving best practice. Key areas of focus in 2022 include:\n\n## Strategy\n\n- \u00b7 We explored the resilience of our credit portfolios under three different climate scenarios as a result of our participation in the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES), as well as undertaking other internal activity developing initial quantitative insight\n\nthe Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. Supporting an effective transition is a priority for us and an integral part of our new strategy. Our Board is fully engaged in key decisions and ensuring continued progress. We have prioritised our activities around net zero ambitions associated with achieving net zero in our own operations by 2030 and for the activities of those we finance by 2050, with/uni00A0interim ambitions set for 2030.\n\nOur priority areas are greening the built environment, supporting the energy transition, low carbon transportation, sustainable farming and natural capital, and sustainable investments and pensions. These form a fundamental part of our overall approach to net zero and represent where we see the greatest challenge and opportunity to help accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy for the UK. Our ambitions and priority areas are underpinned by four pillars of our sustainability strategy that will help us to achieve our ambitions in a manner that engages the whole of our organisation and across our wider stakeholder network.\n\nAs signatories to Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), we have committed to setting sector-based ambitions across our highest emitting sectors. We have now published ambitions covering Power, Thermal Coal, Oil and Gas and Retail (motor) vehicles.\n\nWe will report additional sector ambitions in 2022 for parts of our remaining carbonintensive sectors, including residential mortgages, transportation and automotive activity beyond Retail (motor) vehicles.\n\nfor key sectors. We will undertake further climate scenario analysis in 2022 that leverages learnings from the CBES exercise and access to improved data and analytical capabilities. This will allow us to better understand the resilience of the Group's business model to climate risks. In particular, the aim is to support the development of new business plans and sector ambitions to achieve the Group's net zero ambitions and to examine the resilience of these to/uni00A0physical and transition risks.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\n- \u00b7 We have developed metrics to assess climate-related risks and opportunities that include current and projected financed emissions, emissions intensity, sustainable finance and sectors with increased climate risk (exposure, limit, maturity). We have evolved our Group Balanced Scorecard so that it now includes two ESG measures that are aligned to climate change to reflect our net zero ambitions. The additional climate scenario analysis we will conduct in 2022 will lead to enhancements to the physical and transition risk assessment of our high carbon sectors and clients within these that will allow for improved management information and reporting\n\nWe will also develop further ambitions and a transition plan in accordance with the timelines stipulated by the NZBA. Our sector ambitions for our banking activities complements our Scottish Widows Climate Action Plan, which covers our approach for our/uni00A0investing activity through Scottish Widows.\n\nOur new strategy includes a number of specific outcomes that will help finance the transition of our customers, with \u00a310/uni00A0billion of green mortgage lending by 2024, \u00a38/uni00A0billion financing and leasing for electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles by 2024, and \u00a315 billion sustainable financing for corporate and institutional clients by 2024, and \u00a320-25 billion in climate-aware investment strategies through Scottish Widows by 2025. In-year targets are part of the 2022 Group balanced scorecard, supplementing the measure on reducing our own operational carbon emissions.\n\nWe will continue to identify, manage and disclose material sustainability and climate-related risks and opportunities and their impact on the Group, in line with the TCFD recommendations. A/uni00A0high-level summary of our disclosure aligned to the TCFD recommendations is provided below. Further detailed information can be found in our 2021 Climate Report, a supplement to our Annual Report which enables the Group to provide comprehensive reporting of our climate strategy and risk management activities in alignment with the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures. www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-weare/responsible-business/downloads\n\nto the Board as/uni00A0well as NZBA sector target setting.\n\n- \u00b7 We have developed ambitions to achieve net zero for our own operations by 2030 and for the activities of those we finance by 2050, with interim ambitions set for 2030. We have also developed 2030 ambitions for our operational energy, water and waste and an initial set of our highest emitting sectors. We are on track to disclose further ambitions for high emitting sectors in line with our NZBA commitments, along with a net zero transition plan that further communicates our/uni00A0decarbonisation strategy.\n- \u00b7 We have disclosed our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions for our own operations, along with our initial Scope 3 financed emissions for most of our banking and Scottish Widows activity. Our future focus will be on disclosing our Scope 3 supply chain emissions and extending the coverage of Scope 3 financed emissions by including additional asset classes where methodologies exist and engaging across the industry on/uni00A0calculation approaches for asset classes where methods do not exist.",

It enables proactive identification, active management and monitoring of the Group's risks, which is supported by our One Risk and Control Self-Assessment approach.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite, principles, policies, procedures, controls and reporting are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain fully in line with regulation, law, corporate governance and industry good practice.\n\nThe Board is responsible for approving the Group's Board risk appetite statement annually. Board-level risk appetite metrics are augmented by further sub-Board level metrics and cascaded into more detailed business metrics and limits. Regular close monitoring and comprehensive reporting to all levels of management and the Board ensures appetite limits are maintained and subject to stress analysis at a risk type and portfolio level, as appropriate.\n\nGovernance is maintained through delegation of authority from the Board down to individuals. Senior executives are supported by a committee-based structure which is designed to ensure open challenge and enable effective Board engagement and decision-making.\n\n## Enterprise risk management framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on the Board's responsibilities can be found on page 86 and our Risk committees on pages 138 to/uni00A0140 .\n\n## Risk culture and the customer\n\nFollowing the successful transition between the previous, interim and new Group Chief Executives, a transparent risk culture continues to resonate across the organisation and is supported by the Board and its tone from the top.\n\nRisk management requires all colleagues to play their part, with individuals taking responsibility for their actions. The Group aims to support this through ongoing investment in infrastructure and developing colleagues' capabilities.\n\nSenior management articulate the core risk values to which the Group aspires, based on the Group's prudent business model and approach to risk management with the Board's guidance.\n\nAs a Group, we are open, honest and transparent with colleagues working in collaboration with business areas to:\n\n- \u00b7 Share lessons learned and understand root causes when things go wrong\n- \u00b7 Support effective risk management and provide constructive challenge\n- \u00b7 Consider horizon risks and opportunities\n\nThe Group aims to maintain a strong focus on building and sustaining long-term relationships with customers through the economic cycle.\n\n## Connectivity of risks and our strategic risk management framework\n\nCOVID-19 has demonstrated how individual risks in aggregate, through their interconnectivity, can place significant pressure on the Group's strategy, business model and performance.\n\nIn response to these unprecedented events, a new strategic risk management framework was approved.\n\nExtensive work has been undertaken in 2021 to build a deeper analytical understanding of the Group's key strategic risk themes and risk connectivity. The Group is committed to advancing these capabilities in 2022, while further integrating strategic risk into Group-wide business planning, placing it at the heart of our strategic priorities and Group-wide risk management.\n\nThe following pages outline:\n\n- \u00b7 A deeper insight into how risks are being managed through the Group's strategy\n- \u00b7 Key focus areas and mitigating actions for the Group's principal risks\n- \u00b7 Important emerging risk themes\n\n## The risks can be defined as:\n\nPrincipal: The Board-approved enterprise-wide risk categories, including strategic risk, used to monitor and report the risk exposures posing the greatest impact to the Group.\n\nStrategic: A principal risk arising from:\n\n- \u00b7 Incorrect assumptions about internal or external operating environments\n- \u00b7 A failure to understand the potential impact of strategic responses on existing risk types\n- \u00b7 Inappropriate strategic responses and business plans\n\nEmerging: A future internal or external event or trend, which could have a material positive or adverse impact on the Group and our customers, but where the probability, timescale and/or materiality may be difficult to accurately assess.",

Understanding and managing its impacts dynamically has remained a major area of focus. The Group has responded quickly to the challenges faced, putting in place risk mitigation strategies and refining its investment and strategic plans.\n\nAll of the Group's principal risks, which are outlined in this section, are reported regularly to the Board Risk Committee and the Board. The Board Risk Committee report from pages 94 to 99 outlines its activities during the year, as well as its purpose, responsibilities and composition.\n\nAs part of a review of the Group's risk categories, governance risk is no longer a principal risk and is now classified as a secondary risk category. A detailed review of the Group's enterprise risk management framework is planned for 2022, which may result in further changes to our principal risks.\n\nThe risk management section from pages 134 to 193 provides a more in-depth picture of how each principal risk is managed within the Group.\n\n## Risk trends\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Stable risk\n- Increased risk\n- Decreased risk\n- New risk embedding\n\n## Market risk\n\n## Credit risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's structural hedge has increased to \u00a3240 billion (2020: \u00a3186 billion) mostly due to a significant growth in customer deposits. Both customer behaviour and hedging of these balances are reviewed regularly to ensure nearterm interest rate exposure is managed.\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes have seen an improvement in IAS 19 accounting surplus to \u00a34.3 billion, (2020: \u00a31.5 billion). This is due to strong asset returns, an increase in the discount rate and deficit reduction contributions, partially offset by higher gilt yields and/uni00A0inflation.\n\n## Key mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 Structural hedge programmes implemented to stabilise earnings\n- \u00b7 Equity and credit spread risks are closely monitored and, where appropriate, asset and liability matching is undertaken\n- \u00b7 The Group's defined benefit pension schemes continue to monitor their credit allocation and longevity hedge as well as the hedges in place against nominal rate and inflation movements\n\n## Change/execution risk\n\n## Conduct risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe change/execution risk profile has remained stable with proactive reprioritisation and management of the Group's change portfolio continuing through 2021. Focus has remained on the ongoing evolution and strengthening of the control framework and change capability required to support the Group's business and technology transformation plans.\n\n## Key mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 Continued evolution and enhancement of the Group change policy, method and control environment\n- \u00b7 Measurement and reporting of change/execution risk\n- \u00b7 Providing sufficient skilled resources to safely deliver and embed the change portfolio and support future transformation plans\n\nOverall improvement in conduct risk as a result of the Group's continued support to customers impacted by COVID-19, with focus on outcomes for customers with UK Government support schemes, treating customers in financial difficulty fairly and working through legacy issues.\n\n## Key mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 Robust conduct risk framework in place to support delivery of fair customer outcomes, market integrity and competition requirements\n- \u00b7 Active engagement with regulatory bodies and key stakeholders to ensure that the Group's strategic conduct focus continues to meet evolving stakeholder expectations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group continued to actively support its customers throughout 2021, with a range of flexible options and payment holidays, as well as lending through the UK Government support schemes. This support, alongside the other public policy interventions, has contributed to the economic recovery in 2021 and helped keep credit defaults and business failures at low levels.\n\nThe improved economic outlook was a key driver of the 2021 net underlying impairment credit of \u00a31,207 million, which compares to the full year impairment charge of \u00a34,247 million taken in 2020 in light of anticipated losses resulting from the pandemic. Although reduced in 2021, the Group still holds appropriate customer related expected credit loss allowances of \u00a34,477 million (2020: \u00a36,832 million).\n\n## Key mitigating actions\n\n- \u00b7 Prudent, through-the-cycle risk appetite\n- \u00b7 Robust risk assessment, models and credit sanctioning\n- \u00b7 Sector and asset class concentrations closely monitored and controlled\n- \u00b7 Group-wide Road to Recovery programme established to manage and support increases in businesses experiencing financial difficulties",

The planning process takes account of the Group's business objectives, the risks taken to seek to meet those objectives and the controls in place to mitigate those risks to remain within the Group's overall risk appetite.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe going concern of the Company and the Group is dependent on successfully funding their respective balance sheets and maintaining adequate levels of capital.\n\nThe Group's annual planning process comprises the following key stages:\n\n- \u00b7 The divisional teams develop their operating plans, ensuring that they are in line with the Group's strategy and risk appetite\n- \u00b7 The Board reviews and agrees the Group's strategy, risk appetite and objectives in the context of the operating environment and external market commitments\n- \u00b7 The financial projections and the underlying assumptions in respect of expected market and business changes, and future expected legal, accounting and regulatory changes, are subject to rigorous review and challenge from both divisional and Group executives\n- \u00b7 The planning process is also underpinned by a robust capital and funding stress testing framework. This framework allows the Group to assess compliance of the operating plan with the Group's risk appetite\n- \u00b7 In addition, the Board obtains independent assurance from the Risk division over the alignment of the plan with Group strategy and the Board's risk appetite. This assessment performed by the Risk division also identifies the key risks to delivery of the Group's operating plan\n- \u00b7 The scenarios used for stress testing are designed to be severe but plausible, and take account of the availability and likely effectiveness of mitigating actions that could be taken by management to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying risks. In considering the likely effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the Board's regular monitoring and review of risk and internal control systems, as discussed on page 86 , is taken into account. Further information on stress testing and reverse stress testing is provided on page 140\n- \u00b7 The final operating plan, Risk division assessment and the results of the stress testing are presented to the Board for approval. Once approved, the operating plan drives detailed divisional and Group targets for the following year\n\nIn order to satisfy themselves that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future, the Directors have reviewed the Group's operating plan and its funding and capital positions, including a considerations of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. The Directors have also taken into account the impact of further stress scenarios as well as a number of other key dependencies which are set out in the risk management section under principal risks and uncertainties: funding and liquidity on page 39 and pages 171 to 175 and capital position on pages 176 to 185 .\n\nThe Directors have specifically assessed the prospects of the Company and the Group over the current plan period. The Board considers that a three-year period continues to present a reasonable degree of confidence over expected events and macroeconomic assumptions, while still providing an appropriate longer-term outlook. The Directors have also reviewed a less detailed high level forecast for the years 2025 to 2026; this high level forecast contains no information which would cause different conclusions to be reached over the longer-term viability of the Company and Group. Information relevant to the assessment can be found in the following sections of the Annual Report and Accounts:\n\n- \u00b7 Emerging risks are disclosed on pages 141 to 142\n- \u00b7 The Group's principal activities, business and operating models and strategic direction are described in the strategic report on pages 02 to 43\n- \u00b7 The principal risks, including the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing credit, capital, liquidity and funding, are provided in the risk management section on pages 134 to 193\n- \u00b7 The Group's approach to stress testing and reverse stress testing, including both regulatory and internal stresses, is described on page 140\n\nBased upon this assessment, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years to 31 December 2024.\n\nAdditionally, the Directors have considered the capital and funding projections of the Company. Accordingly, the Directors conclude that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval of the financial statements and therefore it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.",

Engaging and developing strong relationships with local stakeholders has allowed us to identify opportunities for the Group to support activity; that will have a real impact in these cities, leveraging our expertise in key sectors including manufacturing, housing, and infrastructure.\n\nThroughout 2021 in these three regions, we have supported 300 businesses to improve their digital skills through the Lloyds Bank Digital events in West Yorkshire and developed over 460 people through our apprenticeship programmes and our partnership with Regeneration Brainery.\n\nFurthermore, we believe that financial institutions have a role to play in acting as a convener in these places to drive change. In November 2021, we launched the Investing for Impact report, which explores the role of financial institutions in driving regional acceleration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8\n\nFurther information is available in our ESG Report www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/responsiblebusiness/downloads\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Summary of Group results\n\n## Statutory results\n\nThe Group's statutory profit before tax for the year was \u00a36,902 million. Statutory profit after tax was \u00a35,885 million. Both measures benefitted from higher income and a net impairment credit given the improved macroeconomic outlook for the UK compared to the prior year. In the fourth quarter of the year, statutory profit before tax was \u00a3968 million and statutory profit after tax was \u00a3420 million, a reduction on the run rate in the first three quarters of 2021, primarily reflecting increased remediation and restructuring costs.\n\nThe Group's statutory income statement includes income and expense attributable to the policyholders of the Group's long-term assurance funds. These items materially offset in arriving at profit attributable to equity shareholders but can, depending on market movements, lead to significant variances on a statutory basis between total income and insurance claims from one period to the next. In the year to 31 December 2021, due to strong market conditions, the Group recognised significant gains on policyholder investments within total income which were materially offset by the corresponding growth in insurance and investment contract liabilities, recognised as an increase in the insurance claims expense and an increase in the amounts payable to unit holders in the Group's consolidated open-ended investment companies, recognised within net interest income.\n\nTotal statutory income, net of insurance claims for the year was \u00a316,324 million, an increase of 8 per cent on 2020, reflecting strong growth within the open mortgage book, positive insurance assumption and methodology changes and strong returns in the Group's equity investments businesses. The Group has maintained its focus on cost management, whilst continuing to invest in the business with total statutory operating expenses up 11 per cent on the prior year. This included the impact of rebuilding variable pay in the context of continued stronger than expected financial performance within both income and impairment, as well as the increased remediation and restructuring costs.\n\nThe Group's balance sheet reflects continued franchise growth during the year. Loans and advances to customers are up 2 per cent on the prior year at \u00a3448.6 billion. This was driven by strong growth in open mortgage book net lending of \u00a316.0 billion in the year, reflecting the strength of the UK housing market. Customer deposits increased by \u00a325.6 billion in the year to \u00a3476.3 billion, with continued inflows to the Group's trusted brands. This included Retail current account growth of \u00a314.1 billion, driven by continued reduced levels of customer spending.\n\nAssets and liabilities associated with the policyholders of the Group's long-term assurance funds are included in the Group's statutory balance sheet. These items have no material impact upon the net assets attributable to equity shareholders but their movements, which depend on market movements, can lead to significant variances, predominantly in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts, from one period to the next. In the year to 31 December 2021, due to strong market conditions, significant growth was seen in policyholder investments, primarily within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. This was materially offset by an increase in the corresponding insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\nThe Group's CET1 capital ratio increased over the year to 17.3 per cent.\n\n## Underlying results A\n\nThe Group's underlying profit for 2021 was \u00a38,040 million, compared to an underlying profit of \u00a32,193 million in 2020, reflecting solid financial performance alongside the improved macroeconomic outlook for the UK. In particular, the Group recognised a net underlying impairment credit of \u00a31,207 million in 2021, compared to a net charge of \u00a34,247 million in 2020. Underlying profit before impairment for the year of \u00a36,833 million is up 6 per cent against 2020. Within this, net income was higher than in 2020 at \u00a315,763 million, partly offset by higher total costs, largely driven by higher remediation charges.\n\n## Net income A\n\n|                                           | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | Change %   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Underlying net interest income            | 11,163    | 10,773    | 4          |\n| Underlying other income                   | 5,060     | 4,515     | 12         |\n| Operating lease depreciation              | (460)     | (884)     | 48         |\n| Net income A                              | 15,763    | 14,404    | 9          |\n| Banking net interest margin A             | 2.54%     | 2.52%     | 2bp        |\n| Average interest-earning banking assets A | \u00a3444.6bn  | \u00a3435.0bn  | 2          |\n\nNet income performance of \u00a315,763 million was solid and 9 per cent higher than in the prior year, reflecting both increased underlying net interest income and increased underlying other income in the year, alongside a reduction in the charge for operating lease depreciation.\n\nUnderlying net interest income of \u00a311,163 million was up 4 per cent year-on-year, benefitting from an increase in average interest-earning banking assets and a strengthened banking net interest margin of 2.54 per cent, up 2 basis points compared to 2020. Average interest-earning banking assets were up 2/uni00A0per cent on the prior year at \u00a3444.6 billion, driven by strong growth in the open mortgage book and the benefit of a full year of government-backed lending business. This was partially offset by increased levels of optimisation within Commercial Banking, the repayment of revolving credit facilities provided to support commercial clients during the pandemic and lower average balances in the closed mortgage book, credit cards, and UK Motor Finance for 2021. The banking net interest margin in the fourth quarter of 2.57 per cent, up 2 basis points on the third quarter, reflected the positive impact of improved structural hedge income and lower funding costs. Based on its current macroeconomic assumptions, particularly including interest rate assumptions, the Group expects the banking net interest margin in 2022 to be above 260 basis points.\n\nThe Group manages the risk to its earnings and capital from movements in interest rates centrally by hedging the net liabilities which are stable or less sensitive to movements in rates. As at 31 December 2021 the Group's structural hedge had an approved capacity of \u00a3240 billion. This represents a prudent increase from \u00a3210 billion at year end 2020 and \u00a3185 billion at year end 2019, on the basis of substantially greater deposit growth since year end 2019 (growth of \u00a365 billion) added to continued review of deposits to assess their eligibility for the structural hedge. The nominal balance of the structural hedge was \u00a3240 billion at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: \u00a3186 billion) with a weighted-average duration of about three-and-a-half years (31 December 2020: about two-and-a-half years). The Group generated \u00a32.2 billion of total gross income from the structural hedge balances in the year (2020: \u00a32.4 billion).\n\nUnderlying other income of \u00a35,060 million in 2021 was 12 per cent higher than in 2020, with \u00a31,307 million in the fourth quarter. The 2021 performance reflected recovering levels of customer activity, strong returns in the Group's equity investment businesses (including Lloyds Development Capital) and a positive impact from assumption and methodology changes in Insurance and Wealth (largely in the fourth quarter) compared to a negative impact in 2020. This was partly offset by a reduced Lex fleet size and lower levels of gilt sales.",

        "page_content": "Within Retail, underlying other income was broadly in line with prior year, with the effects of recovering levels of customer activity and improved current account performance offset by the continuing impact of a reduced Lex fleet size due to contraction of the corporate fleet and new vehicle supply issues. Commercial Banking underlying other income was broadly stable compared to prior year despite lower income from financial markets. Insurance and Wealth underlying other income (\u00a31,432 million) was 15 per cent higher than the prior year (\u00a31,250 million), largely reflecting the impact of \u00a3111 million of positive assumption and methodology changes, of which c.\u00a380 million occurred in the fourth quarter. Underlying other income associated with the Group's equity investments businesses, including Lloyds Development Capital, was \u00a3682 million (2020: \u00a3281 million), with \u00a3151 million recognised in the fourth quarter.\n\nOperating lease depreciation reduced to \u00a3460 million (2020: \u00a3884 million) as a result of significantly stronger used car prices, combined with the continued impact of a reduced Lex fleet size given industry wide supply constraints in the new car market and contraction of the corporate fleet.\n\n## Total costs A\n\n|                     | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | Change %   |\n|---------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Operating costs A   | 7, 6 30   | 7, 5 8 5  | (1)        |\n| Remediation         | 1,300     | 379       |            |\n| Total costs A       | 8,930     | 7,964     | (12)       |\n| Cost:income ratio A | 56.7%     | 55.3%     | 1.4pp      |\n\nTotal costs of \u00a38,930 million were 12 per cent higher than in 2020, driven by slightly increased operating costs and significantly higher remediation charges. The Group has maintained its focus on cost management. Operating costs of \u00a37,630 million, 1 per cent higher than 2020, included the accelerated rebuild of variable pay in the context of continued stronger than expected financial performance. The Group's cost:income ratio was 56.7 per cent.\n\nFrom the first quarter of 2022 the Group will report all restructuring costs, with the exception of merger, acquisition and integration costs, within operating costs. Non lending-related fraud costs, currently included within underlying impairment, will also be reported as part of operating costs. On this new basis, based on current macroeconomic assumptions, operating costs are expected to be c.\u00a38.8 billion in 2022, with the increase from the 2021 equivalent (\u00a38.3/uni00A0billion) reflecting stable business-as-usual costs, incremental investment and new businesses. Operating costs on the new basis are expected to be stable throughout the period 2022 to 2024.\n\nRemediation charges increased significantly to \u00a31,300 million. This includes the costs in relation to HBOS Reading, the previously announced \u00a391 million regulatory fine relating to the past communication of historical home insurance renewals and redress and operational costs in respect of litigation and other ongoing legacy programmes. During 2021, \u00a3790 million has been recognised in relation to HBOS Reading estimated future awards and operational costs, of which \u00a3600 million was recognised in the fourth quarter. This reflects the Group's estimate of its full liability and includes the expected future cost in relation to the independent Foskett Panel re-review, operational costs in relation to Dame Linda Dobbs' review which is considering whether the issues relating to HBOS Reading were investigated and appropriately reported by the Group during the period January 2009 to January 2017 and other programme costs. The final outcome could be significantly different once the re-review is concluded.\n\n## Underlying impairment A\n\nAsset quality remains strong, with sustained low levels of new to arrears during the year. Underlying impairment was a net credit of \u00a31,207 million in the year, compared to a net charge of \u00a34,247 million in 2020, largely driven by improvements to the economic outlook. Within this, a charge of \u00a3557 million (2020: \u00a31,610 million) was incurred before the impact of economic outlook revisions, primarily split between a charge of \u00a3887 million for Retail and a \u00a3324 million net credit for Commercial Banking. The net credit in Commercial Banking reflects credit quality improvements and lower cases flowing into default as well as a smaller overall balance sheet. The overall net credit in the year was driven by a \u00a31,699 million release of expected credit loss (ECL) allowances, based upon improvements to the macroeconomic outlook for the UK, \u00a3601 million of which was recognised in the fourth quarter given a stronger economic outlook than previously forecasted.\n\n|                                                              | 2021 \u00a3m                                                      | 2020 \u00a3m                                                      | Change %                                                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Charges (releases) pre-updated multiple economic scenarios 1 | Charges (releases) pre-updated multiple economic scenarios 1 | Charges (releases) pre-updated multiple economic scenarios 1 | Charges (releases) pre-updated multiple economic scenarios 1 |\n| Retail                                                       | 887                                                          | 1,359                                                        | 35                                                           |\n| Commercial Banking                                           | (324)                                                        | 252                                                          |                                                              |\n| Other                                                        | (6)                                                          | (1)                                                          |                                                              |\n|                                                              | 557                                                          | 1,610                                                        | 65                                                           |\n| Coronavirus impacted restructuring cases 2                   | (65)                                                         | 403                                                          |                                                              |\n| Updated economic outlook                                     |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |\n| Retail                                                       | (1,172)                                                      | 1,025                                                        |                                                              |\n| Commercial Banking                                           | (527)                                                        | 809                                                          |                                                              |\n| Other                                                        | -                                                            | 400                                                          |                                                              |\n|                                                              | (1,699)                                                      | 2,234                                                        |                                                              |\n| Underlying impairment (credit) charge A                      | (1,207)                                                      | 4,247                                                        |                                                              |\n| Asset quality ratio A                                        | (0.27%)                                                      | 0.96%                                                        |                                                              |\n\n- 1 Charges (releases) based on economic outlook as at 31 December 2019, prior to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on expected losses.\n\nOverall the Group's loan portfolio continues to be well-positioned, reflecting a prudent through-the-cycle approach to credit risk with high levels of security. The Group's ECL allowance reduced in the year by \u00a32.4 billion to \u00a34.5 billion following improvements to the economic outlook, although it remains c.\u00a30.3/uni00A0billion higher than at the end of 2019 (31 December 2020: \u00a36.9 billion, 31 December 2019: \u00a34.2 billion). As noted above, observed credit performance remained robust in the year, with the flow of assets into arrears, defaults and write-offs remaining at low levels.",

        "page_content": "## Summary of Group results continued\n\nThe Group's IFRS 9 base case economic scenario used to calculate the ECL allowance assumes that unemployment will remain close to the reduced level of c.4.3 per cent observed in the fourth quarter following the end of the coronavirus job retention scheme. The ECL allowance continues to reflect a probability-weighted view of future economic scenarios built out from the base case and its associated conditioning assumptions, with a 30 per cent weighting applied to base case, upside and downside scenarios and a 10 per cent weighting to the severe downside. All scenarios have improved since the start of the year, following the changes made to the base case outlook.\n\nThe management adjustments to address unprecedented conditions and specific model limitations resulting from the pandemic have reduced by c.\u00a30.1/uni00A0billion over the year. Following increases during the first nine months of the year, c.\u00a30.4 billion has been released in the fourth quarter, which was partially offset by c.\u00a30.1 billion of this amount now captured in modelled ECL. The Group continues to retain in total \u00a30.8 billion of net management judgements in respect of coronavirus (31 December 2020: c.\u00a30.9 billion). \u00a30.4 billion of this is held within portfolios to reflect the expected base case and mitigate remaining risks within the base case not captured fully by models. In addition, the central adjustment introduced in 2020 has also been maintained at the same level of \u00a30.4 billion to recognise the greater downside risks outside of the base case conditioning assumptions and the probability-weighted view of economic scenarios, such as new virus strains emerging. The quantum of this adjustment is equivalent to a c.15 percentage points higher weighting of the severe downside scenario (31 December 2020: c.10 percentage point), noting that the latest severe scenario is more favourable than that held at 31/uni00A0December 2020.\n\nStage 2 loans and advances to customers decreased to \u00a341.7 billion (31 December 2020: \u00a360.5 billion), equivalent to 8.3 per cent (31 December 2020: 12.0/uni00A0per cent) of total loans and advances to customers, as a result of the improvements in economic outlook. Of these, 86 per cent are up to date (31 December 2020: 89 per cent). Stage 3 loans and advances to customers of \u00a38.7 billion (31 December 2020: \u00a39.1 billion) as a proportion of the portfolio have remained stable against prior year at 1.7 per cent. Continued low levels of flows to arrears and default have so far been sustained, post the removal of government support and payment holidays. The Group's ECL coverage of Stage 2 assets decreased to 3.5 per cent (31 December 2020: 4.5 per cent), again reflecting the improved economic outlook.\n\nCoverage of Stage 3 assets has decreased to 24.7 per cent (31 December 2020: 28.6 per cent) primarily due to an increase in Stage 3 Retail Bounce Back Loan Scheme assets which hold zero ECL due to the government guarantee in place, the improved macroeconomic outlook and a small number of single name releases in Commercial Banking (including on coronavirus impacted restructuring cases).\n\nOn the basis of the Group's updated base case and current underlying performance the Group expects the 2022 asset quality ratio to be c.20 basis points.\n\n## Restructuring, volatility and other items\n\n|                                        | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | Change %   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Underlying profit A                    | 8,040     | 2,193     |            |\n| Restructuring                          | (956)     | (521)     | (83)       |\n| Volatility and other items             |           |           |            |\n| Market volatility and asset sales      | 87        | (59)      |            |\n| Amortisation of purchased intangibles  | (70)      | (69)      | (1)        |\n| Fair value unwind                      | (199)     | (233)     | 15         |\n|                                        | (182)     | (361)     | 50         |\n| Payment protection insurance provision | -         | (85)      |            |\n| Statutory profit before tax            | 6,902     | 1,226     |            |\n| Tax (expense) credit                   | (1,017)   | 161       |            |\n| Statutory profit after tax             | 5,885     | 1,387     |            |\n| Earnings per share                     | 7. 5p     | 1.2p      | 6.3p       |\n| Return on tangible equity A            | 13.8%     | 2.3%      | 11.5pp     |\n\nFurther information on the reconciliation of underlying to statutory results is included on page 66 .\n\nRestructuring\n\n|                                                      | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | Change %   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| Severance costs                                      | (109)     | (156)     | 30         |\n| Property transformation                              | (123)     | (146)     | 16         |\n| Technology research and development                  | (155)     | (61)      |            |\n| Regulatory programmes                                | (60)      | (42)      | (43)       |\n| Other                                                | (57)      | (46)      | (24)       |\n| Mergers and acquisitions, integration and write-offs | (452)     | (70)      |            |\n| Total restructuring                                  | (956)     | (521)     | (83)       |\n\nRestructuring costs of \u00a3956 million were 83 per cent higher than in 2020 with \u00a3570 million incurred in the fourth quarter, including a c.\u00a3400 million software write-off as the Group invests in new technology and systems infrastructure, partly offset by lower property transformation and severance costs. From the first quarter of 2022 all restructuring costs, with the exception of merger, acquisition and integration costs, will be reported as part of the Group's operating costs. Merger, acquisition and integration costs will continue to be reported after underlying profit.\n\nVolatility and other items reflected a net loss of \u00a3182 million in 2021, comprising \u00a387 million of positive market volatility and asset sales, \u00a370 million of amortisation of purchased intangibles and \u00a3199 million of fair value unwind. Market volatility and asset sales included a benefit of \u00a3238 million from positive insurance and banking volatility (driven mainly by narrowing bond spreads and increased inflation, partly offset by increasing interest rates), and a loss of \u00a3101 million relating to liability management exercises recognised in the fourth quarter.",

        "page_content": "## Tax\n\nThe Group recognised a tax expense of \u00a31,017 million for the year, including a credit of \u00a3954 million arising on the remeasurement of deferred tax assets following the announcement, and subsequent substantive enactment, by the UK Government of a corporation tax rate increase from 19 per cent to 25/uni00A0per cent on 1 April 2023. The Group expects a medium term effective tax rate of around 27 per cent which includes the effects of both the increase in corporation tax rate and the expected reduction from 8 per cent to 3 per cent of the rate of banking surcharge from 1 April 2023. An explanation of the relationship between the tax expense and the Group's accounting profit for the year is set out on page 245 .\n\n## Return on tangible equity A\n\nThe return on tangible equity for 2021 was 13.8 per cent (2020: 2.3 per cent), or 11.4 per cent (2020: 1.4 per cent) excluding the remeasurement of deferred tax assets. Returns benefitted from the net impairment credit in the year. Earnings per share were 7.5 pence (2020: 1.2 pence).\n\nSubject to the economic outturn and market volatility, the Group expects the return on tangible equity for 2022 to be c.10 per cent.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\n|                                                  | At 31 Dec 2021   | At 31 Dec 2020   | Change %   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------|\n| Loans and advances to customers                  | \u00a3448.6bn         | \u00a3440.2bn         | 2          |\n| Customer deposits                                | \u00a3476.3bn         | \u00a3450.7bn         | 6          |\n| Loan to deposit ratio A                          | 94%              | 98%              | (4pp)      |\n| Wholesale funding                                | \u00a391.4bn          | \u00a3109.4bn         | (16)       |\n| Wholesale funding <1 year maturity               | \u00a330.3bn          | \u00a334.3bn          | (12)       |\n| Of which money-market funding <1 year maturity 1 | \u00a316.1bn          | \u00a321.5bn          | (25)       |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio - eligible assets 2     | \u00a3140.2bn         | \u00a3141.7bn         | (1)        |\n| Liquidity coverage ratio 3                       | 135%             | 136%             | (1pp)      |\n\n- 1 Excludes balances relating to margins of \u00a33.8 billion (31 December 2020: \u00a35.3 billion).\n- 2 Eligible assets are calculated as an average of month-end observations over the previous 12 months post any liquidity haircuts.\n- 3 The Liquidity coverage ratio is calculated as a simple average of month end observations over the previous 12 months.\n\nLoans and advances to customers of \u00a3448.6 billion increased 2 per cent on the prior year, driven by strong growth in the open mortgage book of \u00a316.0/uni00A0billion in the year, reflecting the strength of the UK housing market. Total customer deposits were up \u00a325.6 billion in the year, to \u00a3476.3 billion with continued inflows to the Group's trusted brands. This included Retail current account growth of \u00a314.1 billion in 2021, driven by inflows to trusted brands and/uni00A0continued reduced levels of customer spending.\n\nThe Group has maintained its robust funding and liquidity position with a loan to deposit ratio of 94 per cent, down 4 percentage points on 2020, largely driven by increased customer deposits.\n\nThe Group continued to access wholesale funding across a variety of currencies and markets. The Group has made net drawings of \u00a316.3 billion from the Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME) in 2021, taking the total outstanding amount to \u00a330 billion at 31 December 2021. Overall, total wholesale funding reduced to \u00a391.4 billion at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: \u00a3109.4 billion) primarily as a result of the growth in customer deposits and TFSME drawings.\n\n## Capital\n\n|                                  | At 31 Dec 2021   | At 31 Dec 2020   | Change %   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------|\n| CET1 ratio                       | 17.3%            | 16.2%            | 1.1pp      |\n| Pro forma CET1 ratio 1,2,A       | 16.3%            | 16.2%            | 0.1pp      |\n| Transitional total capital ratio | 23.6%            | 23.3%            | 0.3pp      |\n| Transitional MREL ratio          | 37.2%            | 36.4%            | 0.8pp      |\n| UK leverage ratio                | 5.8%             | 5.8%             |            |\n| Risk-weighted assets             | \u00a3196bn           | \u00a3203bn           | (3)        |\n| Shareholders' equity             | \u00a347bn            | \u00a343bn            | 9          |\n| Tangible net assets per share A  | 57.5p            | 52.3p            | 5.2p       |\n\n- 1 The pro forma CET1 ratio as at 31 December 2021 reflects both the dividend paid up by the Insurance business in the subsequent first quarter period and the impact of the announced ordinary share buyback programme.",

The strong pro forma capital build of 210 basis points for the year largely reflected banking profitability (pre-underlying impairment credit) of 210 basis points, with a limited impairment offset of 19 basis points, being the net impact of IFRS 9 transitional relief reduction and the underlying impairment credit for the year. The capital build also benefitted from a reduction in risk-weighted assets equivalent to 58 basis points and 16 basis points for the final dividend received from the Insurance business in February 2022 (\u00a3300 million). These positives offset fixed pension contributions made to the defined benefit pension schemes of 41 basis points and other movements of 14 basis points which include around 30 basis points for the impact of the equity provided to Insurance to fund the acquisition of Embark. The pro forma CET1 capital ratio reduced by a further 185 basis points in respect of the full year ordinary dividend and the announced share buyback programme. In addition, variable pension contributions of 10 basis points, based upon a proportion of in year shareholder distributions, were made to the main defined benefit pension schemes in December.\n\nExcluding the Insurance dividend received in February 2022 and the impact of the announced ordinary share buyback programme, the Group's CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2021 was 17.3 per cent (31 December 2020: 16.2 per cent).\n\nRisk-weighted assets at \u00a3196.0 billion reduced by \u00a36.7 billion during the year, including \u00a34.7 billion in the fourth quarter. This was driven primarily by optimisation activity undertaken in Commercial Banking, partially offset by balance sheet growth in the business. Credit migrations have had a limited impact on the risk-weighted asset position in part due to the increase in house prices.\n\nOn 1 January 2022 the Group's risk-weighted assets increased to \u00a3212 billion on a pro forma basis, reflecting the impact of regulatory changes that include the implementation of new CRD IV mortgage, retail unsecured and commercial banking models and revised counterparty credit risk measurement rules (SA-CCR) following the UK implementation of the remainder of CRR 2. These were partially offset by the removal of risk-weighted assets linked to the reversal of the revised treatment previously applied to intangible software assets and other movements. The new CRD IV models are subject to finalisation and approval by the PRA and therefore uncertainty over the final impact remains.\n\nThe pro forma CET1 capital ratio on 1 January 2022 reduced by around 230 basis points to 14.0 per cent, reflecting the above increase in risk-weighted assets and other related modelled impacts, in addition to the capital impact of the treatment of intangible software assets and phased reductions in IFRS 9 transitional relief. The full impact of the regulatory changes has been absorbed through the retention of surplus capital (post announced distributions) that was held aside for this purpose. The Group's pro forma CET1 capital ratio after reflecting the regulatory changes remains strong and above the Group's target capital level and minimum regulatory capital requirements. The Board remains committed to capital returns and intends to pay down to its capital target within the course of the current plan by 2024.\n\nThe Group's CET1 regulatory minimum capital requirement is currently around 11 per cent.\n\nIn December 2021 the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) of the Bank of England announced that the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate will increase from nil to 1 per cent in December 2022, with an expectation that it will increase to 2 per cent in the second quarter of 2023. This would represent an equivalent increase in the Group's countercyclical capital buffer to 0.9 per cent in December 2022 and to 1.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2023, based on the position at 31 December 2021 and reflective of the concentration of exposures of the Group to the UK market.\n\nThe PRA reduced the Group's nominal Pillar 2A CET1 capital requirement during the year. It was the equivalent of around 2.1 per cent of risk-weighted assets as at 31 December 2021.\n\nIn December 2020 the PRA introduced a reduction to the Group's Pillar 2A requirement linked to the setting of a 2 per cent UK countercyclical capital buffer rate under normal conditions (as defined by the FPC). In line with PRA policy, the reduction is currently fully offset by other regulatory capital buffers at the CET1 level whilst the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate remains at nil. This offset is expected to unwind going forward as the UK countercyclical capital buffer rate increases to 2 per cent in line with the FPC announcement, effectively allowing the reduction of the PRA requirement to take effect.\n\nThe Board's view of the ongoing level of CET1 capital required to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties continues to be around 12.5 per cent, plus a management buffer of around 1 per cent.",

        "page_content": "## Pensions\n\nDuring 2021 the valuations of the Group's three main defined benefit pension schemes were agreed with the scheme trustees. The latest annual update as at 31 December 2020 showed the funding deficit had improved to \u00a36.0 billion from the \u00a37.3 billion shown at the 31 December 2019 triennial valuation. The revised deficit included an allowance for the impact of RPI reform as announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in November 2020 which is currently subject to judicial review in 2022.\n\nUnder the agreed recovery plans, the Group will make c.\u00a30.8 billion of fixed contributions to the pension schemes per annum, plus a further 30 per cent of in-year capital distributions to ordinary shareholders, up to a limit on total deficit contributions of \u00a32.0 billion per annum, payable until the 2019 deficit has been removed. A total of \u00a31,064 million of deficit contributions were paid in 2021. The Group continues to provide security to these pension schemes, with corporate guarantees and collateral pledged, whilst also making additional annual contributions for future service and scheme running costs.\n\nThe next triennial valuation will take place as at 31 December 2022 with the outcome to be agreed by 31 March 2024.\n\n## Dividend and share buyback\n\nThe Group has a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy whilst maintaining the flexibility to return surplus capital through buybacks or special dividends.\n\nGiven the Group's solid financial performance and strong capital position at the year end, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.33 pence per share. This is in addition to the interim ordinary dividend of 0.67 pence per share that was announced in the 2021 half year results. The recommended total ordinary dividend per share for 2021 is therefore 2.00 pence per share. The Board has also announced its intention to implement an ordinary share buyback of up to \u00a32 billion which will commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed by 31 December 2022. The Board intends to return surplus capital by way of a buyback programme given the amount of surplus capital, the normalisation of ordinary dividends and the flexibility that a buyback programme offers. Given the total ordinary dividend of 2.00 pence per share and the intended ordinary share buyback, equivalent to up to 2.82 pence per share, the total capital return in respect of 2021 will be up to 4.82 pence per share, equivalent to \u00a33.4 billion.\n\nThe Board remains committed to future capital returns. Going forward, the Board intends to maintain its progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy and due consideration will be given to further excess capital returns at the end of the year as appropriate. The Board intends to pay down to its capital target within the course of the current plan, by 2024.\n\nKey dates for the payment of the recommended dividend are:\n\n| Shares quoted ex-dividend                                        | 7 April 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Record date                                                      | 8 April 2022   |\n| Final date for joining or leaving the dividend reinvestment plan | 27 April 2022  |\n| Dividend paid                                                    | 19 May 2022    |",

IFRS requires that the changes in both the value of the liabilities and investments are reflected within the income statement. The value of the liabilities does not move exactly in line with changes in the value of the investments. As the investments are substantial, movements in their value can have a significant impact on the profitability of the Group. Management believes that it is appropriate to disclose the division's results on the basis of an expected return. The impact of the actual return on these investments differing from the expected return is included within insurance volatility.\n\nInsurance volatility movements in 2021 were largely driven by positive impacts from rising global equity markets, narrowing credit spreads and rising inflation, partially offset by negative impacts from rising interest rates. Although the Group manages its exposures to equity, interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, inflation and market movements within the Insurance division, it does so by balancing the importance of managing the impacts on both capital and earnings volatility. For example, equity market movements are hedged within Insurance on a Solvency II capital basis and whilst this also reduces the IFRS earnings exposure to equity market movements, the hedge works to a lesser extent from an IFRS earnings perspective.\n\n## Changes in Insurance assumptions and methodology\n\nDemographic and expense assumptions are managed within other operating income (separately from economic return assumptions which impact Insurance volatility). The following impacts from assumption and methodology changes are included within Insurance and Wealth other operating income:\n\n|                                          | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Persistency                              | (15)      | ( 74)     |\n| Mortality, longevity and morbidity       | 149       | 52        |\n| Expense assumptions                      | (94)      | (124)     |\n| Other                                    | 3         | (5)       |\n| Total assumption changes                 | 43        | (151)     |\n| Methodology changes                      | 68        | 91        |\n| Total assumption and methodology changes | 111       | (60)      |\n\nKey life and pensions assumptions and methodologies are formally updated through the annual basis review in the fourth quarter of each year, however assumptions are monitored continuously and updated when necessary.\n\nCurrent year changes include allowance for the coronavirus impact on mortality rates, whilst prior year was reflective of the macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic such as redundancies and furlough. The changes in expense assumptions primarily reflect reallocation of costs between business lines and future short-term committed expenditures, including specific projects. Methodology changes include significant model improvements in 2021 and changes in the treatment of illiquid assets in 2020.\n\n## Number of employees (full-time equivalent)\n\n|                              | At 31 Dec 2021   | At 31 Dec 2020   |\n|------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Retail                       | 30,922           | 33,426           |\n| Commercial Banking           | 6,286            | 6,487            |\n| Insurance and Wealth         | 4,394            | 4,903            |\n| Group functions and services | 17,503           | 18,024           |\n|                              | 59,105           | 62,840           |\n| Agency staff                 | (1,150)          | (1,264)          |\n| Total number of employees    | 57,955           | 61,576           |",

        "page_content": "## Alternative performance measures\n\nIn addition to the statutory basis of presentation, the results are also presented on an underlying basis. The Group Executive Committee reviews the Group's results on an underlying basis in order to assess performance and allocate resources. Management uses underlying profit before tax, an alternative performance measure, as a measure of performance and believes that it provides important information for investors because it allows for a comparable representation of the Group's performance by removing the impact of certain items, including volatility caused by market movements.\n\nIn arriving at underlying profit, statutory profit before tax is adjusted for the items below, to allow a comparison of the Group's underlying performance:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring, including severance costs, property transformation, technology research and development, regulatory programmes, merger and acquisition costs and integration costs\n- \u00b7 Payment protection insurance remediation provisions, excluding litigation costs\n- \u00b7 Volatility and other items, which includes the effects of certain asset sales, the volatility relating to the Group's hedging arrangements and that arising in the insurance business, the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments and the amortisation of purchased intangible assets\n\nThe Group's statutory income statement includes income and expense attributable to the policyholders of the Group's long-term assurance funds. These items materially offset in arriving at profit attributable to equity shareholders but can, depending on market movements, lead to significant variances on a statutory basis in total income and insurance claims from one period to the next. The Group nets down this volatility in the underlying basis presentation in order to improve comparability between periods.\n\nAnalysis of lending and expected credit loss (ECL) allowances is presented on both statutory and underlying bases and a reconciliation between the two is shown on page 154 . On a statutory basis, purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) assets include a fixed pool of mortgages that were purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition at a deep discount to face value reflecting credit losses incurred from the point of origination to the date of acquisition. Over time, these POCI assets will run off as the loans redeem, pay down or losses crystallise. The underlying basis assumes that the lending assets acquired as part of a business combination were originated by the Group and are classified as either Stage 1, 2 or 3 according to the change in credit risk over the period since origination. Underlying ECL allowances are calculated accordingly. The Group uses the underlying basis to monitor the creditworthiness of the lending portfolio and related ECL allowances.\n\nThe Group calculates a number of metrics that are used throughout the banking and insurance industries on an underlying basis. These metrics are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies and are not any more authoritative than measures presented in the financial statements, however management believes that they are useful in assessing the performance of the Group and in drawing comparisons between years. A description of these measures and their calculation, is given below.\n\n| Asset quality ratio                  | The underlying impairment credit or charge for the period in respect of loans and advances to customers, expressed as a  percentage of average gross loans and advances to customers for the period.

        "page_content": "## Chair's introduction\n\n## Focusing on good governance as we develop our new strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021 saw a change in leadership for us as Charlie Nunn was appointed Group Chief Executive, bringing renewed passion and commitment to our purpose as well as his own vision for the Group. The Board has revisited the role of the Group's overarching purpose, Helping Britain Prosper, and has considered how to embed our purpose further across business activities to help tackle the social and economic issues facing the UK. Under Charlie's leadership we have developed the Group's strategy in line with this purpose and in response to changing customer needs and expectations.\n\nThe Board remains focused on good governance and stakeholder engagement as fundamental to the Group's role in Helping Britain Recover from the effects of the pandemic. Oversight of Charlie's transition into his role has been a focus for the Board in 2021, together with the other key corporate governance activities set out below.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of engaging with all its stakeholders. Meeting the Group's responsibilities and duties to shareholders and the communities we serve is central to our purpose. Further details on how the Board takes account of stakeholder interests are set out on pages 26 to 29 .\n\n## Board oversight of new strategy\n\nThe Board has been heavily involved with the development of the Group's new strategy. Further information on the key Board discussions during 2021 and early 2022 can be found on page 79 .\n\n## Leading on culture\n\nThis year the Board played an active role in leading the development of a healthy, values-led culture. Further information on the Board's role in assessing, monitoring and providing oversight of the development of the Group's values-led culture can be found on page 80 .\n\n## An inclusive and diverse organisation\n\nDriving inclusion and diversity at Board and throughout all levels of the organisation is a key area of focus for the Board. This year, the Board approved the Group's updated diversity policy - more information on the Board's approach to inclusion and diversity is set out on page 89 .\n\n## Succession planning\n\nSuccession planning is an important component of good governance and is vital to ensure an appropriate mix of skills, experience and backgrounds at Board and senior management level. Further details on the Board's approach to succession planning can be found on pages 87 and/uni00A089 .\n\n## Board and Committee changes\n\nThere have been several changes to the Board and its Committees during 2021.\n\nCharlie Nunn's appointment as Group Chief Executive and Executive Director started on 16 August 2021. William Chalmers, Chief Financial Officer, took on the role of acting Group Chief Executive when Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio stepped down in April pending Charlie's arrival. Ant\u00f3nio made a tremendous contribution to the Group during his tenure and left with our thanks and best wishes.\n\nI would also like to thank William for taking on the interim role. Harmeen Mehta joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 November 2021.\n\nSara Weller retired as Chair of the Responsible Business Committee and as a Non-Executive Director at the Company's AGM in May 2021 after nine years on the Board and was succeeded in the role of Chair of the Responsible Business Committee by Amanda Mackenzie. Nick/uni00A0Prettejohn stepped down as a Non-Executive Director of the Group and as Chair of Scottish Widows Group on 30/uni00A0September 2021 after more than seven years on the Board. Sara and Nick made significant contributions to the Board and left with our thanks and best wishes.\n\nIn March 2021, membership of the Board Risk Committee was streamlined so that, as is the case with our other Board Committees, a number of Non-Executive Directors, but not all, are now members.\n\nStuart Sinclair stepped down from his role as Chair of the Remuneration Committee in November 2021 and was succeeded in that role by Alan Dickinson. Stuart has notified the Board that he will retire from the Board at the Company's AGM in May 2022. Full details of the Board and Committee changes are set out on page 87 .\n\n## Ring-fencing governance\n\nAlthough this is Lloyds Banking Group plc's Corporate Governance Report, I would like to thank Nigel Hinshelwood, Sarah Bentley and Brendan Gilligan for their valuable contribution as Non-Executive Directors of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc (the Ring-Fenced Banks), which represent the majority of the Group's banking activities. Further details regarding the Group's ring-fencing arrangements and the critical role these Directors play in the Group's overall governance structure are set out on page 81 .\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nGiven the appointment of a new Group Chief Executive and the Group's ongoing strategy development, the Board agreed that an evaluation of its effectiveness will be conducted in 2022 instead of in 2021 in order to allow the review to cover the Board's effectiveness in overseeing these developments. Further information on this process can be found on page 85 .\n\n## Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company's statement of compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 can be found on page 71 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Robin Budenberg\n\nChair\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\n## Compliance statement\n\nThe UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the Code) applied to the financial year ended 31 December 2021. The Code is available at www.frc.org.uk.\n\nThe Directors' report is set out in a way that helps shareholders and investors to evaluate how the Company has applied the principles, and complied with the provisions, of the Code during the year. The table below signposts the most relevant parts of the Annual Report, in particular where supporting information is not in the Directors' report.\n\nThe Company confirms that it applied the principles, and complied with all the provisions, of the Code throughout the year except as set out below.\n\nProvision 21 of the Code provides that an annual evaluation of the Board should be undertaken and that the evaluation should be externally facilitated at least every three years. The Board decided to delay the evaluation for 2021 until 2022 for the reasons set out on page 85 and therefore there was no annual evaluation in 2021\n\nand, since the most recent externally facilitated evaluation was in 2018, there will be a gap of more than three years between external evaluations. The Board confirms there will be an evaluation in 2022, which it anticipates will be externally facilitated. Further information is on page/uni00A085 .\n\nProvision 36 of the Code provides that the remuneration committee should develop a formal policy for post-employment shareholding requirements encompassing both unvested and vested shares. The Group has implemented a formal policy for post-employment shareholding requirements with effect from 1 January 2022 and so has complied with the Code provision since that date, but did not comply in 2021 as there was no specific formal policy in place. However, the Group believes that its post-employment shareholding arrangements in place during 2021 complied with best practice and with the spirit of the Code provision. For details of the Group's shareholding policy and post-employment shareholding requirements, please see page/uni00A0102 of the Directors' remuneration report.\n\n| Principles of the Code                                     |                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| 1.

As part of the development of the Group's strategy, the Board has revisited the role of purpose in the Group's strategy and considered how to continue to better align the Group's business with its purpose. Read more about the Board's engagement in the development of the Group's new strategy on page 79 .\n\nThe Group's role as a trusted and sustainable business is central to its purpose, with the Board's Responsible Business Committee overseeing the Group's sustainability ambitions.

The Board is supported by its Committees which make decisions and recommendations on matters delegated to them under the Corporate Governance Framework, including Board appointments, the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management framework, financial reporting, governance, and remuneration issues. This enables the Board to spend a greater proportion of its time on strategic, forward-looking matters. Read more about the Corporate Governance Framework on page 88 .\n\nEach Board Committee comprises Non-Executive Directors only and has an experienced Chair. The Committees are managed on the same basis as the Board. The structure of each Committee seeks to facilitate open discussion and debate, and ensure adequate time for Committees' members to consider all proposals.\n\nThe Executive Directors make decisions within the parameters and principles set out in the Corporate Governance Framework, which aims to ensure that decisions are made by management under the correct authority. However, where appropriate, any activity can be brought to the full Board for consideration, even if the matter falls within agreed parameters. There are\n\nexecutive committees established to support the Group Chief Executive (Group Chief Executive Committees), in particular the Group Executive Committee.

        "page_content": "## Board oversight\n\n## How governance contributes to the delivery of our strategy\n\nOur governance arrangements contribute to the development and delivery of our strategy in various ways, including by seeking accountability and responsibility, information flow and independent insight from the Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Focus of Board discussion\n\n- \u00b7 Role of purpose in our strategy\n- \u00b7 Purpose-alignment of our current business\n- \u00b7 Expressing our purpose\n- \u00b7 Colleague feedback on purpose work\n- \u00b7 Proposed mission statement and principles\n- \u00b7 Overall shape and direction of strategic choices and outcomes\n\n## Our focus on ESG\n\nThe Board has overall oversight of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. As ESG matters are an integral part of the Group's strategy, the Board considered them during the development of the Group's new strategy.\n\nThe Responsible Business Committee oversees and monitors the Group's strategy and plans for delivering the Group's aspirations to be a trusted, responsible business as part of our purpose to Help Britain Prosper. During 2021, the Responsible Business Committee discussed regular updates on key environmental and social issues, providing oversight and challenge on those activities that impact our stakeholders. In addition, the Responsible Business Committee reviewed quarterly progress against our Helping Britain Recover commitments.\n\n## Supporting colleagues\n\nSpeak Up (the Group's whistleblowing programme) enables colleagues to raise matters of concern. Alan Dickinson is the Group's whistleblowing champion and is responsible for overseeing the integrity, independence and effectiveness of the Group's whistleblowing procedures. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews reports on whistleblowing to ensure there are arrangements in place which colleagues can use in confidence to report relevant concerns and reports on its review to the Board.\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing and developing the Group's strategy and monitoring its implementation by the Group Chief Executive, supported by the wider executive management team. During 2021, the Board has regularly reviewed the Group's progress against its delivery of Strategic Review 2021.\n\nThe Board has also been heavily involved with the development of the Group's new strategy and the diagram below gives an indication of the some of the key Board discussion topics on the development of the Group's new strategy during the second half of 2021 and early 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic vision\n- \u00b7 Initial priorities for enablers of new strategy\n- \u00b7 Key strategic choices and options for the retail and commercial customer businesses\n- \u00b7 Finalising our purpose-driven mission statement and financial and delivery plan for the strategy\n- \u00b7 External and internal stakeholder communication strategy\n- \u00b7 Measurement and monitoring approach for delivery of strategy\n\nThe Group has made good progress in further incorporating climate change into the Group strategy and business operations as well as prioritising the areas of our businesses where we see the greatest opportunity to support and accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy. We are enhancing our disclosures with our inaugural standalone Climate Report and have published key sector targets for high-emissions and fossil fuel sectors, committing to a full phase-out from thermal coal. Given this progress and the evolving best practice for climate votes, we do not intend at present to bring a climate vote to the 2022 AGM. We will continue to consider a vote on a year by year basis.\n\nRead more on pages 34 to 36 , in the Responsible Business Committee Report on page 100 and in our Lloyds Banking Group ESG Report 2021.\n\n## Our workforce engagement\n\nIn 2021, the Responsible Business Committee became the designated body for the Board's engagement with the workforce, creating a dedicated resource of Non-Executive Directors, while retaining a commitment for the whole Board to continue to engage with colleagues.\n\nPlease see page 27 for further examples of how the Board engages with the Group's workforce and why the Board considers those arrangements to be/uni00A0effective.\n\n- \u00b7 Key enablers and execution approach for strategy\n- \u00b7 Financial shape of the baseline economics and strategic choices\n- \u00b7 Operating model and culture\n- \u00b7 Approval of strategy, financial plans, targets and investor communications\n\n## Our focus on technology\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of technology in how the Group serves customers and changing how colleagues work. The Nomination and Governance Committee therefore made the recruitment to the Board of additional technology expertise a priority, resulting in the appointment of Harmeen Mehta. Harmeen is Chief Digital and Innovation Officer at BT and brings to the Board 25 years' experience leading digital, engineering, IT and innovation transformation as well as incubating new businesses and creating new revenue streams in businesses.\n\nThe Group's Information Technology and Cyber Advisory Forum (ITCAF) was established in 2018 to enable a smaller group of Board members, as well as directors of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc, to engage in more detailed review of the Group's IT-related operational risks. This helps inform and enhance discussions of the Board and the Board Risk Committee, to which ITCAF reports. During the course of the year ITCAF considered a wide range of technologyrelated matters, including the Group's ongoing use of cloud technology, the continuing digitisation of the Group's business, matters of cyber security, and the management of risk relating to IT and cyber issues generally.",

This included its support to move the 2020 Culture Acceleration Initiatives into 'business as usual' activity, aligned to our culture drivers, as part of the Group culture plan. Action in 2021 built on 2020 with a focus on embedding changes made and continuing to 'raise the bar'.\n\n## Key areas of focus\n\n- \u00b7 Continuing to embed Your Best 2 and use this to help colleagues and teams connect to our purpose\n- \u00b7 Building empathy into the way we support customers, clients and colleagues\n- \u00b7 Powering up Behavioural Experiments 4 , encouraging everyone to use this as a tool to simplify how we work\n- \u00b7 Build on the foundations laid for adoption of hybrid ways of working, with guidance and training for teams to have conversations on their future ways of working\n- \u00b7 Simplifying our approach to risk, encouraging all colleagues to have a healthy risk mindset\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow we think about our culture and ways of working is fundamental.

The Board has also discussed the themes which impact our current culture and our future cultural aspirations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are strengthening the connection between our culture, purpose and strategy with increased clarity about what Helping Britain Prosper means and new values which clarify the expectations we have of each other. Through effective embedding of these new values in 2022 and beyond, we can continue to build on the progress already made in creating a truly purpose-driven and values-led culture.\n\n## Monitoring progress\n\nThe Board has continued to monitor the progress the Group has made on culture and colleague feeling. Updates included details of the Colleague pulse surveys, Financial Services Culture Board survey and Colleague survey, with updates on critical activities and discussions on cultural challenges and tensions.\n\nIn addition, culture progress is also measured through our Culture Index, which brings together key metrics from the Colleague and Financial Services Culture Board surveys. The full results from these surveys and a behavioural diagnostic tool are also used to understand our culture.",

        "page_content": "## Group structure and ring-fencing governance arrangements\n\nSince 1 January 2019 UK legislation has required large UK banks to separate personal banking services, such as current and savings accounts, from riskier activities, such as investment banking, in other parts of their business. This is called ring-fencing. The Group's structure and governance arrangements meet these regulatory requirements. Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc are the banks, within the Group, which have been included within the ring-fence (together, the Ring-Fenced Banks). The governance structure focuses on ensuring:\n\n- \u00b7 Risks affecting the Ring-Fenced Banks are considered and managed from the Ring-Fenced Banks' perspective including maintenance of the capital adequacy and liquidity of the RingFenced Banks\n- \u00b7 Independent decision-making by the Ring-Fenced Banks' boards - on any matters where there might be a conflict between the interests of the Ring-Fenced Banks and the interests of another part of the Group\n- \u00b7 Clear and effective governance at both Ring-Fenced Bank and Lloyds Banking Group plc level - including second and third lines of defence in respect of risk management\n\n## Ring-Fenced Bank-only Directors\n\n## Nigel Hinshelwood\n\nSenior Independent Director Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Appointed: January 2019 Skills, experience and contribution:\n\nExtensive experience in the financial services sector having worked across the UK and Europe, North and South America, the Middle East and Asia Pacific Significant experience of large scale transformation, operations and technology\n\n## Nigel was a partner at Ernst & Young\n\n(subsequently Cap Gemini Ernst & Young) for many years where he held numerous positions including Head of Financial Services and Chief Executive Officer of Southeast Asia.\n\nBefore becoming a Non-Executive, he was the Head of HSBC UK and Deputy CEO of HSBC Bank plc. Within the HSBC Group he held a number of executive appointments including Head of HSBC Insurance Holdings, Chief Operating Officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa, and Global Head of Operations. Nigel was formerly a NonExecutive Director of Lloyd's of London Franchise Board.\n\n## Group structure\n\nThe subsidiaries of the Group are structured into the following subgroups under Lloyds Banking Group plc, providing effective governance for the business undertaken in each sub-group:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group - Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc which provides products and services to Group customers that are not allowed within the ring-fence, as well as serving financial institutions customers and holding certain of the Group's subsidiaries and branches outside the UK\n- \u00b7 Ring-Fenced Banks sub-group containing Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc (including the Halifax and MBNA businesses), serving both their UK personal and commercial customers\n- \u00b7 Insurance sub-group under Scottish Widows Group Limited (including Scottish Widows Limited)\n\n- \u00b7 Equity sub-group under LBG Equity Investments Limited, for which the principal subsidiary is Lloyds Development Capital Limited\n\nThe boards of the Ring-Fenced Banks comprise all of the Group Directors plus three additional independent NonExecutive Directors: Nigel Hinshelwood (Senior Independent Director), Sarah Bentley and Brendan Gilligan.

These responsibilities are formalised within the Corporate Governance Framework.\n\nThe composition of the Board (currently, the Chair, seven Non-Executive Directors and the two Executive Directors) helps ensure that no one individual or small group of individuals dominates the Board's decision-making. The diversity of skills, experience and background on the Board enables the Board to provide constructive challenge and strategic guidance and to offer specialist advice.\n\nThere is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executive leadership of the Group - please refer to the role summaries on the right. The responsibilities of the Chair, Group Chief Executive, Senior Independent Director, Board and Committees are agreed by the Board and publicly available on the Group's website at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/ who-we-are/group-overview/corporategovernance. The Chair periodically refreshes Committee membership.\n\n## Monitoring independence\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee monitors whether there are any relationships or circumstances which may affect a Director's independence. Following the most recent review of independence, the Committee concluded that all NonExecutive Directors are independent in character and judgement. Robin Budenberg was independent on appointment when assessed against the circumstances set out in provision 10 of the Code.\n\n## Monitoring time commitments\n\nNon-Executive Directors are advised of time commitments prior to their appointment and are required to devote such time as is necessary to discharge their duties effectively. The time commitments of the Directors are considered by the Board on appointment and annually thereafter, and, following the most recent review, the Board is satisfied there are no Directors whose time commitments are considered to be a matter for concern.\n\nExternal appointments, which may affect existing time commitments relevant to the Board, must be agreed with the Chair, and prior Board approval must be obtained before taking on any new external appointments. The Board did not approve any significant additional external appointments in 2021. No Executive Director has taken up more than one Non-Executive Director role at a FTSE 100 company or taken up the chair of such a company.

He deputises for the Chair and is available to the Board for consultation and advice. The Deputy Chair may also represent the Group's interests to official enquiries and review bodies.\n\nAs Senior Independent Director, Alan Dickinson is a sounding board for the Chair and Group Chief Executive. He acts as a conduit for the views of other Non-Executive Directors and conducts the Chair's annual performance appraisal. He is available to help resolve shareholders' concerns and attends meetings with major shareholders and financial analysts to understand issues and concerns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe Independent Non-Executive Directors challenge management constructively and help develop and set the Group's strategy. They actively participate in Board decision-making and scrutinise management performance. The Non-Executive Directors satisfy themselves on the integrity of financial information and review the Group's risk exposures and controls. The Non-Executive Directors, through the Remuneration Committee, also determine the remuneration of Executive Directors.\n\n## The right information and support\n\nThe Chair, supported by the Group Company Secretary, ensures that Board members receive appropriate and timely information. All Directors have access to the advice of the Group Company Secretary and the Group provides access, at its expense, to the services of independent professional advisers in order to assist Directors in their role. Board Committees are also provided with sufficient resources to discharge their duties.\n\nGroup Chief Executive Charlie Nunn\n\nCharlie Nunn manages and leads the Group on a day-to-day basis, making decisions on matters affecting the operation and performance of the Group's business and the delivery of the Board's approved strategy.

The Nomination and Governance Committee assesses the skills, experience and knowledge of the Non-Executive Directors on an individual basis and on a collective basis - please see the table below for the results of the latest assessment, which was approved on 24 November 2021. Having the right balance of skills and experience helps to ensure Directors discharge their duties effectively.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee leads the process for Board appointments, which makes recommendations to the Board. Open advertising and/or an external search consultancy is used for the appointment of the Chair and Non-Executive Directors. Appointments are made on merit and due consideration is given to diversity in its broadest sense, including gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, and cognitive and personal strengths.\n\nMore details about the process for the appointment of Harmeen Mehta as a Non-Executive Director can be found on page 88 .\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee ensures plans are in place for orderly succession to both Board and senior management positions, and oversees the development of a diverse pipeline for succession.

On appointment, each Director receives a formal and tailored induction. In addition, there is a programme of ongoing training for Directors.\n\nThe Directors are committed to their own ongoing professional development and the Chair discusses training with each Non-Executive Director at least annually. The Company Secretary oversees a training plan for the Non-Executive Directors, with the plan for 2021 discussed at the Nomination and Governance Committee at the start of the year with the Non-Executive Directors encouraged to suggest training topics of interest.\n\n## Induction\n\nNew Non-Executive Directors like Harmeen Mehta receive a tailored induction that focuses on the Group's culture and values, stakeholders, strategy, structure, operations and governance. The emphasis is on ensuring the induction brings the business and its issues alive, taking account of the specific role the Director has been appointed to fulfil and their skills and experience to date.\n\nAn induction pack is provided containing key corporate documents and information relating to the Group covering aspects such as the role of a director (including relevant Group policies such as antibribery, conflicts of interest, expenses, gifts and hospitality and share dealing), the Board and its Committees, financials and strategy, governance, risk management, culture, shareholders and training.\n\nMeetings are scheduled with Board Directors, the Group Company Secretary, GEC members, and other senior managers to discuss aspects such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic challenges facing the Group\n- \u00b7 The UK banking regulatory framework and corporate governance including ring-fencing requirements, the Senior Managers and Certification Regime, culture and conduct expectations and whistleblowing\n- \u00b7 Culture and values\n- \u00b7 Risk management\n- \u00b7 Group operations\n- \u00b7 Financials (including meetings with internal and external auditors)\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and diversity\n- \u00b7 Capital management and liquidity\n- \u00b7 Retail Banking and Wealth Management\n- \u00b7 Scottish Widows Group Limited and the Insurance sub-group\n- \u00b7 Commercial Banking\n- \u00b7 Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and the Non-Ring-Fenced Banks sub-group\n- \u00b7 LBG Equity Investments and the Equity sub-group\n\n## Group training modules\n\nNon-Executive Directors are asked to complete training modules on a quarterly basis.

        "page_content": "## Board evaluation\n\nThe annual evaluation, which is typically facilitated externally at least once every three years, provides an opportunity to consider ways of identifying greater efficiencies, maximising strengths and highlighting areas of further development to enable the Board continuously to improve its own performance and the performance of the Group.\n\nThe Chair of the Board, with the support of the Nomination and Governance Committee, leads the Board in considering and responding to the annual review of the Board's effectiveness, which includes a review of its Committees and individual Directors. Performance evaluation of the Chair is carried out by the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, considering the views of the Executive Directors.\n\nThe Board is committed to independent evaluation of its own effectiveness and that of its Committees as recommended by the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018. An external evaluation was last conducted in 2018, with internal evaluations having been carried out in 2019 and 2020.\n\nGiven the appointment of a new Group Chief Executive in August 2021 and the Group's ongoing strategy development, the Board agreed that an evaluation of its effectiveness together with that of its Committees, will be conducted in 2022 instead of in 2021 in order to allow the review to cover the Board's effectiveness in overseeing these developments. External board review specialist Dr Tracy Long of Boardroom Review Limited has been engaged to conduct that evaluation, with the results to be presented to the Board during 2022. Dr Tracy Long is an independent external service provider with no connection to the Group or any individual Directors. Details of the process followed, findings and actions arising from that external evaluation will be included in the Annual Report and Accounts 2022.\n\nGiven the Board's decision to defer the annual evaluation of its effectiveness until 2022, the Chair undertook individual assessments of the Non-Executive Directors in January 2022 and found that the Non-Executive Directors are committed and continue to operate effectively individually and collectively as a board. In January 2022, a performance evaluation of the Chair was undertaken by the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, considering\n\nthe views of the Executive Directors. The evaluation found the Chair's performance to be effective.\n\nIf Directors have concerns about the Company or a proposed action which cannot be resolved, their concerns are recorded in the Board minutes. Also, on resignation, Non-Executive Directors are encouraged to provide a written statement of any concerns to the Chair, for circulation to the Board. No such concerns were raised in 2021 and up to the date of this report.\n\n## Progress against the 2020/uni00A0evaluation\n\nThe main focus in improvements to Board effectiveness in 2021 has been on creating room for more forward-looking and strategic discussions on key matters at Board and Committee meetings. These enhancements have been achieved by (1) enhancing focus by the Board and individual Directors on their primary role of establishing, and providing oversight of, the Group's purpose, values and strategy; and (2) enhancing the clarity of accountability between the Boards and the Group Chief Executive Committees. Further improvements have been made in relation to the quality of Board papers and training for members of the Board and Committees.\n\n| Theme                         | Feedback from the 2020 Evaluation                                          | Actions taken in 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Board  discussion  and debate | \u00b7 Call for further strategic,  forward-looking discussion                  | \u00b7 Board and Committee agendas rationalised to focus more on core  activities and matters reserved for the Board \u00b7 Enhanced the process for appropriate delegation to Committees,  including where possible, delegation to Committees for appropriate  decisions or final decisions where the Board has extensively discussed  and agreed the item in principle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Board papers                  | \u00b7 Improve quality of Board  papers                                         | \u00b7 Streamlined the Board agenda papers \u00b7 Established new form of reports from the Group Chief Executive,  Chief/uni00A0Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer for Board meetings, to be  narrative led, drawing out key insights and expressing views on key issues \u00b7 New board portal implemented to give enhanced functionality for Board  members, including the ability to ask clarification questions directly to  report writers and Board members                                                                                                                                       |\n| Training                      | \u00b7 Further formal technical  training for members of  Boards and Committees | \u00b7 Training has been rolled out to Directors in relation to a range of subject  matter including financial models, data, Group technology strategy,  technology foundations, cloud infrastructure, emerging cyber trends,  payments, sustainability and climate risk, and resolution and a bespoke  programme on customers, clients and colleagues - please see  page 84 for more information about the 'Closer to Customers, Colleagues and  Clients programme' and the training provided to Directors \u00b7 Additional training scheduled for individual Directors as needs  are/uni00A0identified |",

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control\n\n## Audit and risk\n\nThere are formal policies and procedures in place designed to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the internal and external audit functions. Group Internal Audit is a single independent internal audit function, reporting to the Audit Committee. Further detail can be found in the sections headed 'Group Internal Audit' and 'Auditor independence and remuneration' on page 93 .\n\nThe Board has delegated a number of responsibilities to the Audit Committee, including monitoring and reviewing financial reporting, the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management framework, whistleblowing, the internal audit process and the external auditor's process. The Audit Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities, and its report for 2021, confirming how it has discharged its duties, can be found on pages 90 to 93 .\n\nRequirements that the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable are considered throughout the drafting and reviewing process and the Board has concluded that the 2021 Annual Report meets this requirement. The Board is supported in this by its Audit Committee and a sign-off process involving different sections of the Annual Report being approved for inclusion by senior management, with additional review by the Group Disclosure Committee. The statement of Directors' responsibilities can be found on page 133 and the statement of the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements can be found on page 204 . Related information on the Company's business model and strategy can be found on pages 1 to 44 .\n\nThe Board is responsible for the Group's risk management and internal controls systems, including the determination of the nature and extent of risk the Company is willing to take. Risk is further managed through the Board-approved risk management framework, as discussed in the risk management report on pages 134 to 193 . The Board Risk Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk governance and oversight responsibilities, including by the provision of advice to the Board on risk strategy and overseeing the development, implementation and maintenance of the Group's overall risk management framework and its risk appetite. The Board Risk Committee reports regularly to the Board on its activities, and its report for 2021, confirming how it has discharged its duties, can be found on pages 94 to 99 .\n\n## Internal control\n\n## Board responsibility\n\nThe Board is responsible for the Group's risk management and internal control systems, which are designed to facilitate effective and efficient operations and to ensure the quality and integrity of internal and external reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and for the determination of the nature and extent of the principal risks the Group is willing to take in order to achieve its strategy. The Directors and senior management are committed to maintaining a robust control framework as the foundation for the delivery of effective risk management. The Directors acknowledge their responsibilities in relation to the Group's risk management and internal control systems and for reviewing their effectiveness.\n\nIn establishing and reviewing the risk management and internal control systems, the Directors carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation, the likelihood of a risk event occurring and the costs of control. The process for identification, evaluation and management of the emerging and principal risks faced by the Group is integrated into the Group's overall framework for risk governance. The risk identification, evaluation and management process also identifies whether the controls in place result in an acceptable level of risk. At Group level, a consolidated risk report and risk appetite dashboard are reviewed and regularly debated by the Group Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee and the Board to ensure that they are satisfied with the overall risk profile, risk accountabilities and mitigating actions. The report and dashboard provide a monthly view of the Group's overall risk profile, key risks and management actions, together with performance against risk appetite and an assessment of emerging risks which could affect the Group's performance over the life of the operating plan. Information regarding the main features of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process is provided within the risk management report on pages 134 to 193 . The Board concluded that the Group's risk management arrangements are adequate to provide assurance that the risk management systems put in place are suitable with regard to the Group's profile and strategy.\n\n## Control effectiveness review\n\nAll material controls are recorded and assessed on a regular basis in response to triggers or at least annually. Control assessments consider both the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness. Where a control is not effective, the root cause is established and action plans implemented to improve control design or performance. Control Effectiveness against all residual risks are aggregated by risk category, reported and monitored via the monthly Consolidated Risk Report (CRR). The CRR is reviewed and independently challenged by the Risk Division and provided to the Risk Division Executive Committee and Group Risk Committee. On an annual basis, a point in time assessment is made for control effectiveness against each risk category and across the sub-groups. The CRR data is the primary source used for this point in time assessment and a year on year comparison on control effectiveness is reported to the Board.\n\n## Reviews by the Board\n\nThe effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems is reviewed regularly by the Board and the Audit Committee, which also receive reports of reviews undertaken by the Risk Division and Group Internal Audit. The Audit Committee receives reports from the Company's auditor, Deloitte LLP (which include details of significant internal control matters that they have identified), and has a discussion with the auditor at least once a year without executives present, to ensure that there are no unresolved issues of concern.\n\nThe Group's risk management and internal control systems are regularly reviewed by the Board and are consistent with the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting issued by the Financial Reporting Council and compliant with the requirements of CRD IV. They have been in place for the year under review and up to the date of the approval of the Annual Report. The Group, Ring-Fenced Bank sub-group and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc have achieved full compliance with BCBS 239 risk data aggregation and risk reporting requirements, and continue to actively maintain this status.",

The experience and knowledge that Harmeen Mehta's appointment brings to the Board helps illustrate the Committee's focus on not only the necessary collective skills and experience of the Board, but also future strategic needs. The streamlining of the Board Risk Committee membership this year also demonstrates the need for more focused discussion.\n\n## How does the Committee consider broader succession planning?\n\nA The Committee also maintains a strong focus on succession planning at an executive level, again recognising the need to ensure that an appropriate mix of knowledge, skills, experience and diversity is maintained. See page 89 for more details of our approach.\n\n## What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2022?\n\nA Core areas of focus for 2022 will continue to include succession planning at both Board and executive level, managing Board (and Committee) composition and skills, and driving diversity and inclusion at Board level and beyond. Board effectiveness will also be an area of particular focus, with scheduling of the externally facilitated Board evaluation.\n\n## Key activities in 2021\n\n- \u00b7 Board and Committee composition, skills and training\n- \u00b7 Implementation of 2020 Board evaluation recommendations\n- \u00b7 Board and senior executive succession planning\n- \u00b7 Diversity and inclusion\n\n## Introduction\n\nAs highlighted in my introduction to the governance report on page 70 , following the appointment of Charlie Nunn as Group Chief Executive, the year has seen a focus on development of the Group's purpose and strategy. This focus has also shaped the agenda and focus of the Committee's activities during the year, most notably the Committee's consideration of Board and executive level succession planning and discussions, which led to the Board's decision to defer the Board evaluation, as discussed below.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to keep the Board's governance, composition, skills, experience, knowledge, independence and succession arrangements under review and to make appropriate recommendations to the Board to ensure the Company's arrangements are consistent with the highest corporate governance standards.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nAs mentioned in my introduction to the governance report on page 70 , there have been a number of changes to the Board and its Committees during the year; all of these have been overseen by the Committee. Strong succession planning remains a key focus in helping ensure the continuation of an appropriate mix of skills, experience and backgrounds. Further details on the Committee's approach to succession planning can be found on page 89 .\n\nConsideration has been given to planned Board retirements and the impact of these on membership of the Board and its Committees. The Committee's ongoing review of the structure, size and composition of the Board and its Committees helps ensure that the appropriate mix of knowledge, skills, experience and diversity is maintained. A number of other changes, beyond those set out below, have also been made to the membership of Board Committees during the year, as detailed in the summary of Board and Committee composition and attendance on page 77 . The most notable of these was the streamlining of the Board Risk Committee membership.\n\nAs indicated in last year's report, Sara Weller retired as planned from the Board, and as Chair of the Responsible Business Committee, at the AGM in May 2021, with Amanda Mackenzie succeeding her as Chair of the Responsible Business Committee. As announced on 23/uni00A0September 2021, Nick Prettejohn stood down as a Non-Executive Director, effective from 30 September 2021 and Stuart Sinclair notified the Board of his intention to retire from the Board at the AGM in 2022. Stuart stood down as Chair of the Remuneration Committee with effect from 24 November 2021, with Alan Dickinson succeeding him in the role, having been a member of the Remuneration Committee since July 2015. Alan also continues in his role as Deputy Chair and Senior Independent Director.\n\nLast year's report discussed Charlie Nunn's appointment as Group Chief Executive. William Chalmers, Chief Financial Officer, took on the role of acting Group Chief Executive when Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio stepped down on 30 April 2021, until Charlie's appointment became effective on 16 August 2021.\n\nOn 16 June 2021 we announced Harmeen Mehta's appointment as an independent Non-Executive Director, effective from 1 November 2021. Harmeen also joined the Group's Information Technology and Cyber Advisory Forum (ITCAF), and both the Board and the ITCAF will benefit greatly from her impressive depth of experience and knowledge. Further details of the selection process for appointments can be found on page 88 .\n\nIn addition to a focus on succession planning at Board level, the Committee also has a strong focus on succession planning at an executive level. The Committee continues to consider the overall health of the executive talent pipeline, together with detailed executive succession planning. Key considerations include, for example, cultural and strategic capabilities which will help ensure the continued transformation of the Group and the delivery of its strategic aims.",

        "page_content": "## Nomination and Governance Committee report continued\n\n## Board effectiveness and training\n\nAs referred to in my introduction to the governance report on page 70 , the Board has agreed that the next Board evaluation, which will be externally facilitated, should be deferred to 2022. Given the appointment of a new Group Chief Executive and the Group's ongoing strategic development, the Board agreed that such a deferral would allow the review to cover the Board's effectiveness in overseeing management transition and strategy review. The Committee also considered the remaining actions taken in response to feedback from the previous internal review undertaken in 2020. Further improvements have also been made in relation to the quality of Board papers and training for members of the Board and Committees. Full details are provided on page 85 .\n\nThe Committee also oversees training undertaken by the Non-Executive Directors. The Chair discusses training with each Non-Executive Director at least annually and, as set out in the summary of Board training on page 84 , training sessions have been offered across a range of topics of particular interest, in addition to mandatory training requirements. Learning and engagement opportunities have been undertaken by all NonExecutive Directors in relation to material aspects of the Group's business.\n\n## Independence and time commitments\n\nBased on its assessment for 2021, the Committee is satisfied that, throughout the year, all Non-Executive Directors remained independent 1 in character and judgement.\n\n## Appointment process - Harmeen Mehta, Independent Non-Executive Director\n\nIn late 2020, anticipating Sara Weller's intention to retire from the Board following the AGM held in May 2021, the Board initiated a search process led jointly by the Chair and, until his retirement, the former Chair, to identify an additional independent Non-Executive Director. A specific requirement was for the candidate to have digital and technology skills, in addition to continuing to strengthen the Board's overall diversity. Following a competitive tender process, Heidrick & Struggles, who have publicly stated commitments around the provision of diverse board candidates amongst the initial list of prospects, were appointed to assist the Board in identifying\n\na diverse list of potential candidates with the required knowledge, skills and experience. The Chair kept the Board and the Committee regularly informed on progress, with discussions being held throughout. A long list of candidates was considered and narrowed down to a diverse shortlist. Further detailed consideration led to the final shortlist of four candidates each being interviewed by the Chair, the Senior Independent Director and two of the Ring-Fenced Bank Directors, with each being assessed formally against defined competencies. Harmeen Mehta was identified as the preferred candidate, recognising her depth and breadth of\n\nIn recommending Directors for election and re-election at the AGM, the Committee has reviewed the performance of each Non-Executive Director and their ability to continue meeting the time commitments required, taking into consideration individual capabilities, skills and experiences and any potential conflicts of interest that have been disclosed. The external roles held by all Directors were considered to be appropriate. Fuller details of any conflicts of interest can be found on page 131 .\n\n## The Group's Corporate Governance Framework\n\nThe annual review of the Corporate Governance Framework was undertaken during the year and is expected to be finalised during the first half of 2022. The review focused on streamlining, simplifying and making the framework more accessible, while continuing to ensure full compliance with the relevant obligations and best practice. There were no material changes to the framework during the year.\n\nAs part of its broader governance responsibilities, the Committee considered regular updates on developments in corporate governance, including the FCA consultation on diversity and inclusion on company boards and executive committees and the BEIS consultation on restoring trust in audit and corporate governance, and also considered correspondence with shareholders.\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company applied the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 for the year ending 31 December 2021 and complied with all the provisions with two exceptions. A detailed summary setting out the Company's compliance, together with details of these exceptions, can be found on page 71 .\n\nThe Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges its responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board, all of which have been accepted during the year. The Committee's terms of reference can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup. com/who-we-are/group-overview/ corporate-governance.\n\n## Committee composition, skills and experience\n\nTo ensure a broad representation of experienced and independent Directors, membership of the Committee currently comprises the Chair, Deputy Chair (who is also the Senior Independent Director), the Chair of the Responsible Business Committee, together with a further independent Non-Executive Director. The Senior Independent Director of the RingFenced Banks also attends meetings as an observer in order to provide insights on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks when required and as part of his role in the Group's overall governance structure.\n\nThe Group Chief Executive attends meetings as appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance during the year can be found on page 77 .\n\nrelevant knowledge, skills and experience. The Committee's recommendation for Harmeen's appointment was subsequently approved by the Board.\n\nThroughout what was a formal, rigorous and transparent appointment process, consideration was given to a broad range of factors such as merit and objective criteria, consideration of diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths, and the Group's future strategic direction. Heidrick & Struggles has no further connection with the Group or individual Directors beyond undertaking search and recruitment related activity.",

        "page_content": "## Succession planning\n\nArrangements put in place to cover the interim period prior to Charlie Nunn joining the Group illustrate how effective succession planning can be used to address short-term requirements. Effective succession planning also contributes to the ability of the Group to deliver on its strategic objectives over the medium and longer term by ensuring the desired mix of skills and experience of Board members now and in the future, of particular relevance in the context of the Group's strategic development. The Board is also committed to recognising and nurturing talent within the executive and management levels across the Group to ensure that the Group creates opportunities to develop current and future leaders.\n\nThe Committee supports the Chair in keeping the composition of the Board and its Committees under regular review and in leading the appointment process for nominations to the Board. This helps ensure continued focus on increasing the overall diversity of the Board, and capacity for future succession planning.\n\n## Board diversity policy\n\nThe Board diversity policy (the Policy) sets out the Board's approach to diversity and provides a high-level indication of the Board's approach to inclusion and diversity in senior management roles which is governed in greater detail through the Group's policies.\n\nThe Board places great emphasis on ensuring that its membership reflects diversity in its broadest sense. Consideration is given to the combination of demographics, skills, experience, race, age, gender, educational and professional background and other relevant personal attributes on the Board to provide the range of perspectives, insights and challenge needed to support good decision-making.\n\nNew appointments are made on merit, taking account of the specific skills and experience, independence and knowledge needed to ensure a rounded Board and the diverse benefits each candidate can bring to the overall Board composition.\n\nObjectives for achieving Board diversity may be set on a regular basis. On gender diversity, the Board is committed to maintaining at least three female Board members and over time will aim to reach 50 per cent male and female representation on the Board to match the 50 per cent ambition that the Group has set for female senior executives.\n\nThe/uni00A0appointment process set out on the previous page helps illustrate how this works in practice.\n\nThe Chair leads an ongoing assessment of the collective Board's technical and governance skill set. From this, the Chair creates a Board skills matrix which is used to track the Board's strengths and identify any gaps in the desired collective skills profile of the Board. Various factors are taken into consideration such as the Group's future strategic direction, and helping ensure due weight is given to diversity in its broadest sense. The skills matrix is considered in the appointment of all Board members. The Group's diversity commitments and outcomes of the Board evaluation process are also taken into consideration.\n\nThe role of succession planning in promoting diversity is fully recognised. The/uni00A0Group has a range of policies which promote the engagement of underrepresented groups within the business in order to build a diverse talent pipeline. Further details can be found on page 34 .\n\nReflecting these aspirations, the Board will aim to meet any recommendations set out by the FTSE Women Leaders review (formerly the Hampton-Alexander Review). Female representation on the Board is currently 40 per cent (based on four female Directors and six male Directors).\n\nThe Group has also set a target of 13 per cent of senior roles to be held by Black, Asian and minority ethnic executives by 2025. The Board will therefore aim over time to reflect this goal with regard to Board members. As at 31 December 2021, the Board met, and continues to meet, the objectives of the Parker Review with at least one Black, Asian and minority ethnic Board member.\n\nAs noted, the Board places high emphasis on ensuring the development of diversity in the senior management roles within the Group and supports and oversees the Group's ambition of achieving 50 per cent of senior roles held by female executives by 2025, and of 13 per cent of senior roles held by Black, Asian and minority ethnic executives by 2025 (including a minimum of 3 per cent of senior roles being held by Black heritage colleagues). This is underpinned by a range of policies within the Group to help provide mentoring and development opportunities for female and Black, Asian and minority ethnic executives and to ensure unbiased career progression opportunities. Progress on this objective is monitored by the Board and built into its assessment of executive performance.\n\nThe Committee continued to focus on the adequacy of succession arrangements for key senior management roles. During the year, consideration was given to the overall strengthening of succession plans, and ensuring an appropriate focus on continuing to improve diversity, in addition to the need to recognise the potential opportunities that development of the Group's strategy may provide. This was also discussed at a full Board meeting during the year.\n\nThe Chair is responsible for developing and maintaining a succession plan for the Group Chief Executive who is, in turn, primarily responsible for developing and maintaining succession plans for key leadership positions in the senior executive team.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, female representation within the Group Executive Committee and their direct reports was 35 per cent in total (with 20 per cent for the Group Executive Committee and 37.1 per cent for their direct reports). Female representation across all senior roles was 37.7 per cent, and Black, Asian and minority ethnic representation in senior roles was 8.8 per cent. The Group's Race Action Plan, which was launched during 2020, aims to drive cultural change, recruitment and progression across the Group. This includes a goal to increase Black representation in senior roles from 0.6 per cent to at least 3 per cent by 2025, aligning the Group with the overall UK labour market. Further details of the Race Action Plan, and the Group's further achievements in championing inclusion and diversity in its widest sense, can be found on page 34 .\n\nA copy of the Policy is available on our website at www.lloydsbankinggroup. com/who-we-are/responsible-business/ downloads and further information on the Board's broader approach to diversity and inclusion as part of its strategic priorities, and continued investment in being a leading inclusive employer, can be found on page 34 .",

Work in this regard has ensured that changing economic conditions have been reflected appropriately and in a timely manner. Improvements in reporting processes, resulting in greater agility, have been achieved. Mitigation of the impact of the pandemic on the reporting and control environment continued to be an important focus for the Committee.\n\n## External disclosure requirements continued to evolve throughout the year - how has the Committee responded?\n\nA Climate-related disclosures received increased attention from the Committee in 2021. In particular, the work to assess the impact of climate change on the Financial Statements was reviewed, including the development of the control environment to support climate-related disclosures.\n\n## How has the Committee overseen the transition of the external audit to Deloitte LLP?\n\nA A smooth transition requires careful planning and co-ordination across both organisations. The Committee has overseen this transition, approving the audit plan and receiving regular progress reports from Deloitte LLP. Committee members also meet with the external auditors periodically, providing good opportunity for further insight on topical matters.\n\n## Key activities in 2021\n\n- \u00b7 Assessing the impact of the pandemic on the financial statements, including expected credit losses and other key aspects of financial reporting.\n- \u00b7 Responding to the evolving disclosure requirements, including climate-related disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the continuous improvement in financial and regulatory reporting, and effectiveness of the internal controls.\n\n## Introduction\n\nI am pleased to report on how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities during what continues to be challenging times, and I would like to thank fellow Committee members for their contributions, including Nick Prettejohn who stepped down during the course of the year. The Committee has also benefitted from insight brought by the Ring-Fenced Bank Directors, who attend the Committee as observers in order to provide insights on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks and as part of their role in the Group's overall governance structure, and from attendance by the chairs of the audit committees of Scottish Widows and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets.\n\nLooking forward to 2022, along with core responsibilities for the integrity of the financial reporting and control environment, the Committee will continue to focus on areas of continuous improvement on an end to end basis. We will engage further on the BEIS proposals on audit reform, and with climate-related disclosure. Towards the end of 2021, we began the process of appointing a new Chief Internal Auditor.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to monitor and review the Group's financial and narrative reporting arrangements, the effectiveness of the internal controls (including over financial reporting) and the risk management framework, whistleblowing arrangements and each of the internal and external audit processes. This includes the statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements and the independence of the statutory external auditor. The Committee reports to the Board on how it discharges its responsibilities and makes recommendations to the Board, all of which have been accepted during the year. A full list of responsibilities is detailed in the Committee's terms of reference, which can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/ who-we-are/group-overview/corporategovernance. In satisfying its purpose, the Committee undertakes the functions\n\ndetailed within Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 7.1.3R.\n\nDuring the year the Committee considered a number of issues relating to the Group's financial reporting. These issues are summarised on the following pages, including discussion of the conclusions the Committee reached, and the key factors considered in reaching these conclusions. In addition, the Committee considered a number of other issues not related directly to financial reporting, including internal controls, internal audit and external audit. These issues are also discussed in detail on the final page of the report.\n\n## Committee composition, skills, experience and operation\n\nThe Committee acts independently of the executive to ensure the interests of the shareholders are properly protected in relation to financial reporting and internal control.\n\nAll members of the Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors with competence in the financial sector, and their biographies can be found on pages 72 to 73 . Sarah Legg is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants and of the Association of Corporate Treasurers, with extensive knowledge of financial markets, treasury, risk management and international accounting standards. She is a member having recent and relevant financial experience for the purposes of the/uni00A0UK Corporate Governance Code, and is the Audit Committee financial expert for SEC/uni00A0purposes.\n\nDuring the course of the year, the Committee held separate sessions with the internal and external audit teams, without members of the executive management present. For details of how the Committee was run, see page 76 .\n\nThe Committee normally undertakes an annual effectiveness review as part of the Board Evaluation process. In line with the approach agreed by Board to defer the review which was due in 2021, the Committee's next effectiveness review will be conducted in 2022. Details of the rationale for this approach are set out in the Board Evaluation section of the Corporate Governance Report on page/uni00A085 .\n\nWhile the Committee's membership comprises the Non-Executive Directors noted on page 77 , all Non-Executive Directors may attend meetings as agreed with the Chair of the Committee. The Group Financial Controller, Chief Internal Auditor, the external auditor, the Group Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Risk Officer also attend meetings as appropriate.

Allowance for  impairment  on loans and  advances | Key issues The Group's impairment  provision is dependent on  management's judgements  on matters such as GDP,  unemployment, house prices  and interest rates, as well as  its assessment of a customer's  current financial position and  whether the exposure has  suffered a significant increase  in credit risk. The Group's total  impairment allowance at 31  December 2021 was \u00a34,042  million (2020: \u00a36,247 million). | Committee review and conclusion Throughout the year, the Committee has challenged the Group's  expectations of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as it has  continued to evolve and reviewed the economic assumptions used to  calculate the Group's expected credit loss (ECL). At 31 December 2021, the Group's ECL allowances resulting from  management judgements accounted for \u00a31,284 million, or 32 per cent, of  the Group's total ECL (31 December 2020: \u00a31,383 million, or 22 per cent).  The Committee has reviewed management's rationale for these provisions  and has challenged whether the additional provisions are appropriate.  Note 3 to the financial statements includes further detail on the judgements  made by management and the amounts provided for each of the  judgements made. Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that the impairment provision  and the disclosures provided in the financial statements were appropriate. |\n| Conduct risk  provisions                          | During 2021, the Group  made provisions of \u00a31,300  million (2020: \u00a3464 million),  including \u00a3790 million for the  HBOS Reading review (2020:  \u00a3159 million). Management  judgement is used to determine  the population likely to be  impacted by conduct risk  matters, the cost of remediation  and, where appropriate, any  related administration costs.                                                                    | The Committee has received regular updates on the progress being made  on the Group's conduct risk matters including the ongoing review of the  Group's handling of HBOS Reading and the General Insurance renewal  errors which resulted in a \u00a391 million FCA fine. Following the emergence of  the first outcomes from an independent panel that is reassessing direct and  consequential losses relating to HBOS Reading, the Group has charged a  further \u00a3790 million in the year ended 31 December 2021.  Conclusion: The Committee has considered management's assessment  of the Group's provisions required for its conduct-related matters and was  satisfied that the provisions were appropriate. The Group's disclosure is set  out in note 36 to the financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

The viability statement must  also disclose the basis for the  Directors' conclusions and  explain why the period chosen is  appropriate.                                                  | The Committee assisted the Board in determining the appropriateness  of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and in performing  the assessment of the viability of the Company and the Group. These  assessments were based on the Group's operating, funding and capital  plans which included consideration of the implications of the COVID-19  pandemic and climate-related matters on the Group's performance and  its projected funding and capital position. The Committee also took into  account the results of the Group's stress testing activities and the principal  and emerging risks, which are set out on  pages 140 to 141 ,  page 135 to  193  and  pages 141 to 142  respectively.

In particular, it considered  the Group's claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish  banking subsidiary. Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that the provisions and  disclosures made in respect of uncertain tax positions were appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Retirement  benefit  obligations                        | The value of the Group's defined  benefit pension plan obligations  is determined by making  financial and demographic  assumptions, both of which  are significant estimates  made by management. The  defined benefit obligation at  31 December 2021 was \u00a347,130  million (31 December 2020:  \u00a349,549 million).                                                                                                        | The Committee reviewed the process used by management to determine  appropriate assumptions to calculate the Group's defined benefit liabilities.  During 2021, these included the discount rate, the future rate of inflation  and expected mortality rates. Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that management had used  appropriate assumptions that reflected the Group's most recent experience  and were consistent with market data and other information. The  Committee was also satisfied that the Group's disclosures made in respect  of retirement benefit obligations are appropriate. The relevant disclosures  are set out in note 34 of the financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Value-in-force  (VIF) asset  and insurance  liabilities | Determining the value of the VIF  asset and insurance liabilities  requires management to make  significant estimates for both  economic and non-economic  actuarial assumptions. At 31  December 2021, the Group's VIF  asset was \u00a35,514 million (2020:  \u00a35,617 million) and its liabilities  arising from insurance contracts  and participating investment  contracts were \u00a3123,423 million  (2020: \u00a3116,060 million). | The Committee considered updates from management and from the  Group's Insurance Audit Committee summarising its activities, which  included a review of the economic and non-economic assumptions  made by management to determine the Group's VIF asset and insurance  liabilities. The most significant assumptions were in respect of workplace  pension persistency, annuitant longevity and expenses. Conclusion: The Committee was satisfied that the assumptions used to  calculate the VIF asset and liabilities arising from insurance contracts and  participating investment contracts were appropriate. The disclosures are  set out in note 23 and note 30.                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n## Other significant issues\n\nThe following matters were also considered by the Committee.\n\n## Risk management and internal control systems\n\nFull details of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to the financial reporting process are given within the risk management section on pages 135 to 193 .

        "page_content": "## Risk-weighted assets (RWA) and regulatory reporting\n\nSince 2019, the PRA has increased its focus on the quality of regulatory reporting, emphasising the need for it to be complete, timely and accurate. A number of skilled person independent reviews have been commissioned across the industry to review the governance, controls and processes supporting the regulator reporting framework within firms. As part of our continued focus on strengthening our control environment in both financial and regulatory reporting, management have established a Regulatory Reporting Review project. Involving first, second and third line, this project is reviewing our current regulatory reporting activities and where necessary, enhancing our governance and control framework. Management provided regular updates to the Committee over the year to highlight progress made in improving the reporting control environment across a number of regulatory reports.\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the enhancements that management has made to the Group's alternative performance measures (APMs) disclosures during the year. Enhancements have included additional reconciliations between statutory measures and APMs, clear labelling of which of the Group's key performance indicators are APMs and increasing the prominence of the Group's statutory disclosures. In the Group's Annual Report and Accounts, a separate section has been created containing a description of the Group's APMs, the information that each of them provides and how the APM is used internally. The Committee was satisfied with the approach to APMs and the associated year-end disclosures.\n\n## Climate-related financial disclosures\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee received updates on the Group's plans to develop its climate-related financial disclosures and has reviewed the Group's Climate Report, which is in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The report sets out the climaterelated governance, strategy and ambitions of the Group and outlines the progress to date against these ambitions as well as the work being done to manage climate-related risks. The Committee has also reviewed the results of the Group's financial reporting climate risk assessment and the disclosure enhancements that the Group has made to its financial statements. The Group will continue to enhance its climate-related disclosures which will remain an area of focus for the Committee.\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nIn monitoring the activity, role and effectiveness of the internal audit function and their audit programme the Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed progress against the plan through the year through updates including quarterly reports on the activities undertaken and six-monthly reports from the internal audit Quality Assurance team\n- \u00b7 Approved the annual audit plan and budget, including resource\n- \u00b7 Considered the major findings of significant internal audits, and management's response\n- \u00b7 Engaged a third party to opine on the effectiveness of the internal audit function, considered the result and monitored progress to address the findings raised\n- \u00b7 Monitored the progress of internal audit's coverage of key risk themes across the Group, including Data Quality & Ethics, Cyber & Information Security, Operational Resilience, Strategic Delivery and Customer Treatment\n\n## Speak Up (the Group's whistleblowing service)\n\nThe Committee received and considered reports from management on the Group's whistleblowing arrangements. The Committee reviewed the reports to ensure there are arrangements in place which colleagues can use in confidence and without fear of retaliation, to report concerns about inappropriate and unacceptable practices, that these arrangements are well-publicised and that there is proportionate and independent investigation of such matters or appropriate follow up. The Committee reported on its consideration of whistleblowing arrangements to the Board.\n\n## Auditor independence and remuneration\n\nThe Committee is responsible for establishing the Group's policies and procedures designed to protect the independence and objectivity of the external auditor. In April 2021, the Committee updated its non-audit services policy to reflect the process for PwC resigning as auditor from each of the Group's legal entities. No other substantive changes were made to the policy.\n\nThe policy details those services that the auditor is permitted to carry out and pre-approves certain of these services provided the fee is below a threshold; all other permitted services must be specifically approved in advance by the Committee. Prior to the engagement of the auditor for a permitted service, the policy requires that senior management confirms whether the Committee has preapproved the service or specific approval is required. The total amount of fees paid to the auditor for both audit and nonaudit related services in 2021 and further information on the policy is disclosed in note 12 to the financial statements.\n\n## External auditor\n\nFollowing an external audit tender in 2018, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte) was appointed as auditor of the Company and the Group with effect from the 2021 financial year. Mike Lloyd is the statutory audit partner for the Group and attends all meetings of the Committee.\n\nThe Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditor, including its terms of engagement and remuneration, and monitors its independence and objectivity. During 2021, the Committee reviewed Deloitte's audit plan, including the underlying methodology, and Deloitte's risk identification processes. In its assessment of Deloitte's performance and effectiveness, the Committee has considered: Deloitte's interactions with the Committee; the responses to a questionnaire issued to the Group's businesses, Finance, Risk and Internal Audit; and the Financial Reporting Council's Audit Quality Inspection Report published in July 2021. The Committee concluded that it was satisfied with the auditor's performance and recommended to the Board a proposal for the reappointment of the auditor at the Company's Annual General Meeting.\n\n## FRC corporate reporting review\n\nThe Committee reviewed a letter received from the FRC on its review of the Group's 2020 Annual Report and Accounts. The FRC's review was based solely on the contents of the Annual Report and Accounts. The FRC had no questions or queries that they wished to raise with the Group. The FRC highlighted a number of areas where it believed that users would benefit from further improvements to the disclosures; where appropriate, the Group has enhanced these disclosures in its 2021 Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## Statutory Audit Services compliance\n\nThe Company and the Group confirm compliance with the provisions of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, which relates to the frequency and governance of tenders for the appointment of the external auditor and the setting of a policy on the provision of non-audit services, for the year to 31 December 2021. There are no plans as at the date of this report to conduct a tender exercise for external audit services.",

Several changes were implemented during the year, simplifying how the Committee operates and, in doing so, helping ensure that time is focused on the most important matters. This helps strengthen and drive more effective support for the Board, coupled with a more forward-looking\n\nagenda. Changes included a review of the volume of routine items considered by the Committee, allowing greater time to be spent on key risk topics with an emphasis on deep dives and greater analysis of these areas. The membership of the Committee has also been reduced, together with the removal of subcommittees, and more opportunities being created for Committee members to have unstructured conversations with management. In addition, as part of the broader review of the Corporate Governance Framework, the Committee's terms of reference have been reviewed and are being updated, with a particular focus on alignment with the Risk Coalition Principles as well as other legal, regulatory and best practice standards.\n\nThe past year has continued to see the pandemic impact the Group's business, its customers, and the wider economy. This, together with the impacts of the EU exit, continue to be a key focus for the Group and the Committee. In addition, the increased focus and pace of activity around climate risk has been, and will throughout 2022 continue to be, central to/uni00A0the Committee's activities.\n\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the former members of the Committee for their contribution, and specifically Nick Prettejohn, the former Committee Chair, for his ongoing support throughout 2021, as I took on the role of Chair of the Committee.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe overriding purpose of the Committee is to assist the Group's Board in fulfilling its risk governance and oversight roles and responsibilities. The Committee is also responsible for ensuring the risk culture is fully embedded and supports at all times the Group's agreed risk appetite, covering the extent and categories of risk which the Board considers as acceptable for the Group. The enhancements made this year to the way the Committee operates have strengthened the support provided to the/uni00A0Board.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting its conclusions to the Board on the Group's risk management framework, which embraces risk principles, policies, methodologies, systems, processes, procedures and people. It also includes the review of new, or material, amendments to risk principles and policies, and overseeing any action resulting from material breaches of such policy.\n\nMore details on the Group's wider approach to risk management can be found in the risk management section on/uni00A0 pages 134 to 193 . Full details of the Committee's responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference, which can be found at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/ who-we-are/group-overview/corporategovernance.",

        "page_content": "## Committee composition, skills, experience and operation\n\nAs mentioned in my introduction, the composition of the Committee was reduced during the year, currently consisting of three Non-Executive Directors, providing core banking and risk/uni00A0knowledge, together with a breadth of/uni00A0experience which brings a clear awareness of the importance of putting the customer at the centre of all that the Group does. Two of the three designated independent Non-Executive Directors of the Ring-Fenced Banks also attend meetings as observers in order to provide insights on matters relevant to the Ring-Fenced Banks when required and as part of their role in the Group's overall governance structure. The Chief Risk Officer has full access to the Committee and attends all meetings. The/uni00A0Chief Internal Auditor and members of the executive also attend meetings as/uni00A0appropriate.\n\nThe Committee normally undertakes an annual effectiveness review as part of the Board evaluation process. In line with the approach agreed by the Board to defer the review, which was due in 2021, the Committee's next effectiveness review will be conducted, and presented to the Committee, in 2022.\n\nDetails of the rationale for this approach are set out in the Board evaluation section of the corporate governance report on page 85 . Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance during the year can be found on page 77 .\n\nAs the most senior risk committee in the Group, the Committee interacts with other related risk committees, including the executive Group Risk Committee. These interactions assist with the agenda planning process, where matters considered by the Group Risk Committee are reviewed to ensure escalation of all relevant matters to the Committee.\n\n## Matters considered by the Committee\n\nOver the course of the year the Committee considered a wide range of risks facing the Group and its Ring-Fenced Banks, both current and forward looking, across all key areas of risk management, in addition to risk culture and risk appetite. In particular, the Committee considered a full refresh of the risk appetite statement to ensure Board-level risk appetite remained appropriately focused on key risks and emerging areas of focus.\n\nAs a result of these reviews, and through the development of the Committee's overall approach to fulfilling its responsibilities, certain risks were identified which required further detailed consideration.\n\nSet out below and on the following pages is a summary of the risks considered by the Committee, with an outline of the material factors considered, and the conclusions which were ultimately reached. During 2021, recognising the greater focus on key risk topics at regular Committee meetings, the Committee ceased to use sub-committees.

programme, which has delivered extensive improvements to support  customers returning to financial health as quickly as possible. This included enhancing  colleague and system capability and ensuring adequate resourcing to support customers  rolling off COVID-19 payment holidays. The Committee noted continued progress made in  improving customer outcomes through strategic changes such as simplified toolkits, an  improved operating model and greater support for vulnerable customers. The Committee  also acknowledged an improved oversight model, providing greater insight and monitoring of  all customers falling into financial difficulty. The Group has robust mechanisms in place to  manage and monitor traditional sources of conduct risk. A deep dive on emerging conduct  risk themes, trends and proposed management actions was also discussed during the year. Conclusion:  The Committee recognises the significant work completed to deliver large-scale  improvements for the treatment of customers in financial difficulty. Given the current  economic outlook, focus will remain on ensuring effective support is provided for customers  in financial difficulty and ensuring fair and appropriate customer outcomes are delivered. |\n| Rectifications                       | The Group's  management of  customer  rectifications. /uni00A0 /uni00A0                                                                          | Throughout 2021, the Committee has received updates on the Group's rectifications portfolio  performance, with particular interest in reducing the number of customers awaiting  remediation.

This will remain an area of focus for the Committee in 2022.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\nthe Committee continues to be supported by the IT and Cyber Advisory Forum, which dedicates additional time and resource to reviewing and challenging risks associated with IT infrastructure, IT strategy, IT resilience and cyber risks, as highlighted on page 79 in Our focus on technology. The Chair and other members of the Committee attend this Forum.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee Chair is a member of the Audit Committee, in addition to the Audit Committee Chair being a member of the Board Risk Committee; this close interaction helps ensure that common issues of interest are addressed appropriately. In addition, there is regular interaction with the Responsible Business Committee, especially on climate change matters, and with the Remuneration Committee on the alignment of remuneration to risk performance.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed regular updates from the non-Ring-Fenced Bank and Insurance sub-groups, headed up by Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc and Scottish Widows Group Limited respectively, summarising key discussions and decisions taken at the relevant entities' risk committees.",

This has included progress made against the requirements of the PRA Supervisory Statement on enhancing banks' and insurers' approaches to managing the financial risks from climate change, and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nThe Committee has provided input on the climate risk strategy and its support for the ongoing and proposed work on targets and metrics. The Committee has been informed on discussions regarding high-level participation choices, developing sector strategies and portfolio alignment considerations from both a sector and product perspective.\n\nThe Committee continues to ensure that the Group's risk management capabilities are developing at pace, and that it is adopting a proactive response to the challenges, risks and opportunities arising from climate change. The Committee was engaged on the development of climate-related management information for input into future expectations and on the Group's approach to setting further quantitative and qualitative risk appetite metrics as capabilities evolve. The Committee has also been involved in the development of stress testing capabilities for climate risk, which were used in the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES).\n\nConclusion: The Committee has been satisfied with the progress made in 2021, however focus will remain on ensuring the pace of work is maintained in 2022 and beyond. The Committee will continue to closely monitor climate-related risks, assessing both the impact on the Group and its customers, and the delivery of climate-related commitments, data requirements and Board risk appetite metrics.\n\n## Financial risk - covering credit and market risk\n\nCommercial credit quality\n\nRisks and external threats to the commercial credit performance, including pandemic-related impacts, together with sectors potentially exposed to the impact of EU exit and climate risks.\n\nThe Committee provided oversight of the Commercial Banking portfolio via regular credit quality papers, sector deep dives, spotlight reviews, including large single name exposures, and updates on climate risk and opportunities.\n\nDetailed reviews have allowed the Committee to assess risk levels and credit exposures, including repayment performance of pandemic-related Government-backed funding, as well as levels of credit risk rating downgrades and clients requiring closer risk management; noting that excess market liquidity and support schemes continue to distort true underlying portfolio risk. The Committee noted that anticipated flows into arrears have not yet materialised; but defaults are expected to increase throughout 2022, as a result of support scheme closures and other economic headwinds, including inflation risk and supply chain issues across the system.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed pandemic-related and emerging risks across a range of sectors, including those considered more vulnerable to the wider economic backdrop or structural change, those potentially exposed to the impacts of the UK's exit from the EU, and those exposed to increased levels of physical and transitional climate risk. Specific consideration was also given to the Group's Commercial Real Estate lending and commercial exposure to the automotive sector.\n\nConclusion: While recognising the risks in the portfolio, the Committee was satisfied that management were continuing to take appropriate action to mitigate and address current and horizon risks, while preparing to manage an expected increase in defaults.",

Multiple updates were presented to the Committee  covering operational resilience investment and risk; third and fourth-party supplier risk  management and the Group's outsourcing strategy; and cyber risk and IT resilience deep- dives. Given the significance of the risk to the Group, the Committee is supported by the IT  and Cyber Advisory Forum specifically focused on IT and cyber risks.  Conclusion:  The Committee remains highly focused on the operational resilience of the  Group's services and has drawn valuable insight from the discussions this year. The Committee  considers that governance of operational resilience risk is robust and meets new regulatory  requirements, and that activities in plan will support the ongoing resilience of key services to  the Group's customers.                               |\n| Data risk                   | The Group's data  governance,  management,  privacy and ethics  risks, including  compliance with  the General Data  Protection  Regulation (GDPR),  Basel Committee  of Banking  Supervision                                | Data risk continues to be an area of significant regulatory and media attention. The Group has  developed a data strategy to provide the common framework and direction required to  improve data across the Group. The Committee considered a deep dive of this and is  supportive of the strategy, which includes building robust data foundations, enhancing data  architecture and tooling, improved data culture and delivering increased insights to our  colleagues and customers./uni00A0The Committee acknowledges the need for continued investment  in managing risks relating to improving data quality, ethical use of data, advanced analytics  and artificial intelligence together with continued monitoring of regulatory developments. Conclusion:  The Committee supports the strengthening of the delivery of the data/uni00A0strategy  and uplifting data culture and capability in order to deliver the Group's strategic  transformation.                                                                                                           |\n| People risk                 | Ensuring the  Group has/uni00A0the  right capabilities  and culture as we  continue our  transformation and  adopt/uni00A0new ways  of/uni00A0working.                                                                       | People risk remains an area of heightened focus as impacts from the pandemic continue to be  felt across the Group's workforce. Future ways of working and return to offices have been key  considerations and close monitoring of colleague sentiment around these continue. Updates  to the Committee have focused on deep dives into the people risk profile and people risks  relating to the Group's cloud transformation, with retention risk across key subject matter  experts closely monitored.  Conclusion:  The Committee is satisfied that the people risk profile is being managed  effectively as the Group manages the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, monitors retention,  develops new ways of working and builds skills and capabilities for the future.

The Committee considers change and execution risk within  other linked risk types, such as operational resilience and supplier risks, and when investment  activities are discussed. The 2020 focus on effective and efficient reprioritisation and  management of change activity during the pandemic has continued throughout 2021,  supporting safe delivery of prioritised change activity. In addition, 2021 has seen significant  focus on planning for evolution and enhancement of the change risk and control framework,  together with focus on change capability to support the Group's business and technology  transformation plans. Particular consideration was given to the impact of public cloud  adoption on the Group's risk profile, with a review of the key risks also covered by the IT and  Cyber Advisory/uni00A0Forum. |",

impact to genuine  customer journeys.  The Group's  management of  financial crime                                                                   | The Committee recognises the Group's continued efforts to fight fraud and reduce the impact  it has on the bank's customers, especially with regard to Authorised Push Payment (APP)  scams, while also acknowledging that there has been a significant growth in APP scam cases  across the industry in the past year. However, against this backdrop, the Group has continued  to improve its preventative and detective methodologies and therefore the value of the  Group's cases has not increased at the same rate.  The Committee received an update on pandemic-related government-backed lending  schemes and acknowledged the Group's commitment to working with law enforcement and  government agencies to share intelligence and combine investigations. The Committee noted  that fraud within these schemes remains low/uni00A0and within appetite.  Conclusion:  The Committee accepts that further and continuous investment in our/uni00A0fraud  defences, tools and resources is needed. It was also agreed that the Group should develop an  enhanced external engagement strategy, to champion a/uni00A0cross-industry response to this  growing threat.

Fairness and sustainability being at the heart of how decisions are/uni00A0made.\n\nQ&A\n\n## What are your main reflections since becoming Chair of the Committee?\n\nA For many years the Group has been in the service of Britain. It has been at the forefront of responsible business best practice. From the setting up of the Foundations to being the first FTSE 100 to set gender and race targets and it was the first UK bank to have set an ambition to reduce the emissions we finance by more than 50 per cent by 2030. The Committee can best support the Group's evolving purpose and strategy by constantly learning and challenging ourselves that we are living up to its promise.\n\n## What role did the Committee play in the evolution of the Group's purpose?\n\nA There is a lot of expertise across the Board which supported the executive plans to embed our purpose across the Group. What is expected today in response to the current environment and changing customer needs requires us together to be more thoughtful, more demanding, and more determined.\n\nOur ambition to become a purpose-driven organisation was therefore a significant area of discussion and debate. The measurement that we agree for this next phase of the strategy will be reviewed at the Committee so our role will continue in supporting the Board in ensuring that the Group's agreed intentions are on course and effectively carried out.\n\n## What are the key areas of focus for the Committee in 2022?\n\n- A The key elements of our responsible business strategy will include plans for net zero; nature stewardship; wellbeing; inclusion and our role as a responsible employer. We will review employee satisfaction surveys, gender and race metrics and cultural indicators.\n\nOur role in society as we embed our purpose will be in helping tackle the social and economic issues facing the UK as one of the country's leading financial services providers.\n\n## Introduction\n\nI assumed the role of Chair of the Responsible Business Committee in May 2021. I am pleased to report on how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities during the year. Firstly, I would like to thank Sara Weller on behalf of the Committee for her excellent work in chairing the Committee since its establishment in July 2015.\n\nWe took the opportunity on Sara's retirement to reflect on the Group's evolution from a company that practises corporate responsibility to one where purpose is integral to business strategy. In handing the Chair to me, Sara rightly observed we are merely 'stewards'. I will do my very best to be a good steward and see my role and that of the Committee as helping the Group build an impressive legacy.\n\nOur key areas of focus in 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Responsible business activity - In overseeing the Group's approach to delivering a positive impact in communities, we were especially interested in the digital skills programme and the development and delivery of the vulnerable customer strategy, with focus on online fraud cases linked to vulnerability.\n- \u00b7 Helping Britain Recover commitments - In our oversight of the overall approach to Helping Britain Recover and performance against the commitments, attention was given to refining the commitments and underlying metrics, encouraging the executive to think about the interplay of environmental sustainability and building an inclusive society.\n- \u00b7 Environmental sustainability - It's clear sustainability is a strategic priority, and we must think of it as a growth driver as well as a risk to be managed. The Committee support the Group's net-zero ambitions and sought assurance from the executive that there will be clear and transparent accountability, as well as targets and metrics to drive the right\n\nbehaviours. Our 'deep dive' into the Motor Sector Emissions Target, which is very significant as regards Scope 3, helped us understand the methodology more fully and gain confidence in the proposed approach, creating a useful benchmark for other market sectors.\n\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and diversity - The Committee was pleased with the progress being made and the significant and broad range of activities delivered through the Group's Race Action Plan. We asked the executive to ensure the pace of action and the role the Group could play more generally and in society as a diverse and inclusive employer. The target for Black heritage colleagues was endorsed and encouraged by the Committee. Both gender and race targets are part of the Helping Britain Recover commitments.\n- \u00b7 Culture - We supported the progress being made on the wider cultural activity and stressed the importance of continuing the transformative work, which had accelerated in response to COVID-19 and now needs to connect the purpose to colleagues' individual roles.\n- \u00b7 Workforce engagement - In 2021 the Committee became the designated body to fulfil the Board's workforce engagement obligations and receives quarterly updates on engagement activity, reporting at least annually to the Board on key themes and issues. Please refer to page 27 for more details on how the Board engages with the Group's workforce.\n\n## Committee purpose and responsibilities\n\nThe Committee's purpose is to support the Board in overseeing the Company's policies, performance and priorities as a responsible business and to oversee the Company's activities in relation to all stakeholders including customers, shareholders, colleagues, suppliers, the wider community and the environment. The Committee's terms of reference can be found at www. lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/ group-overview/corporate-governance.\n\n## Committee composition, skills, experience and operation\n\nThe Committee, which met on four occasions in 2021, is composed of Non-Executive Directors and is attended by the Group Chief Executive. It benefits from a broad range of differing perspectives, insight and experience, with representatives from Group Internal Audit and the Chief Operating Office attending meetings as appropriate. Details of Committee membership and meeting attendance can be found on page 77 .\n\nIn line with the approach agreed by the Board, set out in the Board Evaluation section of the Corporate Governance Report, the Committee's next effectiveness review will be conducted, and presented to the Committee, in 2022.",

This year, with the recovery, colleagues rightly benefit as we reward their hard work.\n\n## Remuneration principles\n\nOur performance and remuneration philosophy is built on four core reward principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Purpose: Remuneration should be linked to the Group's purpose of Helping Britain Prosper\n- \u00b7 Behaviours: Remuneration should reward and drive the right behaviours and outcomes and reflect both strategic (non-financial) and financial achievements\n- \u00b7 Simplicity: Remuneration should be designed in a manner that is clear for all stakeholders and reflects their experience\n- \u00b7 Clarity: Remuneration should be easy to explain and viewed as fair\n\nOur reward principles ensure fair reward outcomes that are linked to our purpose, Group's performance and the experiences of our shareholder and investors.\n\n## Remuneration content\n\n| Chair's statement                                        | pages 101-102   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Remuneration  at/uni00A0a/uni00A0glance                  | page 103        |\n| 2021 annual report on  remuneration                      | pages 104-121   |\n| Other remuneration  disclosures   (Pillar III reporting) | pages 122-129   |\n\nDear shareholder\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors' remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n2021 has been another extraordinarily challenging year in which the Group has sought to do all that we can to Help Britain Recover as part of our Group purpose of Helping Britain Prosper. Our priority has been assisting our personal customers, businesses and the communities in which we operate to deal with the financial consequences caused by the pandemic. What has been achieved has once again required an enormous amount of sustained effort and commitment from our people.\n\nLast year, despite that tremendous work, often above and beyond normal commitments, the Committee took the decision that, in the exceptional circumstances arising from the pandemic, as well as to reflect the Group's reduced profitability in 2020 and align with the experience of shareholders, no bonuses (Group Performance Share) would be awarded to any colleagues. That decision has had a significant impact on the motivation of our workforce and retention of talent through 2021, which the Committee has monitored closely. Given the improved performance of the Group in 2021 and the continued hard work of our people, the Committee felt it was important to reward them for their commitment and contribution. We are pleased that the materially greater profitability of the Group has enabled this to be possible.\n\nAs we deliver the next phase of the Group's strategy, it remains crucial that we are able to attract and retain critical talent and reward our colleagues appropriately while maintaining the continuing strong link to the interests of shareholders and responding to the broader societal challenges evolving around us.\n\n## 2021 variable reward outcomes\n\nTo ensure consistency, the Committee felt that it was important to operate the same framework for determining Group Performance Share awards in 2021 as it did in 2020, including applying a profit threshold.\n\nGiven a stronger economic environment and financial performance, which has enabled the reinstatement of capital distributions, the Committee has approved a Group Performance Share pool of \u00a3399 million. The 2021 pool reflects a collective adjustment of \u00a383/uni00A0million, including adjustments for the fine from the Financial Conduct Authority in 2021 in respect of insurance renewal documentation and the provision for the independent review of the compensation for customers of HBOS Reading.\n\nThis adjustment applied to the whole pool ensures there is alignment with the impact on shareholders.\n\nWhen discussing the allocation of the pool, the Committee wanted to ensure that customer-facing colleagues received awards that reflected the hard work and commitment to customers shown through 2021 and supported the Group Chief Executive's decision to allocate a higher proportion of the pool to those colleagues.\n\nIn considering the vesting outcome for the Executive Group Ownership Share awards granted in 2019, the Committee discussed each measure and considered that these awards were intended to reward long-term performance and strategic delivery. The Group's economic profit has improved despite the challenging income environment and there has been strong progress against customer measures which align to the Group's ambition to be the Best Bank for Customers. Overall, the 2019 plan vests at 41.8 per cent of maximum.\n\nWith respect to the provision taken for the independent review of compensation for customers of HBOS Reading, the Remuneration Committee is considering whether performance adjustments are appropriate for a number of individuals. Pending such further consideration, variable remuneration awards and vestings for 2022 will be frozen for former Executive Directors (the former Group Chief Executive, former Chief Financial Officer and former Chief Operating Officer). The former Group Chief Executive and former Chief Operating Officer voluntarily withdrew from the 2019 GPS awards as a result of the overall performance of the Group and the issues faced during 2019, including publication of/uni00A0the Cranston report.\n\n## Executive Director remuneration outcomes\n\nThe Group welcomed Charlie Nunn as Group Chief Executive in August 2021, taking over from Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio who retired from the Group on 30 April 2021. William Chalmers assumed the role for the interim period from 1 May 2021 to 15 August 2021. As a result of these changes during the year, reporting is more complicated and we have therefore provided additional explanation to support the mandatory disclosures. I/uni00A0would highlight the following:\n\n- \u00b7 In aggregate the single total remuneration for the three individuals in the role of Group Chief Executive during 2021 is \u00a38.9 million, but excluding oneoff buy out awards granted to Charlie Nunn is \u00a34.6 million. On this underlying basis, this is an increase of 28 per cent compared to full year 2020 but reflects the fact no bonus was awarded in 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n- \u00b7 Excluding the one-off buy-out awards granted to Charlie Nunn, the CEO pay ratio is 117:1. This is a 23 per cent increase on 2020 when no bonuses were awarded.\n- \u00b7 Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio was eligible to receive a pro-rata Group Performance Share award for the period 1 January 2021 to his retirement date on 30 April 2021. The Committee determined an award of \u00a3345,059 in line with Group performance, as outlined on page 105 . In addition, under the rules of the Executive Group Ownership Share awards made in 2019 and 2020, awards are pro-rated to the retirement date.\n\nA 1 per cent pay increase is proposed for the Executive Directors. This demonstrates continued restraint in executive remuneration, and compares to pay increases of 4 per cent or higher for two-thirds of our junior colleagues.\n\nThe Committee determined that a Group Performance Share (annual bonus) award of \u00a3348,648 should be made to the Group Chief Executive. This award is pro-rated for the period from 16 August 2021 to 31 December 2021 and is in line with the Group performance as assessed by the Committee and outlined on page 105 . An award of \u00a3704,627 was determined for the Chief Financial Officer reflecting the joint roles and responsibilities performed while acting as Interim Group Chief Executive as outlined on page 105 .\n\nTo ensure that the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer are aligned to the long-term success of the Group and motivated to deliver the next phase of the Group's strategy and sustainable returns, the Remuneration Committee has awarded 2022 Long Term Share Plan awards of 150 per cent of salary to the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer to reflect the Group's performance in 2021 and other factors taken into account in the 'pre-grant test' as outlined on page 115 . The normal range for awards for Executive Directors is 125 per cent to 150 per cent of salary.\n\nThe level of award for the Group Chief Executive acknowledges that prior to joining, Charlie Nunn agreed to voluntarily reduce the maximum opportunity from 200 per cent under the approved Directors' Remuneration Policy to 150 per cent. Consistent with the awards for 2020 performance granted in March 2021, these 2022 awards are subject to underpins for the first three years which align the vesting outcomes to longer-term shareholder experience and are deferred for/uni00A0up to seven years.\n\nFor 2022 awards, the Committee felt that it was important that progress toward climate change commitments should be\n\nreflected in the vesting of awards and has therefore included specific consideration of this within the 'pre-vest test'. Full details of the 2022 LTSP award can be found on page 115 . LTSP awards will be granted to senior colleagues, to ensure there is alignment to shareholder experience and retain critical talent through the next phase of the Group's strategic delivery.\n\n## Shareholding and post-employment shareholding requirements\n\nWe have closely monitored the ongoing developments in policy expectations for senior executives after leaving their posts and as a result, from 1 January 2022, the current Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer will be subject to a postemployment shareholding requirement for two years. This will require them to maintain their shareholdings at a level equal to the lower of the shareholding requirement immediately prior to departure or the actual shareholding on departure. Nominee arrangements are also in place to assist with enforcing shareholding requirements. To fulfil the requirement the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer (and at a later date, any new Executive Director) will be contractually bound not to dispose of a set number of shares which will be confirmed prior to their departure. We have reviewed our current shareholding policy and subject to shareholder approval at the AGM in 2023, the intention will be to align the shareholding policy for Executive Directors with other members of Senior Management and increase the timeframe by which the shareholding requirement should be achieved from three to five years from their commencement date.\n\n## Wider workforce engagement\n\nThe Committee regularly seeks input from a wide range of sources, including reviewing the annual colleague engagement survey and feedback from our recognised unions. We know that many colleagues were unhappy with the decision not to pay bonuses for 2020 performance and that this had an impact on the colleague survey results where engagement levels dropped year-onyear. Some colleagues also feel the pay increases in 2021 were disappointing given the current rate of inflation. Management has listened to colleague feedback and sought to prioritise spend towards junior colleagues and provide pay progression for colleagues more broadly. The 2022 pay budget provides for a minimum pay increase of \u00a31,000 for junior colleagues. The minimum salary in our organisation will rise to \u00a310.60 per hour (\u00a319,292). With Flex cash included, this equates to a \u00a320,000 minimum starting rate for new joiners. Our pay proposal is subject to a ballot of each union's members.\n\n## Responding to feedback\n\nFor 2021 we simplified our Group scorecard to seven performance measures, weighted equally between areas of financial and non-financial focus with 15 per cent of the scorecard assessing progress on specific ESG metrics for our climate and diversity ambitions. We believe this simplified approach, supported by use of careful and balanced judgement, ensures that our remuneration aligns to the Group's performance, purpose and strategy as well as taking into account shareholder interests. With greater focus on integrating societal purpose and environmental aspects into our strategic delivery, the Committee is aware of the importance of continuing to develop a framework within which remuneration decisions are made to ensure that they incentivise the required behaviours and performance.\n\nDuring 2021, I took the opportunity to listen to a broad range of shareholders and other key stakeholders. You told me that your main focus continues to be ensuring there is a clear alignment between business strategy and performance and executive remuneration outcomes, with a specific focus on ensuring that ESG measures are incorporated into the performance assessment.\n\nAligned to your feedback, we have made a limited but important change to the Group scorecard for 2022, to bring greater focus on our climate change ambitions and ensure our purpose of Helping Britain Prosper is at the heart of everything we do. For 2022, ESG metrics aligned directly to our public commitments on climate change and promoting inclusion and diversity will account for 17.5 per cent of the scorecard.\n\n## Future strategic alignment\n\nResponding to the Group Chief Executive's strategy announcements, the Committee will undertake a policy review to ensure the remuneration framework aligns and supports the successful delivery of the strategy. We will engage shareholders through 2022 on changes proposed for the next Policy cycle.\n\nTogether with my Committee members, I/uni00A0look forward to hearing your views on the remuneration arrangements outlined in the report and hope we will receive your support at the upcoming AGM.\n\nOn behalf of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alan Dickinson\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee",

He was granted cash of \u00a3369,703 and deferred share awards over 8,301,708 shares to replace unvested awards given up from his former employer, HSBC, as described on page 110 and a lost opportunity bonus award for 2020. The value of the lost opportunity bonus award was \u00a31,316.564 calculated by reference to his 2019 bonus, adjusted downward to reflect HSBC's group bonus pool as disclosed in their 2020 Annual Report and a further 20 per cent preagreed discount.\n- 2 As previously disclosed William Chalmers was the Interim Group Chief Executive from 1 May 2021 until 15 August 2021 and his remuneration in the table above includes changes to his remuneration for this period (pro-rated deputisation payment of \u00a390,441 and Fixed Share Award of \u00a364,595).\n- 3 Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio retired as an Executive Director and Group Chief Executive on 30 April 2021. His remuneration details for 2021 are in respect of services provided as an Executive Director. Details of Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio's retirement terms are provided on page 107 .\n- 4 The 2019 Group Ownership Share (GOS) vesting (see page 107 ) at 41.8 per cent was confirmed by the Remuneration Committee at its meeting on 17 February 2022. The total number of shares due to vest are 2,498,568 for Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio and the award was pro-rated to reflect Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio's leaving date. The average share price between 1 October 2021 and 31 December 2021 47.993 pence has been used to indicate the value. The shares were awarded in 2019 based on a share price of 48.576 pence and as such no part of the reported value is attributable to share price appreciation.\n- 5 LTIP figures for 2020 have been adjusted to reflect the share price on the date of vesting (5 March 2021) 39.826 pence instead of the average price 32.623 pence reported in the 2020 report.\n- 6 The fixed share award is part of fixed remuneration and is not subject to any performance conditions see page 114 .\n- 7 Other remuneration payments comprise income from all employee share plans, which arise through employer matching or discounting of employee purchases.\n\n## 2021 pension and benefits (audited)\n\n| Pension/Benefits                         | Charlie   Nunn   | William  Chalmers   | Sir Ant\u00f3nio  Horta-Os\u00f3rio   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Pension                                  | 63,920           | 121,626             | 60,400                      |\n| Car or car allowance                     | -                | 12,000              | 4,000                       |\n| Flexible benefits payments               | 15,000           | 32,433              | 17,262                      |\n| Private medical insurance                | 245              | 1,130               | 23,076                      |\n| Legal fees                               | 36,000           | -                   | 30,000                      |\n| Tax preparation 1                        | -                | -                   | 30,000                      |\n| Transportation (chauffeur) 2             | -                | -                   | 29,626                      |\n| Subtotal for total benefits less pension | 51,245           | 45,563              | 133,964                     |\n\n- 1 Tax preparation includes VAT.\n- 2 Transportation benefits relate to the 2020/21 tax year.\n\n## Defined benefits pension arrangements (audited)\n\nSir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio has a conditional unfunded pension commitment. This was a partial buy-out of a pension forfeited on joining from Santander Group. It is an Employer-Financed Retirement Benefits Scheme (EFRBS). The arrangement provides benefits that are normally payable at retirement at age 65. The benefit in the EFRBS accrued during the six years following commencement of employment, therefore ceasing to accrue as of 31 December 2016.\n\nThe EFRBS was subject to performance conditions and it provided for a percentage of his base salary or reference salary in the 12 months before retirement or leaving. No additional benefit is due in the event of early retirement. The rate of pension accrued in each year depended on share price conditions being met. In March 2019, Ant\u00f3nio asked that his defined benefit pension be based on a percentage of his pensionable salary in 2014. The total pension due is now fixed at 6 per cent of his 2014 reference salary of \u00a31,220,000, or \u00a373,200.\n\nThere are no other Executive Directors with defined benefit pension entitlements.",

However, strong performance against the other financial and ESG measures have resulted in an overall outcome of 62.8 per cent.\n\nThe Committee reviewed these outcomes in the context of a number of internal and external considerations to determine whether it should exercise its discretion to adjust the outcome and determined that the 2021 scorecard outcome appropriately rewards the Executive Directors for their performance within the context of overall stakeholder experience.\n\n## Group balanced scorecard\n\n| Measure Block                             |       | Weighting                  | Performance range                  | Performance range                            | Performance range                           | Actual                                    | Outcome   | Weighted outcome   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|\n|                                           |       |                            | 25%               50%              | 75%                                          | 100%                                        |                                           |           |                    |\n| Profit after Tax                          | 20%   | \u00a32,269m                    | \u00a32,552m                            | \u00a32,836m                                      | \u00a33,120m                                     | \u00a35,885m                                   | 100%      | 20.0%              |\n| ROTE c ia l  (                            | 20%   | 5%                         | 5.6%                               | 6.2% 6.9%                                    |                                             | 13.8%                                     | 100%      | 20.0%              |\n| Operating Costs (excl. remediation)       | 10%   | \u00a37,630m 1                  | \u00a37,555m                            | \u00a37,480m                                      | \u00a37,443m                                     | \u00a37,630m                                   | 0%        | 0%                 |\n| Ri  Reducing Operational Carbon Emissions | 7. 5% | 15%                        | 20%                                | 30%                                          | 35%                                         | 34.5%                                     | 75%       | 5.6%               |\n| Increasing our gender and ethnic  50 % )  | 3.75% | 37.0%                      | 37.6%                              | 38.2%                                        | 38.8%                                       | 37.7%                                     | 50%       | 1.9%               |\n| representation in senior roles n c ia     | 3.75% | 7.7%                       | 8.3%                               | 8.8%                                         | 9.4%                                        | 8.8%                                      | 75%       | 2.8%               |\n| Customer Dashboard n -

Overall, the 2019 plan vests at 41.8 per cent of maximum.\n\n## 2019 Executive Group Ownership Share\n\n|                                                   |                                   | Range                           | Range                           | Range                           | Range                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Block                                             | Measure                           | Weighting Threshold             | Maximum                         | Actual                          | Weighted vesting                |\n| % )                                               | Absolute Total Shareholder Return | 8% p.a  30.0%                   | 16% p.a                         | (1.7%) p.a                      | 0.0%                            |\n| Economic Profit c i a l                           | 25.0%                             | \u00a32,210m                         | \u00a33,315m                         | \u00a33,063m                         | 19.3%                           |\n| Cost: Income Ratio F i                            | 10.0%                             | 45.9%                           | 43.4%                           | 56.7%                           | 0.0%                            |\n| Employee Engagement Index )                       | 7. 5%                             | +5% vs   UK norm                | +2% vs   UK HP norm             | +2% vs   UK norm                | 0.0%                            |\n| Customer Satisfaction  ( 3 5                      | 10.0%                             | 3rd                             | 1st                             | 1st                             | 10.0%                           |\n| FCA reportable complaints per '000 accounts a n c | 5.0%                              | 2.89                            | 2.61                            | 2.53                            | 5.0%                            |\n| FOS Uphold Rate N o n                             | 5.0%                              | =<29%                           | =<25%                           | 31%                             | 0.0%                            |\n| Digital NPS Score                                 |                                   | 65.3 7. 5%                      | 68.3                            | 70.5                            | 7. 5%                           |\n| Award (% maximum) vesting 41.8%                   | Award (% maximum) vesting 41.8%   | Award (% maximum) vesting 41.8% | Award (% maximum) vesting 41.8% | Award (% maximum) vesting 41.8% | Award (% maximum) vesting 41.8% |\n\n## Payments for loss of office (audited)\n\nSir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio retired as Group Chief Executive Officer and an Executive Director of Lloyds Banking Group plc on 30/uni00A0April 2021. On 20 May 2021, Ant\u00f3nio received a payment of \u00a3200,809.49 in lieu of unused annual leave entitlement up to the retirement date.\n\nEmployees taking retirement are treated as 'good leavers' under the Company's Group Performance Share Plan (GPS Plan) Rules. Ant\u00f3nio declined a GPS award in 2019 and 2020 and has no outstanding deferred GPS awards. He was eligible to be considered for a GPS award for the 2021 performance period up until his retirement date. He did not receive a Long Term Share Plan award for the 2020 performance year.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio remained entitled to his Fixed Share Award, time pro-rated to his retirement date. The award is paid in shares in quarterly instalments and the final award of \u00a383,477 was made in shares in June 2021 and restricted over three years. The statement published by the Group on its website on 30 April 2021 under s430(2B) of the Companies Act 2006 initially stated that the value of the final award would be \u00a388,846, based on an estimate of the value of the award at that time.\n\nAs a 'good leaver' under the Executive Group Ownership Plan Rules (Executive GOS), Ant\u00f3nio's outstanding 2019 and 2020 Executive GOS awards will be time pro-rated to his retirement date (2019 becomes 5,977,436 shares and 2020 becomes 3,680,612 shares). The awards remain subject to the performance measures which apply to the relevant awards and will continue to vest at the normal vesting dates and be released on their scheduled release dates, subject to the relevant terms (including post-vesting retention periods, malus and, where applicable, clawback and to deductions for national insurance and income tax).\n\nAs the 2017 and 2018 Executive Group Ownership Share awards have achieved their three-year performance period with performance outcomes of 49.7 per cent and 33.75 per cent respectively, any unvested awards will not be time pro-rated and will continue to vest at the normal vesting times and be released on their scheduled release dates.\n\nAnt\u00f3nio was provided with a contribution of up to \u00a325,000 (excluding VAT) towards legal fees incurred in connection with his retirement from the Company. Ant\u00f3nio will be provided with tax assistance from the Group's preferred supplier for the tax years 2021/2022 and 2022/23. Private medical cover was also provided until the end of 2021. As part of Ant\u00f3nio's buyout of retirement benefits from his employment with Santander, the Group agreed to an unfunded pension buy-out arrangement which was determined based on the achievement of share price conditions over a six-year period. The arrangement provides benefits that are normally payable at retirement at age 65, in which case, the amount would be an annual pension equal to 6 per cent of \u00a31,220,000.\n\nNo other payment for loss of office were made in 2021.\n\n## Payments within the reporting year to past Directors (audited)\n\nThere were no payments made to past Directors in 2021.\n\n## External appointments\n\nSir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio - During the year ended 31 December 2021, the former Group Chief Executive served as a NonExecutive Director of Exor, Fundacao Champalimaud, Sociedade Francisco Manuel dos Santos and Stichting INPAR Management/ Enable. Ant\u00f3nio is entitled to retain the fees, which were \u00a3107,978 in total.\n\nNo other Executive Director served as a Non-Executive Director in 2021.",

Nunn joined the Group on 16 August 2021 as Group Chief Executive and Executive Director. He was granted deferred share awards to replace, like for like, unvested share and cash awards from his previous employer, HSBC, forfeited as a result of joining the Group and lost opportunity bonus for 2020. Deferred Share awards were made under the Lloyds Banking Group Deferred Bonus Plan over 8,301,708 shares. This includes deferred cash amounts totalling \u00a31,430,717 that Charlie forfeited from HSBC and voluntarily opted to take in shares. The number of Shares over which the deferred share awards were granted was calculated using the five-day average mid-market closing prices of HSBC and the Group up to his start date of 16 August 2021. The awards are subject to vesting schedules and retention periods that match those of the awards forfeited. As the awards are buy-outs they are not subject to performance conditions or time pro-rating in good leaver circumstances. The awards are subject to malus and clawback on the same terms as Deferred GPS Awards, and in addition are subject to clawback in the event of resignation within two years of grant. The value of the awards is not pensionable. The awards were granted in accordance with the regulatory requirements for buy-outs.\n- 2 As a number of awards would have vested at the time Charlie Nunn joined the Group, the shares awarded in September 2021 vested immediately on grant. The closing market price of the Group's ordinary shares on that date was 43.9775 pence. After the settlement of income tax and National Insurance, 454,168 shares were released to Charlie Nunn of which 297,772 continue to be subject to a retention period of 12 months.\n- 3 All GOS awards have a three-year performance period ending 31 December. Awards were made in the form of conditional rights to free shares.\n- 4 LTSP awards (in the form of conditional share options) in 2021 were made over shares with a value of 75 per cent of salary for William Chalmers (1,547,340 shares with a face value of \u00a3608,128). Vesting is subject to underpin thresholds applicable for the first three years from grant as detailed on page 132 of the 2020 Directors' remuneration report. Each year the Remuneration Committee will monitor the Group's progress in relation to the underpins. No awards were made to Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio and Charlie Nunn. The share price used to calculate the face value was the average price over the five days prior to grant (25 February to 3 March 2021), which was 39.3015 pence. The underpins for this award are set out on page 115 .\n- 5 The second tranche of the 2019 GPS Award deferred shares vested on 5 March 2021. The closing market price of the Group's ordinary shares on that date was 40.07 pence. Shares vested are subject to a further one-year holding period. Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio waived his 2019 GPS.\n- 6 When William Chalmers joined the Group on 3 June 2019, he was granted deferred share awards, to replace unvested awards from his former employer, Morgan Stanley. Options vested on 27 January 2021 and William Chalmers exercised on 4 March 2021. William Chalmers retained all the shares apart from 528,826 shares which were sold at 40.235 pence to meet income tax and National Insurance contributions. 595,801 shares are subject to a 12-month holding period from the date of vesting on 27 January 2021.\n- 7 The second tranche of the 2017 GOS awards and the first tranche of the 2018 GOS award vested on 5 March 2021. The closing market price of the Group's ordinary shares on that date was 40.07 pence. Shares vested are subject to a further holding period.\n- 8 2017 GOS award was eligible to receive an amount equal in value to any dividends paid during the performance period. Dividend equivalents have been paid based on the number of shares vested and have been paid in shares. The dividend equivalent shares were awarded and released on 5 March 2021. The closing market price of the Group's ordinary shares on that date was 40.07 pence. The dividend equivalent shares are not subject to any holding period.\n- 9 The number of shares in respect of the 2019 and 2020 GOS Awards for Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio have been reduced to reflect the period from the start of the Performance Period to his date of leaving (30 April 2021) in accordance with the appropriate plan rules.\n- 10 The final tranche of 2018 GPS award vested on 5 March 2021. The closing market price of the Group's ordinary shares on that date was 40.07 pence. 50 per cent of the final tranche is subject to a one year holding period.\n- 11 2017 Sharesave options were not exercised due to the prevailing share price and lapsed on 2 July 2021.\n- 12 2019 and 2020 Sharesave options exercised on 14 October 2021. The closing market price of the Group's ordinary shares on that date was 48.4425 pence. The lapsed figures represent options Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio was not entitled to due to leaving the Group in April.",

In the event that exceptional individual circumstances exist resulting in an Executive not being able to comply with the Policy, the Remuneration Committee will consider whether an exception should apply.\n\nThe Group did not operate a formal postemployment shareholding policy in 2021. Existing reward structures and the Long Term Share Plan have been designed in\n\nline with regulatory requirements and ensure that a substantial proportion of variable reward for Executive Directors and other senior employees takes the form of shares deferred and held over a period of up to eight years. These structures ensure Executive Directors continue to meet our shareholding requirements for a minimum of two years after leaving the Group.\n\n## Post-employment shareholding requirement\n\nFrom 1 January 2022, the current Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer will be contractually bound to a postemployment shareholding requirement of two years at a level equal to the lower of the shareholding requirements immediately prior to departure or the actual shareholding on departure.\n\nThe post-employment requirement will be maintained through self-certification, with the Committee keeping this approach under review.\n\nWe have reviewed our current shareholding policy and subject to shareholder approval at the AGM in 2023, the intention will be to align the shareholding policy for Executive Directors with other members of Senior Management and increase the timeframe by which the shareholding requirement should be achieved from three to five years from their commencement date.\n\nNone of those who were Directors at the end of the year had any other interest in the capital of Lloyds Banking Group plc or/uni00A0its subsidiaries.\n\n| Charlie Nunn              | Shareholding requirement                         | 350%   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| William Chalmers          | Actual shareholding 1 Shareholding requirement 2 | 36%    |\n| William Chalmers          | Actual shareholding 1                            |        |\n| Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta- Os\u00f3rio | Shareholding requirement 3 Actual shareholding 1 | 350%   |\n| Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta- Os\u00f3rio |                                                  | 837%   |\n\n- 1 Calculated using the average share price for the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021 (44.46 pence).

However, the biggest driver of our pay gap continues to be the shape of our workforce.\n\n## Ethnicity pay\n\nWhile there is currently no legal requirement to publish ethnicity pay data in the UK, we are publishing this data not only because it is the right thing to do, but it also holds us to account for the goals we have set.\n\nSince our last report (2019/20) was released we have seen our pay gap close slightly. This improvement is welcomed. However, we know that the pace of change is slower than we'd like.\n\nWe still have a higher proportion\n\nof women in more junior levels and fewer women in more senior roles.

This is because no bonuses were paid in 2020, except for deferred payments from previous years.\n\nWith this in mind we are taking a number of steps including having Black, Asian, and minority ethnic candidates on all shortlists to increase diversity in senior recruitment.

The table below shows the ratios of the Group Chief Executive's total remuneration to the remuneration of colleagues since 2017. The change in the pay ratios for 2021 is explained in more detail below.\n\nThe median ratio calculated for all three individuals undertaking the role of Group Chief Executive increased by 137 per cent yearon-year. This increase can be attributed to the one-off buy out awards granted to Charlie Nunn, an increase in the vesting LTIP and the payment of Group Performance Awards (Annual Bonus), which were not awarded for 2020. Excluding the one-off buy-out awards granted to Charlie Nunn, the CEO pay ratio is 117:1. Whilst this is a 23 per cent increase on 2020 when no bonuses were awarded, it reflects a continued improvement on prior years.\n\n|                       | Total compensation     | Total compensation     | Total compensation   | Total compensation     | Fixed pay              | Fixed pay      | Fixed pay              |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------|------------------------|\n| Year                  | Methodology            | P25   (Lower Quartile) | P50   (Median)       | P75   (Upper Quartile) | P25   (Lower Quartile) | P50   (Median) | P75   (Upper Quartile) |\n| 2021                  | A                      | 316:1                  | 225:1                | 120:1                  | 93:1                   | 66:1           | 38:1                   |\n| 2020                  | A                      | 132:1                  | 95:1                 | 54:1                   | 103:1                  | 75:1           | 42:1                   |\n| 2019                  | A                      | 179:1                  | 128:1                | 71:1                   | 114:1                  | 82:1           | 47:1                   |\n| 2018                  | A                      | 237:1                  | 169:1                | 93:1                   | 113:1                  | 81:1           | 48:1                   |\n| 2017                  | A                      | 245:1                  | 177:1                | 97:1                   | 113:1                  | 82:1           | 48:1                   |\n| Y-o-Y   (2020 v 2021) |                        |                        | 137%                 |                        |                        | (11%)          |                        |\n| 2021                  | A - Excluding  buy-out | 165:1                  | 117:1                | 63:1                   | 93:1                   | 66:1           | 38:1                   |\n\n## Notes to the table:\n\n- \u00b7 The 2021 base salary for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: \u00a322,961, \u00a330,095, \u00a355,064.\n- \u00b7 The 2021 total remuneration for the colleagues identified at P25, P50 and P75 are as follows: \u00a328,005, \u00a3 39,396, \u00a3 73,629.\n- \u00b7 The P25, P50 and P75 colleagues were determined on 31 December 2021 based on calculating total remuneration for all UK employees for the 2021 financial year. Payroll data from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.\n- \u00b7 The average share price between 1 October 2021 and 31 December 2021 47.993 pence has been used to indicate the value of vesting Group Ownership Share awards.\n- \u00b7 Colleague total remuneration has been calculated in line with the single total figure of remuneration. The single total figure of remuneration has been calculated for 60,317 UK colleagues within the Group for a full year including full-time equivalent base pay, vesting Group Ownership Share awards (for eligible colleagues), core benefits, pension, overtime and shift payments, travel/ relocation payments (for eligible colleagues) and private medical benefit.\n- \u00b7 The colleague identified at P50 did not receive a separate car benefit and does not participate in the long term incentive plan. As a result, the ratio does not provide a direct comparison to the total remuneration of the Group Chief Executive.\n- \u00b7 All other data has been calculated in line with the methodology for the single total figure of remuneration for the Group Chief Executive.\n- \u00b7 Due to operational constraints, the calculation of the colleague Pension Input Figure excludes inflationary adjustments for those on the defined benefit scheme. The omission of this factor does not materially affect the outcome of the ratio and/or distort the validity of the valuation.\n\nOur ratios have been calculated using Methodology option A on the basis that it provided the most accurate means of identifying the median, lower and upper quartile colleagues. The ratio has been calculated taking into account the pay and benefits of over 60,000 UK employees, other than the three individuals performing the role of Group Chief Executive.\n\nThe Group welcomed Charlie Nunn as Group Chief Executive in August 2021, taking over from Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio who retired from the Group on 30 April 2021. William Chalmers was in role for the interim period from 1 May 2021 to 15 August 2021. As a result of these changes during the year, the CEO ratio reporting is more complicated and we have therefore provided additional information to support the mandatory disclosures.\n\nThe change in total remuneration ratios since 2017 is largely driven by the more volatile nature of variable pay for the CEO. The reduction in 2020 can be attributed to the decision not to make awards under the Group Performance Share Plan; reduced performance in the vesting of the 2018 Group Ownership plan compared to 2017 and the reduction in the former Group Chief Executive's pension allowance from 33 per cent to 15 per cent of salary.\n\nFor the majority of colleagues, year-on-year changes in remuneration are principally driven by pay increases and the impacts of Group performance and collective adjustment which has resulted in a reduction in the bonus pool. The Group has a commitment to pay progression and a continued focus on ensuring higher pay awards for colleagues who are lower paid, or paid lower within their pay range. We are committed to reducing the pay gap between executives and wider colleagues and continue to remain focused on addressing the gap from the bottom up and not just from the top down.\n\nThe Committee is thoughtful of the volatility in pay ratios due to variable reward outcomes. Although the pay ratio is used as a useful reference point to inform policy-setting, the Committee takes into account a number of other factors to assess colleague pay progression.",

The Group proposes to operate the policy in the following way for 2022.\n\n## Base salary\n\nThe Group has proposed a total pay budget of 3.6 per cent. The approach focuses on lower paid colleagues and colleagues lower in their pay range.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fixed Share Award\n\nAwards remain unchanged from 2022 as follows: Group Chief Executive: \u00a31,050,000 Chief Financial Officer: \u00a3504,000\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pension\n\nPension allowances for all Executive Directors are set at 15 per cent of base salary. Any new Executive Director appointments in 2022 will also attract a maximum allowance of 15 per cent of base salary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Benefits\n\nBenefits remain unchanged from 2021. Executive Directors receive a flexible benefit allowance in line with colleagues, (4 per cent of base salary).\n\n## Group Performance Share (Bonus)\n\nThe performance measures for determining any individual 2022 Group Performance Share awards for Executive Directors are outlined in the 2022 balanced scorecard on page 116 .\n\nIndividual maximum opportunities for Executive Directors remain unchanged from 2021 at 140 per cent of base salary for the Group Chief Executive and 100 per cent for other Executive Directors.\n\nSalary increases for the Group Chief Executive (GCE) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) are set below the budget for the wider colleague population at 1 per cent.\n\nShares will be released in equal tranches over three years. (See page 118 for further details).\n\nOver 50,000 colleagues participate in the Group's Defined Contribution (DC) Pension scheme where the maximum opportunity for the workforce is 15 per cent of base salary. Executive Directors employer pension contributions are therefore aligned with those available to the majority of the workforce.\n\nThis can be used to select benefits including life assurance and critical illness cover.\n\nIndividual awards as a percentage of maximum will directly correlate to the overall performance assessment outcome.\n\nFor the 2022 performance year, any Group Performance Share opportunity will be awarded in March 2023 in a combination of cash (up to 50 per cent) and shares. In accordance with the Policy, deferral and vesting of any Group Performance Share awards will be structured so that\n\nSalaries will therefore be as follows: Group Chief Executive: \u00a31,136,250 Chief Financial Officer: \u00a3818,945\n\nIn addition to the DC arrangement, the Group currently has almost 12,000 active members in defined benefit plans, with the effective cost of employer contributions into these arrangements being 38 per cent of salary.\n\nOther benefits include transportation and private medical cover. The Chief Financial Officer also receives a car allowance.\n\nin combination with any award under the Long Term Share Plan, there will be a deferral of variable remuneration in line with applicable regulatory requirements (currently requiring a deferral of 60/uni00A0per cent of variable remuneration for Executive/uni00A0Directors).",

        "page_content": "## Long Term Share Plan\n\nIt is an important feature of the LTSP that performance is assessed and appropriately recognised upfront in the award size as there are no performance conditions that apply after the award is granted (only underpins). This is not however a mechanical outturn, as with GPS, the Remuneration Committee may exercise its judgement.\n\n## Pre-grant test\n\nThe decision to award Long Term Share Plan awards for 2022 is based on the performance assessment from the 2021 balanced scorecard provided on page 105 .\n\nTo ensure that the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer are aligned to the long-term success of the Group and motivated to deliver the next phase of the Group's strategy and sustainable returns, the Remuneration Committee has awarded 2022 Long Term Share Plan awards of 150 per cent of salary to the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer to reflect the Group's performance in 2021 and other factors taken into account in the 'pre-grant test'.\n\nThe normal range for awards for Executive Directors is 125 per cent to 150 per cent of salary. The level of award for the Group Chief Executive acknowledges that prior to joining, Charlie Nunn agreed to voluntarily reduce the maximum opportunity from 200 per cent under the approved Directors' Remuneration Policy to 150 per cent. Consistent with the awards for 2020 performance granted in March 2021, these 2022 awards are subject to underpins for the first three years which align the vesting outcomes to longer-term shareholder experience and are deferred for up to seven years.\n\n- In deciding the award size, the Committee considered the balanced scorecard, Group's share price, as well as the following four questions:\n- \u00b7 Do the Group's financial results and capital position adequately reflect risk, conduct and any other non-financial considerations, including ESG?\n- \u00b7 Has the bank lived up to its ambition to be the Best Bank for Customers?\n- \u00b7 Has the Group made meaningful progress in supporting the UK's transition to net zero?\n- \u00b7 Has the Group suffered a serious conduct event or has severe reputational damage arisen from the Group not living its values?\n\nThe Committee concluded that the Group's strong capital position, positive reputation through 2021 and the support for customers and businesses during 2021 supported the making of awards.\n\n## Underpins\n\nThe underpins that will apply to the 2022 LTSP awards are:\n\n- \u00b7 ROTE - Group ROTE exceeds the average for UK peer banks over the three years\n- \u00b7 CET 1 ratio - Group CET1 ratio above the guided management target each year, including all regulatory buffers\n- \u00b7 Ordinary Dividend - Increased ordinary dividend payments over the plan period (subject to any further sector-wide regulatory constraints).\n\nThe peer comparator group for the ROTE underpin is set at Barclays Group PLC, HSBC Holdings PLC, Natwest Group PLC, Santander UK PLC and Virgin Money UK PLC. ROTE will be measured on the new basis adopted from 2021 and will take into account adjustments (as appropriate) for methodology differences between peers and any other factors the Remuneration Committee considers should reasonably be reflected, including relative under or outperformance or change in business mix.\n\n## Balanced scorecard outcomes and LTSP award range\n\n| Scorecard performance outcome           | 0%-50%   | 50%-100%    |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|-------------|\n| All LTSP grant (up to % of base salary) | 0%-125%  | 125%-150% 1 |\n\n- 1 Awards above 150 per cent and up to 200 per cent in line with Policy maximum reserved for exceptional circumstance or exceptional performance for all eligible colleagues other than Charlie Nunn who agreed to cap his maximum award at 150 per cent of salary.\n\nAwards will not be subject to further performance conditions however vesting will be subject to three underpin thresholds applicable for the first three years from grant. Each year the Remuneration Committee will monitor the Group's progress in relation to the underpins. An assessment will be made at the end of the three year period to determine whether the underpins have been successfully maintained over the three years and to what extent the LTSP award should vest. The Remuneration Committee will also retain the right to consider other factors and apply discretion prior to making a decision on vesting.\n\n## Pre-vest test\n\nIn conjunction with the assessment of performance against the underpins, the Remuneration Committee will consider the four core questions above to satisfy itself that the performance considered in the pre-grant test has been sustainable. The Remuneration Committee will retain the right to consider other factors and apply general discretion in making a decision on the vesting of awards. This approach helps to avoid any potential unintended outcomes that might arise from the application of formulaic performance criteria in the underpins and ensure that there is a fair outcome. The Committee will explain its reasons for applying discretion in either direction, or for not doing so.",

When determining the final outcome, the Remuneration Committee may consider any personal or business area objectives and whether there has been effective, consistent and proactive risk management and conduct outcomes across all dimensions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance Adjustment\n\nPerformance adjustment is determined by the Remuneration Committee and/ or Board Risk Committee and may result in a reduction of up to 100 per cent variable remuneration opportunity for the relevant period. It can be applied on a collective or individual basis. When considering collective adjustment, a report is submitted to the Remuneration Committee and Board Risk Committee regarding any adjustments required to balanced scorecards or the overall GPS and/or LTSP outcome to reflect in-year or prior year risk matters.\n\nThe application of malus will generally be considered when:\n\n- \u00b7 there is reasonable evidence of employee misbehaviour or material error or that they participated in conduct which resulted in losses for the Group or failed to meet appropriate standards of fitness and propriety;\n- \u00b7 there is material failure of risk management at a Group, business area, division and/or business unit level;\n- \u00b7 any other circumstances where the Committee consider adjustments should be made.\n- \u00b7 the Committee determines that the financial results for a given year do not support the level of variable remuneration awarded; and/or\n\nJudgement on individual performance adjustment is informed by taking into account the severity of the issue, the individual's proximity to the issue and the individual's behaviour in relation to the issue. Individual adjustment may be applied through adjustments to balanced scorecard assessments and/or through reducing the variable remuneration outcome.\n\nWhen assessing performance, the Committee can exercise its judgment to determine the appropriate outcome. This helps to avoid any potential unintended outcomes that might arise from the application of formulaic performance criteria.\n\n## Targets\n\nTargets will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2022 Annual Report alongside the level of performance achieved, as the Remuneration Committee considers such targets to be commercially sensitive. However a target range has been set in line with our operating plan and, where applicable, forward- looking guidance.\n\nMeasures of financial and non-financial performance have been agreed by the Remuneration Committee to evaluate performance during 2022.\n\n- 1 The sustainable financing and investment criteria for the Group Balanced Scorecard details the financing and investment activities that are eligible for inclusion towards this measure.

Two of the three designated independent Non-Executive Directors of the RingFenced Banks also attend meetings of the Committee as observers in order to provide insights on matters relevant to the RingFenced Banks and as part of their role in the Group's overall governance structure. During the year Stuart Sinclair stepped down as Chair of the Committee and was replaced by Alan Dickinson with effect from 24 November 2021. Alan has been a member of the Committee since July 2015 and Stuart remains a member of the Committee, but has notified the Board that he will retire at the 2022 Annual General Meeting. For further details of Committee membership and attendance at meetings, please see page 77 .\n\nThe purpose of the Committee is to set the remuneration for all Executive Directors and the Chair, including pension rights and any compensation payments. It recommends and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management and material risk takers. It also considers, agrees and recommends to the Board an overall remuneration policy and philosophy for the Group that is aligned with its longterm business strategy, its business objectives, its risk appetite, purpose and values and the long-term interests of the Group, and recognises the interests of relevant stakeholders, including the wider workforce. The Committee's operation is designed to ensure that no conflicts of interest arise, and in particular, the Committee ensures that no individual is present when matters relating to their own remuneration are discussed.\n\n## Advisers\n\nMercer was appointed by the Committee in 2016 following a competitive tender process and was retained for 2021. The Committee is of the view that Mercer provides independent remuneration advice to the Committee and does not have any connections with the Group or any Director that may impair its independence. The broader Mercer company provides unrelated advice on accounting and investments.

Additional information summarising the Group's remuneration policies, structure and governance is also provided. These disclosures should be read in conjunction with the disclosures for Executive Directors contained in the Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR) on pages 101 to 121 and the Directors' Remuneration Policy (DRP) on pages 115 to 123 of the 2019 Annual Report. Together these disclosures comply with the requirements of Article 450 of the onshored and amended version Capital Requirements Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR).\n\nThe remuneration principles and practices detailed in the DRR apply to MRTs and non-MRTs in the same way as to Executive Directors (other than where stated in this disclosure).\n\nIn line with the PRA's guidance, the Group has applied the PRA version of the EBA Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 604/2014 as well as the draft revised Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) for the identification of material risk takers published by the EBA in June 2020 to determine which colleagues should be identified as MRTs. MRTs are colleagues who are considered to have a material impact on the Group's risk profile, and include, but are not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 Business and Function Heads and their respective direct reports. Senior Management Function (SMF) holders and certain Certified roles.\n- \u00b7 Board Executive Directors, Board Non-Executive Directors and members and attendees of the Group Executive Committee (GEC) and their respective executive level direct reports\n- \u00b7 Other highly remunerated individuals whose activities could have a material impact on the Group's risk profile\n\nThis section discloses information regarding the Group's remuneration arrangements on a consolidated basis. Additional disclosures in respect of Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc will be published separately on the Group's website, located at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/investors/ financial-downloads, from 8 March 2022.\n\n## Decision making process for remuneration policy\n\nThe Group has a strong belief in aligning the remuneration delivered to the Group's executives with the successful performance of the business and, through this, the delivery of long-term, superior and sustainable returns to shareholders. It has continued to seek the views of shareholders and other key stakeholders with regard to remuneration policy and seeks to motivate, incentivise and retain talent while being mindful of the economic outlook.\n\nThe overarching purpose of the Remuneration Committee is to consider, agree and recommend to the Board an overall remuneration policy and philosophy for the Group that is defined by, supports and is closely aligned to its long-term business strategy, business objectives, risk appetite and values and recognises the interests of relevant stakeholders. The remuneration policy governs all aspects of remuneration and applies in its entirety firm-wide to all divisions, business units and companies in the Group, including wholly-owned overseas businesses and all colleagues, contractors and temporary staff. The Committee reviews the policy annually and approves all compensation for Executive Directors, GEC members and attendees, senior risk and compliance officers, high earners and any other MRTs. During 2021 the Committee had six scheduled meetings. Further details on the operation of the Remuneration Committee and independent advice received during the year can be found on page 117 of the DRR.\n\nThe Group has a robust governance framework in place, which is cascaded through the Group with the Group People Committee having oversight for all other colleagues.\n\n## Governance and risk management\n\nAn essential component of the approach to remuneration is the governance process that underpins it. This ensures that the policy is robustly applied and risk is managed appropriately. In addition to setting the overall remuneration policy and philosophy for the Group, the Remuneration Committee ensures that colleagues who could have a material impact on the Group's risk profile are not rewarded for excessive risk taking but are provided with appropriate incentives that recognise their individual contribution to the success of the organisation.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee works closely with the Risk Committee in ensuring the Group Performance Share (GPS) plan outcome is moderated. The two Committees determine whether the proposed GPS outcome and performance assessments adequately reflect the risk appetite and framework of the Group; whether it took account of current and future risks; and whether any further adjustment is required or merited. The Group and the Remuneration Committee are determined to ensure that the aggregate variable remuneration for all colleagues is appropriate and balanced with the interests of shareholders and all other stakeholders.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's terms of reference are available from the Company Secretary and are displayed on the Group's website, www.lloydsbankinggroup. com/ourgroup/corporate-governance. These terms are reviewed each year to ensure compliance with the remuneration\n\nregulations and were last updated in January 2022.\n\n## Link between pay and performance\n\nThe Group's approach to reward is intended to provide a clear link between remuneration and delivery of its key strategic objectives, supporting the aim of becoming the best bank for customers, and through that, for shareholders. To this end, the performance management process has been developed, with close participation from Group Risk, to ensure there is a clear alignment between award outcomes and individual performance, growth and development, whilst also reflecting divisional achievement.\n\nThe use of a balanced scorecard approach to measure performance enables the Remuneration Committee to assess the performance of the Group and its senior executives in a consistent and performance-driven way. The Group's remuneration policy supports the business values and strategy, based on building long-term relationships with customers and colleagues and managing the financial consequences of business decisions across the entire economic cycle.\n\nFurther detail can be found in the DRR and the DRP.

        "page_content": "## Design and structure of/uni00A0remuneration\n\nWhen establishing the remuneration policy and associated frameworks, the Group is required to take into account its size, organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of its activities. For the purpose of remuneration regulation, Lloyds Bank plc is treated as a Proportionality level I firm and therefore subject to the more onerous remuneration rules.\n\nRemuneration is delivered via a combination of fixed and variable remuneration. Fixed remuneration reflects the role, responsibility and experience of a colleague. Variable remuneration is based on an assessment of individual, business area and Group performance. The mix of variable and fixed remuneration is driven by seniority and role. Taking into account the expected value of awards, the performance-related elements of pay make up a considerable proportion of the total remuneration package for MRTs, whilst maintaining an appropriate balance between the fixed and variable elements. The maximum ratio of variable to fixed remuneration for MRTs is 200 per cent, which was approved by shareholders (98.77 per cent of votes cast) at the AGM on 15 May 2014.\n\nRemuneration for control functions is set in relation to benchmark market data to ensure that it is possible to attract and retain staff with the appropriate knowledge, experience and skills. An appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation supports this approach. Generally, control function staff receive a higher proportion of fixed remuneration than other colleagues. Particular attention is paid to ensure remuneration for control function staff is linked to the performance of their function and independent from the business areas they control.",

        "page_content": "## Other statutory and regulatory information\n\nThis Directors' report on pages 70 to 133 is our Directors' report for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006 and fulfils the requirements of the corporate governance statement for the purposes of the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR).\n\n## Profit and dividends\n\nThe consolidated income statement shows a statutory profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2021 of \u00a36,902 million (2020: \u00a31,226 million).\n\nThe Directors have recommended a final dividend for 2021, which is subject to approval by the shareholders at the AGM, of 1.33 pence per share, totalling \u00a3947 million. The final dividend will be paid on 19 May 2022. A final dividend of 0.57 pence per share totalling \u00a3404/uni00A0million in respect of 2020 was paid on 25 May 2021, and an interim dividend of 0.67 pence per share totalling \u00a3473 million was paid on 13 September 2021. Further information on dividends is shown in note 43 on page 281 and is incorporated by reference.\n\nThe Board continues to give due consideration at each year end to the return of any surplus capital and for 2021, the Board intends to implement an ordinary share buyback of up to \u00a32 billion, equivalent to up to 2.82 pence per share. This represents the return of capital over and above the Board's view of the current level of capital required to grow the business, meet regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties.\n\nThe share buyback programme is intended to commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed, subject to continued authority from the PRA, by 31 December 2022. Given the total ordinary dividend of 2.00 pence per share and the intended share buyback, the total capital return for 2021 will be up to 4.82 pence per share, an increase of 746 per cent on the prior year, equivalent to up to \u00a33.4 billion.\n\nThe Company intends to use the authority for the repurchase of ordinary shares granted to it at the 2021 AGM to implement the proposed share buyback. Details of this existing authority are set out under 'Power of Directors in relation to shares'.\n\n## Appointment and retirement of Directors\n\nThe appointment and retirement of Directors is governed by the Company's articles of association, the UK Corporate Governance Code and the Companies Act 2006. The Company's articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution of the shareholders in a general meeting.\n\nCharlie Nunn was appointed to the Board on 16 August 2021. Harmeen Mehta was appointed to the Board on 1 November 2021. Both will therefore stand for election at the forthcoming AGM. In the interests of good governance and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all other Directors will retire, and those wishing to serve again will submit themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM. As explained on page 70 , Stuart Sinclair will step down from the Board at the forthcoming AGM and is not seeking re-election.\n\nBiographies of the current Directors are set out on pages 72 to 73 . Details of the Directors seeking election or re-election at the AGM are set out in the Notice of Meeting.\n\n## Board composition changes\n\nChanges to the composition of the Board since 1 January 2021 up to the date of this report are shown in the table below:\n\n|                          | Joined the Board   | Left the Board    |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| Charlie Nunn             | 16 August 2021     |                   |\n| Harmeen Mehta            | 1 November 2021    |                   |\n| Lord Blackwell           |                    | 1 January 2021    |\n| Sir Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio |                    | 30 April 2021     |\n| Sara Weller              |                    | 20 May 2021       |\n| Nick Prettejohn          |                    | 30 September 2021 |\n\nAs announced in September 2021, Stuart Sinclair will retire at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Directors' and Officers' liability insurance\n\nThroughout 2021 the Group had appropriate insurance cover in place to protect Directors, including the Directors who retired during the year, from liabilities that may arise against them personally in connection with the performance of their role.\n\nAs well as insurance cover, the Group agrees to indemnify the Directors to the maximum extent permitted by law. Further information on the Group's indemnity arrangements is provided in the Directors' indemnities section.\n\n## Capital Requirements (Country-by-Country Reporting)\n\nAs required under the Capital Requirements (Country-by-Country Reporting) Regulations 2013, the Group's related disclosures may be found online, at\n\nwww.lloydsbankinggroup.com/investors/financial-downloads.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nThe Directors of the Company, including the former Directors who retired during the year, have entered into individual deeds of indemnity with the Company which constituted 'qualifying thirdparty indemnity provisions' for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006. The deeds indemnify the Directors to the maximum extent permitted by law and remain in force. The deeds were in force during the whole of the financial year or from the date of appointment in respect of the Directors appointed during 2021. Deeds for existing Directors are available for inspection at the Company's registered office.\n\nThe Company has also granted deeds of indemnity by deed poll and by way of entering into individual deeds, which constitute 'qualifying third-party indemnity provisions' to the Directors of the Group's subsidiary companies, including to former Directors who retired during the year and since the year end, and to Group colleagues subject to the provisions of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime. Such deeds were in force during the financial year ended 31 December 2021 and remain in force as at the date of this report.\n\nQualifying pension scheme indemnities have also been granted to the Trustees of the Group's pension schemes, which were in force for the whole of the financial year and remain in force as at the date of this report.\n\n## Change of control\n\nThe Company is not party to any significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid. There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing compensation for loss of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.\n\n## Power of Directors in relation to shares\n\nThe Board manages the business of the Company under the powers set out in the articles of association, which include the Directors' ability to issue or buy back shares. The Directors were granted authorities to issue and allot shares and to buy back shares at the 2021 AGM. Shareholders will be asked to renew these authorities at the 2022 AGM. The authority in respect of purchase of the Company's ordinary shares is limited to 7,088,402,568 ordinary shares, equivalent to 10 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at the latest practicable date prior to publication of the 2021 AGM circular.",

Directors have a duty to notify the Chair and Company Secretary as soon as they become aware of actual or potential conflict situations. Any changes to the commitments of Directors are reported to the Nomination and Governance Committee and the Board, and a register of directors' interests is regularly reviewed and authorised by the Board to ensure the authorisation status remains appropriate.\n\nLord Lupton is a senior adviser to Greenhill Europe, an investment bank focused on providing financial advice on significant mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, financings and capital raising to corporations, partnerships, institutions and governments. The Board has authorised the potential conflicts and requires Lord Lupton to recuse himself from discussions, should the need arise.\n\n## Branches\n\nThe Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services through branches and offices in the UK and overseas.\n\n## Research and development activities\n\nDuring the ordinary course of business, the Group develops new products and services within the business units.\n\n## Information incorporated by reference\n\n| Content                                  |                                                                             | Pages                 |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Group results                            | Summary of Group results                                                    | 50 to 55              |\n| Ordinary dividends                       | Dividends on ordinary shares                                                | 281                   |\n|                                          | Directors' emoluments Directors' remuneration report                        | 101 to 129            |\n| Internal control and  financial risk     | Financial reporting risk                                                    | 137                   |\n| management                               | Risk management                                                             | 37 to 42 135 to 193   |\n|                                          | Financial instruments                                                       | 289 to 300 303 to 322 |\n| Information included                     | Future developments                                                         | 1 to 44               |\n| in the strategic report                  | Supporting people with  disabilities                                        | 34                    |\n|                                          | Engagement with colleagues                                                  | 27                    |\n|                                          | Engagement with customers,  suppliers and others                            | 26 to 29              |\n| Disclosures required  under Listing Rule | Significant contracts                                                       | 286                   |\n| 9.8.4R                                   | Dividend waivers                                                            | 288                   |\n| Principal risks and  uncertainties       | Funding and liquidity                                                       | 39 and 171  to 175    |\n|                                          | Capital position                                                            | 176 to 185            |\n| Viability statement                      | Risk overview                                                               | 43                    |\n| Going concern  statement                 | Risk overview                                                               | 43                    |\n| Share capital and  control               | Share capital and restrictions  on the transfer of shares or  voting rights | 278                   |\n|                                          | Special rights with regard to  the control of the Company                   | 278                   |\n|                                          | Employee share schemes -  exercise voting rights                            | 278                   |\n\n## Substantial shareholders\n\nInformation provided to the Company by substantial shareholders pursuant to the DTR is published via a Regulatory Information Service.

BlackRock Inc.'s holding most recently notified to the Company under Rule 5 of the DTR varies from the holding disclosed in BlackRock Inc.'s Schedule 13-G filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission dated 8 February 2022, which identifies beneficial ownership of 6,484,743,601 shares in the Company representing 9.1 per cent of the issued share capital in the Company. This variance is attributable to different notification and disclosure requirements between these regulatory regimes.\n- 3 An indirect holding.\n\nNo further notifications have been received under Rule 5 of the DTR as at the date of this report.\n\n## Post balance sheet events\n\nDetails of events since the date of the balance sheet are provided in note 53 on page 334 .\n\n## Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions reporting for our own operations\n\nThe Group has reported greenhouse gas emissions and environmental performance since 2009, and since 2013 this has been reported in line with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and its applicable regulations and the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) (i.e. Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting ('SECR'). Our total emissions, in tonnes of CO 2 equivalent, are reported in the table below. Deloitte LLP has provided limited level ISAE 3000 (Revised) assurance over selected non-financial indicators. Their full, independent assurance statement is available online at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/who-we-are/responsiblebusiness/downloads.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe Group follows the principles of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to calculate Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from our worldwide operations. The reporting period is 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021, which is different to that of our Directors' report (January to December 2021). This is in line with the regulations in that most of the emissions reporting year falls within the period of the Directors' report. Emissions are reported based on the operational control approach.\n\nReported Scope 1 emissions are those generated from gas and oil used in buildings, emissions from fuels used in UK company owned vehicles used for business travel and fugitive emissions from the use of air conditioning and chiller/refrigerant plant. Reported Scope 2 emissions are generated from the use of electricity and are calculated using both the location and marketbased methodologies. Reported Scope 3 emissions relate to business travel and commuting undertaken by colleagues, emissions from colleagues working from home, operational waste and the extraction and distribution of each of our energy sources - electricity, gas and oil.",

Scope 3 emissions include elements within the Group's own operations including emissions for waste, colleague commuting and business travel (including taxis, tube, well to tank emissions of business travel and hotels). Additionally, October 19-September 20 and October 20-September 21 Scope 3 figures include an allowance for emissions from homeworkers not previously accounted for, owing to the significant increase in materiality year-on-year due to the impacts of COVID-19. Previous years have not been restated.\n\nThis year, our overall location-based carbon emissions were 188,806 tonnes CO 2 e; a 8.5 per cent since decrease since 2019/20. We have seen a continued reduction in our carbon emissions this reporting year, mainly driven by the impact of coronavirus on our operations. A large proportion of our colleagues continued to work from home in 2021 in line with travel restrictions and advice, which has led to a considerable reduction in both scope 1 and 3 business travel numbers reported.\n\nGroup energy consumption, electricity and gas, has also reduced mainly due to the impact of this operational shift. However, most of our buildings have still been operational and subject to our continued energy management and optimisation programme. Throughout winter months we have seen a small increase in our gas consumption due to additional fresh air requirements in our operational buildings. Overall, we have seen building energy consumption and associated carbon emissions reduced.\n\nSince January 2019, our scope 2 market-based emissions figure is zero tCO 2 e, as we have procured renewable electricity mainly through our PPA and Green Tariff, and renewable certificates equal to the remainder to make up the total electricity consumption in each of the markets we operate.\n\n## Omissions\n\nEmissions associated with joint ventures and investments are not included in this disclosure as they fall outside the scope of our operational boundary. The Group does not have any emissions associated with imported heat, steam or imported cooling and is not aware of any other material sources of omissions from our/uni00A0reporting.\n\n## Carbon emissions (tonnes CO2e)\n\n|                                               | Oct 2020 - Sept 2021   | Oct 2019 -  Sept 2020   | Oct 2018 -  Sept 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Total CO 2 e (market based)  \uf0fe                | 118,057                | 119,878                 | 180,002                 |\n| Total CO 2 e (location based)  \uf0fe              | 188,806                | 206,236                 | 286,363                 |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2   (location based)  \uf0fe     | 108,401                | 125,387                 | 154,917                 |\n| - of which UK Scope 1 and 2  (location based) | 108,084                | 124,708                 | 152,546                 |\n| Total Scope 1 and 2   (market based)  \uf0fe       | 37,653                 | 39,029                  | 48,556                  |\n| - of which UK Scope 1 and 2  (market based)   | 37,336                 | 38,728                  | 47,872                  |\n| Total Scope 1  \uf0fe                              | 37,653                 | 39,029                  | 48,171                  |\n| Total Scope 2   (market based)  \uf0fe             | \\_                      | \\_                       | 385                     |\n| Total Scope 2   (location based)  \uf0fe           | 70,748                 | 86,358                  | 106,745                 |\n| Total Scope 3  \uf0fe                              | 80,404                 | 80,849                  | 131,446                 |\n\n## Global energy use (kWhs)\n\n|                                      | Oct 2020 - Sept 2021   | Oct 2019 -  Sept 2020\u00b9   | Oct 2018 -  Sept 2019\u00b9   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Total global  energy/uni00A0use  \uf0fe   | 474,364,203            | 517,459,510              | 589,853,483              |\n| - of which UK  energy/uni00A0use     | 469,425,422            | 512,208,678              | 583,662,870              |\n| Total building   energy              | 468,594,150            | 497,144,236              | 550,290,468              |\n| Total company  owned vehicle  energy | 2,796,073              | 14,436,436               | 29,987,906               |\n| Total grey fleet  vehicle energy\u00b2    | 2,973,980              | 5,878,838                | 9,575,109                |\n\n- 1 Restated 2018/2019 and 2019/20 emissions data to improve the accuracy of reporting, using actual data to replace estimates.\n- 2 Grey fleet refers to colleague and hired road vehicles being used for a business purpose.

        "page_content": "## Energy efficiency\n\nWhile COVID-19 has had an impact on our energy performance year on year, we have also seen consumption reduction driven by our continued energy efficiency initiatives. This workstream includes an energy optimisation programme that implements onsite optimisation and strategic alterations of Building Management System (BMS) and controls systems to match the run hours of plant to core operating hours and ensures temperature settings are aligned with Group comfort guidelines. In 2021, 45/uni00A0deep-dives, 80 onsite optimisations, 9 remote optimisations and 531 bank holiday programming were completed, which resulted in a 101.5 GWh saving. We have also run a programme of LED lighting upgrades and improved building controls throughout our estate, leading to an estimated 1,280 MWh electricity saving.\n\n## Independent auditor and audit information\n\nEach person who is a Director at the date of approval of this report confirms that, so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware and each Director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditor is aware of that information. This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Statement of Directors' responsibilities\n\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the Directors' remuneration report, and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the Directors are required to prepare the Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nUnder company law, the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company and Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to properly select and apply accounting policies; present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity's financial position and financial performance; and make an assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nA copy of the financial statements is placed on our website at www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/investors/financial-downloads. The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nEach of the current Directors who are in office as at the date of this report, and whose names and functions are listed on pages 72 to 73 of this annual report, confirm that, to the best of his or her knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group and the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group and the Company\n- \u00b7 The Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company and the Group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n- \u00b7 The management report contained in the strategic report and the Directors' report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and the Company together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face\n\nThe Directors have also separately reviewed and approved the strategic report.\n\nOn behalf of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Kate Cheetham\n\nCompany Secretary 23 February 2022\n\nLloyds Banking Group plc Registered in Scotland, No. SC095000",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nRisk management is at the heart of Helping Britain Prosper and creating a more sustainable and inclusive future for people and businesses.\n\nOur mission is to protect our customers, shareholders, colleagues and the Group, while enabling sustainable growth in targeted segments. This is achieved through informed risk decisions and robust risk management, supported by a consistent risk-focused culture.\n\nThe risk overview ( pages 37 to 43 ) provides a summary of risk management within the Group and the key focus areas for 2021, including the significant impact that COVID-19 continues to have on all principal risks faced by the Group. The risk overview also highlights the importance of the connectivity of principal, emerging and strategic risks and how they are embedded into the Group's strategic risk management framework.\n\nThis full risk management section provides a more in-depth picture of how risk is managed within the Group, detailing the Group's emerging risks, approach to stress testing, risk governance, committee structure, appetite for risk and a full analysis of the principal risk categories ( pages 143 to 193 ), the framework by which risks are identified, managed, mitigated and monitored.\n\nEach principal risk category is described and managed using the following standard headings: definition, exposures, measurement, mitigation and monitoring.\n\n## The Group's approach to risk\n\nThe Group operates a prudent approach to risk with rigorous management\n\ncontrols to support sustainable business growth and minimise losses. Through a strong and independent risk function (Risk division), a robust control framework is maintained to identify and escalate current and emerging risks, support sustainable growth within the Group's risk appetite, and to drive and inform good risk reward decision-making.\n\nTo meet ring-fencing requirements, core UK retail and commercial financial services and ancillary retail activities are ring-fenced from other activities of the Group. The Group's enterprise risk management framework (ERMF) and Group risk appetite apply across the Group and are supplemented by risk management frameworks and risk appetites for the sub-groups to meet sub-group specific needs. In each case these operate within the Group parameters. The Group's Corporate Governance Framework applies across Lloyds Banking Group plc, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and HBOS plc. It is tailored where needed to meet the entity-specific needs of Lloyds Bank plc and Bank of Scotland plc, and supplementary corporate governance frameworks are in place to address sub-group specific requirements of the other sub-groups (Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets, Insurance and Equity Investments).\n\nThe Group's ERMF is structured to align with the industry-accepted internal control framework standards.\n\nThe ERMF applies to every area of the business and covers all types of risk. It is reviewed, updated and approved by the Board at least annually to reflect any changes in the nature of the Group's business and external regulations, law, corporate governance and industry best practice. The ERMF provides the Group with an effective mechanism for developing and embedding risk policies and risk management strategies which are aligned with the risks faced by its businesses. It also seeks to facilitate effective communication on these matters across the Group.\n\n## Role of the Board and senior management\n\nKey responsibilities of the Board and senior management include:\n\n- \u00b7 Approval of Group-wide risk principles and policies\n- \u00b7 Approval of the ERMF and Board risk appetite\n- \u00b7 The cascade of delegated authority (for example to Board subcommittees and the Group Chief Executive)\n- \u00b7 Effective oversight of risk management consistent with risk appetite\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe Group's approach to setting, governing, embedding and monitoring risk appetite is detailed in the risk appetite framework, a key component of the ERMF.\n\nRisk appetite is defined within the Group as the amount and type of risk that the Group is prepared to seek, accept or tolerate in delivering its strategy.\n\nGroup strategy and risk appetite are developed in tandem. Business planning aims to optimise value within the Group's risk appetite parameters and deliver on its promise to Help Britain Prosper.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite statement details the risk parameters within which the Group operates. The statement forms part of the Group's control framework and is embedded into its policies, authorities and limits, to guide decision-making and risk management. Group risk appetite is regularly reviewed and refreshed to ensure appropriate coverage across our principal risks and any emerging risks, and to align with internal or external change.\n\nThe Board is responsible for approving the Group's Board risk appetite statement annually. Group Board-level metrics are augmented by further sub-Board-level metrics and cascaded into more detailed business appetite metrics and limits.\n\nThe following areas are currently included in the Group Board risk appetite:\n\nMarket: the Group has effective controls in place to identify and manage the market risk inherent in our customer and client focused activities.\n\nCredit: the Group has a conservative and well balanced credit portfolio through the economic cycle, generating an appropriate return on equity, in line with the Group's target return on equity in aggregate.\n\nFunding and liquidity: the Group maintains a prudent liquidity profile and a balance sheet structure that limits its reliance on potentially volatile sources of funding.\n\nCapital: the Group maintains capital levels commensurate with a prudent level of solvency to achieve financial resilience and market confidence.\n\nChange/execution: the Group has limited appetite for negative impacts on customers, colleagues, or the Group as a result of change activity.\n\nConduct: the Group delivers fair outcomes for its customers.\n\nData: the Group has zero appetite for data related regulatory fines or enforcement actions.\n\nPeople: the Group leads responsibly and proficiently, manages people resource effectively, supports and develops colleague skills and talent, creates and nurtures the right culture and meets legal and regulatory obligations related to its people.\n\nOperational resilience: the Group has limited appetite for disruption to services to customers and stakeholders from significant unexpected events.\n\nOperational: the Group has robust controls in place to manage operational losses, reputational events and regulatory breaches. It identifies and assesses emerging risks and acts to mitigate these.\n\nModel: material models are performing in line with expectations.\n\nRegulatory and legal: the Group interprets and complies with all relevant regulation and all applicable laws (including codes of conduct which could have legal implications) and/or legal obligations.\n\nClimate: the Group takes action to identify, manage and mitigate its climate risk and support the Group and its customers in transitioning to a low carbon economy.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Governance frameworks\n\nThe Group's approach to risk is based on a robust control framework and a strong risk management culture which are the foundation for the delivery of effective risk management and guide the way all employees approach their work, behave and make decisions.\n\nGovernance is maintained through delegation of authority from the Board to individuals through the management hierarchy. Senior executives are supported where required by a committee-based structure which is designed to ensure open challenge and support effective decision-making.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite, principles, policies, procedures, controls and reporting are regularly reviewed and updated where needed to ensure they remain fully in line with regulation, law, corporate governance and industry good practice.\n\nThe interaction of the executive and non-executive governance structures relies upon a culture of transparency and openness that is encouraged by both the Board and senior management.\n\nBoard-level engagement, coupled with the direct involvement of senior management in Group-wide risk issues at Group Executive Committee level, ensures that escalated issues are promptly addressed and remediation plans are initiated where required.\n\nLine managers are directly accountable for identifying and managing risks in their individual businesses, ensuring that business decisions strike an appropriate balance between risk and reward and are consistent with the Group's risk appetite.\n\nClear responsibilities and accountabilities for risk are defined across the Group through a three lines of defence model which ensures effective independent oversight and assurance in respect of key decisions.\n\nThe Risk Committee governance framework is outlined on page 138 .\n\n## Three lines of defence model\n\nThe ERMF is implemented through a 'three lines of defence' model which defines clear responsibilities and accountabilities and ensures effective independent oversight and assurance activities take place covering key decisions.\n\nBusiness lines (first line) have primary responsibility for risk decisions, identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling risks within their areas of accountability. They are required to establish effective governance and control frameworks for their business to be compliant with Group policy requirements, to maintain appropriate risk management skills, mechanisms and toolkits, and to act within Group risk appetite parameters set and approved by the Board.\n\nRisk division (second line) is a centralised function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer, providing oversight and constructive challenge to the effectiveness of risk decisions taken by business management, providing proactive advice and guidance, reviewing, challenging and reporting on the risk profile of the Group and ensuring that mitigating actions are appropriate.\n\nIt also has a key role in promoting the implementation of a strategic approach to risk management reflecting the risk appetite and ERMF agreed by the Board that encompasses:\n\n- \u00b7 Transparent, focused risk monitoring and reporting\n- \u00b7 Overseeing embedding of effective risk management processes\n- \u00b7 Provision of expert and high quality advice and guidance to the Board, executives and management on strategic issues and horizon scanning, including pending regulatory changes\n- \u00b7 A constructive dialogue with the first line through provision of advice, development of common methodologies, understanding, education, training, and development of new risk management tools\n\nThe primary role of Group Internal Audit (third line) is to help the Board and executive management protect the assets, reputation and sustainability of the Group. Group Internal Audit is led by the Group Chief Internal Auditor. Group Internal Audit provides independent assurance to the Audit Committee and the Board through performing reviews and engaging with committees and executive management, providing opinion, challenge and informal advice on risk and the state of the control environment. Group Internal Audit is a single independent internal audit function, reporting to the Audit Committee of the Group and the Audit Committees of the key subsidiaries.\n\n## Risk and control cycle from identification to reporting\n\nTo allow senior management to make informed risk decisions, the business follows a continuous risk management approach which includes producing appropriate, accurate and focused risk reporting. The risk and control cycle sets out how this should be approached. This cycle, from identification to reporting, ensures consistency and is intended to manage and mitigate the risks impacting the Group.\n\nThe process for risk identification, measurement and control is integrated into the overall framework for risk governance. Risk identification processes are forward-looking to ensure emerging risks are identified. Risks are captured and measured using robust and consistent quantification methodologies. The measurement of risks includes the application of stress testing and scenario analysis, and considers whether relevant controls are in place before risks are incurred.\n\nIdentified risks are reported on a monthly basis or as frequently as necessary to the appropriate committee. The extent of the risk is compared to the overall risk appetite as well as specific limits or triggers. When thresholds are breached, committee minutes are clear on the actions and time frames required to resolve the breach and bring risk within tolerances. There is a clear process for escalation of risks and risk events.\n\nAll key controls are recorded and assessed on a regular basis, in response to triggers or minimum annually. Control assessments consider both the adequacy of the design and operating effectiveness. Where a control is not effective, the root cause is established and action plans implemented to improve control design or performance. Control effectiveness against all residual risks are aggregated by risk category and reported and monitored via the monthly Consolidated Risk Report (CRR). The CRR is reviewed and independently challenged by the Risk division and provided to the Risk division Executive Committee and Group Risk Committee. On an annual basis, a point in time assessment is made for control effectiveness against each risk category and across subgroups. The CRR data is the primary source used for this point-in-time assessment and a year-on-year comparison on control effectiveness is reported to the Board.\n\nOne Risk and Control Self-Assessment (One RCSA) is part of the Group's risk and control strategy to deliver a stronger risk culture and simplified risk and control environment. Following improvements made to the Group's approach to risk management, implementation was completed at the end of 2021 across Divisional and Sub-Group Risk Profiles. One RCSA will continue to embed across the Group as risk practices, data quality, culture and capability mature.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nBased on the Group's prudent business model, prudent approach to risk management, and guided by the Board, the senior management articulates the core risk values to which the Group aspires, and sets the tone at the top. Senior management establishes a strong focus on building and sustaining long-term relationships with customers, through the economic cycle. The Group's Code of Responsibility reinforces colleagues' accountability for the risks they take and their responsibility to prioritise their customers' needs.",

        "page_content": "## Risk resources and capabilities\n\nAppropriate mechanisms are in place to avoid over-reliance on key personnel or system/technical expertise within the Group. Adequate resources are in place to serve customers both under normal working conditions and in times of stress, and monitoring procedures are in place to ensure that the level of available resource can be increased if required. Colleagues undertake appropriate training to ensure they have the skills and knowledge necessary to enable them to deliver fair outcomes for customers.\n\nThere is ongoing investment in risk systems and models alongside the Group's investment in customer and product systems and processes. This drives improvements in risk data quality, aggregation and reporting leading to effective and efficient risk decisions.\n\n## Risk decision-making and reporting\n\nRisk analysis and reporting enables better understanding of risks and returns, supporting the identification of opportunities as well as better management of risks.\n\nAn aggregate view of the Group's overall risk profile, key risks and management actions, and performance against risk appetite, including the CRR, is reported to and discussed monthly at the Group Risk Committee with regular reporting to the Board Risk Committee and the Board.\n\nRigorous stress testing exercises are carried out to assess the impact of a range of adverse scenarios with different probabilities and severities to inform strategic planning.\n\nThe Chief Risk Officer regularly informs the Board Risk Committee of the aggregate risk profile and has direct access to the Chair and members of Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Financial reporting risk management systems and internal controls\n\nThe Group maintains risk management systems and internal controls relating to the financial reporting process which are designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure that accounting policies are appropriately and consistently applied, transactions are recorded accurately, and undertaken in accordance with delegated authorities, that assets are safeguarded and liabilities are properly stated\n\n## Exposure to risk arising from the business activities of the Group\n\nThe table below provides a high level guide to how the Group's business activities are reflected through its risk-weighted assets.

Insurance does not hold any RWAs as its assets are removed from the Group's regulatory capital calculations. However, in accordance with capital rules part of the Group's equity investment in Insurance is included in the calculation of threshold RWAs, while the remainder is taken as a deduction from common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital.\n- 2 Central items include assets held outside the main operating divisions, including the assets of Group Corporate Treasury which holds the Group's liquidity portfolio, and other supporting functions.\n- 3 Exposures relating to the default fund of a central counterparty and credit valuation adjustment risk are included in counterparty credit risk.\n- 4 Threshold RWAs reflect the proportion of significant investments and deferred tax assets that are permitted to be risk-weighted instead of deducted from CET1 capital. Significant investments primarily arise from the investment in the Group's Insurance business.\n\n- \u00b7 Enable the calculation, preparation and reporting of financial, prudential regulatory and tax outcomes in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards, statutory and regulatory requirements\n- \u00b7 Ensure that disclosures are made on a timely basis in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements (for example UK Finance Code for Financial Reporting Disclosure and the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act)\n- \u00b7 Enable certifications by the Senior Accounting Officer relating to maintenance of appropriate tax accounting and in accordance with the 2009 Finance Act\n- \u00b7 Ensure ongoing monitoring to assess the impact of emerging regulation and legislation on financial, prudential regulatory and tax reporting\n- \u00b7 Ensure an accurate view of the Group's performance to allow the Board and senior management to appropriately manage the affairs and strategy of the business as a whole and each of its sub-groups\n\nThe Group has a Disclosure Committee which assists the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer in fulfilling their disclosure responsibilities under relevant listing and other regulatory and legal requirements. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews the quality and acceptability of the Group's financial disclosures.

It is fully embedded in the planning process of the Group and its key legal entities as a key activity in medium-term planning, and senior management is actively involved in stress testing activities via the governance process.\n\nScenario stress testing is used for:\n\nRisk identification:\n\n- \u00b7 Understand key vulnerabilities of the Group and its key legal entities under adverse economic conditions\n\nRisk appetite:\n\n- \u00b7 Inform the setting of risk appetite by assessing the underlying risks under stress conditions\n- \u00b7 Assess the results of the stress test against the risk appetite of all parts of the Group to ensure the Group and its legal entities are managed within their risk parameters\n\nStrategic and capital planning:\n\n- \u00b7 Support the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) by demonstrating capital adequacy, and meet the requirements of regulatory stress tests that are used to inform the setting of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and management buffers (see capital risk on pages 176 to 185 ) of the Group and its separately regulated legal entities\n- \u00b7 Allow senior management and the Boards of the Group and its applicable legal entities to adjust strategies if the plan does not meet risk appetite in a stressed scenario\n\nRisk mitigation:\n\n- \u00b7 Drive the development of potential actions and contingency plans to mitigate the impact of adverse scenarios. Stress testing also links directly to the recovery planning process of the Group and its legal entities\n\n## Regulatory stress tests\n\nThe PRA carried out a Solvency Stress test in 2021 which included the Group. Their objective was to update the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) view on how the banking system can support the economy, ensure banks have built up buffers of capital to be drawn on in a stress and input into the PRA's transition back to its standard approach to capital-setting and shareholder distributions. Results showed that the Group passed the stress test on both a fully-loaded (non-transitional) and a transitional IFRS 9 basis, with the Bank of England calculating the Group's CET1 ratio after the application of management actions as 7.8 per cent, against the reference rate of 7.7 per cent, and the Group was not required to take any capital actions. This shows that the Group is resilient to a severe economic shock in addition to what has been experienced over 2020, as the House Price Index (HPI) and Commercial Real Estate (CRE) values fell a further 33 per cent and unemployment peaked at 11.9 per cent in the Bank of England's theoretical stress scenario.\n\n## Internal stress tests\n\nOn at least an annual basis, the Group conducts macroeconomic stress tests of the operating plan, which are supplemented with higher-level refreshes if necessary. The exercise aims to highlight the key vulnerabilities of the Group's and its legal entities' business plans to adverse changes in the economic environment, and to ensure that there are adequate financial resources in the event of a downturn.\n\n## Reverse stress testing\n\nReverse stress testing is used to explore the vulnerabilities of the Group's and its key legal entities' strategies and plans to extreme adverse events that would cause the businesses to fail. Where this identifies plausible scenarios with an unacceptably high risk, the Group or its entities will adopt measures to prevent or mitigate that and reflect these in strategic plans.\n\n## Other stress testing activity\n\nThe Group's stress testing programme also involves undertaking assessments of liquidity scenarios, market risk sensitivities and scenarios, and business-specific scenarios (see the principal risk categories on pages 143 to 193 for further information on risk-specific stress testing). If required, ad hoc stress testing exercises are also undertaken to assess emerging risks, as well as in response to regulatory requests. This wide-ranging programme provides a comprehensive view of the potential impacts arising from the risks to which the Group is exposed and reflects the nature, scale and complexity of the Group. The Group participated in Part 1 of the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Stress test in 2021 and will leverage the experience gained through that exercise to further embed climate risk into risk management and stress testing activities.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe stress tests at all levels must comply with all regulatory requirements, achieved through the comprehensive construction of macroeconomic scenarios and a rigorous divisional, functional, risk and executive review and challenge process, supported by analysis and insight into impacts on customers and business drivers.\n\nThe engagement of all required business, Risk and Finance teams is built into the preparation process, so that the appropriate analysis of each risk category's impact upon the business plans is understood and documented. The methodologies and modelling approach used for stress testing ensure that a clear link is shown between the macroeconomic scenarios, the business drivers for each area and the resultant stress testing outputs. All material assumptions used in modelling are documented and justified, with a clearly communicated review and sign-off process. Modelling is supported by expert judgement and is subject to the Group model governance policy.",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\nClear accountabilities and responsibilities for stress testing are assigned to senior management and the Risk and Finance functions throughout the Group and its key legal entities. This is formalised through the Group business planning and stress testing policy and procedure, which are reviewed at least annually.\n\nThe Group Financial Risk Committee (GFRC), chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and attended by the Chief Financial Officer and other senior Risk and Finance colleagues, is the committee that has primary responsibility for overseeing the development and execution of the Group's and RingFenced Bank's stress tests. The Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets (LBCM) Risk Committee performs a similar function within the scope of LBCM.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\n## Emerging risk\n\nA future internal or external event or trend, which could have a material positive or adverse impact on the Group and our customers, but where the probability, timescale and/or materiality may be difficult to accurately assess.\n\n## Background and framework\n\nUnderstanding emerging risks is an essential component of the Group's risk management approach, enabling the Group to identify the most pertinent risks and opportunities, and to respond through strategic planning and appropriate risk mitigation.\n\nAlthough emerging risk is not a principal risk, if left undetected emerging risks have the potential to adversely impact the Group or result in missed opportunities.\n\nImpacts from emerging risks on the Group's principal risks can materialise via two different routes:\n\n- \u00b7 Alternatively, emerging risks can be a source of new strategic risks, dependent on our chosen response and the underlying assumptions on how given emerging risks may manifest.\n- \u00b7 Emerging risks can impact the Group's principal risks directly in the absence of an appropriate strategic response.\n\nWhere an emerging risk is considered material enough in its own right, the Group may choose to recognise the risk as a principal risk. Recent examples of this include climate risk and strategic risk. Such elevations are considered and approved through the Board as part of the annual refresh of the enterprise risk management framework.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk identification\n\nThe basis for risk identification is founded on collaboration between functions across the Group. The activity incorporates internal horizon scanning and engagement with external experts to gain an external context, ensuring broad coverage.\n\nThis activity is inherently linked with and builds upon the annual strategic planning cycle and is used to identify key external trends, risks and opportunities for the Group.\n\nThe Group is evolving its methodology in respect of the identification and prioritisation of emerging risks. 2021 saw the development of a quantitative risk assessment methodology for understanding the connectivity of strategic risk. Drawing on this methodology and findings, we have expanded our insights by considering the emerging risks that relate to macro strategic risk themes. A description of the macro strategic risk themes is outlined in the risk overview on page 41 .\n\n## Notable emerging risks and their implications\n\nThe Group considers the following emerging risk themes as having the potential to increase in significance and affect the performance of the Group. These risks can align to one or more of the Group's macro strategic risk themes (detailed in the risk overview section on page 41 ) and are considered alongside the Group's operating plan.\n\n| Emerging risk theme                                  | Key considerations                                                                                                                                                                |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Breakdown of the EU                                  | Wide-ranging risks associated with dissolution of the European Union, with member states choosing to  function independently.                                                     |\n| Climate change transition risk                       | Risks arising from the Group's participation choices, policies and investments to support transition to a zero  carbon economy and its ability to meet published climate targets. |\n| Data-driven propositions                             | Harnessing real-time data, emerging technologies and communication channels, to meet consumer  appetite for bespoke products and services.                                        |\n| Digital currencies                                   | Risks and opportunities posed by introduction of new, or wider adoption of existing, digital currencies,  associated supporting infrastructure and subsequent management.         |\n| Evolving regulation                                  | Changing regulatory standards and possibility of retrospective application, driving reputational damage,  fines, litigation and remediation activity.                             |\n| Future pandemics and the world's ability to  respond | Economic, political, social and technological impacts caused by mutations of existing viruses, new viruses, or  resistance to treatments for existing illnesses.                  |\n\nThe review and challenge of the Group's and Ring-Fenced Bank's detailed stress forecasts, the key assumptions behind these, and the methodology used to translate the economic assumptions into stressed outputs conclude with the appropriate Finance and Risk sign-off. The outputs are then presented to GFRC and the Board Risk Committee for review and challenge, before being approved by the Board. There is a similar process within LBCM for the governance of the LBCM-specific results.\n\n## Principal risks\n\nThe Board-approved enterprise-wide risk categories used to monitor and report the risk exposures posing the greatest impact to the Group.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nA principal risk arising from:\n\n- -  A failure to understand the potential impact of strategic responses on existing risk types\n- -  Incorrect assumptions about internal or external operating environments\n- -  Inappropriate strategic responses and business plans",

Pertinent emerging risks are considered as part of the Group's strategic and business planning processes and primarily addressed through the Group's strategy.\n\nKey actions to tackle the emerging challenges and capitalise on opportunities as part of the Group's strategy include the following:\n\nPurpose: At the heart of the Group's purpose are the themes of inclusion, sustainability and being people-first. As such, the Group's strategy aims to fully embed a purpose that supports a more inclusive and sustainable future for the Group's customers, colleagues and shareholders.\n\nOutcomes will see products, services and activities, aligning to societal and regulatory expectations, which drive impacts across housing, financial wellbeing, businesses and jobs, communities, regions, and sustainability.\n\nCustomer proposition: As part of its strategy, the Group aims to enhance its proposition, better aligning to its purpose, while supporting transition to a low carbon economy and adapting to the changing demographic of both its customer base and that of the UK.\n\nKey components include:\n\n- \u00b7 Democratising access to wealth advice, as well as creating a step change in how the Group engages with affluent customers to meet their holistic needs\n- \u00b7 Creating better engagement, improving customer journeys and enhancing experiences and tools to drive greater financial resilience and well-being for customers\n- \u00b7 Supporting customers and businesses in respect of making their homes, vehicles, properties and activities more sustainable\n- \u00b7 Capitalising on the Group's existing asset and product capabilities for corporate and institutional clients to play a leading role in the transition to Net Zero, addressing regional inequalities and supporting UK prosperity by helping corporates trade internationally\n\nTalent: The Group is firmly committed to being diverse, employing new ways of working, where colleagues are supported in having a growth mindset and empowered to make decisions at pace.\n\nThe strategy places focus on a colleague proposition that can attract and retain the best people, while leveraging talent pools across the UK and exploring in-house skills growth strategies, alongside partnerships with universities and businesses, to supplement scarce skill sets.\n\nFor the long term, the Group intends to use its strategic workforce planning capability for understanding and meeting the evolving demand of skills from its businesses and functions. This will also act as the bedrock for key strategic decisions and interventions in respect of important elements of the Group's talent strategy in the future.\n\nTechnology: Simplification of the Group's estate and leveraging contemporary technologies are core components of the Group's strategy.\n\nThe Group aims to manage the challenges of a rapidly evolving landscape by employing technology that is aligned to industry best practice refresh rates, while promoting autonomy and empowerment within teams by streamlining governance.\n\nThis will be supplemented with an aligned business and technology vision and a rationalised hybrid cloud technology estate and modern engineering standards.\n\nData: Being data-driven is central to the Group's transformation activity. More than one third of the benefits from the Group's business strategies are reliant on the ability to successfully leverage data. As such managing data risk and employing strong data ethics are key considerations for the strategy.\n\nThe Group has developed a data management strategy to provide the common framework and direction by uplifting data quality, simplifying data architecture, enhancing data governance and implementing market leading tools to improve its ability to deliver a data-first culture. The Group has also invested in data ethics framework and strong governance for its advanced analytics and cloud programmes.\n\nIn addition to the strategic actions detailed above, the Group works closely with regulatory authorities and industry bodies to ensure that the Group can monitor external developments (e.g. potential regulatory divergence from EU) and identify and respond to the evolving landscape, particularly in relation to regulatory and legal risk.",

Within the Group's balance sheet these fall under the trading assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The assets and liabilities are classified as trading book if they meet the requirements as set out in the Capital Requirements Regulation, article 104. Further information on these activities can be found under the Trading portfolios section on page 148 .\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities are held by the Group for three main purposes: to provide risk management solutions for clients, to manage portfolio risks arising from client business and to manage and hedge the Group's own risks. Insurance business assets and liabilities relate to\n\npolicyholder funds, as well as shareholder invested assets, including annuity funds. The Group recognises the value of in-force business in respect of Insurance's long-term life assurance contracts as an asset in the balance sheet (see note 23, page 258 ).\n\nThe Group ensures that it has adequate cash and balances at central banks and stocks of high quality liquid assets (e.g. gilts or US Treasury securities) that can be converted easily into cash to meet liquidity requirements. The majority of these assets are asset swapped and held at fair value through other comprehensive income. Further information on these balances can be found under funding and liquidity risk on page 171 .\n\nThe majority of debt issuance originates from the Group's capital and funding activities and the interest rate risk of the debt issued is hedged by swapping them into a floating rate.",

        "page_content": "The non-trading book primarily consists of customer on-balance sheet activities and the Group's capital and funding activities, which expose it to the risk of adverse movements in market rates or prices, predominantly interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices, as described in further detail within the Banking activities section ( page 145 ).\n\n## Measurement\n\nGroup risk appetite is calibrated primarily to a number of multi-risk Group economic scenarios, and is supplemented with sensitivity-based measures. The scenarios assess the impact of unlikely, but plausible, adverse stresses on income with the worst case for banking activities, defined benefit pensions, insurance and trading portfolios reported against independently, and across the Group as a whole.\n\nThe Group risk appetite is cascaded first to the Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO), chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, where risk appetite is approved and monitored by risk type, and then to the Group Market Risk Committee (GMRC) where risk appetite is sub-allocated by division. These metrics are reviewed regularly by senior management to inform effective decision-making.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nGALCO is responsible for approving and monitoring Group market risks, management techniques, market risk measures, behavioural assumptions, and the market risk policy. Various mitigation activities are assessed and undertaken across the Group to manage portfolios and seek to ensure they remain within approved limits. The mitigation actions will vary dependent on exposure but will, in general, look to reduce risk in a cost effective manner by offsetting balance sheet exposures and externalising to the financial markets dependent on market liquidity. The market risk policy is owned by Group Corporate Treasury (GCT) and refreshed annually. The policy is underpinned by supplementary market risk procedures, which define specific market risk management and oversight requirements.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nGALCO and GMRC regularly review high level market risk exposure as part of the wider risk management framework. They also make recommendations to the Board concerning overall market risk appetite and market risk policy. Exposures at lower levels of delegation are monitored at various intervals according to their volatility, from daily in the case of trading portfolios to monthly or quarterly in the case of less volatile portfolios. Levels of exposures compared to approved limits and triggers are monitored by Risk and appropriate escalation procedures are in place.\n\nHow market risks arise and are managed across the Group's activities is considered in more detail below.\n\n## Banking activities\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's banking activities expose it to the risk of adverse movements in market rates or prices, predominantly interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates and equity prices. The volatility of market rates or prices can be affected by both the transparency of prices and the amount of liquidity in the market for the relevant asset, liability or instrument.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nYield curve risk in the Group's divisional portfolios, and in the Group's capital and funding activities, arises from the different repricing characteristics of the Group's non-trading assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions.\n\nBasis risk arises from the potential changes in spreads between indices, for example where the bank lends with reference to a central bank rate but funds with reference to a market rate, e.g. SONIA, and the spread between these two rates widens or tightens.\n\nOptionality risk arises predominantly from embedded optionality within assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet items where either the Group or the customer can affect the size or timing of cash flows. One example of this is mortgage prepayment risk where the customer owns an option allowing them to prepay when it is economical to do so. This can result in customer balances amortising more quickly or slowly than anticipated due to customers' response to changes in economic conditions.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nEconomic foreign exchange exposure arises from the Group's investment in its overseas operations (net investment exposures are disclosed in note 51 on page 303 ). In addition, the Group incurs foreign exchange risk through non-functional currency flows from services provided by customer-facing divisions, the Group's debt and capital management programmes and is exposed to volatility in its CET1 ratio, due to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the retranslation of non-Sterling-denominated risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Equity risk\n\nEquity risk arises primarily from three different sources:\n\n- \u00b7 A small number of legacy strategic equity holdings, for example Visa Inc Preference Shares, and recent minority fintech stakes, all held in the Equities sub-group\n- \u00b7 The Group's private equity exposure from investments held by Lloyds Development Capital and its stake in BGF, both within the Equities subgroup\n- \u00b7 A small exposure to Lloyds Banking Group share price through deferred shares and deferred options granted to employees as part of their benefits package\n\n## Credit spread risk\n\nCredit spread risk arises largely from: (i) the liquid asset portfolio held in the management of Group liquidity, comprising of government, supranational and other eligible assets; (ii) the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) and Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) sensitivity to credit spreads; (iii) a number of the Group's structured medium-term notes where the Group has elected to fair value the notes through the profit and loss account; and (iv) banking book assets in Commercial Banking held at fair value under IFRS 9.\n\n## Measurement\n\nInterest rate risk exposure is monitored monthly using, primarily:\n\nMarket value sensitivity: this methodology considers all repricing mismatches (behaviourally adjusted where appropriate) in the current balance sheet and calculates the change in market value that would result from an instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis points parallel rise or fall in the yield curve. Sterling interest rates are modelled with a floor below zero per cent, with negative rate floors also modelled for non-Sterling currencies where appropriate (product-specific floors apply). The market value sensitivities are calculated on a static balance sheet using principal cash flows excluding interest, commercial margins and other spread components and are therefore discounted at the risk-free rate.\n\nInterest income sensitivity: this measures the impact on future net interest income arising from various economic scenarios. These include instantaneous 25, 100 and 200 basis point parallel shifts in all yield curves and the Group economic scenarios. Sterling interest rates are modelled with a floor below zero per cent, with negative rate floors also modelled for non-Sterling currencies where appropriate (product-specific floors apply). These scenarios are reviewed every year and are designed to replicate severe but plausible economic events, capturing risks that would not be evident through the use of parallel shocks alone such as basis risk and steepening or flattening of the yield curve. Additional negative rate scenarios are also used, where floors are removed, to ensure that this risk is monitored; however, these are not measured against the limit framework for the purposes of risk appetite.\n\nUnlike the market value sensitivities, the interest income sensitivities incorporate additional behavioural assumptions as to how and when individual products would reprice in response to changing rates.\n\nReported sensitivities are not necessarily predictive of future performance as they do not capture additional management actions that would likely be taken in response to an immediate, large, movement in interest rates. These actions could reduce the net interest income sensitivity, help mitigate any adverse impacts or they may result in changes to total income that are not captured in the net interest income.",

A number of metrics are in place to monitor the risks within the portfolio.\n\nThe Group has an integrated Asset and Liability Management (ALM) system which supports non-traded asset and liability management of the Group. This provides a single consolidated tool to measure and manage interest rate repricing profiles (including behavioural assumptions), perform stress testing and produce forecast outputs. The Group is aware that any assumptions-based model is open to challenge. A full behavioural review is performed annually, or in response to changing market conditions, to ensure the assumptions remain appropriate and the model itself is subject to annual re-validation, as required under the Group model governance policy. The key behavioural assumptions are:\n\n- \u00b7 The duration of balances that are contractually repayable on demand, such as current accounts and overdrafts, together with net free reserves of the Group\n- \u00b7 Embedded optionality within products\n- \u00b7 The re-pricing behaviour of managed rate liabilities, such as variable rate savings\n\nThe table below shows, split by material currency, the Group's market value sensitivities to an instantaneous parallel up and down 25 and 100 basis points change to all interest rates.\n\n## Group Banking activities: market value sensitivity (audited)\n\n|           | 2021        | 2021          | 2021         | 2021           | 2020        | 2020          | 2020         | 2020           |\n|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|\n|           | Up 25bps \u00a3m | Down 25bps \u00a3m | Up 100bps \u00a3m | Down 100bps \u00a3m | Up 25bps \u00a3m | Down 25bps \u00a3m | Up 100bps \u00a3m | Down 100bps \u00a3m |\n| Sterling  | 42.3        | (43.9)        | 161.9        | (192.7)        | 69.7        | 7. 8          | 279.1        | 10.9           |\n| US Dollar | (2.3)       | 2.5           | (8.8)        | 9.5            | (3.6)       | 4.7           | (13.6)       | 11.1           |\n| Euro      | (4.7)       | (3.3)         | (17.8)       | (11.8)         | (6.0)       | (5.4)         | (23.0)       | (9.3)          |\n| Other     | (0.1)       | 0.1           | (0.3)        | -              | 0.2         | ( 0 .1)       | 0.9          | ( 0 .1)        |\n| Total     | 35.2        | (44.6)        | 135.0        | (195.0)        | 60.3        | 7. 0          | 243.4        | 12.6           |\n\nThis is a risk-based disclosure and the amounts shown would be amortised in the income statement over the duration of the portfolio.\n\nThe market value sensitivity to a down 100 basis points shock has increased due to rates being higher than at year end 2020 leading to a larger downshock being applied before hitting the modelled interest rate floor. The sensitivity to an up 100 basis points shock has decreased as a result of hedging activity and changes to mortgage prepayment assumptions.\n\nThe table below shows supplementary value sensitivity to a steepening and flattening (c.100 basis points around the three-year point) in the yield curve.

        "page_content": "Year 1 net interest income sensitivity, to up 25 basis points, has decreased year-on-year mostly due to the additional structural hedging that has been transacted in 2021 in addition to the use of simpler illustrative pass through assumptions. The increase in risk sensitivity year-on-year, to down 25 basis points, is driven by greater modelled margin compression risk following the rise in interest rates in December 2021. This results in the full 25 basis points downshock being applied at December 2021 whereas a 10 basis points shock was applied at December 2020 due to the Group's assumption, at the time, for modelling Sterling interest rates with a floor of zero per cent (product-specific floors apply).\n\nThe three year net interest income sensitivity to a down 25 basis points shock is driven predominantly by margin compression on Retail and Commercial Bank savings products as well as structural hedge maturities to be reinvested in years two and three. The sensitivity to an up 25 basis points and 50 basis points shock is largely due to reinvestment of structural hedge maturities.\n\nThe sensitivities are illustrative and do not reflect new business margin implications and/or pricing actions, other than as outlined.\n\nThe following assumptions have been applied:\n\n- \u00b7 Balance sheet remains constant\n- \u00b7 Instantaneous parallel shift in interest rate curve, including bank base rate\n- \u00b7 Illustrative 50 per cent deposit pass-through\n\nBasis risk, foreign exchange, equity and credit spread risks are measured primarily through scenario analysis by assessing the impact on profit before tax over a 12-month horizon arising from a change in market rates, and reported within the Board risk appetite on a monthly basis. Supplementary measures such as sensitivity and exposure limits are applied where they provide greater insight into risk positions. Frequency of reporting supplementary measures varies from daily to quarterly appropriate to each risk type.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group's policy is to optimise reward while managing its market risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by the Board. The Group market risk policy and procedures outlines the hedging process, and the centralisation of risk from divisions into Group Corporate Treasury (GCT), e.g. via the transfer pricing framework. GCT is responsible for managing the centralised risk and does this through natural offsets of matching assets and liabilities, and appropriate hedging activity of the residual exposures, subject to the authorisation and mandate of GALCO within the Board risk appetite. The hedges are externalised to the market by derivative desks within GCT and the Commercial Bank. The Group mitigates income statement volatility through hedge accounting. This reduces the accounting volatility arising from the Group's economic hedging activities and any hedge accounting ineffectiveness is continuously monitored.\n\nThe largest residual risk exposure arises from balances that are deemed to be insensitive to changes in market rates (including current accounts, a portion of variable rate deposits and investable equity), and is managed through the Group's structural hedge. Consistent with the Group's strategy to deliver stable returns, GALCO seeks to minimise large reinvestment risk, and to smooth earnings over a range of investment tenors. The structural hedge consists of longer-term fixed rate assets or interest rate swaps and the amount and duration of the hedging activity is reviewed regularly by GALCO.\n\nWhile the bank faces margin compression in low rate environments, its exposure to pipeline and prepayment risk are not considered material and are hedged in line with expected customer behaviour. These are appropriately monitored and controlled through divisional Asset and Liability Committees (ALCOs).\n\nNet investment foreign exchange exposures are managed centrally by GCT, by hedging non-Sterling asset values with currency borrowing. Economic foreign exchange exposures arising from non-functional currency flows are identified by divisions and transferred and managed centrally. The Group also has a policy of forward hedging its forecasted currency profit and loss to year end. The Group makes use of both accounting and economic foreign exchange exposures, as an offset against the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the value of non-Sterling-denominated riskweighted assets. This involves the holding of a structurally open currency position; sensitivity is minimised where, for a given currency, the ratio of the structural open position to risk-weighted assets equals the CET1 ratio. Continually evaluating this structural open currency position against evolving non-Sterling-denominated risk-weighted assets mitigates volatility in the Group's CET1 ratio.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe appropriate limits and triggers are monitored by senior executive committees within the Banking divisions. Banking assets, liabilities and associated hedging are actively monitored and if necessary rebalanced to be within agreed tolerances.\n\n## Defined benefit pension schemes Exposures\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes are exposed to significant risks from their assets and liabilities. The liability discount rate exposes the Group to interest rate risk and credit spread risk, which are partially offset by fixed interest assets (such as gilts and corporate bonds) and swaps. Equity and alternative asset risk arises from direct asset holdings. Scheme membership exposes the Group to longevity risk. Increases to pensions in deferment and in payment expose the Group to inflation risk.\n\nFor further information on defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities please refer to note 34 on page 268 .\n\n## Measurement\n\nManagement of the schemes' assets is the responsibility of the Trustees of the schemes who are responsible for setting the investment strategy and for agreeing funding requirements with the Group. The Group will be liable for meeting any funding deficit that may arise. As part of the triennial valuation process, the Group will agree with the Trustees a funding strategy to eliminate the deficit over an appropriate period.\n\nLongevity risk is measured using both 1-in-20 year stresses (risk appetite) and 1-in-200 year stresses (regulatory capital).\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes an active involvement in agreeing mitigation strategies with the schemes' Trustees. An interest rate and inflation hedging programme is in place to reduce liability risk. The schemes have also reduced equity allocation and invested the proceeds in credit assets. The Trustees have put in place longevity swaps to mitigate longevity risk. The merits of longevity risk transfer and hedging solutions are reviewed regularly.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nIn addition to the wider risk management framework, governance of the schemes includes two specialist pensions committees.\n\nThe surplus, or deficit, in the schemes is tracked monthly along with various single factor and scenario stresses which consider the assets and liabilities holistically. Key metrics are monitored monthly including the Group's capital resources of the scheme, the performance against risk appetite triggers, and the performance of the hedged asset and liability matching positions.\n\n## Insurance business\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe main elements of market risk to which the Group is exposed through the Insurance business are equity, credit default spread, interest rate and inflation.\n\n- \u00b7 Credit default spread risk mainly arises from annuities where policyholders' future cash flows are guaranteed at retirement. Exposure arises if the market value of the assets moves differently to the liabilities they back. This exposure arises from credit downgrades and defaults\n- \u00b7 Equity risk arises indirectly through the value of future management charges on policyholder funds. These management charges form part of the value of in-force business (see note 23 on page 258 . Equity risk also arises in the with-profits funds but is less material\n- \u00b7 Interest rate risk arises through credit and interest assets which are mainly held to cover the annuity and general insurance liabilities\n- \u00b7 Inflation exposure arises from inflation-linked policyholder benefits and future expenses\n\n## Measurement\n\nCurrent and potential future market risk exposures within Insurance are assessed using a range of techniques including stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, as well as stochastic modelling.\n\nRisk measures include 1-in-200 year stresses for the Insurance business' regulatory capital assessments and other supporting measures where appropriate, including those set out in note 31 on page 267 .",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Mitigation\n\nEquity and credit spread risks are closely monitored and, where appropriate, asset liability matching is undertaken to mitigate risk. Unit matching is used to reduce the sensitivity of equity movements by matching unit-linked liabilities on a best-estimate view. Hedging strategies are also in place to reduce exposure from unit-linked and with-profit funds.\n\nInterest rate risk in the annuity book is monitored and mitigated by investing in assets whose cash flows closely match those on the projected future liabilities. It is not possible to eliminate the risk completely as the timing of insured events is uncertain and bonds are not available for all required maturities.\n\nOther market risks (e.g. interest rate exposure outside the annuity book and inflation) are also closely monitored and where considered appropriate, hedges are put in place to reduce exposure.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMarket risks in the Insurance business are monitored by Insurance senior executive committees and ultimately the Insurance Board. Monitoring includes the progression of market risk capital against risk appetite limits, as well as the sensitivity of profit before tax to combined market risk stress scenarios and in-year market movements. Asset and liability matching positions and hedges in place are actively monitored and if necessary rebalanced to be within agreed tolerances. In addition, market risk is controlled via approved investment policies and mandates.\n\n## Trading portfolios\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's trading activity is small relative to its peers. The Group's trading activity is undertaken solely to meet the financial requirements of commercial and retail customers for foreign exchange, credit and interest\n\nrate products. These activities support customer flow and market making activities.\n\nAll trading activities are performed within the Commercial Banking division. While the trading positions taken are generally small, any extreme moves in the main risk factors and other related risk factors could cause significant losses in the trading book depending on the positions at the time. The average 95 per cent 1-day trading VaR (Value at Risk; diversified across risk factors) was \u00a31.0 million for 31 December 2021 compared to \u00a30.9 million for 31 December 2020.\n\nTrading market risk measures are applied to all of the Group's regulatory trading books and they include daily VaR (see trading portfolios: VaR table), sensitivity-based measures, and stress testing calculations.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group internally uses VaR as the primary risk measure for all trading book positions.\n\nThe trading portfolios: VaR table shows some relevant statistics for the Group's 1-day 95 per cent confidence level VaR that are based on 300 historical consecutive business days to year end 2021 and year end 2020.\n\nThe risk of loss measured by the VaR model is the minimum expected loss in earnings given the 95 per cent confidence. The total and average trading VaR numbers reported below have been obtained after the application of the diversification benefits across the five risk types, but does not reflect any diversification between Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets and any other entities. The maximum and minimum VaR reported for each risk category did not necessarily occur on the same day as the maximum and minimum VaR reported at Group level.\n\n## Trading portfolios: VaR (1-day 95 per cent confidence level) (audited)\n\n|                                         | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                         | Close \u00a3m              | Average \u00a3m            | Maximum \u00a3m            | Minimum \u00a3m            | Close \u00a3m              | Average \u00a3m            | Maximum \u00a3m            | Minimum \u00a3m            |\n| Interest rate risk                      | 0.8                   | 0.9                   | 1.7                   | 0.6                   | 1.2                   | 0.9                   | 1.3                   | 0.6                   |\n| Foreign exchange risk                   | -                     | 0.1                   | 0.4                   | -                     | 0.3                   | 0.1                   | 0.3                   | -                     |\n| Equity risk                             | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     | -                     |\n| Credit spread risk                      | 0.1                   | 0.1                   | 0.2                   | -                     | 0.2                   | 0.2                   | 0.3                   | 0.1                   |\n| Inflation risk                          | 0.2                   | 0.3                   | 0.8                   | 0.2                   | 0.1                   | 0.2                   | 0.4                   | 0.1                   |\n| All risk factors before diversification | 1.1                   | 1.4                   | 2.5                   | 1.0                   | 1.8                   | 1.4                   | 1.8                   | 1.0                   |\n| Portfolio diversification               | (0.2)                 | (0.4)                 |                       |                       | (0.7)                 | (0.5)                 |                       |                       |\n| Total VaR                               | 0.9                   | 1.0                   | 2.1                   | 0.6                   | 1.1                   | 0.9                   | 1.3                   | 0.6                   |\n\nThe market risk for the trading book continues to be low relative to the size of the Group and in comparison to peers. This reflects the fact that the Group's trading operations are customer-centric and focused on hedging and recycling client risks.\n\nAlthough it is an important market standard measure of risk, VaR has limitations. One of them is the use of a limited historical data sample which influences the output by the implicit assumption that future market behaviour will not differ greatly from the historically observed period. Another known limitation is the use of defined holding periods which assumes that the risk can be liquidated or hedged within that holding period. Also calculating the VaR at the chosen confidence interval does not give enough information about potential losses which may occur if this level is exceeded. The Group fully recognises these limitations and supplements the use of VaR with a variety of other measurements which reflect the nature of the business activity. These include detailed sensitivity analysis, position reporting and a stress testing programme.\n\nTrading book VaR (1-day 99 per cent) is compared daily against both hypothetical and actual profit and loss. The 1-day 99 per cent VaR charts for Lloyds Bank Group and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets can be found in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe level of exposure is controlled by establishing and communicating the approved risk limits and controls through policies and procedures that define the responsibility and authority for risk taking. Market risk limits are clearly and consistently communicated to the business. Any new or emerging risks are brought within risk reporting and defined limits.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nTrading risk appetite is monitored daily with 1-day 95 per cent VaR and stress testing limits. These limits are complemented with position level action triggers and profit and loss referrals. Risk and position limits are set and managed at both desk and overall trading book levels. They are reviewed at least annually and can be changed as required within the overall Group risk appetite framework.",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk\n\n## Definition\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk that parties with whom the Group has contracted fail to meet their financial obligations (both on and off- balance sheet).\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe principal sources of credit risk within the Group arise from loans and advances, contingent liabilities, commitments, debt securities and derivatives to customers, financial institutions and sovereigns. The credit risk exposures of the Group are set out in note 51 on page 303 .\n\nIn terms of loans and advances (for example mortgages, term loans and overdrafts) and contingent liabilities (for example credit instruments such as guarantees and documentary letters of credit), credit risk arises both from amounts advanced and commitments to extend credit to a customer or bank. With respect to commitments to extend credit, the Group is also potentially exposed to an additional loss up to an amount equal to the total unutilised commitments. However, the likely amount of loss may be less than the total unutilised commitments, as most retail and certain commercial lending commitments may be cancelled based on regular assessment of the prevailing creditworthiness of customers. Most commercial term commitments are also contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.\n\nCredit risk also arises from debt securities and derivatives. The total notional principal amount of interest rate, exchange rate, credit derivative and other contracts outstanding at 31 December 2021 is shown on page 164 . The notional principal amount does not, however, represent the Group's credit risk exposure, which is limited to the current cost of replacing contracts with a positive value to the Group. Such amounts are reflected in note 51 on page 303 .\n\nAdditionally, credit risk arises from leasing arrangements where the Group is the lessor. Note 2(J) on page 219 provides details on the Group's approach to the treatment of leases.\n\nCredit risk exposures in the Insurance and Wealth division relate mostly to bond and loan assets which, together with some related swaps, are used to fund annuity commitments within Shareholder funds; plus balances held in liquidity funds to manage Insurance division's liquidity requirements, and exposure to reinsurers.\n\nThe investments held in the Group's defined benefit pension schemes also expose the Group to credit risk. Note 34 on page 268 provides further information on the defined benefit pension schemes' assets and liabilities.\n\nLoans and advances, contingent liabilities, commitments, debt securities and derivatives also expose the Group to refinance risk. Refinance risk is the possibility that an outstanding exposure cannot be repaid at its contractual maturity date. If the Group does not wish to refinance the exposure then there is refinance risk if the obligor is unable to repay by securing alternative finance. This may occur for a number of reasons which may include: the borrower is in financial difficulty, because the terms required to refinance are outside acceptable appetite at the time or the customer is unable to refinance externally due to a lack of market liquidity. Refinance risk exposures are managed in accordance with the Group's existing credit risk policies, processes and controls, and are not considered to be material given the Group's prudent and through-the-cycle credit risk appetite. Where heightened refinance risk exists exposures are minimised through intensive account management and, where appropriate, are classed as impaired and/or forborne.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe process for credit risk identification, measurement and control is integrated into the Board-approved framework for credit risk appetite and governance.\n\nCredit risk is measured from different perspectives using a range of appropriate modelling and scoring techniques at a number of levels of granularity, including total balance sheet, individual portfolio, pertinent concentrations and individual customer - for both new business and existing exposure. Key metrics, which may include total exposure, expected credit loss (ECL), risk-weighted assets, new business quality, concentration risk and portfolio performance, are reported monthly to Risk Committees and Forums.\n\nMeasures such as ECL, risk-weighted assets, observed credit performance, predicted credit quality (usually from predictive credit scoring models), collateral cover and quality, and other credit drivers (such as cash flow,\n\naffordability, leverage and indebtedness) have been incorporated into the Group's credit risk management practices to enable effective risk measurement across the Group.\n\nThe Group has also continued to strengthen its capabilities and abilities for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities, recognising that Climate change is likely to result in changes in the risk profile and outlook for the Group's customers, the sectors the Group operates in and collateral/asset valuations. For further information, please refer to LBG's 2021 Climate Report.\n\nIn addition, stress testing and scenario analysis are used to estimate impairment losses and capital demand forecasts for both regulatory and internal purposes and to assist in the formulation of credit risk appetite.\n\nAs part of the 'three lines of defence' model, the Risk division is the second line of defence providing oversight and independent challenge to key risk decisions taken by business management. The Risk division also tests the effectiveness of credit risk management and internal credit risk controls. This includes ensuring that the control and monitoring of higher risk and vulnerable portfolios and sectors is appropriate and confirming that appropriate loss allowances for impairment are in place. Output from these reviews helps to inform credit risk appetite and credit policy.\n\nAs the third line of defence, Group Internal Audit undertakes regular riskbased reviews to assess the effectiveness of credit risk management and controls.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk.\n\n## Prudent, through-the-cycle credit principles, risk policies and appetite\n\nstatements: the independent Risk division sets out the credit principles, credit risk policies and credit risk appetite statements. These are subject to regular review and governance, with any changes subject to an approval process. Risk teams monitor credit performance trends and the outlook. Risk teams also test the adequacy of and adherence to credit risk policies and processes throughout the Group. This includes tracking portfolio performance against an agreed set of credit risk appetite tolerances.\n\nRobust models and controls: see model risk on page 191 .\n\nLimitations on concentration risk: there are portfolio controls on certain industries, sectors and products to reflect risk appetite as well as individual, customer and bank limit risk tolerances. Credit policies and appetite statements are aligned to the Group's risk appetite and restrict exposure to higher risk countries and potentially vulnerable sectors and asset classes. Note 51 on page 303 provides an analysis of loans and advances to customers by industry (for commercial customers) and product (for retail customers). Exposures are monitored to prevent both an excessive concentration of risk and single name concentrations. These concentration risk controls are not necessarily in the form of a maximum limit on exposure, but may instead require new business in concentrated sectors to fulfil additional minimum policy and/or guideline requirements. The Group's largest credit limits are regularly monitored by the Board Risk Committee and reported in accordance with regulatory requirements.\n\nDefined country risk management framework: the Group sets a broad maximum country risk appetite. Risk-based appetite for all countries is set within the independent Risk division, taking into account economic, financial, political and social factors as well as the approved business and strategic plans of the Group.\n\nSpecialist expertise: credit quality is managed and controlled by a number of specialist units within the business and Risk division, which provide for example: intensive management and control; security perfection; maintenance of customer and facility records; expertise in documentation for lending and associated products; sector-specific expertise; and legal services applicable to the particular market segments and product ranges offered by the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nStress testing: the Group's credit portfolios are subject to regular stress testing. In addition to the Group-led, PRA and other regulatory stress tests, exercises focused on individual divisions and portfolios are also performed. For further information on stress testing process, methodology and governance see page 140 .\n\nFrequent and robust credit risk assurance: assurance of credit risk is undertaken by an independent function operating within the Risk division which are part of the Group's second line of defence. Their primary objective is to provide reasonable and independent assurance and confidence that credit risk is being effectively managed and to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and being adhered to. Group Internal Audit also provides assurance to the Audit Committee on the effectiveness of credit risk management controls across the Group's activities.\n\n## Collateral\n\nThe principal types of acceptable collateral include:\n\n- \u00b7 Charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable\n- \u00b7 Residential and commercial properties\n- \u00b7 Financial instruments such as debt securities vehicles\n- \u00b7 Guarantees received from third parties\n- \u00b7 Cash\n\nThe Group maintains appetite parameters on the acceptability of specific classes of collateral.\n\nFor non-mortgage retail lending to small businesses, collateral may include second charges over residential property and the assignment of life cover.\n\nCollateral held as security for financial assets other than loans and advances is determined by the nature of the underlying exposure. Debt securities, including treasury and other bills, are generally unsecured, with the exception of asset-backed securities and similar instruments such as covered bonds, which are secured by portfolios of financial assets. Collateral is generally not held against loans and advances to financial institutions. However, securities are held as part of reverse repurchase or securities borrowing transactions or where a collateral agreement has been entered into under a master netting agreement. Derivative transactions with financial counterparties are typically collateralised under a Credit Support Annex (CSA) in conjunction with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement. Derivative transactions with non-financial customers are not usually supported by a CSA.\n\nThe requirement for collateral and the type to be taken at origination will be based upon the nature of the transaction and the credit quality, size and structure of the borrower. For non-retail exposures, if required, the Group will often seek that any collateral includes a first charge over land and buildings owned and occupied by the business, a debenture over the assets of a company or limited liability partnership, personal guarantees, limited in amount, from the directors of a company or limited liability partnership and key man insurance. The Group maintains policies setting out which types of collateral valuation are acceptable, maximum loan to value (LTV) ratios and other criteria that are to be considered when reviewing an application. The fundamental business proposition must evidence the ability of the business to generate funds from normal business sources to repay a customer or counterparty's financial commitment, rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided.\n\nAlthough lending decisions are primarily based on expected cash flows, any collateral provided may impact the pricing and other terms of a loan or facility granted. This will have a financial impact on the amount of net interest income recognised and on internal loss given default estimates that contribute to the determination of asset quality and returns.\n\nThe Group requires collateral to be realistically valued by an appropriately qualified source, independent of both the credit decision process and the customer, at the time of borrowing. In certain circumstances, for Retail residential mortgages this may include the use of automated valuation models based on market data, subject to accuracy criteria and LTV limits. Where third parties are used for collateral valuations, they are subject to regular monitoring and review. Collateral values are subject to review, which will vary according to the type of lending, collateral involved and account performance. Such reviews are undertaken to confirm that the value recorded remains appropriate and whether revaluation is required, considering, for example, account performance, market conditions and any information available that may indicate that the value of the collateral has materially declined. In such instances, the Group may seek additional collateral and/or other amendments to the terms of the facility. The Group\n\nadjusts estimated market values to take account of the costs of realisation and any discount associated with the realisation of the collateral when estimating credit losses.\n\nThe Group considers risk concentrations by collateral providers and collateral type with a view to ensuring that any potential undue concentrations of risk are identified and suitably managed by changes to strategy, policy and/or business plans.\n\nThe Group seeks to avoid correlation or wrong-way risk where possible. Under the Group's repurchase (repo) policy, the issuer of the collateral and the repo counterparty should be neither the same nor connected. The same rule applies for derivatives. The Risk division has the necessary discretion to extend this rule to other cases where there is significant correlation. Countries with a rating equivalent to AA- or better may be considered to have no adverse correlation between the counterparty domiciled in that country and the country of risk (issuer of securities).\n\nRefer to note 51 on page 303 for further information on collateral.\n\n## Additional mitigation for Retail customers\n\nThe Group uses a variety of lending criteria when assessing applications for mortgages and unsecured lending. The general approval process uses credit acceptance scorecards and involves a review of an applicant's previous credit history using internal data and information held by Credit Reference Agencies (CRA).\n\nThe Group also assesses the affordability and sustainability of lending for each borrower. For secured lending this includes use of an appropriate stressed interest rate scenario. Affordability assessments for all lending are compliant with relevant regulatory and conduct guidelines. The Group takes reasonable steps to validate information used in the assessment of a customer's income and expenditure.\n\nIn addition, the Group has in place quantitative limits such as maximum limits for individual customer products, the level of borrowing to income and the ratio of borrowing to collateral. Some of these limits relate to internal approval levels and others are policy limits above which the Group will typically reject borrowing applications. The Group also applies certain criteria that are applicable to specific products, for example applications for buy-to-let mortgages.\n\nFor UK mortgages, the Group's policy permits owner occupier applications with a maximum LTV of 95 per cent. This can increase to 100 per cent for specific products where additional security is provided by a supporter of the applicant and held on deposit by the Group. Applications with an LTV above 90 per cent are subject to enhanced underwriting criteria, including higher scorecard cut-offs and loan size restrictions.\n\nBuy-to-let mortgages within Retail are limited to a maximum loan size of \u00a31,000,000 and 75 per cent LTV. Buy-to-let applications must pass a minimum rental cover ratio of 125 per cent under stressed interest rates, after applicable tax liabilities. Portfolio landlords (customers with four or more mortgaged buy-to-let properties) are subject to additional controls including evaluation of overall portfolio resilience.\n\nThe Group's policy is to reject any application for a lending product where a customer is registered as bankrupt or insolvent, or has a recent County Court Judgment or financial default registered at a CRA used by the Group above de minimis thresholds. In addition, the Group typically rejects applicants where total unsecured debt, debt-to-income ratios, or other indicators of financial difficulty exceed policy limits.\n\nWhere credit acceptance scorecards are used, new models, model changes and monitoring of model effectiveness are independently reviewed and approved in accordance with the governance framework set by the Group Model Governance Committee.\n\n## Additional mitigation for Commercial customers\n\n## Individual credit assessment and independent sanction of customer and\n\nbank limits: with the exception of small exposures to SME customers where certain relationship managers have limited delegated sanctioning authority, credit risk in commercial customer portfolios is subject to sanction by the independent Risk division, which considers the strengths and weaknesses of individual transactions, the balance of risk and reward, and how credit risk aligns to the Group and divisional risk appetite. Exposure to individual counterparties, groups of counterparties or customer risk segments is controlled through a tiered hierarchy of credit authority delegations and risk-based credit limit guidances per client group for larger exposures. Approval requirements for each decision are based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the transaction amount, the customer's",

        "page_content": "aggregate facilities, any risk mitigation in place, credit policy, risk appetite, credit risk ratings and the nature and term of the risk. The Group's credit risk appetite criteria for counterparty and customer loan underwriting is generally the same as that for loans intended to be held to maturity. All hard loan/bond underwriting must be sanctioned by the Risk division. A preapproved credit matrix may be used for 'best efforts' underwriting.\n\nCounterparty credit limits: limits are set against all types of exposure in a counterparty name, in accordance with an agreed methodology for each exposure type. This includes credit risk exposure on individual derivatives and securities financing transactions, which incorporates potential future exposures from market movements against agreed confidence intervals. Aggregate facility levels by counterparty are set and limit breaches are subject to escalation procedures.\n\nDaily settlement limits: settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash, securities or equities is made in the expectation of a corresponding receipt in cash, securities or equities. Daily settlement limits are established for each relevant counterparty to cover the aggregate of all settlement risk arising from the Group's market transactions on any single day. Where possible, the Group uses Continuous Linked Settlement in order to reduce foreign exchange (FX) settlement risk.\n\n## Master netting agreements\n\nIt is credit policy that a Group-approved master netting agreement must be used for all derivative and traded product transactions and must be in place prior to trading, with separate documentation required for each Group entity providing facilities. This requirement extends to trades with clients and the counterparties used for the Bank's own hedging activities, which may also include clearing trades with Central Counterparties (CCPs).\n\nAny exceptions must be approved by the appropriate credit sanctioner. Master netting agreements do not generally result in an offset of balance sheet assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, as transactions are usually settled on a gross basis. However, within relevant jurisdictions and for appropriate counterparty types, master netting agreements do reduce the credit risk to the extent that, if an event of default occurs, all trades with the counterparty may be terminated and settled on a net basis. The Group's overall exposure to credit risk on derivative instruments subject to master netting agreements can change substantially within a short period, since this is the net position of all trades under the master netting agreement.\n\n## Other credit risk transfers\n\nThe Group also undertakes asset sales, credit derivative based transactions, securitisations (including significant risk transfer transactions), purchases of credit default swaps and purchase of credit insurance as a means of mitigating or reducing credit risk and/or risk concentration, taking into account the nature of assets and the prevailing market conditions.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nIn conjunction with the Risk division, businesses identify and define portfolios of credit and related risk exposures and the key behaviours and characteristics by which those portfolios are managed and monitored. This entails the production and analysis of regular portfolio monitoring reports for review by senior management. The Risk division in turn produces an aggregated view of credit risk across the Group, including reports on material credit exposures, concentrations, concerns and other management information, which is presented to the divisional risk committees and forums, Group Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Models\n\nThe performance of all models used in credit risk is monitored in line with the Group's model governance framework - see model risk on page 191 .\n\n## Intensive care of customers in financial difficulty\n\nThe Group operates a number of solutions to assist borrowers who are experiencing financial stress. The material elements of these solutions through which the Group has granted a concession, whether temporarily or permanently, are set out below.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nThe Group's aim in offering forbearance and other assistance to customers in financial distress is to benefit both the customer and the Group by supporting its customers and acting in their best interests by, where possible, bringing customer facilities back into a sustainable position.\n\nThe Group offers a range of tools and assistance to support customers who are encountering financial difficulties. Cases are managed on an individual basis, with the circumstances of each customer considered separately and\n\nthe action taken judged as being appropriate and sustainable for both the customer and the Group.\n\nForbearance measures consist of concessions towards a debtor that is experiencing or about to experience difficulties in meeting its financial commitments. This can include modification of the previous terms and conditions of a contract or a total or partial refinancing of a troubled debt contract, either of which would not have been required had the debtor not been experiencing financial difficulties.\n\nThe provision and review of such assistance is controlled through the application of an appropriate policy framework and associated controls. Regular review of the assistance offered to customers is undertaken to confirm that it remains appropriate, alongside monitoring of customers' performance and the level of payments received.\n\nThe Group classifies accounts as forborne at the time a customer in financial difficulty is granted a concession. However, where customers were temporarily impacted by COVID-19, the Group looked to follow regulator principles and guidance on the granting of concessions resulting from the impact of the pandemic.\n\nBalances in default or classified as Stage 3 are always considered to be nonperforming. Balances may be non-performing but not in default or Stage 3, where for example they are within their non-performing forbearance cure period.\n\nNon-performing exposures can be reclassified as performing forborne after a minimum 12-month cure period, providing there are no past due amounts or concerns regarding the full repayment of the exposure. A minimum of a further 24 months must pass from the date the forborne exposure was reclassified as performing forborne before the account can exit forbearance. If conditions to exit forbearance are not met at the end of this probation period, the exposure shall continue to be identified as forborne until all the conditions are met.\n\nThe Group's treatment of loan renegotiations is included in the impairment policy in note 2(H) on page 218 .\n\n## Customers receiving support from UK Government sponsored programmes\n\nTo assist customers in financial distress, the Group participates in UK Government sponsored programmes for households, including the Income Support for Mortgage Interest programme, under which the government pays the Group all or part of the interest on the mortgage on behalf of the customer. This is provided as a government loan which the customer must repay.\n\n## Support for customers during the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nWorking closely with the UK Government and regulators, the Group supported its retail, small business and commercial customers through a comprehensive and unprecedented range of flexible measures to help alleviate temporary financial pressure on customers during the crisis.\n\nFor retail customers, the Group provided payment holidays of up to three months across a range of products including mortgages, personal loans, credit cards and motor finance, extensions of up to 6 months in total were available.\n\nSimilarly, the Group provided significant support for its small business and commercial customers as well as providing loans to businesses under the different government schemes, including Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS), Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) and Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CLBILS). These schemes closed in March 2021, replaced by the Recovery Loan Scheme through which the Group is also providing support. The Group continues to provide ongoing support to BBLS customers through the Pay As You Grow (PAYG) scheme, where customers are able to access a number of options including repayment holidays and term extensions. The Group also supported its customers through repayment holidays and its own COVID-19 fund which included fee-free lending for new overdrafts or overdraft limit increases as well as new or increased invoice discounting and finance facilities. The Group also offered SME customers a mentoring service to help navigate a path beyond the pandemic.",

The full-year credit resulted from a \u00a31,699 million release of expected credit loss allowances based upon improvements to the macroeconomic outlook for the UK, combined with robust observed credit performance, with a low run rate impairment charge of \u00a3557 million\n- \u00b7 As a result, the Group's customer related ECL allowances reduced in the period from \u00a36,832 million to \u00a34,477 million. Reductions in Commercial Banking ECL allowances also reflected improved outcomes on restructuring cases, reduction in Stage 2 exposures and lower flows to default\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 loans and advances to customers reduced from \u00a360,514 million to \u00a341,710 million and as a percentage of total lending reduced by 3.7 percentage points to 8.3 per cent (31 December 2020: 12.0 per cent), predominantly reflecting the improvement in the Group's forwardlooking macroeconomic assumptions. Of these, 86.5 per cent were up to date (31 December 2020: 88.9 per cent). Stage 2 coverage reduced to 3.5 per cent (31 December 2020: 4.5 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 loans and advances to customers reduced in the period to \u00a38,694 million (31 December 2020: \u00a39,089 million) and as a percentage of total lending reduced to 1.7 per cent (31 December 2020: 1.8 per cent). Stage 3 coverage reduced by 3.9 percentage points to 24.7 per cent (31 December 2020: 28.6 per cent), largely driven by an increase in Retail BBLS assets which hold zero ECL allowances due to the UK Government guarantee in place, the improved macroeconomic outlook, and a small number of single name releases in Commercial Banking, including coronavirus impacted restructuring cases\n\n## Prudent risk appetite and risk management\n\n- \u00b7 Sector and asset class concentrations within the portfolios are closely monitored and controlled, with mitigating actions taken where appropriate. Sector and product caps and policies limit exposure to certain higher risk and vulnerable sectors and asset classes\n- \u00b7 The Group continues to take a prudent approach to credit risk and has a through-the-cycle credit risk appetite, while working closely with customers to help and support them through and recover from the crisis\n- \u00b7 The Group's effective risk management seeks to ensure early identification and management of customers and counterparties who may be showing signs of distress\n- \u00b7 The Group will continue to work closely with its customers throughout the recovery to ensure they receive the appropriate level of support, including where repayments under the UK Government scheme lending fall due\n\n## Statutory impairment (credit) charge by division\n\n|                                      | Loans and  advances to  customers \u00a3m   | Loans and  advances to  banks \u00a3m   | Financial assets at  fair value through  other  comprehensive  income \u00a3m   | Other \u00a3m   | Undrawn  balances \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| UK mortgages                         | (271)                                  | -                                  | -                                                                          | -          | (2)                    | (273)     | 478       |\n| Credit cards                         | 29                                     | -                                  | -                                                                          | -          | (78)                   | (49)      | 800       |\n| Loans and overdrafts                 | 83                                     | -                                  | -                                                                          | -          | (44)                   | 39        | 739       |\n| UK Motor Finance                     | (149)                                  | -                                  | -                                                                          | -          | (2)                    | (151)     | 226       |\n| Other                                | (7)                                    | -                                  | -                                                                          | -          | (14)                   | (21)      | 141       |\n| Retail                               | (315)                                  | -                                  | -                                                                          | -          | (140)                  | (455)     | 2,384     |\n| SME                                  | (218)                                  | -                                  | -                                                                          | -          | (19)                   | (237)     | 264       |\n| Corporate and other                  | (576)                                  | (5)                                | (3)                                                                        | -          | (98)                   | (682)     | 1,105     |\n| Commercial Banking                   | (794)                                  | (5)                                | (3)                                                                        | -          | (117)                  | (919)     | 1,369     |\n| Insurance and Wealth                 | (4)                                    | -                                  | -                                                                          | 2          | -                      | (2)       | 12        |\n| Equity Investments and Central Items | (3)                                    | -                                  | 1                                                                          | -          | -                      | (2)       | 390       |\n| Total impairment (credit) charge     | (1,116)                                | (5)                                | (2)                                                                        | 2          | (257)                  | (1,378)   | 4,155     |",

Loans and advances to customers are categorised into the following stages:\n\nStage 1 assets comprise of newly originated assets (unless purchased or originated credit impaired), as well as those which have not experienced a significant increase in credit risk. These assets carry an expected credit loss allowance equivalent to the expected credit losses that result from those default events that are possible within 12 months of the reporting date (12 month expected credit losses).\n\nStage 2 assets are those which have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since origination. These assets carry an expected credit loss allowance equivalent to the expected credit losses arising over the lifetime of the asset (lifetime expected credit losses).\n\nStage 3 assets have either defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit impaired. These assets carry a lifetime expected credit loss.\n\nPurchased or originated credit-impaired assets (POCI) are those that have been originated or acquired in a credit impaired state. This includes within the definition of credit impaired the purchase of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects impaired credit losses.\n\n## Credit risk basis of presentation\n\nThe analyses which follow have been presented on two bases; the statutory basis which is consistent with the presentation in the Group's accounts and the underlying basis which is used for internal management purposes. Reconciliations between the two bases have been provided.\n\nIn the following statutory basis tables, purchased or originated creditimpaired (POCI) assets include a fixed pool of mortgages that were purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition at a deep discount to face value reflecting credit losses incurred from the point of origination to the date of acquisition. The residual ECL allowance and resulting low coverage ratio on POCI assets reflects further deterioration in the creditworthiness from the date of acquisition. Over time, these POCI assets will run off as the loans redeem, pay down or losses crystallise.\n\nThe Group uses the underlying basis to monitor the creditworthiness of the lending portfolio and related ECL allowances because it provides a better indication of the credit performance of the POCI assets purchased as part of the HBOS acquisition. The underlying basis assumes that the lending assets acquired as part of a business combination were originated by the Group and are classified as either Stage 1, 2 or 3 according to the change in credit risk over the period since origination. Underlying ECL allowances have been calculated accordingly.\n\n## Total expected credit loss allowance\n\n|                                      | Statutory basis   | Statutory basis   | Underlying basis A   | Underlying basis A   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                      | At 31 Dec 2021 \u00a3m | At 31 Dec 2020 \u00a3m | At 31 Dec 2021 \u00a3m    | At 31 Dec 2020 \u00a3m    |\n| Customer related balances            |                   |                   |                      |                      |\n| Drawn                                | 3,820             | 5,760             | 4,277                | 6,373                |\n| Undrawn                              | 200               | 459               | 200                  | 459                  |\n|                                      | 4,020             | 6,219             | 4,477                | 6,832                |\n| Other assets                         | 22                | 28                | 22                   | 28                   |\n| Total expected credit loss allowance | 4,042             | 6,247             | 4,499                | 6,860                |",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\nThe Group's assessment of a significant increase in credit risk, and resulting categorisation of Stage 2, includes customers moving into early arrears as well as a broader assessment that an up to date customer has experienced a level of deterioration in credit risk since origination. A more sophisticated assessment is required for up to date customers, which varies across divisions and product type. This assessment incorporates specific triggers such as a significant proportionate increase in probability of default relative to that at origination, recent arrears, forbearance activity, internal watch lists and external bureau flags. Up to date exposures in Stage 2 are likely to show lower levels of expected credit loss (ECL) allowance relative to those that have already moved into arrears given that an arrears status typically reflects a stronger indication of future default and greater likelihood of credit losses.\n\n## Additional information\n\n## ECL sensitivity to economic assumptions\n\nThe measurement of ECL reflects an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future economic outcomes. The Group achieves this by generating four economic scenarios to reflect the range of outcomes; the central scenario reflects the Group's base case assumptions used for medium-term planning purposes, an upside and a downside scenario are also selected together with a severe downside scenario. The base case, upside and downside scenarios carry a 30 per cent weighting; the severe downside is weighted at 10 per cent.\n\nThe table below shows the Group's ECL for the upside, base case, downside and severe downside scenarios. The stage allocation for an asset is based on the overall scenario probability-weighted PD and hence the staging of assets is constant across all the scenarios. In each economic scenario the ECL for individual assessments and post-model adjustments is constant reflecting the basis on which they are evaluated. The probability-weighted view shows the extent to which a higher ECL allowance has been recognised to take account of multiple economic scenarios relative to the base case; the uplift being \u00a3223 million compared to \u00a3506 million at 31 December 2020 on a statutory basis. The scale of the impact has returned to 2019 levels as the base case outlook has recovered and corresponding downside scenarios no longer reach increased levels of stress.\n\n|                     | Probability  weighted \u00a3m   | Upside \u00a3m   | Base case \u00a3m   | Downside \u00a3m   | Severe  downside \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Statutory basis     |                            |             |                |               |                       |\n| UK mortgages        | 837                        | 637         | 723            | 967           | 1,386                 |\n| Credit cards        | 521                        | 442         | 500            | 569           | 672                   |\n| Other Retail        | 908                        | 844         | 892            | 947           | 1,034                 |\n| Commercial Banking  | 1,333                      | 1,196       | 1,261          | 1,403         | 1,753                 |\n| Other               | 443                        | 441         | 443            | 444           | 446                   |\n| At 31 December 2021 | 4,042                      | 3,560       | 3,819          | 4,330         | 5,291                 |\n| UK mortgages        | 1,027                      | 614         | 804            | 1,237         | 2,306                 |\n| Credit cards        | 923                        | 809         | 889            | 997           | 1,147                 |\n| Other Retail        | 1,445                      | 1,372       | 1,421          | 1,490         | 1,598                 |\n| Commercial Banking  | 2,402                      | 1,910       | 2,177          | 2,681         | 3,718                 |\n| Other               | 450                        | 448         | 450            | 450           | 456                   |\n| At 31 December 2020 | 6,247                      | 5,153       | 5,741          | 6,855         | 9,225                 |\n\n|                     | Probability  weighted \u00a3m   | Upside \u00a3m   | Base case \u00a3m   | Downside \u00a3m   | Severe  downside \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------------|\n| Underlying basis A  |                            |             |                |               |                       |\n| UK mortgages        | 1,284                      | 1,084       | 1,170          | 1,414         | 1,833                 |\n| Credit cards        | 531                        | 453         | 511            | 579           | 682                   |\n| Other Retail        | 908                        | 844         | 892            | 947           | 1,034                 |\n| Commercial Banking  | 1,333                      | 1,196       | 1,261          | 1,403         | 1,753                 |\n| Other               | 443                        | 441         | 443            | 444           | 446                   |\n| At 31 December 2021 | 4,499                      | 4,018       | 4,277          | 4,787         | 5,748                 |\n| UK mortgages        | 1,605                      | 1,192       | 1,382          | 1,815         | 2,884                 |\n| Credit cards        | 958                        | 844         | 924            | 1,032         | 1,182                 |\n| Other Retail        | 1,445                      | 1,372       | 1,421          | 1,490         | 1,598                 |\n| Commercial Banking  | 2,402                      | 1,910       | 2,177          | 2,681         | 3,718                 |\n| Other               | 450                        | 448         | 450            | 450           | 456                   |\n| At 31 December 2020 | 6,860                      | 5,766       | 6,354          | 7,468         | 9,838                 |",

Although such changes would not be observed in isolation, as economic indicators tend to be correlated in a coherent scenario, this gives insight into the sensitivity of the Group's ECL to gradual changes in these two critical economic factors. The assessment has been made against the base case with the reported staging unchanged. Consistent with the reduced ECL impact from the use of MES, the univariate sensitivity of ECL has also reduced from the elevated 2020 levels as the base case now assumes a benign outlook, against which, incremental changes in unemployment or HPI register a smaller impact on ECL.\n\nThe table below shows the impact on the Group's ECL in respect of UK mortgages of an increase or decrease in loss given default for a 10 percentage point (pp) increase or decrease in the UK House Price Index (HPI). The increase or decrease is presented based on the adjustment phased evenly over the first 10 quarters of the base case scenario.\n\n|                | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   |\n|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                | 10pp increase  in HPI | 10pp decrease  in HPI | 10pp increase  in HPI | 10pp decrease  in HPI |\n| ECL impact, \u00a3m | (112)                 | 162                   | (206)                 | 284                   |\n\nThe table below shows the impact on the Group's ECL resulting from a 1 percentage point (pp) increase or decrease in the UK unemployment rate. The increase or decrease is presented based on the adjustment phased evenly over the first 10 quarters of the base case scenario. An immediate increase or decrease would drive a more material ECL impact as it would be fully reflected in both 12-month and lifetime PDs.\n\n|                    | At 31 December 2021           | At 31 December 2021           | At 31 December 2020           | At 31 December 2020           |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                    | 1pp increase in  unemployment | 1pp decrease in  unemployment | 1pp increase in  unemployment | 1pp decrease in  unemployment |\n|                    | \u00a3m                            | \u00a3m                            | \u00a3m                            | \u00a3m                            |\n| UK mortgages       | 23                            | (18)                          | 25                            | (23)                          |\n| Credit cards       | 20                            | (20)                          | 31                            | (31)                          |\n| Other Retail       | 14                            | (14)                          | 23                            | (23)                          |\n| Commercial Banking | 49                            | (42)                          | 125                           | (112)                         |\n| Other              | 1                             | (1)                           | 1                             | (1)                           |\n| ECL impact         | 107                           | (95)                          | 205                           | (190)                         |",

The notional principal amount does not, however, represent the Group's credit risk exposure, which is limited to the current cost of replacing contracts with a positive value to the Group. Such amounts are reflected in note 51 on page 303 .\n\n## Retail\n\n- \u00b7 Performance in the Retail portfolio has remained robust, driven in part by the successful public policy interventions, government-backed lending schemes and payment holidays, which have limited unemployment and helped keep credit defaults and business failures low. The portfolio has also benefitted from proactive risk management and the continued low interest rate environment\n- -  New business quality remains strong\n- -  Early arrears rates remain below pre-pandemic levels on personal lending products\n- -  Coverage across all IFRS 9 stages has decreased largely due to the improved macroeconomic outlook\n- \u00b7 Strong credit performance and an improved economic outlook have allowed the Group to progressively unwind many of the additional precautionary credit quality controls introduced during the pandemic, whilst continuing to ensure that customers and the Group remain protected against any remaining uncertainty in the economy and cost of living increases\n- \u00b7 Existing IFRS 9 staging rules and triggers have been maintained across Retail, with the exception of minor changes to the Loans & Overdraft portfolios to tighten criteria and align to the credit cards portfolio. Transfers between stages have been primarily driven by credit risk rating movements and the estimated impact of the economic factors on a customer's forward-looking default risk\n- \u00b7 A Retail impairment credit of \u00a3285 million for 2021 compares to a charge of \u00a32,384 million for 2020. This significant decrease resulted from a \u00a31,172 million release of customer related expected credit loss (ECL) allowances driven by the Groups improved macroeconomic outlook, combined with robust observed credit performance, with charges relating to flows to arrears and defaults remaining low despite expiry of all payment holidays. This impact compares favourably to the \u00a31,025 million impairment charge to account for deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook over 2020\n- \u00b7 Retail customer related ECL allowance as a percentage of drawn loans and advances (coverage) decreased to 0.7 per cent (31 December 2020: 1.1 per cent) due to the favourable updates in the Group's economic forecast. As at 31 December 2021 the majority of ECL decreases are reflected within Stage 2 under IFRS 9, representing cases which have observed a significant increase in credit risk since origination (SICR)\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 ECL coverage has decreased to 3.4 per cent (31 December 2020: 4.3 per cent), reflecting the improved macroeconomic outlook\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 loans and advances now comprises 9.7 per cent of the Retail portfolio (31 December 2020: 13.0 per cent), of which 84.6 per cent are up to date, performing loans\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 loans and advances have remained broadly flat at 1.6 per cent of total loans and advances (31 December 2020: 1.5 per cent and Stage 3 ECL coverage decreased to 19.6 per cent (31 December 2020: 22.5 per cent) due to an increase in BBLS assets which hold zero ECL due to the government guarantee in place, and the improved macroeconomic outlook\n\n## UK mortgages\n\n- \u00b7 While the housing market has remained resilient throughout 2021 with strong customer demand, the Group has taken action to protect credit quality and participates in the government guarantee scheme for greater than 90 per cent LTVs, which provides risk mitigation at the highest exposures\n- \u00b7 The UK mortgages portfolio is well positioned with low arrears and a strong loan to value (LTV) profile. The Group has actively improved the quality of the portfolio over the years using robust affordability and credit controls, while the balances of higher risk portfolios originated prior to 2008 have continued to reduce\n- \u00b7 Total loans and advances increased to \u00a3308.8 billion (31 December 2020: \u00a3295.4 billion), with a small reduction in average LTV to 42.1 per cent (31 December 2020: 43.5 per cent). The proportion of balances with an LTV greater than 90 per cent decreased to 0.5 per cent (31 December 2020: 0.6 per cent). The average LTV of new business decreased to 63.3 per cent (31 December 2020: 63.9 per cent)\n- \u00b7 There was a net impairment credit of \u00a3273 million for 2021 compared to a charge of \u00a3478 million for 2020, reflecting improvements to the UK's macroeconomic outlook and improved house prices. Total ECL coverage decreased to 0.4 per cent (31 December 2020: 0.5 per cent)",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Stage 2 loans and advances decreased to 9.3 per cent of the portfolio (31 December 2020: 12.8 per cent) and Stage 2 ECL coverage has remained stable at 2.3 per cent (31 December 2020: 2.1 per cent). These impacts also reflect improvements in the UK's macroeconomic outlook, with a reduction in balances transferred into Stage 2 based on the forwardlooking view of their credit performance, in addition to favourable experience and house price assumptions\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 loans and advances remained stable at 1.4 per cent of the portfolio (31 December 2020: 1.5 per cent) and Stage 3 ECL coverage decreased to 13.9 per cent (31 December 2020: 15.6 per cent). This reflects favourable credit performance, in addition to favourable house price assumptions (both observed and forecast)\n\n## Credit cards\n\n- \u00b7 There was a net impairment credit of \u00a349 million for 2021 (2020: \u00a3800 million), reflecting lower than anticipated arrears emergence and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. Total ECL coverage decreased to 3.7 per cent (31 December 2020: 6.4 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Credit cards balances decreased to \u00a314.5 billion (31 December 2020 \u00a315.1 billion) due to reduced levels of customer spend\n- \u00b7 This favourability is reflected in Stage 2 loans and advances which decreased to 14.3 per cent of the portfolio (31 December 2020: 21.7 per cent) and Stage 2 ECL coverage which has reduced to 12.2 per cent (31 December 2020: 16.8 per cent)\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 loans and advances decreased to 2.0 per cent of the portfolio (31 December 2020: 2.3 per cent) and Stage 3 ECL coverage decreased to 58.2 per cent (31 December 2020: 58.8 per cent), both of which reflect favourable credit performance throughout the year\n\n## Loans and overdrafts\n\n- \u00b7 Loans and advances for personal current account and the personal loans portfolios remained broadly flat at \u00a39.6 billion (31 December 2020: \u00a39.5 billion), reflecting recovering customer demand with rising economic activity\n\n- \u00b7 The impairment charge was \u00a3209 million for the full year 2021 compared to \u00a3739 million for the full year 2020. This decrease is due to the improved outlook within the Group's macroeconomic forecasts, in addition to favourable credit performance, reducing both Stage 2 ECL coverage to 15.4 per cent (31 December 2020: 22.6 per cent) and overall ECL coverage to 4.7 per cent (31 December 2020: 7.6 per cent)\n\n## UK Motor Finance\n\n- \u00b7 There was a net impairment credit of \u00a3151 million for 2021 compared to a charge of \u00a3226 million for 2020, reflecting improvements to the Group's macroeconomic outlook and higher than expected used car prices. ECL coverage decreased to 2.1 per cent (31 December 2020: 3.3 per cent)\n- \u00b7 The UK Motor Finance portfolio decreased from \u00a315.2 billion for 2020 to \u00a314.3 billion for 2021 due to reduced market activity and new car supply issues as a result of the pandemic\n- \u00b7 Updates to Residual Value (RV) and Voluntary Termination (VT) risk held against Personal Contract Purchase (PCP) and Hire Purchase (HP) lending are included within the impairment charge. Observed car price gains partially driven by global supply issues, supported by better than expected disposal experience, result in combined RV and VT provisions of \u00a395 million as at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: \u00a3192 million)\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 ECL coverage decreased to 4.0 per cent (31 December 2020: 7.7 per cent) and Stage 3 ECL coverage decreased to 57.7 per cent (31 December 2020: 66.8 per cent) this reflects favourable credit performance, in addition to updates to the Group's outlook on used car prices\n\n## Other\n\n- \u00b7 Bounce Back Loans benefit from Pay as You Grow (PAYG) options including repayment holidays and term extensions which have the potential to delay recognition of customer financial difficulties\n- \u00b7 Other loans and advances decreased slightly to \u00a319.2 billion (31 December 2020: \u00a319.4 billion). The decrease was largely driven by a reduction in balances on the Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) and the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS) as the schemes closed in March 2021 and repayments commenced from the second quarter of 2021\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 loans and advances increased to 4.1 per cent (31 December 2020: 1.0 per cent) driven largely by BBLS assets. However, Stage 3 coverage reduced to 13.8 per cent (31 December 2020: 39.3 per cent) as these assets hold zero ECL due to government guarantees in place\n- \u00b7 There was a net impairment credit of \u00a321 million for 2021 compared to a charge of \u00a3141 million for 2020, primarily due to the improved outlook within the Group's economic forecasts\n\n## Retail UK mortgages loans and advances to customers (statutory basis)\n\n|            | At 31 Dec  2021 1 \u00a3m   | At 31 Dec  2020 1 \u00a3m   |\n|------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Mainstream | 248,013                | 234,273                |\n| Buy-to-let | 51,111                 | 49,634                 |\n| Specialist | 9,220                  | 10,899                 |\n| Total      | 308,344                | 294,806                |\n\n- 1 Balances include the impact of HBOS-related acquisition adjustments.",

At 31 December 2021, owner occupier interest only balances as a proportion of total owner occupier balances had reduced to 18.7 per cent (31 December 2020: 21.6 per cent). The average indexed loan to value remained low at 36.8 per cent (31 December 2020: 39.0 per cent).\n\nFor existing interest only mortgages, a contact strategy is in place during the term of the mortgage to ensure that customers are aware of their obligations to repay the principal upon maturity of the loan.\n\nTreatment strategies are in place to help customers anticipate and plan for repayment of capital at maturity and support those who may have difficulty in repaying the principal amount. A dedicated specialist team supports customers who have passed their contractual maturity date and are unable to fully repay the principal. A range of treatments are offered to customers based on their individual circumstances to create fair and sustainable outcomes.\n\n## Analysis of owner occupier interest only mortgages (statutory basis)\n\n|                                             | At 31 Dec 2021 Total   | At 31 Dec 2020 Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Interest only balances (\u00a3m)                 | 48,128                 | 53,077                 |\n| Stage 1 (%)                                 | 70.7                   | 69.0                   |\n| Stage 2 (%)                                 | 17.1                   | 16.3                   |\n| Stage 3 (%)                                 | 2.8                    | 1.7                    |\n| Purchased or originated credit-impaired (%) | 9.4                    | 13.0                   |\n| Average loan to value (%)                   | 36.8                   | 39.0                   |\n| Maturity profile (\u00a3m)                       |                        |                        |\n| Due                                         | 1,803                  | 1,626                  |\n| 1 year                                      | 1,834                  | 2,045                  |\n| 2-5 years                                   | 8,889                  | 9,450                  |\n| 6-10 years                                  | 17,882                 | 18,351                 |\n| >11 years                                   | 17,720                 | 21,605                 |\n| Past term interest only balances (\u00a3m) 1     | 1,790                  | 1,715                  |\n| Stage 1 (%)                                 | 0.7                    | 0.7                    |\n| Stage 2 (%)                                 | 33.0                   | 28.9                   |\n| Stage 3 (%)                                 | 29.6                   | 24.2                   |\n| Purchased or originated credit-impaired (%) | 36.7                   | 46.2                   |\n| Average loan to value (%)                   | 33.0                   | 34.4                   |\n| Negative equity (%)                         | 1.8                    | 2.5                    |\n\n- 1 Balances where all interest only elements have moved past term.

instances where there are suspensions of interest and/or capital repayments; past term interest only mortgages; and refinance personal loans.\n\nAs a percentage of loans and advances, forbearance loans improved to 1.5 per cent at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 1.7 per cent).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, 97.3 per cent of forbearance loans are captured in Stage 2 or Stage 3 for IFRS 9 and hold provision on a lifetime basis (31 December 2020: 98.3 per cent).\n\nTotal expected credit losses (ECL) as a proportion of loans and advances which are forborne has decreased to 10.8 per cent (31 December 2020: 12.2 per cent).\n\n## Retail forborne loans and advances (statutory basis) (audited)\n\n|                       | Total \u00a3m   | Of which  Stage 2 \u00a3m   | Of which Stage 3 \u00a3m   | Of which  POCI \u00a3m   | Expected  credit losses as  a % of total  loans and  advances  which are  forborne 1 %   |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2021 2 |            |                        |                       |                     |                                                                                          |\n| UK mortgages          | 4,725      | 1,216                  | 901                   | 2,600               | 3.2                                                                                      |\n| Credit cards          | 288        | 90                     | 141                   | -                   | 32.9                                                                                     |\n| Loans and overdrafts  | 312        | 99                     | 131                   | -                   | 33.8                                                                                     |\n| UK Motor Finance      | 102        | 38                     | 62                    | -                   | 37.0                                                                                     |\n| Total                 | 5,427      | 1,443                  | 1,235                 | 2,600               | 7. 2                                                                                     |\n| At 31 December 2020   |            |                        |                       |                     |                                                                                          |\n| UK mortgages          | 5,106      | 1,192                  | 823                   | 3,081               | 3.6                                                                                      |\n| Credit cards          | 356        | 130                    | 191                   | -                   | 40.0                                                                                     |\n| Loans and overdrafts  | 353        | 154                    | 146                   | -                   | 36.5                                                                                     |\n| UK Motor Finance      | 88         | 50                     | 34                    | -                   | 36.3                                                                                     |\n| Total                 | 5,903      | 1,526                  | 1,194                 | 3,081               | 7. 0                                                                                     |\n\n- 1 Expected credit loss allowance as a percentage of total loans and advances which are forborne is calculated excluding loans in recoveries for Credit cards, Loans and overdrafts (31 December 2021: \u00a387 million;

        "page_content": "## Commercial Banking\n\n## Portfolio overview\n\n- \u00b7 Credit performance across the portfolios has been robust, driven in part by the strong market liquidity and government intervention measures, which have helped to support clients and kept credit defaults and business failures at low levels. Portfolios have also benefitted from the Group's prudent risk management and the continued low interest rate environment\n- \u00b7 Commercial Banking has actively supported its customers throughout the pandemic, through a range of propositions including capital repayment holidays, working capital line increases and financial covenant waivers, as well as supporting small businesses and corporates through full use of the UK Government lending schemes\n- \u00b7 As the economy continued its recovery and business' cashflows started to normalise, there has been an improvement in customer credit risk ratings, particularly in the larger corporates segment of Commercial, partially reversing some of the downgrades seen earlier during the pandemic. The Corporate and Institutional business continues to have a predominance of investment grade clients and is well positioned against the uncertain economic outlook\n- \u00b7 The SME portfolio remains largely secured and credit impacts have been relatively muted throughout the pandemic, recognising that Government support measures have prevented more widespread defaults and business failures. Repayments under the UK Government lending schemes began in the second half of 2021, with low arrears to date. The level of arrears continues to be carefully monitored, with early risk mitigation activities taken as appropriate\n- \u00b7 While some sectors such as travel, transportation, non-essential retail, leisure and hospitality were particularly impacted by the crisis, exposure to these sectors remains relatively limited and, in general, sectors have been more resilient than anticipated to date. The Group still expects recovery to be slower in a few of the impacted sectors and anticipates longer term structural changes in these, and a number of other sectors. Sector and credit risk appetite continue to be proactively managed to ensure the Group is protected, and customers are supported in the right way\n- \u00b7 Even though economic conditions have improved, significant uncertainties remain, with a number of prevailing headwinds and the withdrawal of the Government COVID-19 support measures yet to impact portfolio performance. Some credit deterioration is therefore expected in 2022\n- \u00b7 However, the Group continues to support its more vulnerable customers early through focused risk management via its Watchlist and Business Support framework, and will continue to balance prudent risk appetite with ensuring support for financially viable customers on their road to recovery\n\n## Impairments\n\n- \u00b7 The Group recognises that credit quality has been partly supported by the UK Government schemes and the ECL provision at 31 December 2021 assumes some additional losses will emerge now that the support has ended and structural change starts to emerge in some sectors\n- \u00b7 There was a net impairment credit of \u00a3916 million in 2021, compared to a net impairment charge of \u00a31,464 million in 2020. The credit for 2021 includes a \u00a3527 million release of expected credit loss (ECL) allowances resulting from improvements to the Group's view of the UK macroeconomic outlook, and a \u00a365 million net release on coronavirus impacted restructuring cases within the Business Support Unit (BSU). The remaining \u00a3324 million net release reflects other Stage 3 releases, credit quality improvements, reduced balance sheet lending, and low levels of gross charges from cases flowing into default. As a result, total ECL allowances reduced by \u00a31,064 million to \u00a31,331 million at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: \u00a32,395 million)\n- \u00b7 Stage 2 loans and advances reduced by \u00a38,186 million to \u00a36,130 million (31 December 2020: \u00a314,316 million), largely driven by the improvement in the Group's forward-looking economic assumptions, with 97.2 per cent of Stage 2 balances up to date. As a result, Stage 2 as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers reduced to 7.2 per cent (31 December 2020: 16.2 per cent). Stage 2 ECL coverage was lower at 4.0 per cent (31 December 2020: 5.2 per cent) with the reduction in coverage a direct result of the change in the forward-look multiple economic scenarios\n\n- \u00b7 Stage 3 loans and advances reduced to \u00a32,892 million (31 December 2020: \u00a33,524 million) and as a proportion of total loans and advances to customers, reduced to 3.4 per cent (31 December 2020: 4.0 per cent). SME customer flows to Stage 3 have been lower and non-SME flows were offset by repayments and write-offs. Stage 3 ECL coverage reduced to 34.4 per cent (31 December 2020: 38.2 per cent) predominantly driven by the release of provisions on a small number of cases in Business Support, including coronavirus impacted restructuring cases, where coverage levels were relatively higher\n\n## Commercial Banking UK Direct Real Estate\n\n- \u00b7 The Group classifies Direct Real Estate as exposure which is directly supported by cash flows from property activities (as opposed to trading activities, such as hotels, care homes and housebuilders). Exposures of \u00a35.5 billion to social housing providers are also excluded\n- \u00b7 Commercial Banking UK Direct Real Estate gross lending stood at \u00a311.4 billion at 31 December 2021 (net of exposures subject to protection through Significant Risk Transfer (SRT) securitisations). The Group has a further \u00a30.7 billion of real estate lending in Business Banking within the Retail division\n- \u00b7 Recognising this is a cyclical sector, policies and caps are in place to control origination quality and exposure levels, including in a number of asset type categories. The Group's focus remains on the UK market and business propositions have been written in line with a prudent, throughthe-cycle risk appetite with conservative LTVs, strong quality of income, proven management teams and predominately in stronger sub sectors\n- \u00b7 Overall performance has proved resilient despite the rent collection challenge during COVID-19. Retail and Leisure have remained the most challenged sub sectors, but despite this, the portfolio remains well positioned and proactively managed, with appropriate risk mitigants in place:\n- -  Exposures continue to be heavily weighted towards investment real estate (c.90 per cent) rather than development. Of these investment exposures, over 82 per cent have an LTV of less than 60 per cent, with an average LTV of 42 per cent\n- -  Approximately 90 per cent of exposures greater than \u00a35 million have an interest cover ratio of greater than 2.0 times and in SME, LTV at origination has been typically limited to c.55 per cent, given prudent repayment cover criteria (which includes a notional base rate serviceability stress)\n- -  Approximately 55 per cent of exposures relate to commercial real estate (with no speculative development lending) with the remainder predominantly related to residential real estate. The underlying sub sector split is diversified with more limited exposure to higher risk sub sectors (c.14 per cent of exposures secured by Retail assets, with appetite tightened since 2018)\n- -  In the office sub sector, risk appetite continues to be proactively managed with appropriate risk mitigation tightening seen in 2021. The Group remains focused on high quality origination in this sector\n- -  Use of Significant Risk Transfer (SRT) securitisations also acts as a risk mitigant, with run-off of these carefully managed and tracked\n- -  Both investment and development lending is subject to specific credit risk appetite criteria. Development lending criteria includes maximum loan to gross development value and maximum loan to cost, with funding typically only released against completed work, as confirmed by the Group's monitoring quantity surveyor",

        "page_content": "## Funding and liquidity risk\n\n## Definition\n\nFunding risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficiently stable and diverse sources of funding or the funding structure is inefficient. Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its commitments as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.\n\n## Exposure\n\nLiquidity exposure represents the potential stressed outflows in any future period less expected inflows. The Group considers liquidity exposure from both an internal and a regulatory perspective.\n\n## Measurement\n\nLiquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturities with behavioural overlays as appropriate. Note 51 on page 303 sets out an analysis of assets and liabilities by relevant maturity grouping. The Group undertakes quantitative and qualitative analysis of the behavioural aspects of its assets and liabilities in order to reflect their expected behaviour.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group manages and monitors liquidity risks and ensures that liquidity risk management systems and arrangements are adequate with regard to the internal risk appetite, Group strategy and regulatory requirements. Liquidity policies and procedures are subject to independent internal oversight by Risk. Overseas branches and subsidiaries of the Group may also be required to meet the liquidity requirements of the entity's domestic country. Management of liquidity requirements is performed by the overseas branch or subsidiary in line with Group policy. Liquidity risk of the Insurance business is actively managed and monitored within the Insurance business. The Group plans funding requirements over its planning period, combining business as usual and stressed conditions. The Group manages its liquidity position both with regard to its internal risk appetite and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) as required by the PRA, the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) liquidity requirements.\n\nThe Group's funding and liquidity position is underpinned by its significant customer deposit base, and is supported by strong relationships across customer segments. The Group has consistently observed that in aggregate the retail deposit base provides a stable source of funding. Funding concentration by counterparty, currency and tenor is monitored on an ongoing basis and where concentrations do exist, these are managed as part of the planning process and limited by the internal funding and liquidity risk monitoring framework, with analysis regularly provided to senior management.\n\nTo assist in managing the balance sheet, the Group operates a Liquidity Transfer Pricing (LTP) process which: allocates relevant interest expenses from the centre to the Group's banking businesses within the internal management accounts; helps drive the correct inputs to customer pricing; and is consistent with regulatory requirements. LTP makes extensive use of behavioural maturity profiles, taking account of expected customer loan prepayments and stability of customer deposits, modelled on historic data.\n\nThe Group can monetise liquid assets quickly, either through the repurchase agreements (repo) market or through outright sale. In addition, the Group has pre-positioned a substantial amount of assets at the Bank of England's Discount Window Facility which can be used to access additional liquidity in a time of stress. The Group considers diversification across geography, currency, markets and tenor when assessing appropriate holdings of liquid assets. The Group's liquid asset buffer is available for deployment at immediate notice, subject to complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nLiquidity risk within the Insurance business may result from: the inability to sell financial assets quickly at their fair values; an insurance liability falling due for payment earlier than expected; the inability to generate cash inflows as anticipated; an unexpected large operational event; or from a general insurance catastrophe, for example, a significant weather event. Liquidity risk is actively managed and monitored within the Insurance business to ensure that it remains within approved risk appetite, so that even under stress conditions, there is sufficient liquidity to meet obligations.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nDaily monitoring and control processes are in place to address internal and regulatory liquidity requirements. The Group monitors a range of market and internal early warning indicators on a daily basis for early signs of liquidity risk in the market or specific to the Group. This captures regulatory metrics as well as metrics the Group considers relevant for its liquidity profile. These are a mixture of quantitative and qualitative measures, including: daily variation of customer balances; changes in maturity profiles; funding concentrations; changes in LCR outflows; credit default swap (CDS) spreads; and basis risks.\n\nThe Group carries out internal stress testing of its liquidity and potential cash flow mismatch position over both short (up to one month) and longerterm horizons against a range of scenarios forming an important part of the internal risk appetite. The scenarios and assumptions are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they continue to be relevant to the nature of the business, including reflecting emerging horizon risks to the Group. For further information on the Group's 2021 liquidity stress testing results refer to page 185 .\n\nThe Group maintains a Contingency Funding Framework as part of the wider Recovery Plan which is designed to identify emerging liquidity concerns at an early stage, so that mitigating actions can be taken to avoid a more serious crisis developing. Contingency Funding Plan invocation and escalation processes are based on analysis of five major quantitative and qualitative components, comprising assessment of: early warning indicators; prudential and regulatory liquidity risk limits and triggers; stress testing results; event and systemic indicators; and market intelligence.\n\n## Funding and liquidity management in 2021\n\nThe Group has maintained its robust funding and liquidity position with the loan to deposit ratio falling to 94 per cent (98 per cent as at 31 December 2020), largely driven by increased customer deposits.\n\nAhead of the closure of the Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME) in October 2021, the Group drew additional funds taking the total amount outstanding to \u00a330 billion as at 31 December 2021. Overall, total wholesale funding has reduced to \u00a391.4 billion as at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: \u00a3109.4 billion).\n\nThe Group's liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) was 135 per cent (based on a monthly rolling average over the previous 12 months) as at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 136 per cent) calculated on a Group consolidated basis based on the EU Delegated Act. Following the implementation of structural reform, liquidity risk is managed at a legal entity level with the Group consolidated LCR representing the composite of the Ring-Fenced Bank and Non Ring-Fenced Bank entities.\n\nThe Group's credit ratings continue to reflect the resilience of the Group's business model and the strength of the balance sheet. Over the course of June and July, Moody's, S&P and Fitch all returned the outlook on the Group's credit ratings to Stable, from Negative. This reflected better underlying economic expectations for the UK, as well as the Group's prudent provisioning driving their belief that the Group is well positioned to benefit from the macroeconomic recovery and successfully navigate any potential tail risks from the pandemic. In May, Fitch downgraded Lloyds Banking Group and subsequently Scottish Widows by one notch. In July, Moody's issued a number of ratings changes for UK banks, including a one notch upgrade to the Senior and Subordinated ratings for Lloyds Banking Group and Subordinated ratings for Lloyds Bank.",

Overall, total wholesale funding volumes totalled \u00a391.4 billion as at 31 December 2021. For 2022, the Group expects to have a term wholesale funding requirement of less than \u00a310 billion. This is expected to be issued from the Lloyds Banking Group entity, with Lloyds Bank and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets having limited term funding needs given the continued availability of alternative, more cost effective funding options.",

Future use of such facilities will be based on prudent liquidity management and economic considerations, having regard for external market conditions.\n\n## Stress testing results\n\nInternal liquidity stress testing results at 31 December 2021 (calculated as an average of month end observations over the previous 12 months) showed that the Banking business had liquidity resources representing 140 per cent of modelled outflows over a three month period from all wholesale funding sources, retail and corporate deposits, intraday requirements and rating-dependent contracts under the Group's most severe liquidity stress scenario.\n\nThis scenario includes a two notch downgrade of the Group's current long-term debt rating and accompanying one notch short-term downgrade implemented instantaneously by all major rating agencies.\n\n## Encumbered assets\n\nThis disclosure provides further detail on the availability of assets that could be used to support potential future funding requirements of the Group. The disclosure is not designed to identify assets that would be available in the event of a resolution or bankruptcy.\n\nThe Board and the Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) monitor and manage total balance sheet encumbrance using a number of risk appetite metrics. At 31 December 2021, the Group had \u00a336.9 billion (31 December 2020: \u00a346.9 billion) of externally encumbered on-balance sheet assets with counterparties other than central banks. The decrease in encumbered assets was primarily driven by securitisation and covered bond redemptions. The Group also had \u00a3694.3 billion (31 December 2020: \u00a3707.2 billion) of unencumbered on-balance sheet assets, and \u00a3155.4 billion (31 December 2020: \u00a3117.2 billion) of pre-positioned and encumbered assets held with central banks, the increase in the latter was primarily driven by the additional assets pledged to support the increase in drawings from the Bank of England's Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs. Primarily, the Group encumbers mortgages, unsecured lending, credit card receivables and car loans through the issuance programmes and tradable securities through securities financing activity. The Group mainly pre-positions mortgage assets at central banks.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Capital risk\n\n## Definition\n\nCapital risk is defined as the risk that the Group has a sub-optimal quantity or quality of capital or that capital is inefficiently deployed across the Group.\n\n## Exposures\n\nA capital risk event arises when the Group has insufficient capital resources to support its strategic objectives and plans, and to meet both regulatory and external stakeholder requirements and expectations. This could arise due to a depletion of the Group's capital resources as a result of the crystallisation of any of the risks to which it is exposed, or through a significant increase in risk-weighted assets as a result of rule changes or economic deterioration. Alternatively a shortage of capital could arise from an increase in the minimum requirements for capital, leverage or MREL either at Group, RingFenced Bank (RFB) sub-group or regulated entity level. The Group's capital management approach is focused on maintaining sufficient and appropriate capital resources across all regulated levels of its structure in order to prevent such exposures while optimising value for shareholders.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group maintains capital levels across all regulated entities commensurate with a prudent level of solvency to achieve financial resilience and market confidence. To support this, capital risk appetite is calibrated by taking into consideration both an internal view of the amount of capital to hold as well as external regulatory requirements.\n\nUnder UK law, EU capital rules that existed on 31 December 2020 continue to apply to the Group following the end of the transition period for the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, subject to the temporary transitional powers (TTP) granted to the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) which extend until 31 March 2022. The Group continues to therefore measure both its capital requirements and the amount of capital resources it holds to meet those requirements through applying the regulatory framework defined by the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation (CRD IV), as amended by revisions to the Capital Requirements Directive implemented in December 2020 (CRD V) and by those provisions of the revised Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR II) that came into force in June 2019 and December 2020. The requirements are implemented in the UK by the PRA and supplemented through additional regulation under the PRA Rulebook and associated statements of policy, supervisory statements and other guidance.\n\nThe remaining provisions of CRR II will apply in the UK from 1 January 2022 and have been largely enacted via the PRA Rulebook.\n\nFurther details of the regulatory capital and leverage frameworks to which the Group is subject, including the means by which its capital and leverage requirements and capital resources are calculated, will be provided in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures.\n\nThe minimum amount of total capital, under Pillar 1 of the regulatory capital framework, is set at 8 per cent of total risk-weighted assets. At least 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets are required to be covered by common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and at least 6 per cent of risk-weighted assets are required to be covered by tier 1 capital. These minimum Pillar 1 requirements are supplemented by additional minimum requirements under Pillar 2A of the regulatory capital framework, the aggregate of which is referred to as the Group's Total Capital Requirement (TCR), and a number of regulatory capital buffers as described below.\n\nAdditional minimum requirements under Pillar 2A are set by the PRA as a firm-specific Individual Capital Requirement (ICR) reflecting a point in time estimate, which may change over time, of the minimum amount of capital to cover risks that are not fully covered by Pillar 1, such as credit concentration and operational risk, and those risks not covered at all by Pillar 1, such as pensions and interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB). During the year the PRA reduced the Group's nominal Pillar 2A capital requirement, which was the equivalent of around 3.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets as at 31 December 2021, of which the minimum amount to be met by CET1 capital was the equivalent of around 2.1 per cent of risk-weighted assets. During 2022, the PRA will revert to setting a variable amount for the Group's Pillar 2A capital requirement (being a set percentage of risk-weighted assets), with fixed add-ons for certain risk types.\n\nIn line with PRA policy, the Group's Pillar 2A capital requirement includes a reduction linked to the setting of a 2 per cent UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate under normal conditions, as defined by the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC). This reduction is currently fully offset by other regulatory capital buffers at the CET1 capital level, whilst the UK CCyB rate remains at nil and will be expected to unwind going forward as and when the UK CCyB rate increases to 2 per cent.\n\nThe Group is also required to hold a number of regulatory capital buffers which are required to be met with CET1 capital.\n\nSystemic buffers are designed to hold systemically important banks to higher capital standards, so that they can withstand a greater level of stress before requiring resolution.\n\n- \u00b7 Although the Group is not currently classified as a global systemically important institution (G-SII) under the Capital Requirements Directive, it has been classified as an 'other' systemically important institution (O-SII) by the PRA.\n- \u00b7 The O-SII buffer applies to the Group's RFB sub-group and is currently set at 2.0 per cent of the RFB sub-group's risk-weighted assets. The size of the buffer applied to the RFB sub-group is dependent upon the level of its total assets. The O-SII buffer equates to 1.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at Group level, with the difference reflecting the risk-weighted assets of the Group that are not in the RFB sub-group and for which the O-SII buffer does not therefore apply. It is the PRA's policy to include this in the Group's PRA Buffer. The next review of the RFB sub-group's O-SII buffer will take place in December 2023, based upon year-end 2022 financial results, with any changes applying from 1 January 2025. The FPC is proposing to amend the O-SII buffer framework in order to change the metric for determining the buffer rate from total assets to the UK leverage exposure measure.\n\nThe capital conservation buffer (CCB) is a standard buffer of 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets designed to provide for losses in the event of stress.\n\nThe countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is time-varying and is designed to require banks to hold additional capital to remove or reduce the build-up of systemic risk in times of credit boom, providing additional loss absorbing capacity and acting as an incentive for banks to constrain further credit growth. The amount of the buffer is determined by reference to buffer rates applied by the FPC for the individual countries where the Group has relevant credit exposures. The CCyB rate for the UK is currently set at 0 per cent as a result of the measures introduced by UK regulators during the first half of 2020 in response to COVID-19. In December 2021 the FPC announced that the UK CCyB rate will increase to 1 per cent in December 2022, with an expectation that it will increase to 2 per cent in Q2 2023 if the economy continues to recover broadly in line with the Bank of England's central projections and upon the assumption there is no significant change to the financial stability outlook.\n\nGiven the Group's UK focused business model, the Group's CCyB at 31 December 2021 was around 0 per cent of risk-weighted assets. The FPC announcement on the future increases in the UK CCyB rate would represent an equivalent increase in the Group's CCyB to 0.9 per cent in December 2022 and 1.8 per cent in Q2 2023, based upon the position of the Group at 31 December 2021.\n\nAs part of the Group's capital planning process, forecast capital positions are subjected to stress testing to determine the adequacy of the Group's capital resources against minimum requirements, including the ICR. The PRA considers outputs from both the Group's internal stress tests and Bank of England stress tests, in conjunction with other information, as part of the process for informing the setting of a bank-specific capital buffer for the Group, known as the PRA Buffer. The PRA requires this buffer to remain confidential.\n\nUnder previous Bank of England stress tests, the Bank of England has taken action to avoid an unwarranted de facto increase in capital requirements that could result from the interaction of IFRS 9. The stress hurdle rates for banks participating in past exercises were adjusted to recognise the additional resilience provided by the earlier provisions taken under IFRS 9. A similar approach was applied for the 2021 solvency stress test. The Bank is continuing to work on a more enduring treatment of IFRS 9 for the purposes of future stress tests and collected additional data during the 2021 solvency stress test which could help inform a future approach.",

        "page_content": "All buffers are required to be met with CET1 capital. Usage of the PRA Buffer would trigger a dialogue between the Group and the PRA to agree what action is required whereas a breach of the combined buffer (all other regulatory buffers, as referenced above) would give rise to mandatory restrictions upon any discretionary capital distributions. The PRA has previously communicated its expectation that banks' capital and liquidity buffers can be drawn down as necessary to support the real economy through a shock and that sufficient time would be made available to restore buffers in a gradual manner.\n\nIn addition to the risk-based capital framework outlined above, the Group is also subject to minimum capital requirements under the UK Leverage Ratio Framework. The leverage ratio is calculated by dividing fully loaded tier 1 capital resources by the leverage exposure which is a defined measure of on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet items.\n\nThe minimum leverage ratio requirement under the UK Leverage Ratio Framework is 3.25 per cent. This is supplemented by a time-varying countercyclical leverage buffer (CCLB) which is determined by multiplying the leverage exposure measure by 35 per cent of the countercyclical capital buffer (CCYB) rate. As at 31 December 2021 the CCLB for the Group was 0 per cent. Following the FPC's announcements on the planned increase of the UK CCyB rate, the Group's CCLB would be expected to increase to 0.3 per cent in December 2022 and 0.6 per cent in Q2 2023, based upon the position of the Group at 31 December 2021. An additional leverage ratio buffer (ALRB) of 0.7 per cent applies to the RFB sub-group and is determined by multiplying the RFB sub-group leverage exposure measure by 35 per cent of the O-SII buffer. This equates to 0.6 per cent of the total leverage exposure measure at Group level.\n\nAt least 75 per cent of the 3.25 per cent minimum leverage ratio requirement as well as 100 per cent of regulatory leverage buffers must be met by CET1 capital.\n\nThe leverage ratio framework does not currently give rise to higher regulatory capital requirements for the Group than the risk-based capital framework.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group has a capital management framework that includes the setting of capital risk appetite and capital planning and stress testing activities. Close monitoring of capital and leverage ratios is undertaken to ensure the Group meets regulatory requirements and risk appetite levels and deploys its capital resources efficiently.\n\nThe Group monitors early warning indicators and maintains a Capital Contingency Framework as part of a Recovery Plan which are designed to identify emerging capital concerns at an early stage, so that mitigating actions can be taken, if needed. The Recovery Plan sets out a range of potential mitigating actions that could be taken in response to a stress. For example, the Group is able to accumulate additional capital through the retention of profits over time, which can be enhanced through reducing or cancelling proposed dividend payments and share buybacks, by raising new equity via, for example, a rights issue or debt exchange and by raising additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital securities. The cost and availability of additional capital is dependent upon market conditions and perceptions at the time.\n\nThe Group is also able to manage the demand for capital through management actions including adjusting its lending strategy, risk hedging strategies and through business disposals.\n\nCapital policies and procedures are well established and subject to independent oversight.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Group's capital is actively managed and monitoring capital ratios is a key factor in the Group's planning processes, which separately cover the RFB sub-group and key individual banking entities. Multi-year base case forecasts of the Group's capital position, based upon the Group's operating plan, are produced at least annually to inform the Group's capital plan whilst shorter term forecasts are more frequently undertaken to understand and respond to variations of the Group's actual performance against the plan. The Group's capital plan is tested for capital adequacy using relevant stress scenarios and sensitivities covering adverse economic conditions as well as other adverse factors that could impact the Group.\n\nRegular monitoring of the capital position is undertaken by a range of committees, including Group Capital Risk Committee (GCRC), Group Financial Risk Committee (GFRC), Group and Ring-Fenced Banks Asset and Liability Committees (GALCO), Group and Ring-Fenced Banks Risk Committees (GRC), Board Risk Committee (BRC) and the Board. This includes reporting of actual ratios against forecasts and risk appetite, base case and stress scenario projected ratios, and review of early warning indicators and assessment against the Capital Contingency Framework.\n\nThe regulatory framework within which the Group operates continues to evolve and further detail on this will be provided in the Group's Pillar 3 disclosures. The Group continues to monitor prudential developments very closely, analysing the potential capital impacts to ensure that, through organic capital generation and management actions, the Group continues to maintain a strong capital position that exceeds both minimum regulatory requirements and the Group's risk appetite and is consistent with market expectations.\n\n## Target capital ratios\n\nThe Board's view of the ongoing level of CET1 capital required by the Group to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties continues to be around 12.5 per cent plus a management buffer of around 1 per cent.\n\nThis takes into account, amongst other things:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's Pillar 2A capital requirement set by the PRA. During the year the PRA reduced the Group's nominal Pillar 2A capital requirement, of which the minimum amount to be met by CET1 capital was the equivalent of around 2.1 per cent of risk-weighted assets as at 31 December 2021\n- \u00b7 The minimum Pillar 1 CET1 capital requirement of 4.5 per cent of riskweighted assets\n- \u00b7 The Group's current CCyB requirement which is around 0 per cent of risk-weighted assets\n- \u00b7 The RFB sub-group's O-SII buffer of 2.0 per cent of risk-weighted assets, which equates to 1.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets at Group level\n- \u00b7 The CCB requirement of 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets\n- \u00b7 The Group's PRA Buffer\n- \u00b7 The desire to maintain a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy in the context of year to year earnings movements",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nThe Group has a progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy whilst maintaining the flexibility to return surplus capital through buybacks or special dividends.\n\nSurplus capital represents capital over and above the amount management wish to retain to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties. The amount of required capital may vary from time to time depending on circumstances and by its nature there can be no guarantee that any return of surplus capital will be made.\n\nGiven the Group's solid financial performance and strong capital position at the year end, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 1.33 pence per share. This is in addition to the interim ordinary dividend of 0.67 pence per share that was announced in the 2021 half year results. The recommended total ordinary dividend per share for 2021 is therefore 2.00 pence per share. The Group also intends to implement a share buyback of up to \u00a32.0 billion which will commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed by 31 December 2022.\n\nThe Board remains committed to future capital returns. Going forward, the Board intends to maintain its progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy alongside further surplus capital distributions at the end of the year as appropriate. The Board will continue to give due consideration at year end to the size of the final dividend payment and to the return of any surplus capital based upon the circumstances at the time.\n\nThe ability of the Group to pay a dividend is also subject to constraints including the availability of distributable reserves, legal and regulatory restrictions and the Group's financial and operating performance.\n\nDistributable reserves are determined as required by the Companies Act 2006 by reference to a company's individual financial statements. At 31 December 2021 Lloyds Banking Group plc ('the Company') had accumulated distributable reserves of approximately \u00a313 billion. Substantially all of the Company's merger reserve is available for distribution under UK company law as a result of transactions undertaken to recapitalise the Company in 2009.\n\nLloyds Banking Group plc acts as a holding company which also issues capital and other securities to capitalise and fund the activities of the Group. The profitability of the holding company, and its ability to sustain dividend payments, is therefore dependent upon the continued receipt of dividends and interest from its main operating subsidiaries, including Lloyds Bank plc (the Ring-Fenced Bank), Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc (the nonring-fenced bank), LBG Equity Investments Limited and Scottish Widows Group Limited (the insurance business). The principal operating subsidiary is Lloyds Bank plc which, at 31 December 2021, had a consolidated CET1 capital ratio that exceeded minimum regulatory requirements and internal risk appetite levels. A number of Group subsidiaries, principally those with banking and insurance activities, are subject to regulatory capital requirements which require minimum amounts of capital to be maintained relative to their size and risk. The Group actively manages the capital of its subsidiaries, which includes monitoring the regulatory capital ratios for its banking and insurance subsidiaries and, on a consolidated basis, the RFB sub-group against approved risk appetite levels. The Group operates a formal capital management policy which requires all subsidiary entities, subject to agreement by their governing bodies, to remit surplus capital to their parent companies.\n\n## Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL)\n\nGlobal systemically important banks (G-SIBs) are subject to an international standard on total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC). The standard, which first applied from 1 January 2019, is designed to enhance the resilience of the global financial system by ensuring that failing G-SIBs have sufficient capital to absorb losses and recapitalise under resolution, whilst continuing to provide critical banking services.\n\nIn the UK, the Bank of England has implemented the requirements of the international TLAC standard through the establishment of a framework which sets out minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL). The purpose of MREL is to require firms to maintain sufficient own funds and eligible liabilities that are capable of credibly bearing losses or recapitalising a bank whilst in resolution. MREL can be satisfied by a combination of regulatory capital and certain unsecured liabilities (which must be subordinate to a firm's operating liabilities).\n\nAlthough the Group is not classified as a G-SIB it is subject to the Bank of England's MREL framework, including the statement of policy on MREL (the 'MREL SoP') which requires the Group to maintain a minimum level of MREL resources.\n\nUnder the requirements of the framework, the Group operates a single point of entry (SPE) resolution strategy, with Lloyds Banking Group plc as the designated resolution entity.\n\nApplying the MREL SoP to minimum capital requirements at 31 December 2021, the Group's transitional MREL, excluding regulatory capital and leverage buffers, is the higher of 2 times Pillar 1 plus Pillar 2A, equivalent to 19.7 per cent of risk-weighted assets, or 6.5 per cent of the UK leverage ratio exposure measure.\n\nOn 1 January 2022 the Group's MREL, excluding regulatory capital and leverage buffers, increased to the higher of 2 times Pillar 1 plus 2 times Pillar 2A, equivalent to 23.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets as based upon minimum capital requirements at 31 December 2021, or 6.5 per cent of the UK leverage ratio exposure measure.\n\nIn addition, CET1 capital cannot be used to meet both MREL and capital or leverage buffers.\n\nThe Bank of England completed a review of its existing approach to setting MREL in December 2021 and has published a revised approach which became effective and binding on the Group from 1 January 2022. There has been no change to the basis for determining the Group's MREL.\n\nInternal MREL also apply to the Group's material sub-groups and entities, including the RFB sub-group, Lloyds Bank plc, Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc.",

        "page_content": "## Analysis of capital position\n\nThe Group's CET1 capital ratio (after announced distributions) increased by 15 basis points over the year to 16.3 per cent on a pro forma basis (31 December 2020: 16.2 per cent), reflecting a strong pro forma capital build of 210 basis points for the year, offset by 185 basis points in respect of the full year ordinary dividend and the announced ordinary share buyback programme and a further 10 basis points for variable pension contributions made to the Group's main defined benefit pensions schemes in December.\n\nThe pro forma capital build of 210 basis points included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 A further 16 basis points for the \u00a3300 million final dividend received from the Insurance business in February 2022 in respect of its full year 2021 results\n- \u00b7 Banking profitability (pre-underlying impairment credit) of 210 basis points, with a limited impairment offset of 19 basis points, being the net impact of IFRS 9 transitional relief reduction (including 5 basis points for the phased reduction of static relief) and the impairment credit for the year\n- \u00b7 A reduction in risk-weighted assets generating an increase equivalent to 58 basis points\n- \u00b7 Offset by fixed pension contributions made to the defined benefit pension schemes of 41 basis points and other movements of 14 basis points which includes around 30 basis points for the impact of the equity provided to Insurance to fund the acquisition of Embark\n\nExcluding the Insurance dividend received in February 2022 and the impact of the announced ordinary share buyback programme, the Group's CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2021 was 17.3 per cent (31 December 2020: 16.2 per cent).\n\nThe capital impact of 77 basis points for the full year ordinary dividend of \u00a31,420 million reflects both the interim ordinary dividend of 0.67 pence per share paid in September 2021 and an accrual for foreseeable ordinary dividends representing the recommended final ordinary dividend for 2021 of 1.33 pence per share.\n\nThe pro forma CET1 capital ratio includes an accrual of \u00a32 billion for the full amount of the announced ordinary share buyback programme, equivalent to 2.82 pence per share and a reduction of 108 basis points. The buyback will commence as soon as is practicable and the full impact will be accrued for through the Group's actual capital position upon announcement.\n\nThe Group continues to apply the revised IFRS 9 transitional arrangements for capital which provide for temporary capital relief for the increase in accounting impairment provisions following the initial implementation of IFRS 9 ('static' relief) and subsequent relief for any increases in Stage 1 and Stage 2 expected credit losses since 1 January 2020 ('dynamic' relief). The transitional arrangements do not cover Stage 3 expected credit losses. The total CET1 capital relief recognised at 31 December 2021 amounted to 40 basis points.\n\nOn 1 January 2022, the pro forma CET1 capital ratio reduced by around 230 basis points to 14.0 per cent, reflecting the following:\n\n- \u00b7 An increase in intangible software assets deducted from CET1 capital following the reversal of the revised treatment\n- \u00b7 An increase in risk-weighted assets to \u00a3212 billion on a pro forma basis, in addition to other related modelled impacts on CET1 capital, following the implementation of new CRD IV mortgage, retail unsecured and commercial banking models to meet revised regulatory standards for modelled outputs and the UK implementation of the remainder of CRR II which includes a new standardised approach for measuring counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). These were partially offset by the removal of risk-weighted assets linked to the reversal of the revised treatment that had previously been applied to intangible software assets and other movements. The new CRD IV models are subject to finalisation and approval by the PRA and therefore uncertainty over the final impacts remains\n- \u00b7 A reduction in IFRS 9 relief reflecting both phasing under the transitional arrangements and the impact of the new CRD IV models. The remaining relief on 1 January 2022 amounted to around 10 basis points\n\nDuring 2021, the transitional total capital ratio increased to 23.6 per cent (31 December 2020: 23.3 per cent) largely reflecting the increase in CET1 capital, the issuance of a new tier 2 capital instrument and the reduction in risk-weighted assets. This was offset in part by the reduction in transitional limits applied to legacy tier 1 and tier 2 capital instruments, the impact of movements in rates and regulatory amortisation and the net outcome of the revised regulatory classification and exchange and tender offer exercises applied to the Group's legacy preference shares.\n\nThe Group's transitional minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) ratio increased to 37.2 per cent (31 December 2020: 36.4 per cent), largely reflecting the reduction in risk-weighted assets, offset in part by a reduction in other eligible liabilities.\n\nThe UK leverage ratio remained at 5.8 per cent (31 December 2020: 5.8 per cent) as the reduction in the fully loaded total tier 1 capital position was offset by the reduction in the leverage exposure measure, the latter primarily reflecting movements in securities financing transactions and offbalance sheet items, net of increased balance sheet lending.\n\n## Total capital requirement\n\nThe Group's total capital requirement (TCR) as at 31 December 2021, being the aggregate of the Group's Pillar 1 and current Pillar 2A capital requirements, was \u00a322,986 million (31 December 2020: \u00a323,918 million).\n\n## Capital resources\n\nAn analysis of the Group's capital position as at 31 December 2021 is presented in the following section on both a transitional arrangements basis and a fully loaded basis in respect of legacy capital securities that were subject to grandfathering provisions prior to 1 January 2022. In addition the Group's capital position under both bases reflects the application of the separate transitional arrangements for IFRS 9.",

        "page_content": "## Movements in capital resources\n\nThe key difference between the transitional capital calculation as at 31 December 2021 and the fully loaded equivalent is primarily related to legacy capital securities that previously qualified as tier 1 or tier 2 capital, but that do not fully qualify under the regulation, and which can be included in additional tier 1 (AT1) or tier 2 capital (as applicable) up to specified limits which reduced by 10 per cent per annum until 2022. From 1 January 2022, legacy capital securities will cease to be recognised as eligible regulatory capital, with the exception of securities that qualify for the extended transitional rules under CRR II. As of 31 December 2021, the Group has a single legacy capital security that qualifies for the extension which will allow it to be recognised as tier 2 capital until June 2025.\n\nFollowing a debt restructure by the Insurance business during the year, the Group's previous holdings in certain legacy capital instruments issued by Scottish Widows Group Limited have been replaced with new instruments that are fully eligible under Solvency II requirements. These include the issue of Restricted Tier 1 (RT1) and tier 2 capital instruments to the Group which are subsequently deducted from the Group's tier 1 and tier 2 capital positions respectively on both a transitional and fully loaded basis.\n\nThe key movements on a transitional capital basis are set out in the table below.\n\n## Movements in capital resources\n\n|                                                                                                 | Common  equity tier 1 \u00a3m   | Additional tier  1 \u00a3m   | Tier 2 \u00a3m   | Total capital \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|--------------------|\n| At 31 December 2020                                                                             | 32,822                     | 5,844                   | 8,502       | 47,168             |\n| Banking business profits 1                                                                      | 5,919                      | -                       | -           | 5,919              |\n| Foreseeable dividend accrual 2                                                                  | (947)                      | -                       | -           | (947)              |\n| Interim dividend paid out on ordinary shares during the year                                    | (473)                      | -                       | -           | (473)              |\n| IFRS 9 transitional adjustment to retained earnings                                             | (1,340)                    | -                       | -           | (1,340)            |\n| Movement in treasury shares and employee share schemes                                          | 169                        | -                       | -           | 169                |\n| Pension contributions                                                                           | (944)                      | -                       | -           | (944)              |\n| Fair value through other comprehensive income reserve                                           | 164                        | -                       | -           | 164                |\n| Deferred tax asset                                                                              | (921)                      | -                       | -           | (921)              |\n| Goodwill and other intangible assets                                                            | 94                         | -                       | -           | 94                 |\n| Significant investments                                                                         | (464)                      | 38                      | (19)        | (445)              |\n| Movements in other equity, subordinated liabilities, other tier 2 items and related adjustments | -                          | (552)                   | (1,294)     | (1,846)            |\n| Distributions on other equity instruments                                                       | (429)                      | -                       | -           | (429)              |\n| Other equity reserves and other movements\u00b3                                                      | 165                        | -                       | -           | 165                |\n| At 31 December 2021                                                                             | 33,815                     | 5,330                   | 7,189       | 46,334             |\n\n- 1 Under the regulatory capital framework, profits made by Insurance are removed from CET1 capital. However, when dividends are paid to the Group by Insurance these are recognised through CET1 capital.\n- 2 Reflects the accrual for the final 2021 ordinary dividend. Excludes the reversal of the brought forward accrual for the 2020 full year ordinary dividend which was paid out during the year.\n- 3 Includes other pension movements.\n\nCET1 capital resources have increased by \u00a3993 million over the year, primarily reflecting underlying banking business profits, with the impairment credit more than offset by the partial unwind of IFRS 9 transitional relief. Further offsets comprised of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the interim ordinary dividend paid out in September 2021 and the accrual for the final 2021 ordinary dividend\n- \u00b7 pension contributions made to the defined benefit pension schemes\n- \u00b7 distributions on other equity instruments\n- \u00b7 an increase in significant investments deducted from capital reflecting the equity provided to Insurance to fund the acquisition of Embark Group\n- \u00b7 an increase in deferred tax assets deducted from capital which primarily reflects the remeasurement of deferred tax assets following the announced increase in the UK corporation tax rate from 1 April 2023. The remeasurement has a limited overall capital benefit as the tax credit through banking profits is largely offset by the increase in the deferred tax asset deduction\n\nAT1 capital resources have reduced by \u00a3514 million over the year, primarily reflecting the annual reduction in the transitional limit applied to legacy AT1 capital instruments.\n\nTier 2 capital resources have reduced by \u00a31,313 million over the year, largely reflecting the application of the reduced transitional limit applied to legacy tier 2 capital instruments, the impact of movements in rates and regulatory amortisation and the net outcome of the revised regulatory classification and exchange and tender offer exercises applied to the Group's legacy preference shares.",

Significant investments primarily arise from investments in the Group's Insurance business.\n\nThe risk-weighted assets movement table provides analysis of the movement in risk-weighted assets in the period by risk type and an insight into the key drivers of the movements.\n\nCredit risk, risk-weighted assets:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset quality increase of \u00a30.6 billion reflects the impact of retail model calibrations with limited credit migration in part due to the benefit of House Price Index increases\n- \u00b7 Asset size reduction of \u00a34.0 billion predominantly reflects increased levels of optimisation in Commercial Banking and lower unsecured balances, partially offset by increased mortgage lending\n- \u00b7 Methodology and policy changes of \u00a33.0 billion include reductions in risk-weighted assets through securitisation activity, other optimisation activity and enhanced identification of SME exposures\n\nCounterparty credit risk, risk-weighted assets: reduced by \u00a30.7 billion predominantly due to movements in market rates during the period.\n\nMarket risk, risk-weighted assets: increased by \u00a31.0 billion driven by an increase in IBOR transition related Risks Not in VaR (RNIVs), capital multiplier increases due to IBOR related activities and increased market volatility in the fourth quarter resulting in backtesting overshoots.\n\nOperational risk, risk-weighted assets: reduced by \u00a30.8 billion due to a reduction in 3 year average income levels.\n\n## Leverage ratio\n\n## Analysis of leverage movements\n\nThe Group's fully loaded UK leverage ratio has remained at 5.8 per cent, with the impact of the reduction in the fully loaded total tier 1 capital position offset by the \u00a31.7 billion reduction in the exposure measure which largely reflected movements in securities financing transactions and off-balance sheet items, net of increased balance sheet lending.\n\nFollowing a direction received from the PRA during 2020 the Group is permitted to exclude lending under the UK Government's Bounce Back Loan Scheme (BBLS) from the leverage exposure measure.\n\nThe derivatives exposure measure, representing derivative financial instruments per the balance sheet net of deconsolidation and derivatives adjustments, increased by \u00a32.4 billion during the year, largely reflecting lower cash collateral adjustments, partially offset by reductions in both the replacement cost (reflecting market movements) and the regulatory potential future exposure (reflecting trade compressions through central counterparties).\n\nThe securities financing transactions (SFT) exposure measure, representing SFT assets per the balance sheet net of deconsolidation and other SFT adjustments, reduced by \u00a34.4 billion during the year, reflecting a reduction in volumes.\n\nOff-balance sheet items reduced by \u00a33.4 billion during the year, reflecting net reductions in both corporate facilities and residential mortgage offers placed and other optimisation activity.\n\nThe average UK leverage ratio was 5.8 per cent over the quarter, consistent with the positions at the start and end of the quarter. This reflected a higher average exposure measure which was broadly offset by the average fully loaded total tier 1 capital position.",

Specifically, the Group has opted to apply both paragraphs 2 and 4 of CRR Article 473a (static and dynamic relief) and in addition to apply a 100 per cent risk weight to the consequential Standardised credit risk exposure add-back as permitted under paragraph 7a of the revisions.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, static relief under the transitional arrangements amounted to \u00a3353 million (31 December 2020: \u00a3616 million) and dynamic relief amounted to \u00a3428 million (31 December 2020: \u00a31,865 million) through CET1 capital.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe Group undertakes a wide-ranging programme of stress testing, providing a comprehensive view of the potential impacts arising from the risks to which the Group and its key legal entities are exposed. One of the most important uses of stress testing is to assess the resilience of the operational and strategic plans of the Group and its legal entities to adverse economic conditions and other key vulnerabilities. As part of this programme, the Group conducts a macroeconomic stress test of the Group's operating plan in the second half of the year to assess whether the Group's capital position is resilient to a further severe economic shock, over and above the stress experienced during the pandemic.\n\nThe Group also participates in stress tests run by the Bank of England which published the results of the most recent exercise in December 2021, showing that the Group had passed the stress test. The Bank of England calculated the Group's CET1 capital ratio after the application of management actions to be 7.8 per cent, against the reference rate of 7.7 per cent, meaning the Group was not required by the regulator to undertake any capital actions. This shows the Group's resilience to a severe economic shock in addition to what had been experienced over 2020, as House Price Index (HPI) and Commercial Real Estate (CRE) values fell a further 33 per cent and unemployment peaked at 11.9 per cent in the Bank of England's theoretical stress scenario.\n\nThe Group participated in Part I of the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Stress test in 2021 and will leverage the experience gained through that exercise to further embed climate risk into risk management and stress testing activities.\n\n## G-SIB indicators\n\nAlthough the Group is not currently classified as a Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB), by virtue of the Group's leverage exposure measure exceeding \u20ac200 billion the Group is required to report G-SIB indicator metrics to the PRA. The Group's indicator metrics used within the 2021 Basel G-SIBs annual exercise will be disclosed from April 2022 and the results are expected to be made available by the Basel Committee later this year.\n\n## Insurance business\n\nThe business transacted by the insurance companies within the Group comprises both life insurance business and General Insurance business. Life insurance comprises of unit-linked, non-profit and with-profits business.\n\nScottish Widows Limited (SW Ltd) holds the only with-profit fund managed by the Group. Each insurance company within the Group is regulated by the PRA.\n\nThe Solvency II regime for insurers and insurance groups came into force from 1 January 2016. Insurance is required to calculate solvency capital requirements and available capital on a risk-based approach. Insurance calculates regulatory capital on the basis of an internal model, which has been approved by the PRA.\n\nThe minimum required capital must be maintained at all times throughout the year. These capital requirements and the capital available to meet them are regularly estimated in order to ensure that capital maintenance requirements are being met.\n\nAll minimum regulatory requirements of the insurance companies have been met during the year.\n\n## Insurance underwriting risk\n\n## Definition\n\nInsurance underwriting risk is defined as the risk of adverse developments in the timing, frequency and severity of claims for insured/underwritten events and in customer behaviour, leading to reductions in earnings and/ or value.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe major source of insurance underwriting risk within the Group arises from the Insurance business.\n\nLongevity and persistency are key risks within the life and pensions business. Longevity risk arises from the annuity portfolios where policyholders' future cash flows are guaranteed at retirement and increases in life expectancy beyond current assumptions will increase the cost of annuities. Longevity risk exposures are expected to increase with the Insurance business growth in the annuity market. Customer behaviour may result in increased cancellations or cessation of contributions, giving rise to the persistency exposure.\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes also expose the Group to longevity risk. For further information please refer to the defined benefit pension schemes component of the market risk section and note 34 to the financial statements.\n\nProperty insurance risk is a key risk within the General Insurance business, arising from home insurance. Exposures can arise, for example, from extreme weather conditions such as flooding, when property damage claims are higher than expected.\n\n## Measurement\n\nInsurance underwriting risks are measured using a variety of techniques including stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, as well as stochastic modelling. Current and potential future insurance underwriting risk exposures are assessed and aggregated across a range of stresses with risk measures based on 1-in-200 year stresses for the Insurance business' regulatory capital assessments and other supporting measures where appropriate, including those set out in note 31 to the financial statements.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nInsurance underwriting risk in the Insurance business is mitigated in a number of ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Embedded Insurance processes for underwriting, claims management, pricing and product design",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n- \u00b7 Exposure limits by risk type are assessed through the business planning process and used as a control mechanism to ensure risks are taken within risk appetite\n- \u00b7 General Insurance exposure to accumulations of risk and possible catastrophes is mitigated by reinsurance arrangements spread over numerous reinsurers. Detailed modelling, including that of the potential losses under various catastrophe scenarios, supports the choice of reinsurance arrangements\n- \u00b7 Longevity risk transfer and hedging solutions are considered on a regular basis and since 2017 the Group has reinsured \u00a34.2 billion of annuitant longevity. An established team of longevity and pricing experts supports the annuity proposition\n\n## Monitoring\n\nInsurance underwriting risks in the Insurance business are monitored by Insurance senior executive committees and ultimately the Insurance Board. Significant risks from the Insurance business and the defined benefit pension schemes are reviewed by the Group Executive and Group Risk Committees and Board.\n\nInsurance underwriting risk exposures within the Insurance business are monitored against risk appetite. The Insurance business monitors experiences against expectations, for example business volumes and mix, claims and persistency experience. The effectiveness of controls put in place to manage insurance underwriting risk is evaluated and significant divergences from experience or movements in risk exposures are investigated and remedial action taken.\n\n## Change/execution risk Definition\n\nChange/execution risk is defined as the risk that, in delivering its change agenda, the Group fails to ensure compliance with laws and regulation, maintain effective customer service and availability, and/or operate within the Group's risk appetite.\n\n## Exposures\n\nChange/execution risks arise when the Group undertakes activities which require products, processes, people, systems or controls to change. These changes can be as a result of external drivers (for example, a new piece of regulation that requires the Group to put in place a new process or reporting) and/or internal drivers including business process changes, technology upgrades and strategic business or technology transformation.\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group currently measures change/execution risk against defined risk appetite metrics which are a combination of leading, quality and delivery indicators across the investment portfolio. These indicators are reported through internal governance structures and monthly execution metrics, which forms part of the Board risk appetite metrics, and are under ongoing evolution and enhancement to ensure ongoing support of the Group's change agenda.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to change/ execution risk. These include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring compliance with the change policy and associated policies and procedures, which set out the principles and key controls that apply across the business and are aligned to the Group risk appetite\n- \u00b7 The Board establishes a Group-wide risk appetite and metric for change/ execution risk\n- \u00b7 Businesses assess the potential impacts of undertaking any change activity on their ability to execute effectively, on customers and colleagues and on the potential consequences for existing business risk profiles\n- \u00b7 Events and incidents related to change activities are escalated and managed appropriately in line with risk framework guidance\n- \u00b7 The implementation of effective governance and control frameworks to ensure adequate controls are in place to manage change activity and act to mitigate the change/execution risks identified. These controls are monitored in line with the change policy and enterprise risk management framework\n- \u00b7 Ensuring there are sufficient, appropriately skilled resources to support the safe delivery of the Group's current and future change portfolio\n\n## Monitoring\n\nChange/execution risks are monitored and reported through to the Board and Group Governance Committees in accordance with the Group's enterprise risk management framework. Risk exposures are assessed monthly through established governance in both Group Transformation and Business Risk Committees with escalation to Executive Committees where required. Material change/execution related risk events or incidents are escalated in accordance with the Group operational risk policy and change policy. In addition there is oversight, challenge and reporting at Risk division level to support overall management of risks and ongoing effectiveness of controls.\n\n## Conduct risk\n\n## Definition\n\nConduct risk is defined as the risk of customer detriment across the customer lifecycle including: failures in product management, distribution and servicing activities; from other risks materialising, or other activities which could undermine the integrity of the market or distort competition, leading to unfair customer outcomes, regulatory censure, reputational damage or financial loss.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group faces significant conduct risks, which affect all aspects of the Group's operations and all types of customers.\n\nConduct risks can impact directly or indirectly on the Group's customers and could materialise from a number of areas across the Group, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Ineffective development, management and monitoring of products, their distribution (including the sales process, fair value assessment and responsible lending criteria) and post- sales service (including the management of customers in financial difficulties)\n- \u00b7 Business and strategic planning that does not sufficiently consider customer needs\n- \u00b7 Unclear, unfair, misleading or untimely customer communications\n- \u00b7 Poor governance of colleagues' incentives and rewards and approval of schemes which drive unfair customer outcomes\n- \u00b7 A culture that is not sufficiently customer-centric\n- \u00b7 Ineffective identification, management and oversight of legacy conduct issues\n- \u00b7 Outsourcing of customer service and product delivery to third parties that do not have the same level of control, oversight and culture as the Group\n- \u00b7 Ineffective management and resolution of customers' complaints or claims\n\nThere is a high level of scrutiny regarding financial institutions' treatment of customers, including those in vulnerable circumstances, from regulatory bodies, the media, politicians and consumer groups. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified existing challenges, and brought new challenges for customers, affecting health, income and relationships. The Group continues to apply significant focus to its treatment of customers in financial difficulties to ensure fair outcomes.\n\nThe Group is also exposed to the risk of engaging in activities or failing to manage conduct which could constitute market abuse, undermine the integrity of a market in which it is active, distort competition or create conflicts of interest.\n\nThere continues to be a significant focus on market misconduct, and action has been taken to move to risk-free rates following the ending of the majority of London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) measures on 1st January 2022.\n\nThe Group continuously adapts to market developments that could pose heightened conduct risk, including: the potential for more customers in financial difficulties driven by the increased cost of living/evolving COVID-19 situation, ongoing scrutiny in ensuring transparency and fairness of pricing communications, increased expectation regarding fair customer treatment due to the introduction of the FCA's Consumer Duty in 2022, and ensuring victims of Authorised Push Payment Fraud receive fair outcomes.",

        "page_content": "## Measurement\n\nTo articulate its conduct risk appetite, the Group has sought more granularity through the use of suitable Conduct Risk Appetite Metrics (CRAMs) and tolerances that indicate where it may be operating outside its conduct risk appetite.\n\nCRAMs have been designed for services and products offered by the Group and are measured by a consistent set of common metrics. These contain a range of product design, sales and process metrics (including outcome testing outputs) to provide a more holistic view of conduct risks; some products also have a suite of additional bespoke metrics.\n\nEach of the tolerances for the metrics are agreed for the individual product or service and are regularly tracked. At a consolidated level these metrics are part of the Board risk appetite. The Group has, and continues to, evolve its approach to conduct risk measurements, to include emerging conduct themes.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes a range of mitigating actions with respect to conduct risk and remains focused on delivering a leading customer experience.\n\nAll three retail brands have now received Accessibility Standards accreditation from the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute in recognition of the Group's work to make services more accessible for customers with mental health problems. The Group's ongoing commitment to fair customer outcomes sets the tone from the top and supports the development of our values-led culture with customers at the heart, strengthening links between actions to support conduct, culture and customer and enabling more effective control management. Actions to encourage good conduct include:\n\n- \u00b7 Simplified and enhanced conduct policies and procedures in place to ensure appropriate controls and processes that deliver fair customer outcomes, and support market integrity and competition requirements\n- \u00b7 Conduct risk appetite established at Group and business area level, with metrics included in the Group risk appetite to ensure ongoing focus\n- \u00b7 Customer needs considered through divisional customer plans, with integral conduct lens\n- \u00b7 Continuous embedding of the customer vulnerability framework aligned with the FCA guidance on fair treatment of vulnerable customers launched in January 2021. Development and continued oversight of the implementation of the vulnerability strategy continues through the Group Customer Vulnerability Committee (GCVC) operating at a senior level to prioritise change, drive implementation and ensure consistency across the Group\n- \u00b7 Cultural transformation: achieving a values-led culture through a consistent focus on behaviours to ensure the Group is transforming its culture for success in a digital world. This is supported by strong direction and tone from senior executives and the Board\n- \u00b7 Robust product governance framework to ensure products continue to offer customers fair value, and consistently meet their needs throughout their product lifecycle\n- \u00b7 Review and oversight of thematic conduct agenda items at senior committees, ensuring holistic consideration of key Group-wide conduct risks\n- \u00b7 Effective complaints management through responding to, and learning from, root causes of complaint volumes and Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) change rates\n- \u00b7 Robust recruitment and training, with a continued focus on how the Group manages colleagues' performance with clear customer accountabilities\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and testing of customer outcomes to ensure the Group delivers fair outcomes for customers throughout the product and service lifecycle, and make continuous improvements to products, services and processes\n- \u00b7 Ongoing engagement with third parties involved in serving the Group's customers to ensure consistent delivery\n- \u00b7 Continued focus on market conduct and member of the Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities Markets Standard Board and committed to conducting its market activities consistent with the principles of the UK Money Markets code, the Global Precious Metals Code and the FX Global Code\n- \u00b7 Continued focus on proactive identification and mitigation of conduct risk in the Group's strategy\n- \u00b7 Adoption of robust change delivery methodology to enable prioritisation and delivery of initiatives to address conduct challenges\n\n- \u00b7 Active engagement with regulatory bodies and other stakeholders to develop understanding of concerns related to customer treatment, effective competition and market integrity, to ensure that the Group's strategic conduct focus continues to meet evolving stakeholder expectations\n- \u00b7 The Group closely monitors the outcomes of business banking customers, particularly those with COVID-19 response products (BBLS, CBILS) to ensure the appropriate support is in place\n\n## Monitoring\n\nConduct risk is governed through divisional risk committees and significant issues are escalated to the Group Risk Committee, in accordance with the Group's enterprise risk management framework, as well as through the monthly Consolidated Risk Report. Risk exposures are discussed at divisional risk committees, where oversight, challenge and reporting are completed to assess the effectiveness of controls. Remedial action is recommended, if required. All material conduct risk events are escalated in accordance with the Group operational risk policy to the respective Business Managing Director/Head of Business.\n\nA number of activities support the close monitoring of conduct risk including:\n\n- \u00b7 Second line oversight activities\n- \u00b7 The use of CRAMs across the Group, with a clear escalation route to Board\n- \u00b7 Horizon scanning\n\n## Data risk\n\n## Definition\n\nData risk is defined as the risk of the Group failing to effectively govern, manage and control its data (including data processed by third party suppliers), leading to unethical decisions, poor customer outcomes, loss of value to the Group and mistrust.\n\n## Exposures\n\nData risk is present in all aspects of the business where data is processed, both within the Group and by third parties including colleague and contractor, prospective and existing customer lifecycle and insight processes. Data risk manifests:\n\n- \u00b7 When data quality (accuracy, completeness, consistency, uniqueness, validity and timeliness) is not managed, resulting in data used in systems, processes and products not being fit for the intended purpose\n- \u00b7 When personal data is not gathered legally, for a legitimate purpose, or is not managed or protected from misuse and/or processed in a way that complies with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and other data privacy regulatory obligations\n- \u00b7 When data records are not created, retained, protected, destroyed, or retrieved appropriately\n- \u00b7 When data standards are not maintained across core data, data management risks are not managed and data-related issues are not remediated as a result of poor data management, resulting in inaccurate, incomplete data that is not available at the right time, to the right people, to enable business decisions to be made, and regulatory reporting requirements to be fulfilled\n- \u00b7 When data governance fails to provide robust oversight of data decision-making and the control mechanisms to ensure strategies and management instructions are implemented effectively\n- \u00b7 When critical data mapping and data information standards are not followed, impacting compliance, traceability and understanding of data\n\n## Measurement\n\nData risk is measured through a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators, aligned to key sources of data risk for the Group covering data governance, data management and data privacy and ethics. In addition to risk appetite measures and limits, data risks and controls are monitored and governed through Group and sub-group committees on a regular basis. Significant issues are escalated to the Group Risk Committee.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## Mitigation\n\nData risk is a key component of the Group's enterprise risk management framework, where the focus is on the end-to-end management of data risk. This ensures that risks are identified, assessed, managed, monitored and reported using the risk and control self-assessment process.\n\nInvestment continues to be made to enhance the maturity of data risk management. Examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 Enhancing data quality, capability and awareness in data management and privacy\n- \u00b7 Delivering a data strategy and data risk and control library to ensure data risks are managed within appetite\n- \u00b7 Enhancing assurance of suppliers\n- \u00b7 Embedding data by design and ethics principles into the data science lifecycle and progressing opportunities to simplify the completion of privacy records impact assessments\n- \u00b7 Delivering enhanced controls and processes for data retention and destruction, deleting large volumes of historic over-retained data\n\n## Monitoring\n\nData risk is governed through Group and sub-group committees and significant issues are escalated to Group Risk Committee, in accordance with the Group's enterprise risk management framework. Risk exposures are discussed at Group and sub-group committees, where oversight, challenge and reporting are completed to assess the effectiveness of controls and agree remedial actions. All material data risk events are escalated in accordance with the Group operational risk policy and data risk policies and, where personal data is concerned, the Group Data Protection Officer. In addition, Group-wide data risk issues and the top data risks that the Group faces are discussed at the Data Cross Divisional Committee and Group Data Committee.\n\nA number of activities support the close monitoring of data risk, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Design and monitoring of data risk appetite metrics, including key risk indicators and key performance indicators\n- \u00b7 Implementation of the data risk and control library to ensure greater coverage and insight of data risk, and ensuring data risks are managed within appetite\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and reporting of progress against the Data Capability Assessment Model\n- \u00b7 Identification and mitigation of data risk when planning and implementing transformation or business change\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of significant data-related issues, complaints, events and breaches\n- \u00b7 Implementation of controls to mitigate data risk, including data privacy, ethics, data management and records management\n- \u00b7 Horizon scanning for changes in the external environment, including, but not limited to, changes to laws, rules and regulations; for example, arising from the UK's exit from the EU and ensuring data flows remain effective\n- \u00b7 Effective monitoring and testing of compliance with data privacy and data management regulatory requirements. For example GDPR and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS 239) requirements\n\n## People risk\n\n## Definition\n\nPeople risk is defined as the risk that the Group fails to provide an appropriate colleague and customer-centric culture, supported by robust reward and wellbeing policies and processes; effective leadership to manage colleague resources; effective talent and succession management; and robust control to ensure all colleague-related requirements are met.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group's management of material people risks is critical to its capacity to deliver against its strategic objectives, particularly in the context of organisational, political and external market change and increasing digitisation. The Group is exposed to the following key people risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Non- inclusive culture, ineffective leadership, poor communication, weak performance, inappropriate remuneration policies and poor colleague conduct\n- \u00b7 Failure to recruit, develop and retain a diverse workforce, with the appropriate mix and required level of skills and capabilities to meet the current and future needs of the Group\n- \u00b7 Ineffective succession planning or failure to identify appropriate talent pipeline\n- \u00b7 Failure to manage capacity, colleagues having excessive demands placed on them resulting in wellbeing issues and business objectives not being met\n- \u00b7 Failure to meet all colleague-related legal and regulatory requirements\n- \u00b7 The increasing digitisation of the business is changing the capability mix required and may impact the Group's ability to attract and retain talent\n- \u00b7 Inadequately designed people processes that are not resilient to withstand unexpected events\n- \u00b7 Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR) and additional regulatory constraints on remuneration structures may impact the Group's ability to attract and retain talent\n- \u00b7 Colleague engagement may be challenged by a number of factors ranging from adjustment to new ways of working, dissatisfaction with reward; and ongoing media attention on culture within the banking sector\n\n## Measurement\n\nPeople risk is measured through a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators, aligned to key sources of people risk for the Group such as succession, diversity, retention, colleague engagement and wellbeing. In addition to risk appetite measures and limits, people risks and controls are monitored on a monthly basis via the Group's risk governance framework and reporting structures.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group takes many mitigating actions with respect to people risk. Key areas of focus include:\n\n- \u00b7 Continued focus on the Group's culture and inclusivity strategy by developing and delivering initiatives that reinforce the appropriate behaviours which generate the best possible long-term outcomes for customers and colleagues\n- \u00b7 Focusing on leadership and colleague engagement, through delivery of strategies to attract, retain and develop high calibre people together with implementation of rigorous succession planning\n- \u00b7 Managing organisational capability and capacity through divisional people strategies to ensure there are the right skills and resources to meet customers' needs and deliver the Group's strategic plan\n- \u00b7 Ensuring colleague wellbeing strategies and support are in place to meet colleague needs, and that the skills and capability growth required to maximise the potential of our people\n- \u00b7 Maintaining effective remuneration arrangements to ensure they promote an appropriate culture and colleague behaviours that meet customer needs and regulatory expectations\n- \u00b7 Ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements related to SM&CR, embedding compliant and appropriate colleague behaviours in line with Group policies, values and its people risk priorities\n- \u00b7 Reviewing and enhancing people processes to ensure they are fit for purpose and operationally resilient\n- \u00b7 Ongoing consultation with the Group's recognised unions on changes which impact their members\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMonitoring and reporting is undertaken at Board, Group, entity and divisional committees. Key people risk metrics are reported and discussed monthly at the Group People Risk Committee with escalation to Group Risk and Executive Committees and the Board where required.\n\nAll material people risk events are escalated in accordance with the Group operational risk policy.\n\n## Operational resilience risk Definition\n\nOperational resilience risk is defined as the risk that the Group fails to design resilience into business operations, underlying infrastructure and controls (people, process, technology) so that it is able to withstand external or internal events which could impact the continuation of operations, and fails to respond in a way which meets customer and stakeholder expectations and needs when the continuity of operations is compromised.\n\n## Exposures\n\nIneffective operational resilience risk management could lead to vital services not being available to customers, and in extreme circumstances, bank failure could result. The Group has in place a transparent and effective operating model to identify and monitor critical business processes from a customer, Group and financial industry perspective. The failure to adequately build resilience into a critical business process may occur in a variety of ways, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group not having an adequate succession plan in place for designated subject matter experts\n- \u00b7 The Group being overly reliant on one location to deliver a critical business process",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 The Group being overly reliant on a supplier which fails to provide a service\n- \u00b7 The Group failing to upgrade its IT systems and leaving them vulnerable to failure\n- \u00b7 A weakness in the Group's cyber or security defences leaving it vulnerable to an attack\n\nEffective operational resilience ensures the Group designs resilience into its systems, is able to withstand and/or recover from a significant unexpected event occurring and can continue to provide services to its customers. A significant outage could result in customers being unable to access accounts or conduct transactions, which as well as presenting significant reputational risk for the Group would negatively impact the Group's purpose. Operational resilience is also an area of continued regulatory and industry focus, similar in importance to financial resilience.\n\nFailure to manage operational resilience effectively could impact the following other risk categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Operational risk: being unable to safely provide customers with business services\n- \u00b7 Regulatory compliance: non-compliance with new/existing operational resilience regulations, for example, through failure to identify emerging regulation or not embedding regulatory requirements within the Group's policies, processes and procedures or identify further future emerging regulation\n- \u00b7 Conduct risk: an operational resilience failure may render the Group liable to fines from the FCA for poor conduct\n- \u00b7 Market risk: the Group being unable to provide key services could have ramifications for the wider market and could impact share price\n\n## Measurement\n\nOperational resilience risk is managed across the Group through the Group's enterprise risk management framework and operational risk policies. Board risk appetite metrics for operational resilience are in place and are well understood. These specific measures are subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting, including a mandatory review of thresholds on at least an annual basis. To strengthen the management of operational resilience risk, the Group mobilised an operational resilience enhancement programme which is designed to focus on end-to-end resilience and the management of key risks to critical processes.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group has increased its focus on operational resilience and has updated its operational resilience strategy to reflect changing priorities of both customers and regulators. Furthermore, the Group is in the process of responding to the publication of regulatory policy statements. Focus has been given to ensure compliance, and further consideration to how the existing framework will be adapted including consideration of important business services and impact tolerances. At the core of its approach to operational resilience are the Group's critical business processes which drive all activity, including further mapping of the processes to identify any additional resilience requirements such as impact tolerances in the event of a service outage. The Group continues to maintain and develop playbooks that guide its response to a range of interruptions from internal and external threats and tests these through scenario-based testing and exercising.\n\nThe Group's new strategy considers the changing risk management requirements, adapting the change delivery model to be more agile and develop the people skills and capabilities needed. The Group continues to review and invest in its control environment to ensure it addresses the risks it faces. Risks are reported and discussed at local governance forums and escalated to executive management and the Board as appropriate. The Group employs a range of risk management strategies, including: avoidance, mitigation, transfer (including insurance) and acceptance. Where there is a reliance on third-party suppliers to provide services, the Group's sourcing policy ensures that outsourcing initiatives follow a defined process including due diligence, risk evaluation and ongoing assurance.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, business continuity plans have continued to prove resilient, with particular attention applied to heightened risks in the supply chain.\n\nMitigating actions to the principal operational resilience risk are:\n\nCyber: the threat landscape associated with cyber risk continues to evolve and there is significant regulatory attention on this subject. The Board continues to invest heavily to protect the Group from cyber-attacks. Investment continues to focus on improving the Group's approach to identity and access management, improving capability to detect and respond to cyber-attacks and improved ability to manage vulnerabilities across the estate. With effect from 1 January 2021, the Group has entered into a cyber insurance policy, which provides cover for specified information security risks.\n\nIT resilience: the Group continues to optimise its approach to IT and operational resilience by investing in technology improvements and enhancing the resilience of systems that support the Group's critical business processes, primarily through the technology resilience programme, with independent verification of progress on an annual basis. The Board recognises the role that resilient technology plays in maintaining banking services across the wider industry. As such, the Board dedicates considerable time and focus to this subject at both the Board and the Board Risk Committee, and continues to sponsor key investment programmes that enhance resilience.\n\nPeople: the Group acknowledges the risks associated to the failure to maintain appropriately skilled and available colleagues. The Group continues to optimise its approach to ensure that, where applicable, colleagues are capable of supporting a critical business process. Key controls and processes are regularly reported to committee(s) and alignment with the Group's strategy is closely monitored.\n\nProperty: the Group's property portfolio remains a key focus in ensuring resilience requirements are appropriately maintained. Processes are in place to identify key buildings where a critical business process is performed. Depending on criticality, a number of mitigating controls are in place to manage the risk of severe critical business process disruption. The Group remains committed to investment in the upkeep of the property portfolio, primarily through the Group property upkeep investment programme.\n\nSourcing: the threat landscape associated with third-party suppliers and the critical services they provide continues to receive a significant amount of regulatory attention. The Group acknowledges the importance of demonstrating control and responsibility for those critical business services which could cause significant harm to the Group's customers. The Group segments its suppliers by criticality and has processes in place to support ongoing vendor management.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMonitoring and reporting of operational resilience risk is undertaken at Board, Group, entity and divisional committees. Each committee monitors key risks, control effectiveness, key risk and control indicators, events, operational losses, risk appetite metrics and the results of independent testing conducted by the Risk division and/or Group Internal Audit.\n\nThe Group maintains a formal approach to operational resilience risk event escalation, whereby material events are identified, captured and escalated. Root causes are determined, and action plans put in place to ensure an optimum level of control to keep customers and the business safe, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.\n\n## Operational risk\n\n## Definition\n\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe principal operational risks to the Group which could result in customer detriment, unfair customer outcomes, financial loss, disruption and/or reputational damage are:\n\n- \u00b7 Failure of IT systems, due to volume of change, and/or aged infrastructure\n- \u00b7 A cyber-attack\n- \u00b7 Internal and/or external economic crime\n- \u00b7 Failure to ensure compliance with increasingly complex and detailed regulation including anti-money laundering, anti-bribery, counter-terrorist financing, and financial sanctions and prohibitions laws and regulations\n\nA number of these risks could increase where there is a reliance on thirdparty suppliers to provide services to the Group or its customers.",

Pillar II is calculated using internal and external loss data and extreme but plausible scenarios that may occur in the next 12 months.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group continues to focus on changing risk management requirements, adapting the change delivery model to be more agile and developing the people skills and capabilities needed. Risks are reported and discussed at local governance forums and escalated to executive management and the Board as appropriate to ensure the correct level of visibility and engagement. The Group employs a range of risk management strategies, including: avoidance, mitigation, transfer (including insurance) and acceptance. Where there is a reliance on third-party suppliers to provide services, the Group's sourcing policy ensures that outsourcing initiatives follow a defined process including due diligence, risk evaluation and ongoing assurance.\n\nMitigating actions to the principal operational risks are:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group adopts a risk-based approach to mitigate the internal and external fraud risks it faces, reflecting the current and emerging fraud risks within the market. Fraud risk appetite metrics holistically cover the impacts of fraud in terms of losses to the Group, costs of fraud systems and operations, and customer experience of actual and attempted fraud. Oversight of the appropriateness and performance of these metrics is undertaken regularly through business area and Group-level committees. This approach drives a continual programme of prioritised enhancements to the Group's technology and process and peoplerelated controls; with an emphasis on preventative controls supported by real time detective controls wherever feasible. Group-wide policies and operational control frameworks are maintained and designed to provide customer confidence, protect the Group's commercial interests and reputation, comply with legal requirements and meet regulatory requirements. The Group's fraud awareness programme remains a key component of its fraud control environment, and awareness of fraud risk is supported by mandatory training for all colleagues. This is further strengthened by material annual investment into both technology and the personal development needs of colleagues. The Group also plays an active role with other financial institutions, industry bodies and law enforcement agencies in identifying and combatting fraud\n- \u00b7 The Group has adopted policies and procedures designed to detect and prevent the use of its banking network for money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, tax evasion, human trafficking, modern-day slavery and wildlife trafficking, and activities prohibited by legal and regulatory sanctions. Against a background of complex and detailed laws and regulations, and of continued criminal and terrorist activity, the Group regularly reviews and assesses its policies, procedures and organisational arrangements to keep them current, effective and consistent across markets and jurisdictions. The Group requires mandatory training on these topics for all employees. Specifically, the anti-money laundering procedures include 'know-your-customer' requirements, transaction monitoring technologies, reporting of suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing to the applicable regulatory authorities, and interaction between the Group's Financial Intelligence Unit and external agencies and other financial institutions. The Group economic crime prevention policy prohibits the payment, offer, acceptance or request of a bribe, including 'facilitation payments' by any employee or agent and provides a confidential reporting service for anonymous reporting of suspected or actual bribery activity. The Group economic crime prevention policy also sets out a framework of controls for compliance with legal and regulatory sanctions\n- \u00b7 In addition to its efforts internally, the Group also contributes to economic crime prevention by supporting and championing industry-level activity, including:\n- -  Working with the Lending Standards Board to improve customer outcomes related to Authorised Push Payment (APP) fraud. The Group remains a signatory to the industry code for APP fraud, which has improved customer protection and the reimbursement of funds to victims\n- -  Co-chairing the inaugural Public Private Threat Group with National Economic Crime Centre (NECC). This builds on the success of the Fusion Cell in 2020, which was established in response to the changing economic crime threat related to COVID-19\n- -  Maintaining partnerships with key partners such as City of London Police, Global Cyber Alliance and the North East Business Resilience Centre\n- -  Active membership of Stop Scams UK (SSUK), designed to stop scams at source by bringing together partnerships from various industry sectors. The Group is involved in a new SSUK pilot, Project 159, which aims to provide consumers with a secure connection to their bank\n\nOperational resilience risk, pages 188 to 189 , provides further information on the mitigating actions for cyber and IT resilience.",

        "page_content": "## Monitoring\n\nMonitoring and reporting of operational risk is undertaken at Board, Group, entity and divisional committees. Each committee monitors key risks, control effectiveness, key risk and control indicators, events, operational losses, risk appetite metrics and the results of independent testing conducted by the Risk division and/or Group Internal Audit.\n\nThe Group maintains a formal approach to operational risk event escalation, whereby material events are identified, captured and escalated. Root causes of events are determined, and action plans put in place to ensure an optimum level of control to keep customers and the business safe, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.\n\nThe insurance programme is monitored and reviewed regularly, with recommendations being made to the Group's senior management annually prior to each renewal. Insurers are monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure counterparty risk is minimised. A process is in place to manage any insurer rating changes or insolvencies.\n\n## Model risk\n\n## Definition\n\nModel risk is defined as the risk of financial loss, regulatory censure, reputational damage or customer detriment, as a result of deficiencies in the development, application or ongoing operation of models and rating systems.\n\nModels are defined as quantitative methods that process input data into quantitative outputs, or qualitative outputs (including ordinal letter output) which have a quantitative measure associated with them. Model governance policy is restricted to specific categories of application of models, principally financial risk, treasury and valuation, with certain exclusions, such as prescribed calculations and project appraisal calculations.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group makes extensive use of models. They perform a variety of functions including:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit decisioning, including fraud\n- \u00b7 Capital calculation\n- \u00b7 Pricing models\n- \u00b7 Stress testing and forecasting\n- \u00b7 Impairment calculation\n- \u00b7 Market risk measurement\n\nAs a result of the wide scope and breadth of coverage, there is exposure to model risk across a number of the Group's principal risk categories.\n\nModel risk remains above pre-pandemic levels. The effect of governmentled customer support schemes weakened relationships between model inputs and outputs, and there remains a reliance on the use of judgement, particularly in the areas for forecasting and impairment. However, recent months have seen more stable patterns for model outputs, and we expect model drivers to remain valid in the longer term.\n\nIn addition, in common with the rest of the industry, changes required to capital models following new regulations will create a temporary increase in the risk relating to these models during the period of transition. Further information on capital impacts are detailed in the capital risk section on pages 176 to 185 .\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Board risk appetite metric is the key component for measuring the Group's most material models; performance is reported monthly to the Group and Board Risk Committees.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe model risk management framework, established by and with continued oversight from an independent team in the Risk division, provides the foundation for managing and mitigating model risk within the Group. Accountability is cascaded from the Board and senior management via the Group enterprise risk management framework.\n\nThis provides the basis for the model governance policy, which defines the mandatory requirements for models across the Group, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Model materiality\n- \u00b7 The scope of models covered by the policy\n- \u00b7 Roles and responsibilities, including ownership, independent oversight and approval\n- \u00b7 Key principles and controls regarding data integrity, development, validation, implementation, ongoing maintenance and revalidation, monitoring, and the process for non-compliance\n\nThe model owner takes responsibility for ensuring the fitness for purpose of the models and rating systems, supported and challenged by the independent specialist Group function.\n\nThe above ensures all models in scope of policy, including those involved in regulatory capital calculation, are developed consistently and are of sufficient quality to support business decisions and meet regulatory requirements.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Group Model Governance Committee is the primary body for overseeing model risk. Policy requires that key performance indicators are monitored for every model to ensure they remain fit for purpose and all issues are escalated appropriately. Material model issues are reported to the Group and Board Risk Committees monthly, with more detailed papers as necessary to focus on key issues.\n\n## Regulatory and legal risk\n\n## Definition\n\nRegulatory and legal risk is defined as the risk of financial penalties, regulatory censure, criminal or civil enforcement action or customer detriment as a result of failure to identify, assess, correctly interpret, comply with, or manage regulatory and/or legal requirements.\n\n## Exposures\n\nThe Group has a zero risk appetite for material legal or regulatory breaches. However, due to the wide scope and breadth of its regulatory permissions, the Group remains exposed to the evolving UK legal and regulatory landscape, such as changes to the Regulatory Framework due to the UK's exit from the EU and other changing regulatory standards as well as uncertainty arising from the current and future litigation landscape.\n\n## Measurement\n\nRegulatory and legal risks are measured against a defined risk appetite metric, which is an assessment of material regulatory breaches and material legal incidents.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe Group undertakes a range of key mitigating actions to manage regulatory and legal risk. These include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Group policies and procedures set out the principles and key controls that should apply across the business which are aligned to the Group risk appetite. Mandated policies and processes require appropriate control frameworks, management information, standards and colleague training to be implemented to identify and manage regulatory and legal risk\n- \u00b7 The Board has established a Group-wide risk appetite and metric for regulatory and legal risk\n- \u00b7 Business units identify, assess and implement policy and regulatory requirements and establish local controls, processes, procedures and resources to ensure appropriate governance and compliance\n- \u00b7 Risk and Legal departments provide oversight, proactive support and constructive challenge to the business in identifying and managing regulatory and legal issues\n- \u00b7 Business units regularly produce management information to assist in the identification of issues and test management controls are working effectively\n- \u00b7 Risk division conducts thematic reviews of regulatory compliance and provides oversight of regulatory compliance assessments across businesses and divisions where appropriate\n- \u00b7 The Group engages with regulatory authorities and industry bodies on forthcoming regulatory changes, market reviews and investigations, ensuring programmes are established to deliver new regulation and legislation\n- \u00b7 Business units, with the support of divisional and Group-level teams, conduct ongoing horizon scanning to identify and address changes in regulatory and legal requirements\n- \u00b7 The Group has adapted quickly to evolving regulatory expectations during the COVID-19 pandemic and has engaged with regulatory authorities throughout\n\n## Monitoring\n\nMaterial risks are managed through the relevant divisional-level committees, with review and escalation through Group-level committees where appropriate, including the escalation of any material regulatory breaches or material legal incidents.",

Customer, shareholder and employee expectations continue to evolve and current societal trends are being accelerated following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStrategic risks can manifest themselves in existing principal risks or as new exposures which could adversely impact the Group and its businesses.\n\nIn considering strategic risks, a key focus is the interconnectivity of individual risks and the cumulative effect of different risks on the Group's overall risk profile.\n\nThe Group has invested in implementing a robust framework for the identification, assessment and quantification of strategic risks and their incorporation into business planning and strategic investment decisions. With Board support, the Group will continue to invest in evolving the strategic risk management framework and embedding it into the Group's day-to-day business operations.\n\nFurther information on strategic risk drivers and their potential risk implications is outlined in the risk overview on pages 37 and 43 .\n\n## Measurement\n\nThe Group assesses and monitors strategic risk implications as part of business planning and in its day-to-day activities, ensuring they respond appropriately to internal and external factors including changes to regulatory, macroeconomic and competitive environments. An assessment is made of the key strategic risks that are considered to impact the Group, leveraging internal and external information and the key mitigants or actions that could be taken in response.\n\n2021 saw development of the Group's quantitative risk assessment approach, assessing the:\n\n- \u00b7 Time horizons in respect of the crystallisation of impacts, should risks manifest\n- \u00b7 Connectivity of inherent risks, which can magnify their impact and severity\n\n## Mitigation\n\nThe range of mitigating actions includes the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's business planning processes include formal assessment of the strategic risk implications of new business, product entries and other strategic initiatives\n- \u00b7 Horizon scanning is conducted across the Group to identify potential threats, risks, emerging issues and opportunities and to explore future trends\n- \u00b7 The Group's governance framework mandates individuals' and committees' responsibilities and decision-making rights, to ensure that strategic risks are appropriately reported and escalated\n\n## Monitoring\n\nA review of the Group's strategic risks is undertaken on an annual basis and the findings are reported to the Group and Board Risk Committees.\n\nRisks, alongside their control effectiveness, are articulated and reported regularly to Group and Board Risk Committees.\n\n## Climate risk\n\n## Definition\n\nClimate risk is defined as the risk that the Group experiences losses and/ or reputational damage as a result of physical events, transition risk, or as a consequence of the responses to managing these changes, either directly or through our customers.\n\n## Exposures\n\nClimate risk can arise from:\n\n- \u00b7 Transition risks - changes associated with the move towards a low carbon economy, including changes to policy, legislation and regulation, technology and changes to customer preferences; or legal risks from failing to manage these changes\n- \u00b7 Physical risks - changes in climate or weather patterns which are acute, event driven (e.g. flood or storms), or chronic, longer-term shifts (e.g. rising sea levels or droughts)\n\nClimate risk manifests through, and has the potential to impact, the Group's existing principal financial and non-financial risks. The Group has adopted a comprehensive approach to embedding climate risk into its enterprise risk management framework, establishing climate risk as its own principal risk, as well as its integration into our existing principal risks.\n\nThe Group has undertaken an analysis of the main physical and transition risk which may impact the Group and our customers, as well as how these may impact across the different principal risks within the Group's enterprise risk management framework. For further information see page 55 in the 2021 Lloyds Banking Group Climate Report.\n\nThe Group has identified loans and advances to customers in sectors at increased risk from the impacts of climate change, see page 59 in the 2021 Lloyds Banking Group Climate Report.\n\n## Measurement\n\nIn order to identify the main physical and transition risks which could impact the Group, a number of workshops have been held with subject matter experts across the divisions and Risk division. These workshops have taken into account the sectors most exposed to the risks from climate change and also the impacts across the other principal risks in the Group's enterprise risk management framework. These outputs have been used to establish the key risks impacting the Group to inform where updates are required to the Group's risk management processes to ensure suitable management of climate risk.\n\nThe Group is continuing to develop a number of metrics to track key areas of climate risk across its main portfolios. In Commercial Banking, the Group has continued to enhance our internal climate risk assessment methodologies and tools to assess the physical and transition risks relevant to our clients, developing and launching a bespoke qualitative climate risk assessment tool with a focus on transition risks and readiness, which will be completed at least annually as part of regular client engagements for our large corporate portfolio.\n\nInitial consideration of climate risks was included within the Group's financial planning process, considering the key impacts for the Group across key business areas where detailed sector reviews have been undertaken.\n\nThe Group has continued to develop its scenario modelling capabilities and is participating in the Bank of England's Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario on the Financial Risks for Climate Change. Commentary on climate-related risks was included in the Group's annual Individual Capital Adequacy Assessment Process. Work continues to improve our scenario analysis capabilities and other analytical tools.",

        "page_content": "## Mitigation\n\nIn 2021, the Group climate risk policy was established to provide an overarching framework for the management of climate risks, intended to support appropriate consideration of climate risks across key activities. The policy also supports the Group's climate-related external ambitions and progress against the relevant regulatory requirements, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.\n\nThe Group is continuing to integrate consideration of climate risk as part of its activity and processes for managing other principal risks in our enterprise risk management framework. As part of the Group's credit risk policy, we have mandatory requirements to consider environmental risks in key risk management activities. In Commercial Banking, Relationship Managers must ensure that climate risk is considered for all new and renewal facilities, and specifically commented on for customers who bank with us where total limits exceed \u00a3500,000 (excluding automated renewal process). In Retail, the Group's credit risk policies require due regard to be paid to energy efficiency (EPC controls) and physical risks (such as flood assessments) in our mortgages business, and transition risks (pace and growth of electric vehicles) within our motor portfolio. Within our General Insurance business, given the short-term nature of home insurance policies the Group is able to review our risks regularly, and change our approach as risks develop to mitigate long-term exposure of climate risk.\n\nThe Group has undertaken sector deep dives where we have lending to customers in sectors at increased risk from the impacts of climate change, considering both risks and opportunities as we look to support our customers' responses to climate change.\n\nThe Group has twelve external sector statements that help articulate appropriate areas of climate-related risk appetite and the Group's approach to the risk assessment of its customers. The Group is continuing to refine and enhance these statements.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nGovernance for climate risk is embedded into the Group's existing governance structure and is complementary to governance of the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\nClimate risk is included as part of regular risk reporting to the Board. This is currently focused on a qualitative assessment against external expectations and the Group's external commitments. A Board-approved risk appetite statement for climate risk is also in place, supported by an initial metric to ensure the Group continues to progress activities at pace.\n\nThe Group is continuing to develop its approach to measuring and monitoring climate risk and will enhance reporting going forward as understanding and capabilities increase, which will also be used to set further quantitative and qualitative risk appetite metrics as appropriate.",

We undertook a number of transitional procedures to prepare for the audit including establishing our independence from the Group which involved ceasing a number of commercial relationships and banking arrangements and changing the financial arrangements for our partners and over 3,000 staff who are in the audit division at Deloitte, or who work on the LBG audit. We used the time prior to commencing our audit to meet with Group leadership and non-executive directors to gain an understanding of the business, its issues and the environment in which it operates.\n\nWe became independent of the Group and commenced our audit planning on 1 January 2020. From that date we attended all Audit Committee meetings, initially in an observer capacity, and continued to meet regularly with Group leadership, non-executive directors and the Group's main regulators. We worked alongside the former auditor, reviewed their working papers and shadowed some of their meetings to gain an understanding of the Group's processes, their audit risk assessment, and the controls on which they relied for the purposes of issuing their audit opinion.\n\nThroughout 2020 we held regular meetings of audit partners and senior staff who would be responsible for undertaking the audits in the most significant components of the Group. The main purpose of these meetings were to outline our audit approach, including discussing possible significant audit risks, the use of analytics in assessing significant and non-significant risks, to discuss testing approaches, and to brief our teams on the Group's key processes, systems and structure. During these meetings, we also heard directly from the Group on the changes impacting the business to inform our audit planning and risk assessment.\n\n- \u00b7 Balance sheet as at 31 December 2021;\n- \u00b7 Cash flow statement; and\n- \u00b7 Statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;\n- \u00b7 Notes 1 to 14 to the financial statements, which include the accounting principles and policies.",

Our audit approach can be summarised into the following areas that enabled us to obtain the evidence required to form an opinion on the Group and Parent company financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Audit work executed at component level. We have identified components based on the Group's operating segments and their geographical location. The following components were subject to audit procedures; UK Banking, Insurance and Wealth, and an overseas component based in the US. The Group audit team was in active dialogue throughout the audit with the component audit teams responsible for the audit work. This included determining whether the work was planned and performed in accordance with the overall Group audit strategy and the requirements of our Group audit instructions to the components. Government work-from-home orders and travel restrictions in force during the year required our teams to work and communicate remotely. We were able to satisfy ourselves that our oversight and supervision was appropriate through increased videoconferencing, direct reviews of work completed within the UK, remote reviews over videoconferencing for work performed overseas, and we have continued to attend virtually the planning and clearance meetings of components to engage with local management;\n- \u00b7 Risk assessment and audit planning. We instructed partners for each of the Group's three components, as well as identifying partners to lead areas requiring significant audit judgement including expected credit losses, insurance actuarial assumptions, provisions for regulatory and litigation matters, and the valuation of certain complex and illiquid financial instruments. These partners met regularly with management to understand business strategy, accounting judgements and estimations and other matters which arose during the year that could have impacted the Group's financial reporting. Our risk assessment was further informed by detailed analytics as well as other quantitative and qualitative audit procedures, including consideration of matters such as the impact of the global pandemic and climate change on the account balances, disclosures and company practices;\n- \u00b7 Audit procedures undertaken at a Group level and on the Parent company. In addition to the above, we also performed audit work on the Group and Parent company financial statements, including the consolidation of the Group's results, the preparation of the financial statements, certain disclosures within the directors' remuneration report, litigation provisions and exposures in addition to the Group's entity level and oversight controls relevant to financial reporting. All components with either annual revenues, total assets, total liabilities or profit before tax greater than 5% of the Group were included in our audit scope. The components not covered by our audit scope are subject to analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement in the aggregated financial information;\n- \u00b7 The impact of climate change on our audit. In planning our audit, we have considered the impact of climate change on the Group's operations and subsequent impact on its financial statements. The Group sets out its assessment of the potential impact on page 192 of the Risk Management section of the Annual Report.\n- \u00b7 Internal controls testing approach. We tested internal controls over financial reporting where our scoping and risk assessment determined those controls to be relevant to the audit. This included testing of general IT controls, process level controls and entity level controls at the Group level; and\n\nIn conjunction with our climate risk specialists, we have held discussions with the Group to understand their:\n\n- -  process for identifying affected operations, including the governance and controls over this process, and the subsequent effect on the financial reporting for the Group; and\n- -  long-term strategy to respond to climate change risks as they evolve including the effect on the Group's forecasts.\n\nOur audit work has involved:\n\n- -  challenging the completeness of the physical and transition risks identified and considered in the Group's climate risk assessment and the conclusion that there is no material impact of climate change risk on the current year financial reporting;\n- -  assessing the Group's qualitative loan sector analysis, which supports the Group's conclusion that there is no material financial statement impact of climate risk on expected credit losses; and\n- -  assessing disclosures in the annual report, and challenging the consistency between the financial statements and the remainder of the annual report.\n\nWe have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of climate change disclosures set out at pages 35 to 36 in the Annual Report. As part of our audit procedures we are required to read and consider these disclosures to consider whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or knowledge obtained in the audit and we did not identify any material inconsistencies as a result of these procedures.\n\n## 4. Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group's and Parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 making enquiries of Group management about the assumptions, including climate risk considerations, used in their going concern models, and assessing the reasonableness of those assumptions and historical forecasting accuracy;\n- \u00b7 using our knowledge of the Group and Parent company, the financial services industry, the financial services regulatory environment and the general economic environment to identify inherent risks in the business model and how such risks might affect the financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 evaluating the Group's strategic plans, short and longer term financial budgets, funding, liquidity and capital adequacy plans including internal stress tests;\n- \u00b7 reading analyst reports, industry data, Bank of England reports and other external information to determine if it provided corroborative or contradictory evidence in relation to the Group's assumptions;\n- \u00b7 considering the Group's operational resilience;\n- \u00b7 reviewing correspondence and meeting with prudential and conduct regulators to assess whether there are any matters that may impact the going concern assessment;\n- \u00b7 evaluating the Group's disclosures on going concern against the requirements of IAS 1.\n- \u00b7 testing the underlying data generated to prepare the forecast scenarios and determined whether there was adequate support for the assumptions underlying the forecasts; and\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and Parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the reporting on how the Group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.",

Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit, and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Expected credit losses (Group)\n\nKey audit matter description\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\n## Refer to notes 2, 3, 13, 18 and 51 in the financial statements\n\nThe Group has recognised \u00a34.0 billion of expected credit losses ('ECL') at 31 December 2021. The determination of ECL  consists of a number of assumptions that require a high degree of judgement and involve complex impairment modelling. The key areas we identified as having the most significant level of management\n\njudgement were in respect of:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail ECL; and\n- \u00b7 Multiple Economic Scenarios (MES);\n- \u00b7 Commercial ECL.\n\n## Multiple economic scenarios\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses is required to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future outcomes.\n\nThe Group's economics team develops the future economic scenarios. Firstly, a base case forecast is produced based on a set of conditioning assumptions, which are designed to reflect the Group's best view of future events. A full distribution of economic scenarios around this base case is produced using a Monte Carlo simulation and scenarios within that distribution are ranked using estimated relationships with industrywide historical loss data.\n\nFour scenarios are derived from the distribution as averages of constituent modelled scenarios around the 15th, 75th and 95th percentiles of the distribution corresponding to an upside, a downside and a severe downside, respectively. The upside, the base case and the downside scenarios are weighted at 30% and the severe downside at 10%.\n\nThese four scenarios are then used as key assumptions in the determination of the ECL allowance.\n\nThe development of these multiple economic scenarios is inherently uncertain, highly complex, and requires significant judgement. The global pandemic has increased the uncertainty of the conditioning assumptions used to develop the base case and, to account for this, the Group have recognised an adjustment to their multiple economic scenarios model to account for the significant downside uncertainties.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 91 .\n\nWorking with our internal economic team and modelling specialists, we performed the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Challenged and evaluated economic forecasts in the base scenario such as the unemployment rate, House Price Index and Gross Domestic Product through comparison to an independent economic outlook, external analysts and market data;\n- \u00b7 Tested the controls over the generation of the multiple economic scenarios including those over the Group's governance processes to determine the base case, different scenarios and the weightings applied to each scenario;\n- \u00b7 Challenged and evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology applied to generate alternative macroeconomic scenarios, including associated weightings, and assumptions within;\n- \u00b7 Tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used by the model;\n- \u00b7 Tested whether the methodology has been appropriately reflected in the model code by producing an independent version of the model generating alternative macroeconomic scenarios and reconciling its outputs to the Group's model;\n- \u00b7 Performed a stand back assessment of the appropriateness of the weightings applied to each of the scenarios based on publicly available data; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the adequacy of disclosures in respect of significant judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty including macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nIn respect of the adjustment to the multiple economic scenarios model, we performed the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the quantification of the model adjustment; and\n- \u00b7 Tested the controls over review, challenge, and approval of this central adjustment;\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures of the adjustment, including the sensitivity analysis.",

The models use a number of significant judgments to calculate a probability weighted ECL estimate applying an appropriate probability of default, estimated exposure at default and taking account of collateral held or other loss mitigants, discounted using the effective interest rate. The key driver of the probability of default and, therefore, the staging of Commercial banking exposures is the credit risk rating. The determination of these credit risk ratings is performed on a counterparty basis for larger exposures by a credit officer and involves a high degree of judgement and consideration of multiple sources of information.\n\nTherefore, we focused our work on testing the credit risk ratings feeding the collective models and the appropriateness of the methodology.\n\nFor individual assessments of larger exposures in Stage 3, the significant judgements in determining provisions and where we focused our work are the:\n\n- \u00b7 probability assigned to each identified potential workout and restructuring scenario through the use of best/likely/worst case flags; and\n- \u00b7 completeness and appropriateness of the potential workout and restructuring scenarios identified;\n- \u00b7 valuation assumptions used in determining the workout and restructuring scenarios.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 91 .\n\nWe tested controls across the process to determine the ECL provisions including the following:\n\n- \u00b7 In-model adjustments (IMA) and post-model adjustments (PMA);\n- \u00b7 Model governance including model validation and monitoring;\n- \u00b7 Model assumptions;\n- \u00b7 Data accuracy and completeness.\n- \u00b7 The allocation of assets into stages; and\n\nWorking with our internal modelling specialists, our audit procedures over the key areas of estimation included:\n\n- -  assessed and challenged the appropriateness of modelling approach and assumptions used;\n- \u00b7 Model estimations, where we:\n- -  independently replicated the models for the most material portfolios and compared outputs of our instances of the models to the Group's;\n- -  evaluated whether other models operate in line with their specification through inspecting and re-running the model code designed by the Group;\n- -  assessed model performance by evaluating variations between observed data and model predictions;\n- -  developed an understanding and assessed model limitations and remedial actions; and\n- -  tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in model execution and calibration.\n- \u00b7 Allocation of assets into stages, where we:\n- -  evaluated the appropriateness of quantitative and qualitative criteria used for allocation into IFRS 9 stages;\n- -  tested the appropriateness of the stage allocation for a sample of exposures; and\n- -  tested the data used by models in assigning IFRS 9 stages and evaluated the appropriateness of the model logic used.\n- \u00b7 In-model and post-model adjustments where we:\n- -  challenged the methodology, approach and assumptions in developing IMAs and PMAs, and evaluated the Group's selection of approach for indications of bias;\n- -  tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used;\n- -  performed a recalculation of the IMAs and PMAs; and\n- -  evaluated the completeness of IMAs and PMAs based on our understanding of model and data limitations, including those highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \u00b7 Adequacy of disclosure where we:\n- -  assessed whether the disclosures appropriately address the uncertainty which exists in determining the ECL.\n\nWe tested the controls across the process to determine the ECL provisions including:\n\n- \u00b7 the allocation into stages, particularly the assessment of a significant change in credit risk;\n- \u00b7 the determination of credit risk ratings;\n- \u00b7 model governance and arithmetical accuracy of provision calculations;\n- \u00b7 recognition and calculation of post-model adjustments.\n- \u00b7 data accuracy and completeness; and\n\nWe performed the following audit procedures over:\n\n- -  Independently assessed the credit rating and tested whether a significant increase in credit risk had occurred to result in a stage 2 classification against IFRS 9 criteria;\n- \u00b7 Expected credit losses determined through impairment models:\n- -  Assessed and challenged the model methodologies, approach and assumptions, including those used in developing the IMAs and PMAs;\n- -  Tested the completeness and accuracy of data used; and\n- -  Performed a recalculation of the IFRS 9 collective provision.\n- \u00b7 Expected credit losses assessed individually:\n- -  Assessed the exposures to determine if they met the definition of credit impaired;\n- -  Performed independent assessments to determine the appropriateness of recovery scenarios and associated cash flows, including considerations of climate risks on recoveries;\n- -  Evaluated valuations, including the use of internal specialists for business valuations; and\n- -   Independently assessed and challenged the completeness of workout and restructuring scenarios identified and weightings applied.\n- \u00b7 Adequacy of disclosure where we:\n- -  assessed whether the disclosures appropriately address the uncertainty which exists in determining the ECL.",

The calculations are based on appropriate methodologies using reasonable modelled assumptions, including IMAs and PMAs addressing model shortcomings. Where control deficiencies were identified, particularly in data linkage to models, compensating controls were identified and operated effectively. Overall ECL levels are reasonable compared to peer benchmarking information, although we did identify some prudence in our assessment of some of the model adjustments.\n\n## Insurance actuarial assumptions (Group)\n\nKey audit matter description\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\n## Refer to notes 2, 3, 10, 23, 30 and 31 in the financial statements\n\nThe valuation of the Group's liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts ('insurance contract liabilities') and value of in-force asset ('VIF') involves complex and subjective judgements about future events, both internal and external to the business, which are inherently uncertain.\n\nThe Group's insurance contract liabilities and value of in-force asset were \u00a3123.4bn and \u00a35.5bn respectively. As such, small changes in these assumptions can, individually and in combination, result in a material impact to the valuation of these balances and therefore, a material impact to the Group's profit for the period.\n\nIn particular, the following key judgements and estimations are significant to the valuation of the Group's insurance contract liabilities and VIF:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintenance expense assumptions and associated provisions, reflecting the expected cost of maintaining policies until maturity;\n- \u00b7 Base mortality rates and mortality improvements used for annuities, reflecting the expectation of how long an annuity policyholder will live and how that might change over time;\n- \u00b7 Persistency assumptions and provisions, reflecting the expected retention of policies over time for Workplace Pensions business;\n- \u00b7 Illiquidity Premium, used in the calculation of the risk-discount rate for the VIF on annuities.\n- \u00b7 Credit default assumptions, used in the Valuation Interest Rate for annuities; and\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 92 .\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe identified control deficiencies over the extraction of policyholder data, which impacted the controls over data used in the experience studies for the setting of the mortality and persistency assumptions set out above. These controls were remediated during the year and our testing of the remediated controls concluded that they were appropriately designed and implemented by the year-end.\n\nWe are satisfied that the actuarial assumptions are individually reasonable, and the aggregate impact of these judgements on the overall valuation of the insurance contract liabilities and VIF is reasonable.\n\nWe tested controls over the Group's processes over the insurance actuarial assumptions including:\n\n- \u00b7 each key assumption;\n- \u00b7 modelling methodologies used.\n- \u00b7 data underlying each key assumption; and\n\nWe utilised our actuarial specialists to support our testing of the following key assumptions as set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 Base mortality rates and mortality improvements used for annuities, where we: -  tested the data used in the assumption setting process;\n- -  challenged base mortality assumptions and tested underlying experience investigations, including independent replication of a sample of experience studies;\n- -  challenged the approach to setting long term rates of mortality improvement through benchmarking against peers, taking into account specific features of the Group's annuity policyholders (including any adjustments for socio-economic groups); and\n- -  challenged expert judgements made, including choice of model parameterisation and judgements made regarding experience over the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \u00b7 Maintenance expenses and persistency assumptions and provisions, where we:\n- -  tested the data used in the assumption setting process, re-performing key calculations; and\n- -  challenged the expert judgements used in setting these assumptions and provisions, including the recent and expected future impact of COVID-19 on Workplace Pensions lapse rates, as well as the treatment of expenses associated with the Group's cost allocation process and future administration system migrations.\n- \u00b7 Credit default adjustment and Illiquidity Premium, where we:\n- -  assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used to set these assumptions;\n- -  tested the implementation of this methodology, through the development of our own replication tool; and\n- -  tested the data and assumptions used in the calculations of the assumptions.",

The valuation of these loans uses complex valuation models as they are without readily determinable market values and were valued using significant unobservable inputs, such as loan to bond premium and calibration spread that involved considerable judgment by management.\n\nWe also consider these judgements to be at risk of management bias, giving rise to a potential risk of fraud.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe are satisfied that the valuation of these certain complex and illiquid financial instruments is reasonable and in accordance with IFRS 13.\n\n## Regulatory and litigation matters (Group)\n\n## Key audit matter description\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\n## Refer to notes 2, 3 and 36 in the financial statements.\n\nThe Group operates in an environment where it is subject to regulatory investigations, litigation and customer remediation.

Their valuation is determined with reference to key actuarial assumptions including mortality assumptions, discount rates and inflation rates. Due to the size of these schemes, small changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the value of the defined benefit obligation and therefore, the assessment of these assumptions are a key judgement.\n\nThis key audit matter is discussed in the Audit Committee's report on page 92 .\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe are satisfied that the Group's judgements in relation to the actuarial assumptions were reasonable.\n\n## IT systems that impact financial reporting (Group and Parent company)\n\n## Key audit matter description\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\nThe Group's IT environment is inherently complex as it supports a broad range of banking and insurance products and facilitates the processing of a significant volume of transactions.\n\nThe IT systems within the Group form a critical component of the Group's financial reporting activities and impact all account balances with a reliance on automated and IT dependent manual controls. Due to the significant reliance on IT systems, effective General IT Controls (GITCs) are critical to allow reliance to be placed on the completeness and accuracy of financial data and the integrity of automated system functionality (e.g. system calculations).\n\nWe identified the IT systems that impact financial reporting as a key audit matter because of the:\n\n- \u00b7 Reliance on technology which continues to develop in line with the business strategy, such as the increase in the use of automation across the Group and increasing reliance on third parties; and\n- \u00b7 Pervasive reliance on complex technology that is integral to the operation of key business processes and financial reporting;\n- \u00b7 Importance of the IT controls in maintaining an effective control environment. A key interdependency exists between the ability to rely on IT controls and the ability to rely on financial data, system configured automated controls and system reports.\n\nIT controls, in the context of our audit scope, primarily relate to privileged access at the infrastructure level, user access security at the application level and change control.\n\nIT systems which impact financial reporting are discussed in the Audit Committee report on page 92 .\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nIT control deficiencies were identified in respect of privileged user access to IT infrastructure and in application user access management. The existence of these deficiencies in the year resulted in an increased risk in relation to data, reports and automated system functionality from the affected systems.\n\nHowever, overall, in combination with business mitigating controls, we are satisfied that the Group's overall IT control environment appropriately supports the financial reporting process.\n\nOur IT audit scope tested the Group's IT controls over information systems deemed relevant to the audit based on the financial data, system configured automated controls and/or key financial reports that reside within it.\n\nWe used IT specialists to support our evaluation of the risks associated with IT in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Key financial reports and system configured automated controls; and\n- \u00b7 General IT Controls, including user access and change management controls;\n- \u00b7 Cyber security risk assessment.\n\nWhere deficiencies in the IT control environment were identified, our risk assessment procedures included an assessment of those deficiencies to determine the impact on our audit plan. Where relevant, the audit plan was adjusted to mitigate the unaddressed IT risk.\n\nWhere we were able to identify and test appropriate mitigating controls over affected financial statement line items, our testing approach remained unchanged.\n\nIn a limited number of areas, we adopted a non-controls reliance approach and we therefore performed additional substantive procedures.\n\n- We performed the following audit procedures:\n- \u00b7 Challenged the key actuarial assumptions used by comparing against ranges and expectations determined by our internal actuarial experts, which are calculated with reference to the central assumptions adopted by the actuarial firms for whom we have reviewed and accepted their methodologies.\n- \u00b7 Tested the Group's controls over the valuation of the defined benefit obligations, including controls over the assumptions setting process; and",

We have determined the following  benchmarks to be the most relevant to users of the financial  statements: \u00b7 Pre-tax profit; and  \u00b7 Net assets.                                                           | Parent company materiality represents 0.7% of net assets, and  is capped at Group materiality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Basis for determining  materiality    |\n| Given the importance of these measures to investors and  users of the financial statements, we have used forecasted pre- tax profit as the primary benchmark for our determination of  materiality, and net assets as a supporting benchmark.  Component materiality allocated across all three components  range between \u00a3126 million and \u00a3189 million. | The Parent company holds the Group's investments and is not  profit driven. The balance sheet is the key measure of financial  health that is important to shareholders since the primary  concern for the Parent company is the receipt and payment of  dividends. However, given the size of the entity's balance sheet,  we have capped materiality at Group's materiality. | Rationale for the  benchmark applied  |\n\n## 6.2 Performance materiality\n\nWe set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceed the materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\n\n|                                                                | Group financial statements Parent company financial statements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performance  materiality                                       | 60% of Group materiality - \u00a3210 million 60% of Parent company materiality - \u00a3210 million                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Basis and rationale  for determining  performance  materiality | In determining performance materiality, we considered the following factors:  a.

We have reviewed and assessed the Group's calculation  and reporting of these metrics to assess consistency with the  Group's published definitions and policies for these items. | In our opinion: \u00b7 the use, calculation and disclosure of APMs is consistent with  the Group's published definitions and policies;  \u00b7 the use of APMs in the Group's reporting results is consistent  with the guidelines produced by ESMA and FRC; and \u00b7 there is an appropriate balance between the use of statutory  metrics and APMs, together with clear definitions and  reconciliation for APMs used in financial reporting. |\n| Dividends and  distribution policy             | We also considered whether there was an appropriate  balance between the use of statutory metrics and APMs, in  addition to whether clear definitions and reconciliation for  APMs used in financial reporting have been provided.

Responsibilities of Directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## 9. Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## 10. Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\n## Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\n\nIn identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error that was approved by the board on 23 February 2022;\n- \u00b7 the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the Group's remuneration policies, key drivers for directors' remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;\n- \u00b7 enquiring of management, in-house legal counsel, internal audit and the Audit Committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Group's policies and procedures relating to:\n- -  identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;\n- -  detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and\n- -  the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 obtaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the Group operates in, focusing on those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the financial statements, such as provisions of the UK Companies Act, pensions legislation and tax legislation or that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the Group, including regulation and supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority, Financial Reporting Council and Financial Conduct Authority.\n- \u00b7 discussing among the engagement team including significant component audit teams and involving relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, pensions, IT and industry specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud; and\n\n## Audit response to risks identified\n\nAs a result of performing the above, we identified the Group's determination of 'expected credit losses' and 'valuation of certain complex and illiquid financial instruments held at fair value' as key audit matters related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matter in more detail and also describes the specific procedures in response to those key audit matters. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\n\nIn addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 enquiring of management, the Audit Committee and in-house and external legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;\n- \u00b7 reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;\n- \u00b7\n- performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud; and\n- \u00b7 in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.\n- \u00b7 reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and correspondence with regulators; and\n\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including specialists, and component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.",

Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 The strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n- \u00b7 The information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and of the Parent company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\n## 12. Corporate Governance Statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the Group's compliance with the provisions of the UK corporate governance code specified for our review.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the directors' explanation as to its assessment of the Group's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate is set out on page 43 ;\n- \u00b7 the directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 43 ;\n- \u00b7 the directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 133 ;\n- \u00b7 the section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 86 ; and\n- \u00b7 the board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 37 ;\n\n.\n\n- \u00b7 the section describing the work of the audit committee set out on pages 90 to 93\n\n## 13. Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\n## Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or\n- \u00b7 The Parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.\n\n## Directors' remuneration\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors' remuneration have not been made or the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.\n\n## 14. Other matters which we are required to address\n\n## Auditor tenure\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we were appointed by shareholders at its annual general meeting on 20 May 2021 to audit the financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2021 and subsequent financial periods. The period of total uninterrupted engagement of the firm is accordingly one year.\n\n## Consistency of the audit report with the additional report to the Audit Committee\n\nOur audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee we are required to provide in accordance with ISAs (UK).\n\n## 15. Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Parent company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Parent company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Parent company and the Parent company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\nAs required by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule (DTR) 4.1.14R, these financial statements form part of the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF) prepared Annual Financial Report filed on the National Storage Mechanism of the UK FCA in accordance with the ESEF Regulatory Technical Standard (('ESEF RTS').

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 1: Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (the Group) have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, trading securities and certain other financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts. The Directors consider that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. In reaching this assessment, the Directors have considered the implications of the short-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change upon the Group's performance and projected funding and capital position. The Directors have also taken into account the impact of further stress scenarios.\n\nDetails of those IFRS pronouncements which will be relevant to the Group but which were not effective at 31 December 2021 and which have not been applied in preparing these financial statements are given in note 54.\n\nIn 2019 the Group adopted IFRS 16 and amendments to IAS 12 and early-adopted the hedge accounting amendments Interest Rate Benchmark Reform issued by the IASB. In 2021, the Group has adopted the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 amendments issued by the IASB. These amendments require that changes to expected future cash flows that both arise as a direct result of IBOR Reform and are economically equivalent to the previous cash flows are accounted for as a change to the effective interest rate with no adjustment to the asset's or liability's carrying value; no immediate gain or loss is recognised. The new requirements also provide relief from the requirements to discontinue hedge accounting as a result of amending hedge documentation if the changes are required solely as a result of IBOR Reform. The amendments do not have a material impact on the Group's comparatives, which have not been restated.\n\nThe following changes have been made to the presentation of the Group's assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets arising from reinsurance contracts held are included within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (note 16) and other assets (note 25)\n- \u00b7 Reverse repurchase agreements with banks and customers are shown separately from loans and advances to banks and loans and advances to customers respectively; and repurchase agreements with banks and customers are shown separately from deposits from banks and customer deposits respectively\n- \u00b7 Property, plant and equipment is included in other assets (note 25)\n\nThere has been no change in the basis of accounting for any of the underlying transactions. Comparatives have been presented on a consistent basis for all of the above.\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies\n\nThe Group's accounting policies are set out below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently.\n\n## (A) Consolidation\n\nThe assets, liabilities and results of Group undertakings (including structured entities) are included in the financial statements on the basis of accounts made up to the reporting date. Group undertakings include subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. Details of the Group's subsidiaries and related undertakings are given on pages 337 to 342 .\n\n## (1) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity, and has the ability to affect those returns through the exercise of its power. This generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights although in certain circumstances a holding of less than one half of the voting rights may still result in the ability of the Group to exercise control. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an entity if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to any of the above elements. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group; they are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.\n\nThe Group consolidates collective investment vehicles if its beneficial ownership interests give it substantive rights to remove the external fund manager over the investment activities of the fund. Where a subsidiary of the Group is the fund manager of a collective investment vehicle, the Group considers a number of factors in determining whether it acts as principal, and therefore controls the collective investment vehicle, including: an assessment of the scope of the Group's decision-making authority over the investment vehicle; the rights held by other parties including substantive removal rights without cause over the Group acting as fund manager; the remuneration to which the Group is entitled in its capacity as decision-maker; and the Group's exposure to variable returns from the beneficial interest it holds in the investment vehicle. Consolidation may be appropriate in circumstances where the Group has less than a majority beneficial interest. Where a collective investment vehicle is consolidated the interests of parties other than the Group are reported in other liabilities and the movement in these interests in interest expense.\n\nStructured entities are entities that are designed so that their activities are not governed by way of voting rights. In assessing whether the Group has power over such entities in which it has an interest, the Group considers factors such as the purpose and design of the entity; its practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity; the nature of the relationship with the entity; and the size of its exposure to the variability of returns of the entity.\n\nThe treatment of transactions with non-controlling interests depends on whether, as a result of the transaction, the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Changes in the parent's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions; any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent entity. Where the Group loses control of the subsidiary, at the date when control is lost the amount of any non-controlling interest in that former subsidiary is derecognised and any investment retained in the former subsidiary is remeasured to its fair value; the gain or loss that is recognised in profit or loss on the partial disposal of the subsidiary includes the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the retained interest.\n\nIntercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group. The consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred except those relating to the issuance of debt instruments (see (E)(4) below) or share capital (see (P) below). Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (2) Joint ventures and associates\n\nJoint ventures are joint arrangements over which the Group has joint control with other parties and has rights to the net assets of the arrangements. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement and only exists when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity, but is not control or joint control of those policies, and is generally achieved through holding between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting share capital of the entity.\n\nThe Group utilises the venture capital exemption for investments where significant influence or joint control is present and the business unit operates as a venture capital business. These investments are designated at initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss. Otherwise, the Group's investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting.\n\n## (B) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired. Where the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity is greater than the cost of acquisition, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nGoodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is tested at least annually for impairment. If an impairment is identified the carrying value of the goodwill is written down immediately through the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. At the date of disposal of a subsidiary, the carrying value of attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## (C) Other intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets which have been determined to have a finite useful life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life as follows: up to 7 years for capitalised software; 10 to 15 years for brands and other intangible assets.\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed at each reporting date to assess whether there is any indication that they are impaired. If any such indication exists the recoverable amount of the asset is determined and in the event that the asset's carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount, it is written down immediately. Certain brands have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortised. Such intangible assets are assessed annually to determine whether the asset is impaired and to reconfirm that an indefinite useful life remains appropriate. In the event that an indefinite life is inappropriate, a finite life is determined and a further impairment review is performed on the asset.\n\n## (D) Revenue recognition\n\n## (1) Net interest income\n\nInterest income and expense are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method for all interest-bearing financial instruments, except for those classified at fair value through profit or loss. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the expected life of the financial instrument. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (before adjusting for expected credit losses) or to the amortised cost of the financial liability, including early redemption fees, other fees, and premiums and discounts that are an integral part of the overall return. In the case of financial assets that are purchased or originated credit-impaired, the effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the estimated future cash flows to the amortised cost of the instrument. Direct incremental transaction costs related to the acquisition, issue or disposal of a financial instrument are also taken into account. Interest income from non-credit impaired financial assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the asset; for credit impaired financial assets, the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount after deducting the allowance for expected credit losses. Impairment policies are set out in (H) below.\n\n## (2) Fee and commission income and expense\n\nFees and commissions receivable which are not an integral part of the effective interest rate are recognised as income as the Group fulfils its performance obligations. The Group's principal performance obligations arising from contracts with customers are in respect of value added current accounts, credit cards and debit cards. These fees are received, and the Group provides the service, monthly; the fees are recognised in income on this basis. The Group also receives certain fees in respect of its asset finance business where the performance obligations are typically fulfilled towards the end of the customer contract; these fees are recognised in income on this basis. Where it is unlikely that the loan commitments will be drawn, loan commitment fees are recognised in fee and commission income over the life of the facility, rather than as an adjustment to the effective interest rate for loans expected to be drawn. Incremental costs incurred to generate fee and commission income are charged to fees and commissions expense as they are incurred.\n\n## (3) Other\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\nRevenue recognition policies specific to trading income are set out in (E)(3) below, life insurance and general insurance business are detailed below (see (M) below); those relating to leases are set out in (J)(1) below.\n\n## (E) Financial assets and liabilities\n\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss, depending on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and whether the cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. The Group assesses its business models at a portfolio level based on its objectives for the relevant portfolio, how the performance of the portfolio is managed and reported, and the frequency of asset sales. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when considering their cash flow characteristics. The Group reclassifies financial assets only when its business model for managing those assets changes. A reclassification will only take place when the change is significant to the Group's operations and will occur at a portfolio level and not for individual instruments; reclassifications are expected to be rare. Equity investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss unless the Group elects at initial recognition to account for the instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. For these instruments, principally strategic investments, dividends are recognised in profit or loss but fair value gains and losses are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss following derecognition of the investment.\n\nThe Group initially recognises loans and advances, deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of securities and other financial assets and trading liabilities are recognised on trade date, being the date that the Group is committed to purchase or sell an asset.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash flows from those assets has expired or when the Group has transferred its contractual right to receive the cash flows from the assets and either: substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred; or the Group has neither retained nor transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards, but has transferred control.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.\n\n## (1) Financial instruments measured at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A basic lending arrangement results in contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Where the contractual cash flows introduce exposure to risks or volatility unrelated to a basic lending arrangement such as changes in equity prices or commodity prices, the payments do not comprise solely principal and interest. Financial assets measured at amortised cost are predominantly loans and advances to customers and banks together with certain debt securities used by the Group to manage its liquidity. Loans and advances are initially recognised when cash is advanced to the borrower at fair value inclusive of transaction costs. Interest income is accounted for using the effective interest method (see (D) above).\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortised cost, except for trading liabilities and other financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss on initial recognition which are held at fair value.\n\nWhere changes are made to the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability that are economically equivalent and arise as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform, the Group updates the effective interest rate and does not recognise an immediate gain or loss.\n\n## (2) Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets that are held to collect contractual cash flows and for subsequent sale, where the assets' cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value, inclusive of transaction costs. Interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on assets denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement. All other gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the financial asset is either sold or matures, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement other than in respect of equity shares, for which the cumulative revaluation amount is transferred directly to retained profits. The Group recognises a charge for expected credit losses in the income statement (see (H) below). As the asset is measured at fair value, the charge does not adjust the carrying value of the asset, it is reflected in other comprehensive income.\n\n## (3) Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss where they do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss to reduce an accounting mismatch. All derivatives are carried at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives are carried on the balance sheet as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative. Refer to note 48(3) (Financial instruments: Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value) for details of valuation techniques and significant inputs to valuation models.\n\nDerivatives embedded in a financial asset are not considered separately; the financial asset is considered in its entirety when determining whether its cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities and insurance contracts (unless the embedded derivative is itself an insurance contract) are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value through profit or loss. These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. In accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts , a policyholder's option to surrender an insurance contract for a fixed amount is not treated as an embedded derivative.\n\nThe assets backing the insurance and investment contracts issued by the Group do not meet the criteria to be measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income as they are managed on a fair value basis and accordingly are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Similarly, trading securities, which are debt securities and equity shares acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or which are part of a portfolio which is managed for short-term gains, do not meet these criteria and are also measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value. Fair value gains and losses together with interest coupons and dividend income are recognised in the income statement within net trading income.\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss where they are trading liabilities or where they are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to reduce an accounting mismatch; where the liabilities are part of a group of liabilities (or assets and liabilities) which is managed, and its performance evaluated, on a fair value basis; or where the liabilities contain one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows arising under the contract and would otherwise need to be separately accounted for. Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in the balance sheet at their fair value. Fair value gains and losses are recognised in the income statement within net trading income in the period in which they occur, except that gains and losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities traded in active markets are based on current bid and offer prices, respectively, which include the expected effects of potential changes to laws and regulations, risks associated with climate change and other factors. If the market is not active the Group establishes a fair value by using valuation techniques. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are adjusted where appropriate to reflect credit risk (via credit valuation adjustments (CVAs), debit valuation adjustments (DVAs) and funding valuation adjustments (FVAs)), market liquidity and other risks.\n\n## (4) Borrowings\n\nBorrowings (which include deposits from banks, customer deposits, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities) are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred. These instruments are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\nPreference shares and other instruments which carry a mandatory coupon or are redeemable on a specific date are classified as financial liabilities. The coupon on these instruments is recognised in the income statement as interest expense. Securities which carry a discretionary coupon and have no fixed maturity or redemption date are classified as other equity instruments. Interest payments on these securities are recognised as distributions from equity in the period in which they are paid. An exchange of financial liabilities on substantially different terms is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the new financial liability is recognised in profit or loss together with any related costs or fees incurred.\n\nWhen a financial liability is exchanged for an equity instrument, the new equity instrument is recognised at fair value and any difference between the carrying value of the liability and the fair value of the new equity is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## (5) Sale and repurchase agreements (including securities lending and borrowing)\n\nSecurities sold subject to repurchase agreements (repos) continue to be recognised on the balance sheet where substantially all of the risks and rewards are retained. Funds received for repos carried at fair value are included within trading liabilities. Conversely, securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repos), where the Group does not acquire substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, are measured at amortised cost or at fair value. Those measured at fair value are recognised within trading securities. The difference between sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the life of the agreements using the effective interest method.\n\nSecurities borrowing and lending transactions are typically secured; collateral takes the form of securities or cash advanced or received. Securities lent to counterparties are retained on the balance sheet. Securities borrowed are not recognised on the balance sheet, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability. Cash collateral given or received is treated as a loan and advance measured at amortised cost or customer deposit.\n\n## (F) Hedge accounting\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 9, the Group continues to apply the requirements of IAS 39 to its hedging relationships.\n\nChanges in the fair value of all derivative instruments, other than those in effective cash flow and net investment hedging relationships, are recognised immediately in the income statement. As noted in (2) and (3) below, the change in fair value of a derivative in an effective cash flow or net investment hedging relationship is allocated between the income statement and other comprehensive income.\n\nHedge accounting allows one financial instrument, generally a derivative such as a swap, to be designated as a hedge of another financial instrument such as a loan or deposit or a portfolio of such instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, formal documentation is drawn up specifying the hedging strategy, the hedged item, the hedging instrument and the methodology that will be used to measure the effectiveness of the hedge relationship in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of the hedged risk. The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is tested both at inception and throughout its life and if at any point it is concluded that it is no longer highly effective in achieving its documented objective, hedge accounting is discontinued. Note 17 provides details of the types of derivatives held by the Group and presents separately those designated in hedge relationships.\n\nWhere there is uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform, the Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk are based, or the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging instrument are based, are not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform. The Group does not discontinue a hedging relationship during the period of uncertainty arising from the interest rate benchmark reform solely because the actual results of the hedge are not highly effective.\n\nWhere the contractual terms of a financial asset, financial liability or derivative are amended, on an economically equivalent basis, as a direct consequence of interest rate benchmark reform, the uncertainty arising from the reform is no longer present. In these circumstances, the Group amends the hedge documentation to reflect the changes required by the reform; these changes to the documentation do not in and of themselves result in the discontinuation of hedge accounting or require the designation of a new hedge relationship.\n\n## (1) Fair value hedges\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk; this also applies if the hedged asset is classified as a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are no longer recognised in the income statement. The cumulative adjustment that has been made to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement using the effective interest method over the period to maturity.\n\n## (2) Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income in the cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised in the income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\n## (3) Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income, the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of. The hedging instrument used in net investment hedges may include non-derivative liabilities as well as derivative financial instruments.\n\n## (G) Offset\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Cash collateral on exchange traded derivative transactions is presented gross unless the collateral cash flows are always settled net with the derivative cash flows. In certain situations, even though master netting agreements exist, the lack of management intention to settle on a net basis results in the financial assets and liabilities being reported gross on the balance sheet.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (H) Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe impairment charge in the income statement reflects the change in expected credit losses, including those arising from fraud. Expected credit losses are recognised for loans and advances to customers and banks, other financial assets held at amortised cost, financial assets (other than equity investments) measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, and certain loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. Expected credit losses are calculated as an unbiased and probability-weighted estimate using an appropriate probability of default, adjusted to take into account a range of possible future economic scenarios, and applying this to the estimated exposure of the Group at the point of default after taking into account the value of any collateral held, repayments, or other mitigants of loss and including the impact of discounting using the effective interest rate.\n\nAt initial recognition, allowance (or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial guarantees) is made for expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (12-month expected credit losses). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk since origination, allowance (or provision) is made for expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime expected credit losses). Financial assets where 12-month expected credit losses are recognised are considered to be Stage 1; financial assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition are in Stage 2; and financial assets which have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit-impaired are allocated to Stage 3. Some Stage 3 assets, mainly in Commercial Banking, are subject to individual rather than collective assessment. Such cases are subject to a risk-based impairment sanctioning process, and these are reviewed and updated at least quarterly, or more frequently if there is a significant change in the credit profile. The collective assessment of impairment aggregates financial instruments with similar risk characteristics, such as whether the facility is revolving in nature or secured and the type of security against financial assets.\n\nAn assessment of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition considers the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining expected life of the financial instrument. In determining whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, the Group uses quantitative tests based on relative and absolute probability of default (PD) movements linked to internal credit ratings together with qualitative indicators such as watchlists and other indicators of historical delinquency, credit weakness or financial difficulty. The use of internal credit ratings and qualitative indicators ensures alignment between the assessment of staging and the Group's management of credit risk which utilises these internal metrics within distinct retail and commercial portfolio risk management practices. However, unless identified at an earlier stage, the credit risk of financial assets is deemed to have increased significantly when more than 30 days past due. The use of a payment holiday in and of itself has not been judged to indicate a significant increase in credit risk, with the underlying long-term credit risk deemed to be driven by economic conditions and captured through the use of forward-looking models. These portfolio-level models are capturing the anticipated volume of increased defaults and therefore an appropriate assessment of staging and expected credit loss. Where the credit risk subsequently improves such that it no longer represents a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the asset is transferred back to Stage 1.\n\nAssets are transferred to Stage 3 when they have defaulted or are otherwise considered to be credit-impaired. Default is considered to have occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing financial difficulty which is likely to affect significantly the ability to repay the amount due. IFRS 9 contains a rebuttable presumption that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due. The Group uses this 90 day backstop for all its products except for UK mortgages. For UK mortgages, the Group uses a backstop of 180 days past due as mortgage exposures more than 90 days past due, but less than 180 days, typically show high cure rates and this aligns with the Group's risk management practices. Key differences between Stage 3 balances and non-performing loans relate to the use of 180 days past due for Stage 3 mortgages and to the cure periods applied to forbearance exposures. The use of payment holidays is not considered to be an automatic trigger of regulatory default and therefore does not automatically trigger Stage 3. Days past due will also not accumulate on any accounts that have taken a payment holiday including those already past due.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the Group will renegotiate the original terms of a customer's loan, either as part of an ongoing customer relationship or in response to adverse changes in the circumstances of the borrower. In the latter circumstances, the loan will remain classified as either Stage 2 or Stage 3 until the credit risk has improved such that it no longer represents a significant increase since origination (for a return to Stage 1), or the loan is no longer credit-impaired (for a return to Stage 2). On renegotiation the gross carrying amount of the loan is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows, which are discounted at the original effective interest rate. Renegotiation may also lead to the loan and associated allowance being derecognised and a new loan being recognised initially at fair value.\n\nPurchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (POCI) include financial assets that are purchased or originated at a deep discount that reflects incurred credit losses. At initial recognition, POCI assets do not carry an impairment allowance; instead, lifetime expected credit losses are incorporated into the calculation of the effective interest rate. All changes in lifetime expected credit losses subsequent to the assets' initial recognition are recognised as an impairment charge.\n\nA loan or advance is normally written off, either partially or in full, against the related allowance when the proceeds from realising any available security have been received or there is no realistic prospect of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of impairment losses recorded in the income statement. For both secured and unsecured retail balances, the write-off takes place only once an extensive set of collections processes has been completed, or the status of the account reaches a point where policy dictates that continuing attempts to recover are no longer appropriate. For commercial lending, a write-off occurs if the loan facility with the customer is restructured, the asset is under administration and the only monies that can be received are the amounts estimated by the administrator, the underlying assets are disposed and a decision is made that no further settlement monies will be received, or external evidence (for example, third-party valuations) is available that there has been an irreversible decline in expected cash flows.\n\n## (I) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (other than investment property) is included at cost less accumulated depreciation. The value of land (included in premises) is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the difference between the cost and the residual value over their estimated useful lives, as follows: the shorter of 50 years and the remaining period of the lease for freehold/long and short leasehold premises; the shorter of 10 years and, if lease renewal is not likely, the remaining period of the lease for leasehold improvements; 10 to 20 years for fixtures and furnishings; and 2 to 8 years for other equipment and motor vehicles.\n\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, taking into account considerations such as potential changes to legislation, including those that are climate-related, as well as other factors, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\nAssets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverable amount of assets the Group considers the effects of potential or actual changes in legislation, customer behaviour, climate-related risks and other factors. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\n\nInvestment property comprises freehold and long leasehold land and buildings that are held either to earn rental income or for capital accretion or both, primarily within the life insurance funds. In accordance with the guidance published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, investment property is carried at fair value based on current prices for similar properties, adjusted for the specific characteristics of the property (such as location or condition). If this information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as discounted cash flow projections or recent prices in less active markets. These valuations are reviewed at least annually by independent professionally qualified valuers. Investment property being redeveloped for continuing use as investment property, or for which the market has become less active, continues to be valued at fair value.\n\n## (J) Leases\n\nUnder IFRS 16, a lessor is required to determine whether a lease is a finance or operating lease. A lessee is not required to make this determination.\n\n## (1) As lessor\n\nAssets leased to customers are classified as finance leases if the lease agreements transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee but not necessarily legal title. All other leases are classified as operating leases. When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable, net of allowances for expected credit losses and residual value impairment, within loans and advances to banks and customers. The difference between the gross receivable and the present value of the receivable is recognised as unearned finance lease income. Finance lease income is recognised in interest income over the term of the lease using the net investment method (before tax) so as to give a constant rate of return on the net investment in the leases. Unguaranteed residual values are reviewed regularly to identify any impairment.\n\nOperating lease assets are included within other assets at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, which equates to the lives of the leases, after taking into account anticipated residual values. Operating lease rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.\n\nThe Group evaluates non-lease arrangements such as outsourcing and similar contracts to determine if they contain a lease which is then accounted for separately.\n\n## (2) As lessee\n\nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Group's incremental borrowing rate appropriate for the right-of-use asset arising from the lease and the liability recognised within other liabilities.\n\nLease payments are allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of twelve months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.\n\n## (K) Employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits, such as salaries, paid absences, performance-based cash awards and social security costs, are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the related services.\n\n## (1) Pension schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of post-retirement benefit schemes for its employees including both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. A defined benefit scheme is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan into which the Group pays fixed contributions; there is no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions.\n\nScheme assets are included at their fair value and scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method. The defined benefit scheme liabilities are discounted using rates equivalent to the market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. The Group's income statement charge includes the current service cost of providing pension benefits, past service costs, net interest expense (income), and plan administration costs that are not deducted from the return on plan assets. Past service costs, which represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment, are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs. Net interest expense (income) is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset.\n\nRemeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense (income) and net of the cost of managing the plan assets), and the effect of changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) are reflected immediately in the balance sheet with a charge or credit recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income are reflected immediately in retained profits and will not subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nThe Group's balance sheet includes the net surplus or deficit, being the difference between the fair value of scheme assets and the discounted value of scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date. Surpluses are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the schemes. In assessing whether a surplus is recoverable, the Group considers (i) its current right to obtain a refund or a reduction in future contributions and (ii) the rights of other parties existing at the balance sheet date. In determining the rights of third parties existing at the balance sheet date, the Group does not anticipate any future acts by other parties.\n\nThe costs of the Group's defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (2) Share-based compensation\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans in respect of services received from certain of its employees. The value of the employee services received in exchange for equity instruments granted under these plans is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the instruments, with a corresponding increase in equity. This expense is determined by reference to the fair value of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest. The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant. In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments at the date of grant is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a Black-Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation. The determination of fair values excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions, which are included in the assumptions used to estimate the number of options that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, this estimate is reassessed and if necessary revised. Any revision of the original estimate is recognised in the income statement, together with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Cancellations by employees of contributions to the Group's Save As You Earn plans are treated as non-vesting conditions and the Group recognises, in the year of cancellation, the amount of the expense that would have otherwise been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period. Modifications are assessed at the date of modification and any incremental charges are charged to the income statement.\n\n## (L) Taxation\n\nTax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current and deferred tax are charged or credited in the income statement except to the extent that the tax arises from a transaction or event which is recognised, in the same or a different period, outside the income statement (either in other comprehensive income, directly in equity, or through a business combination), in which case the tax appears in the same statement as the transaction that gave rise to it. The tax consequences of the Group's dividend payments (including distributions on other equity instruments), if any, are charged or credited to the statement in which the profit distributed originally arose.\n\nCurrent tax is the amount of corporate income taxes expected to be payable or recoverable based on the profit for the period as adjusted for items that are not taxable or not deductible, and is calculated using tax rates and laws that were enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nCurrent tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions when management expects that, upon examination of the uncertainty by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or other relevant tax authority, it is more likely than not that an economic outflow will occur. Provisions reflect management's best estimate of the ultimate liability based on their interpretation of tax law, precedent and guidance, informed by external tax advice as necessary. Changes in facts and circumstances underlying these provisions are reassessed at each balance sheet date, and the provisions are remeasured as required to reflect current information.\n\nFor the Group's long-term insurance businesses, the tax expense is analysed between tax that is payable in respect of policyholders' returns and tax that is payable on the shareholders' returns. This allocation is based on an assessment of the rates of tax which will be applied to the returns under the current UK tax rules.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the balance sheet. Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and which are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences but not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries where the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised on temporary differences that arise from goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised, and are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised in respect of temporary differences that arise on initial recognition of assets and liabilities acquired other than in a business combination. Deferred tax is not discounted.\n\n## (M) Insurance\n\nThe Group undertakes both life insurance and general insurance business. Insurance and participating investment contracts are accounted for under IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts , which permits (with certain exceptions) the continuation of accounting practices for measuring insurance and participating investment contracts that applied prior to the adoption of IFRS. The Group, therefore, continues to account for these products using UK GAAP and UK established practice.\n\nProducts sold by the life insurance business are classified into three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts - these contracts transfer significant insurance risk and may also transfer financial risk. The Group defines significant insurance risk as the possibility of having to pay benefits on the occurrence of an insured event which are significantly more than the benefits payable if the insured event were not to occur. These contracts may or may not include discretionary participation features\n- \u00b7 Non-participating investment contracts - these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk or contain a discretionary participation feature\n- \u00b7 Investment contracts containing a discretionary participation feature (participating investment contracts) - these contracts do not transfer significant insurance risk, but contain a contractual right which gives the holder the right to receive, in addition to the guaranteed benefits, further additional discretionary benefits or bonuses that are likely to be a significant proportion of the total contractual benefits and the amount and timing of which is at the discretion of the Group, within the constraints of the terms and conditions of the instrument and based upon the performance of specified assets\n\nFor certain investment contracts, the contract can be partly invested in units which contain a discretionary participation feature (DPF) and partly in units without. Where switching levels for similar contracts are deemed to be significant, new investment contracts which contain an option to switch into investment contracts with DPF have been classified as participating investment contracts. Where the switching levels are not deemed to be significant, a new contract is split, with units containing a DPF being allocated as a participating investment contract and the units without a DPF as a non-participating investment contract.\n\nThe general insurance business issues only insurance contracts.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2: Accounting policies continued\n\n## (1) Life insurance business\n\n(i) Accounting for insurance and participating investment contracts\n\n## Premiums and claims\n\nPremiums received in respect of insurance and participating investment contracts are recognised as revenue when due except for unit-linked contracts on which premiums are recognised as revenue when received. Claims are recorded as an expense on the earlier of the maturity date or the date on which the claim is notified.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nChanges in the value of liabilities are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance and participating investment contracts in the Group's with-profit funds\n\nLiabilities of the Group's with-profit funds, including guarantees and options embedded within products written by these funds, are stated at their realistic values in accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authority's realistic capital regime, except that projected transfers out of the funds into other Group funds are recorded in the unallocated surplus (see below). Further details on valuation under the realistic capital regime are included in note 30 Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance contracts which are not unit-linked or in the Group's with-profit funds\n\nA liability for contractual benefits that are expected to be incurred in the future is recorded when the premiums are recognised. The liability is calculated by estimating the future cash flows over the duration of in-force policies and discounting them back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence. The liability will vary with movements in interest rates and with the cost of life insurance and annuity benefits where future mortality is uncertain.\n\nAssumptions are made in respect of all material factors affecting future cash flows, including future interest rates, mortality and costs.\n\nFurther details on valuation are included in note 30 Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n\n- \u00b7 Insurance and participating investment contracts which are unit-linked\n\nLiabilities for unit-linked insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are stated at the bid value of units plus an additional allowance where appropriate (such as for any excess of future expenses over charges). The liability is increased or reduced by the change in the unit prices and is reduced by policy administration fees, mortality and surrender charges and any withdrawals. Benefit claims in excess of the account balances incurred in the period are also charged through insurance claims. Revenue consists of fees deducted for mortality, policy administration and surrender charges.\n\n## Unallocated surplus\n\nAny amounts in the with-profit funds not yet determined as being due to policyholders or shareholders are recognised as an unallocated surplus which is shown separately from liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n\n## (ii) Accounting for non-participating investment contracts\n\nThe Group's non-participating investment contracts are primarily unit-linked. These contracts are accounted for as financial liabilities whose value is contractually linked to the fair values of financial assets within the Group's unitised investment funds. The value of the unit-linked financial liabilities is determined using current unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders at the balance sheet date. Their value is never less than the amount payable on surrender, discounted for the required notice period where applicable. Investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to those contracts are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.\n\nDeposits and withdrawals are not accounted for through the income statement but are accounted for directly in the balance sheet as adjustments to the non-participating investment contract liability.\n\nThe Group receives investment management fees in the form of an initial adjustment or charge to the amount invested. These fees are in respect of services rendered in conjunction with the issue and management of investment contracts where the Group actively manages the consideration received from its customers to fund a return that is based on the investment profile that the customer selected on origination of the contract. These services comprise an indeterminate number of acts over the lives of the individual contracts and, therefore, the Group defers these fees and recognises them over the estimated lives of the contracts, in line with the provision of investment management services.\n\nCosts which are directly attributable and incremental to securing new non-participating investment contracts are deferred. This asset is subsequently amortised over the period of the provision of investment management services and its recoverability is reviewed in circumstances where its carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the asset is greater than its recoverable amount it is written down immediately through fee and commission expense in the income statement. All other costs are recognised as expenses when incurred.\n\n## (iii) Value of in-force business\n\nThe Group recognises as an asset the value of in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts. The asset represents the present value of the shareholders' interest in the profits expected to emerge from those contracts written at the balance sheet date. This is determined after making appropriate assumptions about future economic and operating conditions such as future mortality and persistency rates and includes allowances for both non-market risk and for the realistic value of financial options and guarantees. Each cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets. The asset in the consolidated balance sheet is presented gross of attributable tax and movements in the asset are reflected within other operating income in the income statement.\n\nThe Group's contractual rights to benefits from providing investment management services in relation to non-participating investment contracts acquired in business combinations and portfolio transfers are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. The resulting asset is amortised over the estimated lives of the contracts. At each reporting date an assessment is made to determine if there is any indication of impairment. Where impairment exists, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and the impairment loss recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (2) General insurance business\n\nThe Group both underwrites and acts as intermediary in the sale of general insurance products. Underwriting premiums are included in insurance premium income, net of refunds, in the period in which insurance cover is provided to the customer; premiums received relating to future periods are deferred in the balance sheet within liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts on a basis that reflects the length of time for which contracts have been in-force and the projected incidence of risk over the term of the contract and only credited to the income statement when earned. Broking commission is recognised when the underwriter accepts the risk of providing insurance cover to the customer. Where appropriate, provision is made for the effect of future policy terminations based upon past experience.",

The provision for the cost of claims notified but not settled is based upon a best estimate of the cost of settling the outstanding claims after taking into account all known facts. In those cases where there is insufficient information to determine the required provision, statistical techniques are used which take into account the cost of claims that have recently been settled and make assumptions about the future development of the outstanding cases. Similar statistical techniques are used to determine the provision for claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. Claims liabilities are not discounted.\n\n## (3) Liability adequacy test\n\nAt each balance sheet date liability adequacy tests are performed to ensure the adequacy of insurance and participating investment contract liabilities net of related deferred cost assets and value of in-force business. In performing these tests, current best estimates of discounted future contractual cash flows and claims handling and policy administration expenses, as well as investment income from the assets backing such liabilities, are used. Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially by writing off the relevant assets and subsequently by establishing a provision for losses arising from liability adequacy tests.\n\n## (4) Reinsurance\n\nThe presentation of contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for amounts payable on one or more other contracts issued by the Group is dependent on whether the contract with the reinsurer transfers significant insurance risk to the reinsurer. Where the reinsurance contract transfers significant insurance risk, it is classified as an insurance contract and the asset recognised within other assets. Where the reinsurance contract does not transfer significant insurance risk to the reinsurer, the assets arising from contracts held with reinsurers are presented within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Contracts with reinsurers that transfer significant insurance risk\n\nAmounts recoverable from or due to reinsurers are measured consistently with the amounts associated with the reinsured contracts and in accordance with the terms of each reinsurance contract and are regularly reviewed for impairment. Premiums payable for reinsurance contracts are recognised as an expense when due within insurance premium income. Changes in the reinsurance recoverable assets are recognised in the income statement through insurance claims.\n\n## Contracts with reinsurers that do not transfer significant insurance risk\n\nContracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk to the reinsurer are recognised within financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as they are within a portfolio of financial assets that is managed, and whose performance is evaluated, on a fair value basis. These contracts, while legally reinsurance contracts, do not meet the definition of a reinsurance contract under IFRS. Investment returns (including movements in fair value and investment income) allocated to these contracts are recognised in insurance claims.\n\n## (N) Foreign currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the appropriate functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow or net investment hedges. Non-monetary assets that are measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date that the fair value was determined. Translation differences on equities and similar non-monetary items held at fair value through profit and loss are recognised in profit or loss as part of the fair value gain or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, such as equity shares, are included in the fair value reserve in equity unless the asset is a hedged item in a fair value hedge.\n\nThe results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity, are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date; and the income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average exchange rates unless these do not approximate to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions.\n\nForeign exchange differences arising on the translation of a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity together with exchange differences arising from the translation of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments (see (F)(3) above). On disposal or liquidation of a foreign operation, the cumulative amount of exchange differences relating to that foreign operation is reclassified from equity and included in determining the profit or loss arising on disposal or liquidation.\n\n## (O) Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nProvisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence depends on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.\n\nProvision is made for expected credit losses in respect of irrevocable undrawn loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts (see (H) above).\n\n## (P) Share capital\n\nIncremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options or to the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Dividends paid on the Group's ordinary shares are recognised as a reduction in equity in the period in which they are paid.\n\nWhere the Company or any member of the Group purchases the Company's share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders' equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled; if these shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders' equity.\n\n## (Q) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and non-mandatory balances with central banks and amounts due from banks with an original maturity of less than three months.",

        "page_content": "## Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Group's financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions in applying the accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts which differ from those estimates. Estimates, judgements and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. In preparing the financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate-related risks on its financial position and performance. While the effects of climate change represent a source of uncertainty, the Group does not consider there to be a material impact on its judgements and estimates from the physical, transition and other climate-related risks in the short to medium term.\n\nThe significant judgements, apart from those involving estimation, made by management in applying the Group's accounting policies in these financial statements (key judgements) and the key sources of estimation uncertainty that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year (key estimates), which together are considered critical to the Group's results and financial position, are as follows:\n\n## Allowance for expected credit losses\n\n| Key judgements:   | Determining an appropriate definition of default against which a probability of default, exposure at default and loss  given default parameter can be evaluated                                                       |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                   | The appropriate lifetime of an exposure to credit risk for the assessment of lifetime losses, notably on revolving products Establishing the criteria for a significant increase in credit risk (SICR)                |\n| Key estimates:    | The use of management judgement alongside impairment modelling processes to adjust inputs, parameters and  outputs to reflect risks not captured by models                                                            |\n|                   | Base case and multiple economic scenarios (MES) assumptions, including the rate of unemployment and the rate of  change of house prices, required for creation of MES scenarios and forward-looking credit parameters |\n\nThese judgements and estimates are subject to significant uncertainty.\n\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for loans and advances to customers and banks, other financial assets held at amortised cost, financial assets (other than equity investments) measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and certain loan commitment and financial guarantee contracts. At 31 December 2021, the Group's expected credit loss allowance was \u00a34,042 million (2020: \u00a36,247 million), of which \u00a33,842 million (2020: \u00a35,788 million) was in respect of drawn balances.\n\nThe calculation of the Group's expected credit loss allowances and provisions against loan commitments and guarantees under IFRS 9 requires the Group to make a number of judgements, assumptions and estimates. The most significant are set out below.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe probability of default (PD) of an exposure, both over a 12-month period and over its lifetime, is a key input to the measurement of the ECL allowance. Default has occurred when there is evidence that the customer is experiencing significant financial difficulty which is likely to affect the ability to repay amounts due. The definition of default adopted by the Group is described in note 2(H) Impairment of financial assets. The Group has rebutted the presumption in IFRS 9 that default occurs no later than when a payment is 90 days past due for UK mortgages. As a result, at 31 December 2021, \u00a30.5 billion of UK mortgages (2020: \u00a30.6 billion) were classified as Stage 2 rather than Stage 3; the impact on the Group's ECL allowance was not material.\n\n## Lifetime of an exposure\n\nA range of approaches, segmented by product type, has been adopted by the Group to estimate a product's expected life. These include using the full contractual life and taking into account behavioural factors such as early repayments, extensions and refinancing. For non-revolving retail assets, the Group has assumed the expected life for each product to be the time taken for all significant losses to be observed. For retail revolving products, the Group has considered the losses beyond the contractual term over which the Group is exposed to credit risk. For commercial overdraft facilities, the average behavioural life has been used. Changes to the assumed expected lives of the Group's assets could impact the ECL allowance recognised by the Group. The assessment of SICR and corresponding lifetime loss, and the PD, of a financial asset designated as Stage 2, or Stage 3, is dependent on its expected life.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk\n\nPerforming assets are classified as either Stage 1 or Stage 2. An ECL allowance equivalent to 12 months' expected losses is established against assets in Stage 1; assets classified as Stage 2 carry an ECL allowance equivalent to lifetime expected losses. Assets are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2 when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Credit-impaired assets are transferred to Stage 3 with a lifetime expected losses allowance. The Group uses both quantitative and qualitative indicators to determine whether there has been a SICR for an asset. For Retail, the following tables set out the retail master scale (RMS) grade triggers which result in a SICR for financial assets and the PD boundaries for each RMS grade. Loans and overdrafts SICR triggers have been refined in 2021 following a review of sensitivity to changes in economic assumptions, aligning to Credit cards (refined in 2020). The impact of this has been approximately \u00a30.3 billion of additional assets being classified as Stage 2 at 31 December 2021, with a corresponding increase in the ECL of \u00a315 million resulting from the transfer to a lifetime expected loss.\n\n## SICR triggers for key Retail portfolios\n\n| Origination grade                             |      |      |      |      |      |      | 1      |       |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |     6 |   7 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|--------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|-----|\n| Mortgages SICR grade                          |      |      |      |      |      |      |        | 5     |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |  9    |  10 |\n| Credit cards, loans and overdrafts SICR grade |      |      |      |      |      |      | 4      |       |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |  9    |  10 |\n| RMS grade                                     | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5    | 6    | 7      | 8     |   9 |  10 |  11 |  12 | 13    |  14 |\n| PD boundary % 1                               | 0.10 | 0.40 | 0.80 | 1.20 | 2.50 | 4.50 | 7. 5 0 | 10.00 |  14 |  20 |  30 |  45 | 99.99 | 100 |\n\n- 1 Probability-weighted annualised lifetime probability of default.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued\n\nFor Commercial a doubling of PD with a minimum increase in PD of 1 per cent and a resulting change in the underlying grade is treated as a SICR.\n\nThe Group uses the internal credit risk classification and watchlist as qualitative indicators to identify a SICR. The Group does not use the low credit risk exemption in its staging assessments. The use of a payment holiday in and of itself has not been judged to indicate a significant increase in credit risk, nor forbearance, with the underlying long-term credit risk deemed to be driven by economic conditions and captured through the use of forward-looking models. These portfolio level models are capturing the anticipated volume of increased defaults and therefore an appropriate assessment of staging and expected credit loss.\n\nAll financial assets are assumed to have suffered a SICR if they are more than 30 days past due; credit cards, loans and overdrafts financial assets are also assumed to have suffered a SICR if they are in arrears on three or more separate occasions in a rolling 12-month period. Financial assets are classified as credit-impaired if they are 90 days past due, except for UK mortgages where a 180 days backstop is used.\n\nA Stage 3 asset that is no longer credit-impaired is transferred back to Stage 2 as no cure period is applied to Stage 3. If an exposure that is classified as Stage 2 no longer meets the SICR criteria, which in some cases capture customer behaviour in previous periods, it is moved back to Stage 1.\n\nThe setting of precise trigger points combined with risk indicators requires judgement. The use of different trigger points may have a material impact upon the size of the ECL allowance. The Group monitors the effectiveness of SICR criteria on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Generation of multiple economic scenarios\n\nThe estimate of expected credit losses is required to be based on an unbiased expectation of future economic scenarios. The approach used to generate the range of future economic scenarios depends on the methodology and judgements adopted. The Group's approach is to start from a defined base case scenario, used for planning purposes, and to generate alternative economic scenarios around this base case. The base case scenario is a conditional forecast underpinned by a number of conditioning assumptions that reflect the Group's best view of key future developments. If circumstances appear likely to materially deviate from the conditioning assumptions, then the base case scenario is updated.\n\nThe base case scenario is central to a range of future economic scenarios generated by simulation of an economic model, for which the same conditioning assumptions apply as in the base case scenario. These scenarios are ranked by using estimated relationships with industry-wide historical loss data. With the base case already pre-defined, three other scenarios are identified as averages of constituent scenarios located around the 15th, 75th and 95th percentiles of the distribution. The full distribution is therefore summarised by a practical number of scenarios to run through ECL models representing an upside, the base case, and a downside scenario weighted at 30 per cent each, together with a severe downside scenario weighted at 10 per cent. The scenario weights represent the distribution of economic scenarios and not subjective views on likelihood. The inclusion of a severe downside scenario with a smaller weighting ensures that the non-linearity of losses in the tail of the distribution is adequately captured. The Group does not apply any reversion techniques within scenario generation, noting that data after the five-year forecast period shown has a relatively immaterial effect on the ECL provision.\n\nA forum under the chairmanship of the Chief Economist meets at least quarterly to review and, if appropriate, recommend changes to the method by which economic scenarios are generated, for approval by the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer. While no material changes were made to the model in 2021, the forum identified the need to consider an alternative approach to address interest rate risks not captured within the downside scenarios. The forum recommended that a non-modelled severe downside scenario was evaluated for potential incremental losses. This resulted in a management adjustment for UK mortgages which exhibited a sufficient uplift in ECL in a high rate scenario.\n\n## Base case and MES economic assumptions\n\nThe Group's base case economic scenario has been revised in light of the continuing impact of the coronavirus pandemic, intensifying global inflation pressures, and a shift towards a more restrictive stance of monetary policy by central banks. The Group's updated base case scenario built in three key conditioning assumptions. First, the current wave of coronavirus infections does not lead to a re-imposition of lockdown restrictions in the UK, although greater household caution is expected amid increased hospitalisation rates. Second, the rise in wholesale energy prices is passed on to consumers through a 50 per cent increase in retail energy prices in April 2022. Third, inflation expectations rise in response to increasing headline inflation but subsequently revert to levels consistent with the Bank of England's 2 per cent inflation target.\n\nBased on these assumptions and incorporating the improved economic data in the fourth quarter, the Group's base case outlook is for a modest rise in the unemployment rate alongside a deceleration in residential and commercial property price growth, as the UK Bank Rate is raised in response to increasing inflationary pressures. Risks around this base case economic view lie in both directions and are partly captured by the generation of alternative economic scenarios described above. Uncertainties relating to key epidemiological developments, notably the possibility that a vaccine-resistant strain could emerge, are not specifically captured by these scenarios. These specific risks are recognised outside of the modelled scenarios with a central adjustment.\n\nThe Group has accommodated the latest available information at the reporting date in defining its base case scenario and generating alternative economic scenarios. The scenarios include forecasts for key variables in the fourth quarter of 2021, for which actuals may have since emerged prior to publication.\n\n## Scenarios by year\n\nKey annual assumptions made by the Group are shown below. Gross domestic product is presented as an annual change, house price growth and commercial real estate price growth are presented as the growth in the respective indices within the period. UK Bank Rate and unemployment rate are averages for the period.\n\nThe key UK economic assumptions made by the Group averaged over a five-year period are also shown below. The five-year period reflects movements within the current reporting year such that 31 December 2021 reflects the five years 2021 to 2025. The prior year comparative data has been re-presented to align to the equivalent period, 2020 to 2024. The inclusion of the reporting year within the five-year period reflects the need to predict variables which remain unpublished at the reporting date, and recognises that credit models utilise both level and annual change in calculating ECL. The use of calendar years also maintains a comparability between tables disclosed.",

The stage allocation for an asset is based on the overall scenario probability-weighted PD and, hence, the staging of assets is constant across all the scenarios. In each economic scenario the ECL for individual assessments and post-model adjustments is constant reflecting the basis on which they are evaluated. Judgements applied through changes to inputs are reflected in the scenario sensitivities. The probability-weighted view shows the extent to which a higher ECL allowance has been recognised to take account of multiple economic scenarios relative to the base case; the uplift being \u00a3223 million compared to \u00a3506 million at 31 December 2020, noting that if the impact of MES staging was also included, as shown in the table below, this would increase to \u00a3230 million compared to \u00a3545 million at 31 December 2020.\n\n|                               | At 31 December 2021       | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2021   | At 31 December 2020       | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   | At 31 December 2020   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                               | Probability-  weighted \u00a3m | Upside \u00a3m             | Base case \u00a3m          | Downside \u00a3m           | Severe  downside \u00a3m   | Probability-  weighted \u00a3m | Upside \u00a3m             | Base case \u00a3m          | Downside \u00a3m           | Severe  downside \u00a3m   |\n| UK mortgages                  | 837                       | 637                   | 723                   | 967                   | 1,386                 | 1,027                     | 614                   | 804                   | 1,237                 | 2,306                 |\n| Retail excluding UK mortgages | 1,429                     | 1,286                 | 1,392                 | 1,516                 | 1,706                 | 2,368                     | 2,181                 | 2,310                 | 2,487                 | 2,745                 |\n| Commercial Banking            | 1,333                     | 1,196                 | 1,261                 | 1,403                 | 1,753                 | 2,402                     | 1,910                 | 2,177                 | 2,681                 | 3,718                 |\n| Other                         | 443                       | 441                   | 443                   | 444                   | 446                   | 450                       | 448                   | 450                   | 450                   | 456                   |\n| ECL allowance                 | 4,042                     | 3,560                 | 3,819                 | 4,330                 | 5,291                 | 6,247                     | 5,153                 | 5,741                 | 6,855                 | 9,225                 |\n\nThe table below shows the Group's ECL for the upside, base case, downside and severe downside scenarios, with staging of assets based on each specific scenario probability of default.

Although such changes would not be observed in isolation, as economic indicators tend to be correlated in a coherent scenario, this gives insight into the sensitivity of the Group's ECL to gradual changes in these two critical economic factors. The assessment has been made against the base case with the reported staging unchanged.\n\nThe table below shows the impact on the Group's ECL resulting from a 1 percentage point (pp) increase or decrease in the UK unemployment rate. The increase or decrease is presented based on the adjustment phased evenly over the first 10 quarters of the base case scenario. An immediate increase or decrease would drive a more material ECL impact as it would be fully reflected in both 12-month and lifetime PDs.\n\n|                               | At 31 December 2021              | At 31 December 2021              | At 31 December 2020              | At 31 December 2020              |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                               | 1pp increase in  unemployment \u00a3m | 1pp decrease in  unemployment \u00a3m | 1pp increase in  unemployment \u00a3m | 1pp decrease in  unemployment \u00a3m |\n| UK mortgages                  | 23                               | (18)                             | 25                               | (23)                             |\n| Retail excluding UK mortgages | 34                               | (34)                             | 54                               | (54)                             |\n| Commercial Banking            | 49                               | (42)                             | 125                              | (112)                            |\n| Other                         | 1                                | (1)                              | 1                                | (1)                              |\n| ECL impact                    | 107                              | (95)                             | 205                              | (190)                            |\n\nThe table below shows the impact on the Group's ECL in respect of UK mortgages of an increase or decrease in loss given default for a 10 percentage point (pp) increase or decrease in the UK House Price Index (HPI).

These assessments are carried out by the Business Support Unit based on detailed reviews and expected recovery strategies. While these assessments are based on the Group's latest economic view, the use of Group-wide multiple economic scenarios and weightings is not considered appropriate for these cases due to their individual characteristics. In place of this, a range of case-specific outcomes are considered with any alternative better or worse outcomes that carry a 25 per cent likelihood taken into account in establishing a probability-weighted ECL. At 31 December 2021, individually assessed provisions for Commercial Banking were \u00a3905 million (2020: \u00a31,222 million) which reflected a range of \u00a3741 million to \u00a31,024 million (2020: \u00a3982 million to \u00a31,548 million), based on the range of alternative outcomes considered.\n\n## Application of judgement in adjustments to modelled ECL\n\nImpairment models fall within the Group's model risk framework with model monitoring, periodic validation and back testing performed on model components (i.e. probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default). Limitations in the Group's impairment models or data inputs may be identified through the ongoing assessment and validation of the output of the models. In these circumstances, management make appropriate adjustments to the Group's allowance for impairment losses to ensure that the overall provision adequately reflects all material risks. These adjustments are determined by considering the particular attributes of exposures which have not been adequately captured by the impairment models and range from changes to model inputs and parameters, at account level, through to more qualitative post-model adjustments.\n\nJudgements are not typically assessed under each distinct economic scenario used to generate ECL, but instead are applied on the basis of final modelled ECL which reflects the probability-weighted view of all scenarios. All adjustments are reviewed quarterly and are subject to internal review and challenge, including by the Audit Committee, to ensure that amounts are appropriately calculated and that there are specific release criteria identified.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and the various support measures that have been put in place have resulted in an economic environment which differs significantly from the historical economic conditions upon which the impairment models have been built. As a result there has been a greater need for management judgements to be applied alongside the use of models. At 31 December 2021 management judgement resulted in additional ECL allowances totalling \u00a31,284 million (2020: \u00a31,383 million). This comprises judgements added due to COVID-19 and other judgements not directly linked to COVID-19 but which have increased in size during the pandemic. The table below analyses total ECL allowance by portfolio, separately identifying the amounts that have been modelled, those that have been individually assessed and those arising through the application of management judgement.",

Management believes that the resulting position does not fully reflect the underlying credit risk in the portfolios although there is no longer an expectation that the reduced level of defaults experienced in 2020 was temporary. Adjustments continue to be made to increase expected future rates of default and predicted exposures at default relative to modelled ECL.\n\n## Commercial Banking: \u00a3161 million (2020: \u00a3131 million)\n\nThese adjustments principally comprise:\n\n## Adjustment to economic variables used as inputs to models: \u00a389 million (2020: \u00a393 million)\n\nObserved reductions in the rate of UK corporate insolvencies, used as an input to commercial default models, continue to be substituted with an increase proportionate to that seen in unemployment to generate a level of predicted defaults. As anticipated, the rate of recoveries has returned to pre-pandemic levels towards the end of 2021 and, with model outputs based on 12 months observed insolvency data, management believe the historically low levels of insolvencies seen during early 2021 do not reflect the underlying credit risk.\n\n## Specific sector risks: \u00a380 million (2020: \u00a3nil)\n\nAt 31 December 2020 modelled ECL incorporated an economic outlook containing a material reduction in corporate profits. This is no longer assumed, which generates a reduction in modelled ECL and therefore leaves potential risk on specific sectors. An updated assessment of risks including COVIDdriven restrictions, inflation and interest rate pressures has been undertaken which continues to suggest that a number of specific industries remain more exposed. Judgement has therefore been raised in place of this to ensure a more targeted stress on likelihood and severity of loss in sectors which are considered to face an elevated risk incorporating any impact on SICR through the increased likelihood of loss.\n\n## Other: \u00a3400 million (2020: \u00a3400 million)\n\n## COVID risk to base case conditioning assumptions: \u00a3400 million (2020: \u00a3400 million)\n\nAn important element of the methodology used to calculate the Group's ECL allowance is the determination of a base case economic scenario, predicated on certain conditioning assumptions, which is then used to derive alternative economic scenarios using stochastic shocks. While the base case outlook has improved throughout the year, unexpected and adverse COVID-19 mutations may partially invalidate the base case conditioning assumptions and therefore the potential range of losses considered. The base case represents the Groups most likely view, however management believes that in the context of the pandemic, the possibility that the conditioning assumptions are invalidated is firmly to the downside. In particular, the possibility that a future virus mutation has vaccine resistance leading to serious social and economic disruption. Such a possibility lies outside of the Group's current methodology because it would invalidate one of the key assumptions behind the base case forecast. The likelihood and impact of a vaccine resistant mutation is difficult to estimate with any precision therefore the Group has considered a number of approaches to create a reasonable estimate of this additional downside risk.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 3: Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued\n\nAn adjustment of \u00a3400 million (31 December 2020: \u00a3400 million) has been made to increase the Group's ECL allowances to reflect the increased downside risk and the potential for the severity of losses to stretch beyond the Group's severe scenario. One approach used to quantify this amount is to apply a 15 per cent re-weighting from the stated upside to the stated severe downside scenario, a larger re-weight than at 31 December 2020 given that the current severe scenario reflects the improved conditioning assumptions of the base case, whereas the downside risk remains constant. Another approach is to apply a 1 percentage point increase in unemployment allied with a 10 per cent lower HPI in 2022, reflecting a broader assessment of a more immediate and therefore greater ECL impact than the gradual increase reflected in the stated univariate sensitivities. Such an increase is proportionate to the level of volatility seen in forecasts every six months as the pandemic has unfolded.\n\nAs the adjustment has been calculated centrally it has not been allocated to specific portfolios. It has therefore been allocated against Stage 1 assets given that the downside risks are largely considered to relate to non-defaulted exposures, the majority of which are in Stage 1. Detailed portfolio level disclosures continue to reflect the Group's economic assumptions at the Group's stated weightings. An indicative allocation to allow users to understand where the Group believes that the additional losses could arise is as follows: UK mortgages: c.\u00a3200 million, Credit cards and Other Retail: c.\u00a3100 million, Commercial Banking c.\u00a3100 million. The Group continues to monitor and assess the likelihood and consequences of its current conditioning assumptions.\n\n## Other judgements\n\n## UK mortgages: \u00a3478 million (2020: \u00a3510 million)\n\nThese adjustments principally comprise:\n\n## Adjustment to modelled forecast parameters: \u00a365 million (2020: \u00a3193 million)\n\nAdjustments to the estimated defaults used within the ECL calculation for UK mortgages were introduced in 2020 following the adoption of new default forecast models. Work has progressed through the year to embed the new model, including updates to model design choices through the implementation of formal model changes or through in-model adjustments, which are considered judgemental pending final evaluation and model governance. These remaining in-model adjustments now target a combination of specific enhancements which will continue to be progressed through to model changes. The reduction in the adjustment is also partly due to the improved economic outlook which reduces the impact of adopting the new forecast model.\n\n## End-of-term interest-only: \u00a3174 million (2020: \u00a3179 million)\n\nThe current definition of default used in the UK mortgages impairment model excludes past term interest-only accounts that continue to make interest payments but have missed their capital payment upon maturity of the loan. This adjustment therefore mitigates the risk that the model understates the credit losses associated with interest-only accounts which have missed, or will potentially miss, their final capital payment. For those accounts that have reached end of term this adjustment manually overwrites PDs to 70 per cent or 100 per cent, thereby moving them into Stage 2, or Stage 3, depending on whether they are considered performing or non-performing respectively. For interest-only accounts with six years or less to maturity an appropriate incremental PD uplift is made to PDs based on the probability of missing a future capital payment, assessed through segmentation of behaviour score, debt-to-value and worst ever arrears status.\n\n## Long-term defaults: \u00a387 million (2020: \u00a387 million)\n\nThe Group suspended mortgage litigation activity between late 2014 and mid 2018 as changes were implemented to the treatment of amounts in arrears, interrupting the natural flow of accounts to possession. An adjustment is made to ensure adequate provision coverage considering the resulting buildup of accounts in long-term default. Coverage is uplifted to the equivalent levels of those accounts already in repossession on an estimated shortfall of balances expected to flow to possession. A further adjustment is made to mitigate for the risk that credit model provision understates the probability of possession for accounts which have been in default for more than 24 months, with an arrears balance increase in the last 6 months. These accounts have their probability of possession set to 95 per cent based on observed historical losses incurred on accounts that were of an equivalent status.\n\n## Adjustment for specific segments: \u00a354 million (2020: \u00a320 million)\n\nThe Group monitors risks across specific segments of its portfolios which may not be fully captured through wider collective models. Along with continued judgmental increases to probability of default on forborne accounts, \u00a318 million (2020: \u00a320 million), the Group has taken an additional \u00a336/uni00A0million judgement for fire safety and cladding uncertainty. This captures risks within the assessment of affordability and asset valuations, not captured by underlying models. Though experience remains limited the risk is now considered sufficiently material to address through judgement, given that more cases have been assessed as having defective cladding, or other fire safety issues, together with emerging evidence of higher arrears and weaker sales values relative to the wider portfolio.\n\n## Inflation and interest rate risk: \u00a352 million (2020: \u00a3nil)\n\nThe Group's approach to MES modelling incorporates a range of interest rate scenarios, however it is recognised that given current inflationary pressures the risk of a very rapid increase in interest rates may not be fully captured in the range of economic assumptions used to assess credit losses. Therefore an additional management judgement for the mortgage portfolio, for which default rates are most sensitive to interest rates, has been taken to reflect this heightened risk. The quantification of this risk adopts an alternative severe downside scenario which leverages the Group's internal stress testing exercise. The increase in ECL therefore reflects the incremental losses from adopting a severe downside scenario with interest rates increasing to 4 per cent, with peak unemployment and house price falls broadly consistent with the Group's stated severe downside scenario. The Group will continue to reassess inflationary risks and whether this additional judgement is required.\n\n## Credit cards: \u00a3(9) million (2020: \u00a3(56) million) and Other Retail: \u00a350 million (2020: \u00a343 million)\n\nThese adjustments principally comprise:\n\n## Lifetime extension on revolving products: Credit cards: \u00a341 million (2020: \u00a371 million) and Other Retail: \u00a35 million (2020: \u00a310 million)\n\nUnsecured revolving products use a model lifetime definition of three years based on historic data which shows that substantially all accounts resolve in this time. An adjustment is made to extend the lifetime used for Stage 2 exposures to six years by increasing default probabilities through the extrapolation of the default trajectory observed throughout the three years and beyond. The resulting additional ECL allowance is added to Stage 2 accounts proportionate to the modelled three-year PD. The decrease in this judgement during 2021 is primarily due to the Group's improved economic outlook, meaning that the model view of lifetime three year losses is lower and therefore this extrapolation to six years is proportionally lower.\n\n## Credit card loss given default alignment (LGD): \u00a3(37) million (2020: \u00a3(55) million)\n\nThe MBNA impairment model was developed using historical MBNA data. Following the acquisition of the business and the subsequent migration of this portfolio to Lloyds Banking Group's collections strategies, an adjustment is required to reflect the recent improvement in cure rates now evident as collections strategies harmonise, which are not captured by the original MBNA model development data. The reduction in the judgement reflects a lower level of anticipated defaults, now expected from an improved economic outlook, against which the LGD adjustments would be applied.",

The valuation of this asset requires assumptions to be made about future economic and operating conditions which are inherently uncertain and changes could significantly affect the value attributed to this asset. The methodology used to value this asset and the key assumptions that have been made in determining the carrying value of the value of in-force business asset at 31 December 2021 are set out in note 23.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group carried total liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts of \u00a3123,423 million (2020: \u00a3116,060 million). Elements of the valuations of liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts require management to estimate future investment returns, future mortality rates and future expenses. These estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. The methodology used to value these liabilities and the key assumptions that have been made in determining their carrying value are set out in note 30.\n\nThe effect of changes to critical estimates used by management to determine the life insurance assets and liabilities is set out in note 31. The note presents the impact of changes to the estimates made on the Group's profit before tax and shareholders' equity as management believes that this analysis best presents these sensitivities in a manner that helps the user of the financial statements to understand the judgements made by management and the level of estimation uncertainty.\n\n## Defined benefit pension scheme obligations\n\n| Key judgement:   | Determination of an appropriate yield curve    |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Key estimates:   | Discount rate applied to future cash flows     |\n|                  | Expected lifetime of the schemes' members      |\n|                  | Expected rate of future inflationary increases |\n\nThe net asset recognised in the balance sheet at 31 December 2021 in respect of the Group's defined benefit pension scheme obligations was \u00a34,404/uni00A0million comprising an asset of \u00a34,531 million and a liability of \u00a3127 million (2020: a net asset of \u00a31,578 million comprising an asset of \u00a31,714 million and a liability of \u00a3136 million). The Group's accounting policy for its defined benefit pension scheme obligations is set out in note 2(K).\n\nThe accounting valuation of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes' liabilities requires management to make a number of assumptions. The key areas of estimation uncertainty are the discount rate applied to future cash flows, the expected lifetime of the schemes' members and the expected rate of future inflationary increases.\n\nThe discount rate is required to be set with reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds in the currency of and with a term consistent with the defined benefit pension schemes' obligations. The average duration of the schemes' obligations is approximately 17 years. The market for bonds with a similar duration is limited and, as a result, significant management judgement is required to determine an appropriate yield curve on which to base the discount rate. Assuming that there is no change in other assumptions or in the value of the schemes' assets, the effect on the net accounting surplus at 31 December 2021 of a decrease of 10 basis points in the discount rate would be a reduction of \u00a3795 million (2020: \u00a3890/uni00A0million). To the extent that changes in the discount rate arise from changes in gilt yields, rather than credit spreads, the impact is largely mitigated by the schemes' asset-liability matching strategies.\n\nThe cost of the benefits payable by the schemes will also depend upon the life expectancy of the members. The mortality assumptions used by the Group are based on standard industry tables for both current mortality rates and the rate of future mortality improvement, adjusted in line with the actual experience of the Group's schemes. Assuming that there is no change in other assumptions or in the value of the schemes' assets, the effect on the net accounting surplus at 31 December 2021 of an increase of one year in the average life of scheme members would be a reduction of \u00a31,934 million (2020: \u00a32,146 million). The Group has in place a longevity swap, as described in note 34, to partially mitigate mortality risk.\n\nThe majority of the Group's plans provide benefits linked to inflation both in deferment and in payment and the Group sets its inflation assumption with reference to an implied inflation curve. Assuming that there is no change in other assumptions or in the value of the schemes' assets, the effect on the net accounting surplus at 31 December 2021 of an increase of 10 basis points in the expected rate of inflation would be a decrease of \u00a3481 million (2020: \u00a3531/uni00A0million). This impact would be offset by gains recognised on the pension schemes' holding of index linked gilts and inflation linked swaps.\n\nFurther sensitivities and the balance sheet impact of changes in the principal actuarial assumptions are provided in part (v) of note 34.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions\n\nThe Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which ceased trading on 31 December 2010. In 2013, HMRC informed the Group that its interpretation of the UK rules means that the group relief is not available. In 2020, HMRC concluded their enquiry into the matter and issued a closure notice. The Group's interpretation of the UK rules has not changed and hence it has appealed to the First Tier Tax Tribunal, with a hearing expected in 2022. If the final determination of the matter by the judicial process is that HMRC's position is correct, management estimate that this would result in an increase in current tax liabilities of approximately \u00a3840 million (including interest) and a reduction in the Group's deferred tax asset of approximately \u00a3330 million. The Group, having taken appropriate advice, does not consider that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.\n\nThe Group makes other estimates in relation to tax which do not require significant judgements, see further discussion in note 35.",

It will often be necessary to form a view on matters which are inherently uncertain, such as the scope of reviews required by regulators, and to estimate the number of future complaints, the extent to which they will be upheld, the average cost of redress and the impact of decisions reached by legal and other review processes that may be relevant to claims received. Consequently the continued appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence and adjustments made to the provisions where appropriate.\n\nManagement has applied significant judgement in determining the provision required for HBOS Reading; further details are provided in note 36.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nKey estimate:\n\nInterest rate spreads, earnings multiples and interest rate volatility\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the carrying value of the Group's financial instrument assets held at fair value was \u00a3256,959 million (2020: \u00a3248,385 million), and its financial instrument liabilities held at fair value was \u00a386,223 million (2020: \u00a388,411 million).\n\nThe Group's valuation control framework and a description of level 1, 2 and 3 financial assets and liabilities is set out in note 48(2). The valuation techniques for level 3 financial instruments involve management judgement and estimates, the extent of which depends on the complexity of the instrument and the availability of market observable information. In addition, in line with market practice, the Group applies credit, debit and funding valuation adjustments in determining the fair value of its uncollateralised derivative positions. A description of these adjustments is set out in note 48. A quantitative analysis of the sensitivities to market risk arising from the Group's trading portfolios is set out in the tables marked audited on page 148 .\n\n## Capitalised software enhancements\n\n| Key judgement:   | Assessing future trading conditions that could affect the Group's business operations   |\n|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Key estimate:    | Estimated useful life of internally generated capitalised software                      |\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the carrying value of the Group's capitalised software enhancements was \u00a33,435 million (2020: \u00a33,309 million).\n\nIn determining the estimated useful life of capitalised software enhancements, management consider the product's lifecycle and the Group's technology strategy; assets are reviewed annually to assess whether there is any indication of impairment and to confirm that the remaining estimated useful life is still appropriate. For the year ended 31 December 2021, the amortisation charge was \u00a3892 million, including a software write-off as the Group invests in new technology and systems infrastructure, and at 31 December 2021, the weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of the Group's capitalised software enhancements was 4.7 years (2020: 4.9 years). If the Group reduced by one year the estimated useful life of those assets with a remaining estimated useful life of more than two years at 31 December 2021, the 2022 amortisation charge would be approximately \u00a3200 million higher.",

        "page_content": "## Note 4: Segmental analysis\n\nLloyds Banking Group provides a wide range of banking and financial services in the UK and in certain locations overseas.\n\nThe Group Executive Committee (GEC) has been determined to be the chief operating decision-maker, as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments , for the Group. The Group's operating segments reflect its organisational and management structures. The GEC reviews the Group's internal reporting based around these segments in order to assess performance and allocate resources. They consider interest income and expense on a net basis and consequently the total interest income and expense for all reportable segments is presented net. The segments are differentiated by the type of products provided and by whether the customers are individuals or corporate entities.\n\nThe segmental results and comparatives are presented on an underlying basis (pre-tax), the basis reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker. The effects of the following are excluded in arriving at underlying profit:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring, including severance-related costs, property transformation, technology research and development, regulatory programmes, merger and acquisition costs and integration costs\n- \u00b7 Payment protection insurance remediation provisions, excluding litigation costs\n- \u00b7 Volatility and other items, which includes the effects of certain asset sales, the volatility relating to the Group's hedging arrangements and that arising in the insurance businesses, the unwind of acquisition-related fair value adjustments and the amortisation of purchased intangible assets\n\nFor the purposes of the underlying income statement, operating lease depreciation (net of gains on disposal of operating lease assets) is shown as an adjustment to total income.\n\nThe Group's activities are organised into three financial reporting segments: Retail; Commercial Banking; and Insurance and Wealth.\n\nRetail offers a broad range of financial service products, including current accounts, savings, mortgages, motor finance and unsecured consumer lending to personal and small business customers.\n\nCommercial Banking provides a range of products and services such as lending, transactional banking, working capital management, risk management and debt capital markets services to SMEs, corporates and financial institutions.\n\nInsurance and Wealth offers insurance, investment and wealth management products and services.\n\nOther comprises income and expenditure not attributed to the Group's financial reporting segments. These amounts include those arising from the Group's equities business, residual net interest income after transfer pricing (including the central recovery of the Group's distributions on other equity instruments) and certain gains from gilt sales.\n\nIn considering the aggregation of these segments, the Group has taken into account the related economic risks, including those associated with climate change, on the business lines contained within them. The Group considers the level of aggregation reported to be reflective of the shared characteristics of the principal portfolios.\n\nInter-segment services are generally recharged at cost, although some attract a margin. In particular, a profit margin is charged on the internal commission arrangements between the branch network and other distribution channels and the insurance product manufacturing businesses within the Group. Intersegment lending and deposits are generally entered into at market rates, except that non-interest bearing balances are priced at a rate that reflects the external yield that could be earned on such funds.\n\nFor the majority of those derivative contracts entered into by business units for risk management purposes, the business unit recognises the net interest income or expense on an accrual accounting basis and transfers the remainder of the movement in the fair value of the derivative to the central function where the resulting accounting volatility is managed where possible through the establishment of hedge accounting relationships. Any change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk is also recorded within the central function. This allocation of the fair value of the derivative and change in fair value of the hedged instrument attributable to the hedged risk avoids accounting asymmetry in segmental results and leads to accounting volatility, which is managed centrally and reported within Other.",

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was the statutory auditor during 2020.\n- 2 As defined by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC).\n- 3 As defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n- 4 As defined by the SEC. Total non-audit services as defined by the FRC include all fees other than audit fess in respect of the statutory audit of Group entities. These fees totalled \u00a36.5 million in 2021 (2020: \u00a35.1 million; 2019: \u00a35.2 million).\n\nThe following types of services are included in the categories listed above:\n\nAudit fees: This category includes fees in respect of the audit of the Group's annual financial statements and other services in connection with regulatory filings. Other services supplied pursuant to legislation relate primarily to costs incurred in connection with client asset assurance and with the SarbanesOxley Act requirements associated with the audit of the Group's financial statements filed on its Form 20-F.\n\nOther audit-related fees: This category includes fees in respect of services for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example acting as reporting accountants in respect of debt prospectuses required by the Listing Rules.\n\nAll other fees: This category includes other assurance services not related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, for example, the review of controls operated by the Group on behalf of a third party. The auditors are not engaged to provide tax services.\n\nIt is the Group's policy to use the auditors only on assignments in cases where their knowledge of the Group means that it is neither efficient nor cost effective to employ another firm of accountants.\n\nThe Group has procedures that are designed to ensure auditor independence, including prohibiting certain non-audit services. All audit and non-audit assignments must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee on an individual engagement basis; for certain types of non-audit engagements where the fee is 'de minimis' the Audit Committee has pre-approved all assignments subject to confirmation by management. On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee receives and reviews a report detailing all pre-approved services and amounts paid to the auditors for such pre-approved services.\n\nDuring the year, the auditors 1 also earned fees payable by entities outside the consolidated Lloyds Banking Group in respect of the following:\n\n|                                                                                   |   2021 \u00a3m |   2020 \u00a3m |   2019 \u00a3m |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Audits of Group pension schemes                                                   |       0.4 |       0.1 |       0.1 |\n| Audits of the unconsolidated Open-Ended Investment Companies managed by the Group |       0.3 |       0.4 |       0.4 |\n| Reviews of the financial position of corporate and other borrowers                |       0.3 |       1.4 |       0.2 |\n\n- 1 Deloitte LLP became the Group's statutory auditor in 2021.

This also contains the impact on the impairment charge as a result of write-offs and recoveries, where the related loss allowances are reassessed to reflect ultimate realisable or recoverable value.\n\n## Additions and repayments\n\nExpected loss allowances are recognised on origination of new loans or further drawdowns of existing facilities. Repayments relate to the reduction of loss allowances resulting from the repayments of outstanding balances that have been provided against.\n\n## Methodology and model changes\n\nIncrease or decrease in impairment charge as a result of adjustments to the models used for expected credit loss calculations; either as changes to the model inputs or to the underlying assumptions, as well as the impact of changing the models used.\n\nMovements in the Group's impairment allowances are shown in note 18.",

The number of shares that could have been acquired at the annual average price of the Company's shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards is determined. This is deducted from the number of shares issuable under such options and awards to leave a residual bonus amount of shares which are added to the weighted-average number of ordinary shares in issue, but no adjustment is made to the profit attributable to equity shareholders.\n\nThere were 143 million anti-dilutive share options and awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share (2020: 647 million; 2019: 24/uni00A0million).\n\n## Note 16: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nThese assets are comprised as follows:\n\n|                                                   | 2021              | 2021                                                                          | 2021     | 2020              | 2020                                                                         | 2020     |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n|                                                   | Trading assets \u00a3m | Other financial assets  mandatorily at fair value  through  profit or loss \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Trading assets \u00a3m | Other financial assets  mandatorily at fair value  through profit or loss \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Loans and advances to banks                       | 486               | 3,684                                                                         | 4,170    | 229               | 4,238                                                                        | 4,467    |\n| Loans and advances to customers                   | 14,435            | 10,933                                                                        | 25,368   | 12,765            | 11, 24 4                                                                     | 24,009   |\n| Debt securities:                                  |                   |                                                                               |          |                   |                                                                              |          |\n| Government securities                             | 6,579             | 11,101                                                                        | 17,680   | 7, 5 74           | 13,048                                                                       | 20,622   |\n| Other public sector securities                    | -

To reduce credit risk the Group uses a variety of credit enhancement techniques such as netting and collateralisation, where security is provided against the exposure; a large proportion of the Group's derivatives are held through exchanges such as London Clearing House and are collateralised through those exchanges. Further details are provided in note 51 Credit risk.\n\nThe Group holds derivatives as part of the following strategies:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer driven, where derivatives are held as part of the provision of risk management products to Group customers\n- \u00b7 To manage and hedge the Group's interest rate and foreign exchange risk arising from normal banking business. The hedge accounting strategy adopted by the Group is to utilise a combination of fair value and cash flow hedge approaches as described in note 51\n- \u00b7 Derivatives held in policyholder funds as permitted by the investment strategies of those funds\n\nThe principal derivatives used by the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest rate related contracts include interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options. An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange fixed and floating interest payments, based upon interest rates defined in the contract, without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Forward rate agreements are contracts for the payment of the difference between a specified rate of interest and a reference rate, applied to a notional principal amount at a specific date in the future. An interest rate option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to fix the rate of interest on a future loan or deposit, for a specified period and commencing on a specified future date\n- \u00b7 Exchange rate related contracts include forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and options. A forward foreign exchange contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified future date at an agreed rate. Currency swaps generally involve the exchange of interest payment obligations denominated in different currencies; the exchange of principal can be notional or actual. A currency option gives the buyer, on payment of a premium, the right, but not the obligation, to sell specified amounts of currency at agreed rates of exchange on or before a specified future date",

Index-linked equity options are purchased which give the Group the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specified amount of equities, or basket of equities, in the form of published indices on or before a specified future date\n- \u00b7 Credit derivatives, principally credit default swaps, are used by the Group as part of its trading activity and to manage its own exposure to credit risk. A credit default swap is a swap in which one counterparty receives a premium at pre-set intervals in consideration for guaranteeing to make a specific payment should a negative credit event take place\n\nDetails of the Group's hedging instruments are set out below:\n\n|                               | Maturity         | Maturity      | Maturity       | Maturity     | Maturity        | Maturity   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|------------|\n| At 31 December 2021           | Up to 1 month \u00a3m | 1-3 months \u00a3m | 3-12 months \u00a3m | 1-5 years \u00a3m | Over 5 years \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m   |\n| Fair value hedges             |                  |               |                |              |                 |            |\n| Interest rate                 |                  |               |                |              |                 |            |\n| Cross currency swap           |                  |               |                |              |                 |            |\n| Notional                      | -

Where a POCI asset's expected credit loss is less than its expected credit loss on purchase or origination, the increase in its carrying value is recognised within gross loans, rather than as a negative impairment allowance.\n\nThe total allowance for impairment losses includes \u00a395 million (2020: \u00a3192 million) in respect of residual value impairment and voluntary terminations within the Group's UK motor finance business.",

Transfers between stages are deemed to have taken place at the start of the reporting period, with all other movements shown in the stage in which the asset is held at 31 December, with the exception of those held within purchased or originated credit-impaired, which are not transferable.\n\nAdditions and repayments comprise new loans originated and repayments of outstanding balances throughout the reporting period. Loans which are written off in the period are first transferred to Stage 3 before acquiring a full allowance and subsequent write-off.\n\n## Note 19: Finance lease receivables\n\nThe Group's finance lease receivables are classified as loans and advances to customers and accounted for at amortised cost.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 22: Goodwill continued\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows has been based on a value-in-use calculation. The calculation uses pre-tax projections of future cash flows based upon budgets and plans approved by management covering a three-year period, the related run-off of existing business in-force and a discount rate (pre-tax) of 8.8 per cent. The budgets and plans are based upon past experience adjusted to take into account anticipated changes in sales volumes, product mix and margins having regard to expected market conditions (which will reflect current and future risks, such as climate and expected economic activity conditions) and competitor activity. The discount rate is determined with reference to internal measures and available industry information. New business cash flows beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using a steady 3.5 per cent growth rate which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the life assurance market. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Scottish Widows to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Motor Finance has also been based on a value-in-use calculation using post-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a four-year period and a discount rate (post-tax) of 10.25 per cent. The cash flows beyond the four-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3.5 per cent which does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the markets in which Motor Finance participates. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including from the impacts of climate change or climate-related legislation, would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to Motor Finance to fall below the balance sheet carrying value. The impairment charge of \u00a34 million in 2020 related to the goodwill arising on a small, separable acquisition a number of years ago.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to the Cards business has been based on a value-in-use calculation using post-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management covering a four-year period and a discount rate (post-tax) of 10.25 per cent. The cash flows beyond the four-year period assume 3.5 per cent growth. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions above would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill relating to the Cards business to fall below the balance sheet carrying value.\n\n## Note 23: Value of in-force business\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe impacts of reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions made in respect of the Group's life insurance business, which include the impact on the value of in-force business, are disclosed in note 31.\n\nThe principal features of the methodology and process used for determining key assumptions used in the calculation of the value of in-force business are set out below:\n\n## Economic assumptions\n\nEach cash flow is valued using the discount rate consistent with that applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets. In practice, to achieve the same result, where the cash flows are either independent of or move linearly with market movements, a method has been applied known as the 'certainty equivalent' approach whereby it is assumed that all assets earn a risk-free rate and all cash flows are discounted at a risk-free rate. The certainty equivalent approach covers all investment assets relating to insurance and participating investment contracts, other than the annuity business (where an illiquidity premium is included, see below).\n\nA market-consistent approach has been adopted for the valuation of financial options and guarantees, using a stochastic option pricing technique calibrated to be consistent with the market price of relevant options at each valuation date. Further information on options and guarantees can be found in note 30.\n\nThe liabilities in respect of the Group's UK annuity business are matched by a portfolio of fixed interest securities, including a large proportion of corporate bonds and illiquid loan assets. The value of the in-force business asset for UK annuity business has been calculated after taking into account an estimate of the market premium for illiquidity in respect of corporate bond holdings and relevant illiquid loan assets. In determining the market premium for illiquidity, a range of inputs are considered which reflect actual asset allocation and relevant observable market data. The illiquidity premium is estimated to be 88 basis points at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: 77 basis points).\n\nThe risk-free rate is derived from the relevant swap curve with a deduction for credit risk.\n\nThe table below shows the resulting range of yields and other key assumptions at 31 December:\n\n|                                                           | 2021 %         | 2020 %         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Risk-free rate (value of in-force non-annuity business) 1 | (0.16) to 3.60 | (0.36) to 3.75 |\n| Risk-free rate (value of in-force annuity business) 1     | 0.72 to 4.49   | 0.41 to 4.53   |\n| Risk-free rate (financial options and guarantees) 1       | (0.16) to 3.60 | (0.36) to 3.75 |\n| Retail price inflation                                    | 3.28           | 3.00           |\n| Expense inflation                                         | 3.58           | 3.30           |\n\n- 1 All risk-free rates are quoted as the range of rates implied by the relevant forward swap curve.",

The carrying value at 31 December 2021 was \u00a3380 million (2020: \u00a3380 million). The Bank of Scotland name has been in existence for over 300 years and there are no indications that the brand should not have an indefinite useful life. The recoverable amount has been based on a valuein-use calculation. The calculation uses post-tax projections for a six-year period of the income generated by the Bank of Scotland cost generating unit, a discount rate of 10.25 per cent and a future growth rate of 3.5 per cent. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of the Bank of Scotland brand to fall below its balance sheet carrying value.",

The valuation methodology includes an assessment of general market conditions and sector level transactions and takes account of expectations of occupancy rates, rental income and growth. Properties undergo individual scrutiny using cash flow analysis to factor in the timing of rental reviews, capital expenditure, lease incentives, dilapidation and operating expenses; these reviews utilise both observable and unobservable inputs. Within the fair value hierarchy, all of the Group's investment properties are categorised as level 3 (see note 48 for details of levels in the fair value hierarchy). The table below analyses movements in level 3 investment properties, which are carried at fair value.\n\n|                                               | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                                  | 3,347     | 3,553     |\n| Acquisition of new properties                 | 18        | 61        |\n| Additional expenditure on existing properties | 68        | 21        |\n| Change in fair value (note 7)                 | 575       | (209)     |\n| Disposals                                     | (396)     | (79)      |\n| At 31 December                                | 3,612     | 3,347     |\n\nRental income of \u00a3186 million (2020: \u00a3191 million) and direct operating expenses of \u00a325 million (2020: \u00a332 million) arising from investment properties that generate rental income have been recognised in the income statement.\n\nCapital expenditure in respect of investment properties which had been contracted for but not recognised in the financial statements was \u00a378 million (2020: \u00a338 million).\n\n## Operating lease assets where the Group is lessor\n\nEquipment leased to customers under operating leases primarily relates to vehicle contract hire arrangements.

At 31 December 2021 there was a cumulative \u00a3195 million increase in the fair value of these liabilities attributable to changes in credit spread risk; this is determined by reference to the quoted credit spreads of Lloyds Bank plc, the issuing entity within the Group. Of the cumulative amount, an increase of \u00a386 million arose in 2021 and an increase of \u00a375 million arose in 2020.\n\nFor the fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase agreements see note 51.\n\nIn addition to the liabilities above, the Group's non-participating investment contracts (see note 32) are held at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Note 28: Debt securities in issue\n\n|                                | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Medium-term notes issued       | 37, 354   | 42,621    |\n| Covered bonds (note 29)        | 17, 409   | 23,980    |\n| Certificates of deposit issued | 4,454     | 7,9 9 8   |\n| Securitisation notes (note 29) | 3,672     | 4,406     |\n| Commercial paper               | 8,663     | 8,392     |\n| Total debt securities in issue | 71,552    | 87, 397   |\n\n## Note 29: Securitisations and covered bonds\n\n## Securitisation programmes\n\nLoans and advances to customers include loans securitised under the Group's securitisation programmes, the majority of which have been sold by subsidiary companies to bankruptcy remote structured entities.

Additionally, the Group has certain contractual arrangements to provide liquidity facilities to some of these structured entities. At 31 December 2021 these obligations had not been triggered; the maximum exposure under these facilities was \u00a352 million (2020: \u00a352 million).\n\nThe Group has a number of covered bond programmes, for which limited liability partnerships have been established to ring-fence asset pools and guarantee the covered bonds issued by the Group. At the reporting date the Group had over-collateralised these programmes as set out in the table above to meet the terms of the programmes, to secure the rating of the covered bonds and to provide operational flexibility. From time to time, the obligations of the Group to provide collateral may increase due to the formal requirements of the programmes. The Group may also voluntarily contribute collateral to support the ratings of the covered bonds.\n\nThe Group recognises the full liabilities associated with its securitisation and covered bond programmes within debt securities in issue, although the obligations of the Group in respect of its securitisation issuances are limited to the cash flows generated from the underlying assets. The Group could be required to provide additional support to a number of the securitisation programmes to support the credit ratings of the debt securities issued, in the form of increased cash reserves and the holding of subordinated notes. Further, certain programmes contain contractual obligations that require the Group to repurchase assets should they become credit-impaired or as otherwise required by the transaction documents.\n\nThe Group has not provided financial or other support by voluntarily offering to repurchase assets from any of its public securitisation programmes during 2021 (2020: none).\n\n## Note 30: Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts\n\nInsurance contract and participating investment contract liabilities are comprised as follows:\n\n|                                               | 2021     | 2021             | 2021    | 2020     | 2020             | 2020     |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|---------|----------|------------------|----------|\n|                                               | Gross \u00a3m | Reinsurance 1 \u00a3m | Net \u00a3m  | Gross \u00a3m | Reinsurance 1 \u00a3m | Net \u00a3m   |\n| Life insurance (see (1) below):               |          |                  |         |          |                  |          |\n| Insurance contracts                           | 109,200  | (740)            | 108,460 | 102,424  | (820)            | 101,604  |\n| Participating investment contracts            | 13,623   | -                | 13,623  | 13,041   | -                | 13,041   |\n|                                               | 122,823  | (740)            | 122,083 | 115,465  | (820)            | 114,645  |\n| Non-life insurance contracts (see (2) below): |          |                  |         |          |                  |          |\n| Unearned premiums                             | 312      | (16)             | 296     | 330      | (14)             | 316      |\n| Claims outstanding                            | 288      | -                | 288     | 265      | -                | 265      |\n|                                               | 600      | (16)             | 584     | 595      | (14)             | 581      |\n| Total                                         | 123,423  | (756)            | 122,667 | 116,060  | (834)            | 115, 226 |\n\n- 1 Reinsurance balances are reported within other assets.",

The primary purpose of the conventional and unitised business written in the withprofit funds is to provide a smoothed investment vehicle to policyholders, protecting them against short-term market fluctuations. Payouts may be subject to a guaranteed minimum payout if certain policy conditions are met. With-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90 per cent of the distributed profits, with the shareholders receiving the balance. The policyholders are also usually insured against death and the policy may carry a guaranteed annuity option at retirement.\n\n## (ii) Method of calculation of liabilities\n\nWith-profit liabilities are stated at their realistic value, the main components of which are:\n\n- \u00b7 With-profit benefit reserve, the total asset shares for with-profit policies\n- \u00b7 Deductions levied against asset shares\n- \u00b7 Cost of options and guarantees (including guaranteed annuity options)\n- \u00b7 Planned enhancements to with-profits benefits reserve\n- \u00b7 Impact of the smoothing policy\n\n## (iii) Assumptions\n\nKey assumptions used in the calculation of with-profit liabilities, which reflect the impacts of COVID-19 (in particular in relation to persistency and mortality assumptions) that has also increased the level of uncertainty, and the processes for determining these, are:\n\n## Investment returns and discount rates\n\nWith-profit fund liabilities are valued on a market-consistent basis, achieved by the use of a valuation model which values liabilities on a basis calibrated to tradable market option contracts and other observable market data. The with-profit fund financial options and guarantees are valued using a stochastic simulation model where all assets are assumed to earn, on average, the risk-free yield and all cash flows are discounted using the risk-free yield. The risk-free yield is defined as the spot yield derived from the relevant swap curve, adjusted for credit risk. Further information on significant options and guarantees is given below.\n\n## Guaranteed annuity option take-up rates\n\nCertain pension contracts contain guaranteed annuity options that allow the policyholder to take an annuity benefit on retirement at annuity rates that were guaranteed at the outset of the contract. For contracts that contain such options, key assumptions in determining the cost of options are economic conditions in which the option has value, mortality rates and take-up rates of other options. The financial impact is dependent on the value of corresponding investments, interest rates and longevity at the time of the claim.\n\n## Investment volatility\n\nThe calibration of the stochastic simulation model uses implied volatilities of derivatives where possible, or historical volatility where it is not possible to observe meaningful prices.",

        "page_content": "## Note 30: Liabilities arising from insurance contracts and participating investment contracts continued\n\n## Mortality\n\nThe mortality assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Group's actual experience where this is significant, and relevant industry data otherwise.\n\n## Lapse rates (persistency)\n\nLapse rates refer to the rate of policy termination or the rate at which policyholders stop paying regular premiums due under the contract.\n\nHistorical persistency experience is analysed using statistical techniques. As experience can vary considerably between different product types and for contracts that have been in force for different periods, the data is broken down into broadly homogenous groups for the purposes of this analysis.\n\nThe most recent experience is considered along with the results of previous analyses and management's views on future experience, taking into consideration potential changes in future experience that may result from guarantees and options becoming more valuable under adverse market conditions, in order to determine a 'best estimate' view of what persistency will be. In determining this best estimate view a number of factors are considered, including the credibility of the results (which will be affected by the volume of data available), any exceptional events that have occurred during the period under consideration, any known or expected trends in underlying data and relevant published market data.\n\n## (iv) Options and guarantees within the With-Profit Funds\n\nThe most significant options and guarantees provided from within the With-Profit Funds are in respect of guaranteed minimum cash benefits on death, maturity, retirement or certain policy anniversaries, and guaranteed annuity options on retirement for certain pension policies.\n\nFor those policies written in Scottish Widows pre-demutualisation containing potentially valuable options and guarantees, under the terms of the scheme a separate memorandum account was set up, within the With-Profit Fund originally held in Scottish Widows plc and subsequently transferred into Scottish Widows Limited, called the Additional Account, which is available, inter alia, to meet any additional costs of providing guaranteed benefits in respect of those policies. The Additional Account had a value at 31 December 2021 of \u00a32.5 billion (2020: \u00a32.5 billion). The eventual cost of providing benefits on policies written both pre and post demutualisation is dependent upon a large number of variables, including future interest rates and equity values, demographic factors, such as mortality, and the proportion of policyholders who seek to exercise their options. The ultimate cost will therefore not be known for many years.\n\nAs noted above, the liabilities of the With-Profit Funds are valued using a market-consistent stochastic simulation model which places a value on the options and guarantees which captures both their intrinsic value and their time value.\n\nThe most significant economic assumptions included in the model are risk-free yield and investment volatility.\n\n## Non-profit fund liabilities\n\n## (i) Business description\n\nThe Group principally writes the following types of life insurance contracts within its non-profit funds. Shareholder profits on these types of business arise from management fees and other policy charges.\n\n## Unit-linked business\n\nThis includes unit-linked pensions and unit-linked bonds, the primary purpose of which is to provide an investment vehicle where the policyholder is also insured against death.\n\n## Life insurance\n\nThe policyholder is insured against death or permanent disability, usually for predetermined amounts. Such business includes whole of life and term assurance and long-term creditor policies.\n\n## Annuities\n\nThe policyholder is entitled to payments for the duration of their life and is therefore insured against surviving longer than expected.\n\n## (ii) Method of calculation of liabilities\n\nThe non-profit fund liabilities are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods and involve estimating future policy cash flows over the duration of the in-force book of policies, and discounting the cash flows back to the valuation date allowing for probabilities of occurrence.\n\n## (iii) Assumptions\n\nGenerally, assumptions used to value non-profit fund liabilities are prudent in nature and therefore contain a margin for adverse deviation. This margin for adverse deviation is based on management's judgement and reflects management's views on the inherent level of uncertainty. In calculating the value of non-profit fund liabilities, the impacts of COVID-19, that have increased the level of uncertainty have been considered, in particular in relation to persistency and mortality. The key assumptions used in the measurement of non-profit fund liabilities are:\n\n## Interest rates\n\nThe rates of interest used are determined by reference to a number of factors including the redemption yields on fixed interest assets at the valuation date.\n\nMargins for risk are allowed for in the assumed interest rates, including reductions made to the available yields to allow for default risk based upon the credit rating of the securities allocated to the insurance liability.\n\n## Mortality and morbidity\n\nThe mortality and morbidity assumptions, including allowances for improvements in longevity for annuitants, are set with regard to the Group's actual experience where this provides a reliable basis, and relevant industry data otherwise, and include a margin for adverse deviation.\n\n## Lapse rates (persistency)\n\nLapse rates are allowed for on some non-profit fund contracts. The process for setting these rates is as described for with-profit liabilities, however a prudent scenario is assumed by the inclusion of a margin for adverse deviation within the non-profit fund liabilities.",

Expenses are determined by reference to an internal analysis of current and expected future costs plus a margin for adverse deviation. Explicit allowance is made for future expense inflation.\n\n## Key changes in assumptions\n\nA detailed review of the Group's demographic and expense assumptions in 2021 resulted in a net gain of \u00a343 million (2020: net loss of \u00a3151 million). The following were the key impacts on profit before tax:\n\n- \u00b7 Change in persistency assumptions (\u00a315 million decrease (2020: \u00a374 million decrease))\n- \u00b7 Change in expenses assumptions (\u00a394 million decrease (2020: \u00a3124 million decrease))\n- \u00b7 Change in the assumption in respect of current and future mortality and morbidity rates (\u00a3149 million increase (2020: \u00a352 million increase))\n\nThese amounts include the impacts of movements in liabilities and value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.\n\n## (iv) Options and guarantees outside the With-Profit Funds\n\nA number of typical guarantees are provided outside the With-Profit Funds such as guaranteed payments on death (for example term assurance) or guaranteed income for life (e.g. annuities). Caps and floors on inflation-linked increases to benefits and premiums across the annuities and protection business form additional guarantees within the Group's insurance business. Key assumptions affecting the time value of these guarantees are inflation, inflation volatility and interest rates. At 31 December 2021, additional reserves of \u00a3102 million were held to cover the time value of these guarantees. In addition, certain personal pension policyholders in Scottish Widows, for whom reinstatement to their occupational pension scheme was not an option, have been given a guarantee that their pension and other benefits will correspond in value to the benefits of the relevant occupational pension scheme. The key assumptions affecting the ultimate value of the guarantee are future salary growth, gilt yields at retirement, annuitant mortality at retirement, marital status at retirement and future investment returns. There is currently a provision, calculated on a deterministic basis, of \u00a361 million (2020: \u00a365 million) in respect of those guarantees.\n\n## (2) Non-life insurance\n\nFor non-life insurance contracts, the methodology and assumptions used in relation to determining the bases of the earned premium and claims provisioning levels are derived for each individual underwritten product. Assumptions represent the Group's estimates of the most likely or expected outcome, with a margin added for uncertainty reserves. There has been no significant change in the assumptions and methodologies used for setting reserves.\n\nThe movements in non-life insurance contract liabilities and reinsurance assets over the year have been as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Provisions for unearned premiums                                                                                                               |           |           |\n| Gross provision at 1 January                                                                                                                   | 330       | 333       |\n| Increase in the year                                                                                                                           | 624       | 655       |\n| Release in the year                                                                                                                            | (642)     | (658)     |\n| Change in provision for unearned premiums charged to income statement                                                                          | (18)      | (3)       |\n| Gross provision at 31 December                                                                                                                 | 312       | 330       |\n| Reinsurers' share                                                                                                                              | (16)      | (14)      |\n| Net provision at 31 December                                                                                                                   | 296       | 316       |\n| These provisions represent the liability for short-term insurance contracts for which the Group's obligations are not expired at the year end. |           |           |\n|                                                                                                                                                | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n| Claims outstanding                                                                                                                             |           |           |\n| Gross claims outstanding at 1 January                                                                                                          | 265       | 241       |\n| Cash paid for claims settled in the year                                                                                                       | (305)     | (294)     |\n| Increase in liabilities charged to the income statement 1                                                                                      | 328       | 318       |\n|                                                                                                                                                | 23        | 24        |\n| Gross claims outstanding at 31 December                                                                                                        | 288       | 265       |\n| Reinsurers' share                                                                                                                              | -         | -         |\n| Net claims outstanding at 31 December                                                                                                          | 288       | 265       |\n| Notified claims                                                                                                                                | 177       | 141       |\n| Incurred but not reported                                                                                                                      | 111       | 124       |\n| Net claims outstanding at 31 December                                                                                                          | 288       | 265       |\n\n- 1 Of which an increase of \u00a3367 million (2020: increase of \u00a3362 million) was in respect of current year claims and a decrease of \u00a339 million (2020: decrease of \u00a344 million) was in respect of prior year claims.\n\nThese claims liabilities are not discounted because they are typically settled within three years.",

In practice this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some assumptions may be correlated. These amounts include movements in assets, liabilities and the value of the in-force business in respect of insurance contracts and participating investment contracts.

All significant schemes are based in the UK, with the three most significant being the main sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1, the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 2 and the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme. At 31 December 2021, these schemes represented 94 per cent of the Group's total gross defined benefit pension assets (2020: 94 per cent). These schemes provide retirement benefits calculated as a proportion of final pensionable salary depending upon the length of pensionable service; the minimum retirement age under the rules of the schemes at 31 December 2021 is generally 55, although certain categories of member are deemed to have a protected right to retire at 50.\n\nThe Group operates both funded and unfunded pension arrangements; the majority, including the three most significant schemes, are funded schemes in the UK. All of these UK funded schemes are operated as separate legal entities under trust law, are in compliance with the Pensions Act 2004 and are managed by a Trustee Board (the Trustee) whose role is to ensure that their scheme is administered in accordance with the scheme rules and relevant legislation, and to safeguard the assets in the best interests of all members and beneficiaries. The Trustee is solely responsible for setting investment policy and for agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the funding valuation process. The Board of Trustees must be composed of representatives of the scheme membership along with a combination of independent and employer appointed trustees to comply with legislation and scheme rules.\n\nA valuation to determine the funding status of each scheme is carried out at least every three years, whereby scheme assets are measured at market value and liabilities (technical provisions) are measured using prudent assumptions. If a deficit is identified a recovery plan is agreed between the employer and the scheme Trustee and sent to the Pensions Regulator for review. The Group has not provided for these deficit contributions as the future economic benefits arising from these contributions are expected to be available to the Group. The Group's overseas defined benefit pension schemes are subject to local regulatory arrangements.\n\nThe most recent triennial funding valuations of the Group's three main defined benefit pension schemes showed an aggregate ongoing funding deficit of \u00a37.3 billion as at 31 December 2019 (a funding level of 85.7 per cent) compared to a \u00a37.3 billion deficit at 31 December 2016 (a funding level of 85.9 per cent). The revised deficit now includes an allowance for the impact of RPI reform announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in November 2020, and which is subject to judicial review in 2022. The latest annual update as at 31 December 2020 showed the funding deficit had improved to \u00a36.0 billion. Under the agreed recovery plan, \u00a30.8 billion plus a further 30 per cent of in-year capital distributions to ordinary shareholders, up to a limit on total deficit contributions of \u00a32.0 billion per annum, is payable from 2021 until the 2019 deficit has been removed. The deficit contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet benefits accruing over the year, and to cover the expenses of running the schemes. \u00a31.1 billion of deficit contributions were paid to these schemes in 2021. The Group expects to pay contributions of at least \u00a31.1 billion to its defined benefit schemes in 2022.\n\nDuring 2009, the Group made one-off contributions to the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 and Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 2 in the form of interests in limited liability partnerships for each of the two schemes which hold assets to provide security for the Group's obligations to the two schemes. At 31 December 2021, the limited liability partnerships held assets of \u00a37.4 billion. The limited liability partnerships are consolidated fully in the Group's balance sheet.\n\nThe Group has also established three private limited companies which hold assets to provide security for the Group's obligations to the HBOS Final Salary Pension Scheme, a section of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1 and the Lloyds Bank Offshore Pension Scheme. At 31 December 2021 these held assets of \u00a35.8 billion in aggregate. The private limited companies are consolidated fully in the Group's balance sheet. The terms of these arrangements require the Group to maintain assets in these vehicles to agreed minimum values in order to secure obligations owed to the relevant Group pension schemes. The Group has satisfied this requirement during 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Note 34: Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\nThe last funding valuations of other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates. In order to report the position under IAS 19 as at 31 December 2021, the most recent valuation results for all schemes have been updated by qualified independent actuaries. The funding valuations use a more prudent approach to setting the discount rate and more conservative longevity assumptions than the IAS 19 valuations.\n\nIn a judgement in 2018, the High Court confirmed the requirement to equalise the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) benefits of men and women accruing between 1990 and 1997 from contracting out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. The Group recognised a past service cost of \u00a3108 million in respect of equalisation in 2018 and, following agreement of the detailed implementation approach with the Trustee, a further \u00a333 million was recognised in 2019. A further hearing was held during 2020 which confirmed the extent of the Trustee's obligation to revisit past transfers out of the schemes. The amount of any additional liability as a result of this judgment is still being reviewed but is not considered likely to be material.\n\n## (ii) Amounts in the financial statements\n\n|                                                        | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|\n| Amount included in the balance sheet                   |           |              |\n| Present value of funded obligations                    | (47,130)  | (49,549)     |\n| Fair value of scheme assets                            | 51,534    | 51,127       |\n| Net amount recognised in the balance sheet             | 4,404     | 1,578        |\n|                                                        | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m      |\n| Net amount recognised in the balance sheet             |           |              |\n| At 1 January                                           | 1,578     | 550          |\n| Net defined benefit pension charge                     | (234)     | (244)        |\n| Actuarial gains (losses) on defined benefit obligation | 1,267     | (5,443)      |\n| Return on plan assets                                  | 449       | 5,565        |\n| Employer contributions                                 | 1,344     | 1,149        |\n| Exchange and other adjustments                         | -         | 1            |\n| At 31 December                                         | 4,404     | 1,578        |\n|                                                        | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m      |\n| Movements in the defined benefit obligation            |           |              |\n| At 1 January                                           | (49,549)  | (45,241)     |\n| Current service cost                                   | (213)     | (206)        |\n| Interest expense                                       | (704)     | (914)        |\n| Remeasurements:                                        |           |              |\n| Actuarial (losses) gains - experience                  | (426)     | 493          |\n| Actuarial losses - demographic assumptions             | (146)     | (218)        |\n| Actuarial gains (losses) - financial assumptions       | 1,839     | (5,718)      |\n| Benefits paid                                          | 2,034     | 2,254        |\n| Past service cost                                      | (11)      | (5)          |\n| Settlements                                            | 22        | 20           |\n| Exchange and other adjustments                         | 24        | (14)         |\n| At 31 December                                         | (47,130)  | (49,549)     |\n|                                                        | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m      |\n| Analysis of the defined benefit obligation             |           |              |\n| Active members                                         | (5,837)   | (6,550)      |\n| Deferred members                                       | (16,167)  | ( 17, 6 47 ) |\n| Pensioners                                             | (23,171)  | (23,409)     |\n| Dependants                                             | (1,955)   | (1,943)      |\n|                                                        | (47,130)  | (49,549)     |",

It is now expected that from 2030 RPI will be aligned with CPIH (the Consumer Price Index including owner-occupiers' housing costs). To determine the RPI assumption a term-dependent inflation curve has been used adjusting for an assumed inflation risk premium. In the period to 2030 a gap of 100 basis points has been assumed between RPI and CPI; thereafter no gap has been assumed. The RPI reform is subject to judicial review in 2022, and its outcome may impact these assumptions in the future.\n\n|                                                                        | 2021 Years   | 2020 Years   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Life expectancy for member aged 60, on the valuation date:             |              |              |\n| Men                                                                    | 27.1         | 27.0         |\n| Women                                                                  | 29.1         | 29.0         |\n| Life expectancy for member aged 60, 15 years after the valuation date: |              |              |\n| Men                                                                    | 28.1         | 28.1         |\n| Women                                                                  | 30.3         | 30.2         |\n\nThe mortality assumptions used in the UK scheme valuations are based on standard tables published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries which were adjusted in line with the actual experience of the relevant schemes. The table shows that a member retiring at age 60 at 31 December 2021 is assumed to live for, on average, 27.1 years for a male and 29.1 years for a female. In practice there will be much variation between individual members but these assumptions are expected to be appropriate across all members. It is assumed that younger members will live longer in retirement than those retiring now. This reflects the expectation that mortality rates will continue to fall over time as medical science and standards of living improve. To illustrate the degree of improvement assumed, the table also shows the life expectancy for members aged 45 now, when they retire in 15 years' time at age 60. The Group has considered the impact of COVID-19 and evidence to date indicates that this did not have a material impact on the defined benefit obligation. The Group uses the CMI mortality projections model and in line with actuarial industry recommendations has placed no weight on 2020 mortality experience.\n\n## (v) Amount, timing and uncertainty of future cash flows\n\nRisk exposure of the defined benefit schemes\n\nWhile the Group is not exposed to any unusual, entity-specific or scheme-specific risks in its defined benefit pension schemes, it is exposed to a number of significant risks, detailed below:\n\nInflation rate risk: The majority of the plans' benefit obligations are linked to inflation both in deferment and once in payment. Higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities although this will be materially offset by holdings of inflation-linked gilts and, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation.\n\nInterest rate risk: The defined benefit obligation is determined using a discount rate derived from yields on AA-rated corporate bonds. A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase plan liabilities although this will be materially offset by an increase in the value of bond holdings and through the use of derivatives.\n\nLongevity risk: The majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities.\n\nInvestment risk: Scheme assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of debt securities, equities and other return-seeking assets. If the assets underperform the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation, it will reduce the surplus or increase the deficit. Volatility in asset values and the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension asset on the Group's balance sheet and in other comprehensive income. To a lesser extent this will also lead to volatility in the pension expense in the Group's income statement.\n\nThe ultimate cost of the defined benefit obligations to the Group will depend upon actual future events rather than the assumptions made. The assumptions made are unlikely to be borne out in practice and as such the cost may be higher or lower than expected.",

The sensitivities provided assume that all other assumptions and the value of the schemes' assets remain unchanged, and are not intended to represent changes that are at the extremes of possibility. The calculations are approximate in nature and full detailed calculations could lead to a different result. It is unlikely that isolated changes to individual assumptions will be experienced in practice. Due to the correlation of assumptions, aggregating the effects of these isolated changes may not be a reasonable estimate of the actual effect of simultaneous changes in multiple assumptions.\n\n|                                             | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions   | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions   | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions                   | Effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions                   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                             | Increase (decrease) in the income  statement charge     | Increase (decrease) in the income  statement charge     | (Increase) decrease in the net  defined benefit pension scheme  surplus | (Increase) decrease in the net  defined benefit pension scheme  surplus |\n|                                             | 2021 \u00a3m                                                 | 2020 \u00a3m                                                 | 2021 \u00a3m                                                                 | 2020 \u00a3m                                                                 |\n| Inflation (including pension increases) 1 : |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                         |                                                                         |\n| Increase of 0.1 per cent                    | 12                                                      | 11                                                      | 481                                                                     | 531                                                                     |\n| Decrease of 0.1 per cent                    | (12)                                                    | (11)                                                    | (475)                                                                   | (522)                                                                   |\n| Discount rate 2 :                           |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                         |                                                                         |\n| Increase of 0.1 per cent                    | (24)                                                    | (20)                                                    | (774)                                                                   | (866)                                                                   |\n| Decrease of 0.1 per cent                    | 23                                                      | 19                                                      | 795                                                                     | 890                                                                     |\n| Expected life expectancy of members:        |                                                         |                                                         |                                                                         |                                                                         |\n| Increase of one year                        | 44                                                      | 39                                                      | 1,934                                                                   | 2,146                                                                   |\n| Decrease of one year                        | (42)                                                    | (37)                                                    | (1,852)                                                                 | (2,052)                                                                 |\n\n- 2 At 31 December 2021, the assumed discount rate is 1.94 per cent (2020: 1.44 per cent).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis method and assumptions\n\nThe sensitivity analysis above reflects the impact on the liabilities of the Group's three most significant schemes which account for over 90 per cent of the Group's defined benefit obligations. While differences in the underlying liability profiles for the remainder of the Group's pension arrangements mean they may exhibit slightly different sensitivities to variations in these assumptions, the sensitivities provided above are indicative of the impact across the Group as a whole.\n\nThe inflation assumption sensitivity applies to the assumed rate of increase in both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Retail Price Index (RPI), and includes the impact on the rate of increases to pensions, both before and after retirement. These pension increases are linked to inflation (either CPI or RPI) subject to certain minimum and maximum limits.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis (including the inflation sensitivity) does not include the impact of any change in the rate of salary increases as pensionable salaries have been frozen since 2 April 2014.\n\nThe life expectancy assumption has been applied by allowing for an increase/decrease in life expectation from age 60 of one year, based upon the approximate weighted average age for each scheme. While this is an approximate approach and will not give the same result as a one year increase in life expectancy at every age, it provides an appropriate indication of the potential impact on the schemes from changes in life expectancy.\n\nThere was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis from the prior year.\n\n## Asset-liability matching strategies\n\nThe main schemes' assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of debt securities. The investment strategy is not static and will evolve to reflect the structure of liabilities within the schemes. Specific asset-liability matching strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the responsible governance body for each scheme and in consultation with the employer.\n\nA significant goal of the asset-liability matching strategies adopted by Group schemes is to reduce volatility caused by changes in market expectations of interest rates and inflation. In the main schemes, this is achieved by investing scheme assets in bonds, primarily fixed interest gilts and index linked gilts, and by entering into interest rate and inflation swap arrangements. These investments are structured to take into account the profile of scheme liabilities and actively managed to reflect both changing market conditions and changes to the liability profile. At 31 December 2021 the asset-liability matching strategy mitigated around 117 per cent of the liability sensitivity to interest rate movements and around 126 per cent of the liability sensitivity to inflation movements. In addition, a small amount of interest rate sensitivity arises through holdings of corporate and other debt securities. The higher level of hedging provides greater protection to the funding position of the schemes.\n\nOn 28 January 2020, the main schemes entered into a \u00a310 billion longevity insurance arrangement to hedge part of the schemes' exposure to unexpected increases in life expectancy. This arrangement forms part of the schemes' investment portfolio and will provide income to the schemes in the event that pensions are paid out for longer than expected. The transaction was structured as a pass-through with Scottish Widows as the insurer, and onwards reinsurance to Pacific Life Re Limited. The valuation of the swap was \u00a3nil at inception and while there has been a slightly higher than expected number of deaths in the population covered by the arrangement, this has not had a material impact on the value of the swap. At 31 December 2021 the value of these swaps was \u00a30.6 million, and is reflected in the value of scheme assets.\n\nOn 28 January 2022, the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No 1 entered into an additional \u00a35.5 billion longevity insurance arrangement. The transaction is structured as a pass-through with Scottish Widows as the insurer, and onwards reinsurance to SCOR SE - UK Branch. The valuation of the swap was \u00a3nil at inception. In total the schemes have now hedged around 25 per cent of their longevity risk exposure.",

They are shown in their undiscounted form and therefore appear large relative to the discounted assessment of the defined benefit obligations recognised in the Group's balance sheet. They are in respect of benefits that have been accrued prior to the respective year-end date only and make no allowance for any benefits that may have been accrued subsequently.\n\n## Defined contribution schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally Your Tomorrow and the defined contribution sections of the Lloyds Bank Pension Scheme No. 1.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2021 the charge to the income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was \u00a3302 million (2020: \u00a3319/uni00A0million; 2019: \u00a3287 million), representing the contributions payable by the employer in accordance with each scheme's rules.\n\n## Other post-retirement benefit schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of schemes which provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to certain employees, retired employees and their dependants. The principal scheme relates to former Lloyds Bank staff and under this scheme the Group has undertaken to meet the cost of post-retirement healthcare for all eligible former employees (and their dependants) who retired prior to 1 January 1996. The Group has entered into an insurance contract to provide these benefits and a provision has been made for the estimated cost of future insurance premiums payable.\n\nFor the principal post-retirement healthcare scheme, the latest actuarial valuation of the liability was carried out at 31 December 2021 by qualified independent actuaries. The principal assumptions used were as set out above, except that the rate of increase in healthcare premiums has been assumed at 6.82 per cent (2020: 6.40 per cent).\n\nMovements in the other post-retirement benefits obligation:\n\n|                                | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                   | (109)     | (126)     |\n| Actuarial gains                | 4         | 16        |\n| Insurance premiums paid        | 3         | 4         |\n| Charge for the year            | (2)       | (3)       |\n| Exchange and other adjustments | 1         | -         |\n| At 31 December                 | (103)     | (109)     |",

The tax disclosure of deferred tax assets and liabilities ties to the amounts outlined in the tables below which splits the deferred tax assets and liabilities by type, before such netting.\n\nFinance Act 2021, which was substantively enacted on 24 May 2021, increases the rate of corporation tax from 19 per cent to 25 per cent with effect from 1 April 2023. The impact of this rate change is an increase in the Group's net deferred tax asset as at 31 December 2021 of \u00a3728 million, comprising a \u00a3954/uni00A0million credit included in the income statement and a \u00a3226 million charge included in equity. The tax credit in 2020 included an uplift in deferred tax assets following the announcement by the UK Government that it would maintain the corporation tax rate at 19 per cent.\n\nOn 27 October 2021, the UK Government announced its intention to decrease the rate of banking surcharge from 8 per cent to 3 per cent with effect from 1 April 2023. This change was substantively enacted on 2 February 2022 and its impact on deferred tax is therefore not included in these financial statements. Had this change in banking surcharge rate been substantively enacted at 31 December 2021, the impact would have been to recognise a \u00a317 million deferred tax charge in the income statement and an \u00a380 million credit within other comprehensive income, increasing the Group's net deferred tax asset by \u00a363 million.\n\nMovements in deferred tax assets and liabilities (before taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same taxing jurisdiction) can be summarised as follows:\n\n| Deferred tax assets                            | Tax losses \u00a3m   | Property, plant and  equipment \u00a3m   | Provisions \u00a3m   | Share- based  payments \u00a3m   | Pension  liabilities \u00a3m   | Derivatives \u00a3m   | Asset  revaluations 1 \u00a3m   | Other  temporary  differences \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|\n| At 1 January 2020                              | 3, 611          | 663                                 | 226             | 51                          | 53                        | 149              | -

        "page_content": "## Note 35: Deferred tax continued\n\nAt 31 December 2021 the Group carried net deferred tax assets on its balance sheet of \u00a33,118 million (2020: \u00a32,741 million) principally relating to tax losses carried forward.\n\nEstimation of income taxes includes the assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are considered more likely than not to be recoverable based on existing tax laws and forecasts of future taxable profits against which the underlying tax deductions can be utilised. The Group has recognised a deferred tax asset of \u00a35,023 million (2020: \u00a34,064 million) in respect of trading losses carried forward. Substantially all of these losses have arisen in Bank of Scotland plc and Lloyds Bank plc, and they will be utilised as taxable profits arise in those legal entities in future periods.\n\nThe Group's expectations of future UK taxable profits require management judgement, and take into account the Group's long-term financial and strategic plans and anticipated future tax-adjusting items. In making this assessment, account is taken of business plans, the Board-approved operating plan and the expected future economic outlook as set out in the strategic report, as well as the risks associated with future regulatory, climate-related and other change, in order to produce a base case forecast of future UK taxable profits. Under current law there is no expiry date for UK trading losses not yet utilised, and given the forecast of future profitability and the Group's commitment to the UK market, in management's judgement it is more likely than not that the value of the losses will be recovered by the Group while still operating as a going concern. Banking tax losses that arose before 1 April 2015 can only be used against 25 per cent of taxable profits arising after 1 April 2016, and they cannot be used to reduce the surcharge on banking profits. These restrictions in utilisation mean that the value of the deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses is only expected to be fully recovered by 2047 (2020: 2049) in the base case forecast. The rate of recovery of the Group's tax loss asset is not a straight line, being affected by the relative profitability of the legal entities in future periods, and the relative size of their tax losses carried forward. It is expected in the base case that 60 per cent of the value will be recovered by 2034, when Bank of Scotland plc will have utilised all of its available tax losses. It is possible that future tax law changes could materially affect the timing of recovery and the value of these losses ultimately realised by the Group. The value of the deferred tax asset in respect of tax losses increased by \u00a31,156 million in 2021 as a result of the change in UK tax rates.\n\n## Deferred tax not recognised\n\nDeferred tax assets of \u00a35 million (2020: \u00a385 million) have been recognised in respect of the future tax benefit of certain expenses of the life assurance business carried forward. The deferred tax asset not recognised in respect of the remaining expenses is \u00a3226 million (2020: \u00a3414 million), and these expenses can be carried forward indefinitely. The unrecognised deferred tax asset has decreased in 2021 because, as UK markets performed strongly, there was a significant decrease in the amount of expenses to carry forward.\n\nDeferred tax assets of \u00a3167 million (2020: \u00a3114 million) have not been recognised in respect of \u00a3658 million of UK tax losses and other temporary differences which can only be used to offset future capital gains. UK capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nNo deferred tax asset was recognised in 2020 in respect of unrelieved foreign tax credits of \u00a346 million as there were no expected profits against which the credits could be utilised. The formal closure of the branches in respect of which these credits arose means that the credits have now been extinguished.\n\nNo deferred tax has been recognised in respect of foreign trade losses where it is not more likely than not that we will be able to utilise them in future periods. Of the asset not recognised, \u00a341 million (2020: \u00a341 million) relates to losses that will expire if not used within 20 years, and \u00a37 million (2020: \u00a348/uni00A0million) relates to losses with no expiry date.\n\nAs a result of parent company exemptions on dividends from subsidiaries and on capital gains on disposal there are no significant taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint arrangements.",

See also note 18.\n\n## Regulatory and legal provisions\n\nIn the course of its business, the Group is engaged in discussions with the PRA, FCA and other UK and overseas regulators and other governmental authorities on a range of matters. The Group also receives complaints in connection with its past conduct and claims brought by or on behalf of current and former employees, customers, investors and other third parties and is subject to legal proceedings and other legal actions. Where significant, provisions are held against the costs expected to be incurred in relation to these matters and matters arising from related internal reviews. During the year ended 31 December 2021 the Group charged a further \u00a31,300 million in respect of legal actions and other regulatory matters, including a charge in respect of HBOS Reading, a charge of \u00a391 million for the FCA fine in relation to the past communication of historical home insurance renewals and charges for other legacy programmes.\n\nThe unutilised balance at 31 December 2021 was \u00a31,156 million (31 December 2020: \u00a3642 million). The most significant items are as follows.\n\n## HBOS Reading - review\n\nThe Group completed its compensation assessment for those within the Customer Review in 2019 with more than \u00a3109 million of compensation paid, in addition to \u00a315 million for ex-gratia payments and \u00a36 million for the reimbursement of legal fees. The Group is now applying the recommendations from Sir Ross Cranston's review, issued in December 2019, including a reassessment of direct and consequential losses by an independent panel (the Foskett Panel), an extension of debt relief and a wider definition of de facto directors. The appeal process for the further assessment of debt relief and de facto director status is now nearing completion. Further details of the Foskett Panel were announced on 3 April 2020 and the Foskett Panel's full scope and methodology was published on 7 July 2020. The Foskett Panel's stated objective is to consider cases via a non-legalistic and fair process and to make their decisions in a generous, fair and common sense manner, assessing claims against an expanded definition of the fraud and on a lower evidential basis.\n\nFollowing the emergence of the first outcomes of the Foskett Panel through 2021, the Group has charged a further \u00a3790 million in the year ended 31 December 2021, of which \u00a3600 million was recognised in the fourth quarter. This includes operational costs in relation to Dame Linda Dobbs' review, which is considering whether the issues relating to HBOS Reading were investigated and appropriately reported by the Group during the period from January 2009 to January 2017, and other programme costs. A significant proportion of the fourth quarter charge relates to the estimated future awards from the Foskett Panel. To date the Foskett Panel has shared outcomes on a limited subset of the total population which covers a wide range of businesses and different claim characteristics. The estimated awards provision recognised is therefore materially dependent on the assumption that the limited number of awards to date are representative of the full population of cases. The 2021 charge increases the lifetime cost to \u00a31,225 million. The final outcome could be significantly different from the current provision once the re-review is concluded by the Foskett Panel. There is no confirmed timeline for the completion of the Foskett Panel re-review process. The Group is committed to implementing Sir Ross's recommendations in full.\n\n## Payment protection insurance\n\nThe Group has made provisions for PPI costs over a number of years totalling \u00a321,960 million. Good progress continues to be made towards ensuring operational completeness, ahead of an orderly programme close. At 31 December 2021, a provision of \u00a322 million remained outstanding (excluding amounts related to MBNA), with total cash payments of \u00a3179 million during the year.\n\nIn addition to the above provision, the Group continues to challenge PPI litigation cases, with mainly legal fees and operational costs associated with litigation activity recognised within regulatory and legal provisions, including a charge in the fourth quarter. PPI litigation remains inherently uncertain, with a number of key Court judgments due to be delivered in 2022.\n\n## Arrears handling related activities\n\nTo date the Group has provided a total of \u00a31,026 million for arrears handling activities. The unutilised balance at 31 December 2021 was \u00a326 million.\n\n## Customer claims in relation to insurance branch business in Germany\n\nThe Group continues to receive claims from customers in Germany relating to policies issued by Clerical Medical Investment Group Limited (subsequently renamed Scottish Widows Limited), with smaller numbers of claims received from customers in Austria and Italy. The Group provided a further \u00a321 million in the year to 31 December 2021, bringing the total provided to date to \u00a3695 million. Utilisation of the provision was \u00a329 million in the year to 31 December 2021. The remaining unutilised provision as at 31 December 2021 was \u00a385 million. The ultimate financial effect, which could be significantly different from the current provision, will be known only once all relevant claims have been resolved.\n\n## Other\n\nFollowing the sale of TSB Banking Group plc, the Group raised a provision of \u00a3665 million in relation to various ongoing commitments in respect of the divestment. At 31 December 2021, a provision of \u00a390 million remained unutilised; the Group expects the majority of the remaining provision to be utilised in the next twelve months and the provision to be fully utilised by 31 December 2025.\n\nThe Group carries provisions of \u00a3114 million in respect of dilapidations, rent reviews and other property-related matters. Provisions are also made for staff and other costs related to Group restructuring initiatives at the point at which the Group becomes committed to the expenditure; at 31 December 2021 provisions of \u00a3189 million (31 December 2020: \u00a3198 million) were held.\n\nThe Group carries provisions of \u00a394 million (2020: \u00a3112 million) for indemnities and other matters relating to legacy business disposals in prior years. Whilst there remains significant uncertainty as to the timing of the utilisation of the provisions, the Group expects the majority of the remaining provisions to have been utilised by 31 December 2026.",

The subordination of specific subordinated liabilities is determined in respect of the issuer and any guarantors of that liability. The claims of holders of preference shares and preferred securities are generally junior to those of the holders of undated subordinated liabilities, which in turn are junior to the claims of holders of the dated subordinated liabilities. The Group has not had any defaults of principal, interest or other breaches with respect to its subordinated liabilities during 2021 (2020: none).\n\n## Note 38: Share capital\n\n## (1) Authorised share capital\n\nAs permitted by the Companies Act 2006, the Company removed references to authorised share capital from its articles of association at the Annual General Meeting on 5 June 2009.

Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions at that time.\n\nIn addition, the Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights.\n\nThe Directors have authority to allot and issue ordinary and preference shares and to make market purchases of ordinary and preference shares as granted at the Annual General Meeting on 20 May 2021.

There are also certain restrictions on the payment of interest as specified in the terms\n- \u00b7 The securities bear a fixed rate of interest until the first call date.

In some instances, grants may be made subject to individual performance conditions.\n\nParticipants are not entitled to any dividends paid during the vesting period.\n\n|                            | 2021              | 2021                                       | 2020              | 2020                                       |\n|----------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                            | Number of options | Weighted  average  exercise price  (pence) | Number of options | Weighted  average  exercise price  (pence) |\n| Outstanding at 1 January   | 6,666,372         | Nil                                        | 7,634,638         | Nil                                        |\n| Granted                    | 5,308,496         | Nil                                        | 1,990,449         | Nil                                        |\n| Exercised                  | (5,129,115)       | Nil                                        | (2,122,302)       | Nil                                        |\n| Vested                     | -                 | Nil                                        | ( 47, 3 37 )      | Nil                                        |\n| Forfeited                  | (385,184)         | Nil                                        | (111,10 0)        | Nil                                        |\n| Lapsed                     | (558,679)         | Nil                                        | ( 67 7,976)       | Nil                                        |\n| Outstanding at 31 December | 5,901,890         | Nil                                        | 6,666,372         | Nil                                        |\n| Exercisable at 31 December | 708,939           | Nil                                        | 3,150,407         | Nil                                        |\n\nThe weighted average fair value of options granted in the year was \u00a30.45 (2020: \u00a30.33). The fair values of options granted have been determined using a standard Black-Scholes model. The weighted average share price at the time that the options were exercised during 2021 was \u00a30.44 (2020: \u00a30.36). The weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at the end of the year was 4.3 years (2020: 4.1 years).\n\n## Other share plans\n\n## Lloyds Banking Group Executive Group Ownership Share Plan\n\nThe plan, introduced in 2006, is aimed at delivering shareholder value by linking the receipt of shares to an improvement in the performance of the Group over a three-year period. Awards are made within limits set by the rules of the plan, with the limits determining the maximum number of shares that can be awarded equating to three times annual salary. In exceptional circumstances this may increase to four times annual salary.\n\nAt the end of the performance period for the 2018 grant, the targets had not been fully met and therefore these awards vested in 2021 at a rate of 33.75 per cent.\n\n|                            | 2021 Number of shares   | 2020 Number of shares   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Outstanding at 1 January   | 533,987,527             | 459,904,745             |\n| Granted                    | -                       | 211,214,605             |\n| Vested                     | (39,621,415)            | (47,775,806)            |\n| Forfeited                  | (144,437,243)           | (96,015,542)            |\n| Dividend award             | 944,758                 | 6,659,525               |\n| Outstanding at 31 December | 350,873,627             | 533,987,527             |\n\nAwards in respect of the 2019 grant are due to vest in 2022 at a rate of 41.80 per cent. In previous years participants were entitled to any dividends paid in the vesting period. However, following a regulatory change prohibiting the payment of dividend on such awards, the number of shares awarded has been determined by applying a share price adjusted to exclude the value of estimated future dividends. Details of the performance conditions for the plan are provided in the Directors' remuneration report.\n\nThe weighted average fair value of the awards granted in 2020 was \u00a30.28.\n\n## Lloyds Banking Group Long Term Share Plan\n\nThe plan, introduced in 2021, which replaced the Executive Group Ownership Share Plan, is intended to provide alignment to our aim of delivering sustainable returns to shareholders, supported by our values and behaviours.\n\n|                            | 2021 Number of shares   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Granted                    | 83,456,304              |\n| Forfeited                  | (5,573,236)             |\n| Outstanding at 31 December | 77,883,068              |\n\nThe weighted average fair value of awards granted in the year was \u00a30.36.",

The expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of the closing daily share price over the most recent period that is commensurate with the expected life of the option. The historical volatility is compared to the implied volatility generated from market traded options in the Group's shares to assess the reasonableness of the historical volatility and adjustments made where appropriate.\n\n## Share Incentive Plan\n\n## Free shares\n\nAn award of shares may be made annually to employees up to a maximum of \u00a33,600. The shares awarded are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employee's behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares. The award is subject to a non-market based condition. If an employee leaves the Group within this three-year period for other than a 'good' reason, all of the shares awarded will be forfeited. On 25 March 2021, the Group made an award of 1,017 (2020: 676) shares to all eligible employees. The number of shares awarded was 67,658,976 (2020: 45,612,424), with an average fair value of \u00a30.42 (2020: \u00a30.30) based on the market price at the date of award.\n\n## Matching shares\n\nThe Group undertakes to match shares purchased by employees up to the value of \u00a345 per month; these matching shares are held in trust for a mandatory period of three years on the employee's behalf, during which period the employee is entitled to any dividends paid on such shares. The award is subject to a non-market based condition: if an employee leaves within this three-year period for other than a 'good' reason, all of the matching shares are forfeited. Similarly, if the employees sell their purchased shares within three years, their matching shares are forfeited.\n\nThe number of shares awarded relating to matching shares in 2021 was 46,621,026 (2020: 62,262,140), with an average fair value of \u00a30.44 (2020: \u00a30.34), based on market prices at the date of award.\n\n## Fixed share awards\n\nFixed share awards were introduced in 2014 in order to ensure that total fixed remuneration is commensurate with role and to provide a competitive reward package for certain Lloyds Banking Group employees, with an appropriate balance of fixed and variable remuneration, in line with regulatory requirements. The fixed share awards are delivered in Lloyds Banking Group shares, released over five years with 20 per cent being released each year following the year of award. From June 2020, the fixed share awards are released over three years with one third being released each year following the year of award. The number of shares purchased in 2021 was 8,320,948 (2020: 13,975,993).\n\nThe fixed share award is not subject to any performance conditions, performance adjustment or clawback. On an employee leaving the Group, there is no change to the timeline for which shares will become unrestricted.",

In accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements , transactions and balances with subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Pension funds\n\nThe Group provides banking and some investment management services to certain of its pension funds. At 31 December 2021, customer deposits of \u00a3480/uni00A0million (2020: \u00a3151 million) and investment and insurance contract liabilities of \u00a3144 million (2020: \u00a3152 million) related to the Group's pension funds. As disclosed in note 34, the Group's main pension funds have entered into a longevity insurance arrangement that was structured as a pass-through involving Scottish Widows.\n\n## Collective investment vehicles\n\nThe Group manages 145 (2020: 137) collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies (OEICs) and of these 73 (2020: 76) are consolidated. The Group invested \u00a3427 million (2020: \u00a3659 million) and redeemed \u00a3820 million (2020: \u00a31,159 million) in the unconsolidated collective investment vehicles during the year and had investments, at fair value, of \u00a31,965 million (2020: \u00a32,234 million) at 31 December. The Group earned fees of \u00a396 million from the unconsolidated collective investment vehicles during 2021 (2020: \u00a393 million).\n\n## Joint ventures and associates\n\nAt 31 December 2021 there were loans and advances to customers of \u00a314 million (2020: \u00a328 million) outstanding and balances within customer deposits of \u00a322 million (2020: \u00a373 million) relating to joint ventures and associates.\n\nDuring the year the Group paid fees of \u00a37 million (2020: \u00a37 million) to its Schroders Personal Wealth joint venture and also made a payments of \u00a310 million (2020: \u00a320 million) under the terms of agreements put in place on the establishment of the joint venture.\n\nIn addition to the above balances, the Group has a number of other associates held by its venture capital business that it accounts for at fair value through profit or loss. At 31 December 2021, these companies had total assets of \u00a33,889 million (2020: \u00a34,387 million), total liabilities of \u00a34,412 million (2020: \u00a34,928/uni00A0million) and for the year ended 31 December 2021 had turnover of \u00a33,686 million (2020: \u00a33,857 million) and made a net loss of \u00a3187 million (2020: net loss of \u00a3435 million). In addition, the Group has provided \u00a31,265 million (2020: \u00a31,295 million) of financing to these companies on which it received \u00a386/uni00A0million (2020: \u00a391 million) of interest income in the year.\n\n## Note 46: Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees Interchange fees\n\nWith respect to multi-lateral interchange fees (MIFs), the Group is not involved in the ongoing litigation which involves the card schemes Visa and Mastercard (as described below). However, the Group is a member/licensee of Visa and Mastercard and other card schemes. The litigation in question is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Litigation brought by retailers against both Visa and Mastercard continues in the English Courts, in which retailers are seeking damages on grounds that Visa and Mastercard's MIFs breached competition law (this includes a judgment of the Supreme Court in June 2020 upholding the Court of Appeal's finding in 2018 that historic interchange arrangements of Mastercard and Visa infringed competition law)\n- \u00b7 Litigation brought on behalf of UK consumers in the English Courts against Mastercard\n\nAny impact on the Group of the litigation against Visa and Mastercard remains uncertain at this time, such that it is not practicable for the Group to provide an estimate of any potential financial effect. Insofar as Visa is required to pay damages to retailers for interchange fees set prior to June 2016, contractual arrangements to allocate liability have been agreed between various UK banks (including the Group) and Visa Inc, as part of Visa Inc's acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016. These arrangements cap the maximum amount of liability to which the Group may be subject and this cap is set at the cash consideration received by the Group for the sale of its stake in Visa Europe to Visa Inc in 2016. In 2016, the Group received Visa preference shares as part of the consideration for the sale of its shares in Visa Europe. In 2020, some of these Visa preference shares were converted into Visa Inc Class A common stock (in accordance with the provisions of the Visa Europe sale documentation) and they were subsequently sold by the Group. The sale has no impact on this contingent liability.\n\n## LIBOR and other trading rates\n\nCertain Group companies, together with other panel banks, have been named as defendants in ongoing private lawsuits, including purported class action suits, in the US in connection with their roles as panel banks contributing to the setting of US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Sterling London Interbank Offered Rate and the Australian BBSW reference rate.\n\nCertain Group companies are also named as defendants in (i) UK-based claims; and (ii) two Dutch class actions, raising LIBOR manipulation allegations. A number of the claims against the Group in the UK relating to the alleged mis-sale of interest rate hedging products also include allegations of LIBOR manipulation.\n\nIt is currently not possible to predict the scope and ultimate outcome on the Group of any private lawsuits or any related challenges to the interpretation or validity of any of the Group's contractual arrangements, including their timing and scale. As such, it is not practicable to provide an estimate of any potential financial effect.",

        "page_content": "## Note 46: Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees continued\n\n## Tax authorities\n\nThe Group has an open matter in relation to a claim for group relief of losses incurred in its former Irish banking subsidiary, which ceased trading on 31 December 2010. In 2013, HMRC informed the Group that its interpretation of the UK rules means that the group relief is not available. In 2020, HMRC concluded their enquiry into the matter and issued a closure notice. The Group's interpretation of the UK rules has not changed and hence it has appealed to the First Tier Tax Tribunal, with a hearing expected in 2022. If the final determination of the matter by the judicial process is that HMRC's position is correct, management estimate that this would result in an increase in current tax liabilities of approximately \u00a3840 million (including interest) and a reduction in the Group's deferred tax asset of approximately \u00a3330 million. The Group, having taken appropriate advice, does not consider that this is a case where additional tax will ultimately fall due.\n\nThere are a number of other open matters on which the Group is in discussions with HMRC (including the tax treatment of certain costs arising from the divestment of TSB Banking Group plc), none of which is expected to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.\n\n## Other legal actions and regulatory matters\n\nIn addition, during the ordinary course of business the Group is subject to other complaints and threatened or actual legal proceedings (including class or group action claims) brought by or on behalf of current or former employees, customers, investors or other third parties, as well as legal and regulatory reviews, challenges, investigations and enforcement actions, which could relate to a number of issues, including financial, environmental or other regulatory matters, both in the UK and overseas. Where material, such matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability. In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established based on management's best estimate of the amount required at the relevant balance sheet date. In some cases it will not be possible to form a view, for example because the facts are unclear or because further time is needed to assess properly the merits of the case, and no provisions are held in relation to such matters. In these circumstances, specific disclosure in relation to a contingent liability will be made where material. However, the Group does not currently expect the final outcome of any such case to have a material adverse effect on its financial position, operations or cash flows. Where there is a contingent liability related to an existing provision the relevant disclosures are included within note 36.\n\n## Contingent liabilities, commitments and guarantees arising from the

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 47: Structured entities\n\nThe Group's interests in structured entities are both consolidated and unconsolidated. Details of the Group's interests in consolidated structured entities are set out in note 29 for securitisations and covered bond vehicles, note 34 for structured entities associated with the Group's pension schemes, and below in part (A) and (B). Details of the Group's interests in unconsolidated structured entities are included below in part (C).\n\n## (A) Asset-backed conduits\n\nIn addition to the structured entities discussed in note 29, which are used for securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group sponsors an active asset-backed conduit, Cancara, which invests in client receivables and debt securities. The total consolidated exposure of Cancara at 31 December 2021 was \u00a31,669 million (2020: \u00a32,490 million), comprising \u00a3889 million of loans and advances (2020: \u00a31,695 million) and \u00a3780 million of debt securities (2020: \u00a3795 million).\n\nAll lending assets and debt securities held by the Group in Cancara are restricted in use, as they are held by the collateral agent for the benefit of the commercial paper investors and the liquidity providers only. The Group provides liquidity facilities to Cancara under terms that are usual and customary for standard lending activities in the normal course of the Group's banking activities. During 2021 there have continued to be planned drawdowns on certain liquidity facilities for balance sheet management purposes, supporting the programme to provide funding alongside the proceeds of the asset-backed commercial paper issuance. The Group could be asked to provide support under the contractual terms of these arrangements including, for example, if Cancara experienced a shortfall in external funding, which may occur in the event of market disruption.\n\nThe external assets in Cancara are consolidated in the Group's financial statements.\n\n## (B) Consolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships\n\nThe assets of the Insurance business held in consolidated collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies and limited partnerships, are not directly available for use by the Group. However, the Group's investment in the majority of these collective investment vehicles is readily realisable. As at 31 December 2021, the total carrying value of these consolidated collective investment vehicle assets and liabilities held by the Group was \u00a360,352 million (2020: \u00a357,430 million).\n\nThe Group has no contractual arrangements (such as liquidity facilities) that would require it to provide financial or other support to the consolidated collective investment vehicles; the Group has not previously provided such support and has no current intentions to provide such support.\n\n## (C) Unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships\n\nThe Group's direct interests in unconsolidated structured entities comprise investments in collective investment vehicles, such as Open-Ended Investment Companies, and limited partnerships with a total carrying value of \u00a374,916 million at 31 December 2021 (2020: \u00a355,235 million), included within financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss (see note 16). These investments include both those entities managed by third parties and those managed by the Group. At 31 December 2021, the total asset value of these unconsolidated structured entities, including the portion in which the Group has no interest, was \u00a32,597 billion (2020: \u00a32,473 billion).\n\nGiven the nature of these investments, the Group's maximum exposure to loss is equal to the carrying value of the investment. However, the Group's investments in these entities are primarily held to match policyholder liabilities in the Insurance division and the majority of the risk from a change in the value of the Group's investment is matched by a change in policyholder liabilities. The collective investment vehicles are primarily financed by investments from investors in the vehicles.\n\nDuring the year the Group has not provided any non-contractual financial or other support to these entities and has no current intention of providing any financial or other support. There were no transfers from/to these unconsolidated collective investment vehicles and limited partnerships.\n\nThe Group considers itself the sponsor of a structured entity where it is primarily involved in the design and establishment of the structured entity and further where the Group transfers assets to the structured entity, markets products associated with the structured entity in its own name and/or provides guarantees regarding the structured entity's performance.\n\nThe Group sponsors a range of diverse investment funds and limited partnerships where it acts as the fund manager or equivalent decision-maker and markets the funds under one of the Group's brands.\n\nThe Group earns fees from managing the investments of these funds. The investment management fees that the Group earned from these entities, including those in which the Group held no ownership interest at 31 December 2021, are reported in note 6.",

        "page_content": "## Note 48: Financial instruments continued\n\n## (2) Fair value measurement\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is a measure as at a specific date and may be significantly different from the amount which will actually be paid or received on maturity or settlement date.\n\nWherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments held by the Group. Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liquidity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs. Valuation techniques used include discounted cash flow analysis and pricing models and, where appropriate, comparison to instruments with characteristics similar to those of the instruments held by the Group. The Group measures valuation adjustments for its derivative exposures on the same basis as the derivatives are managed.\n\nThe carrying amount of the following financial instruments is a reasonable approximation of fair value: cash and balances at central banks, items in the course of collection from banks, items in course of transmission to banks and notes in circulation. Liabilities arising from non-participating investment contracts are carried at fair value. Fair values have not been disclosed for discretionary participating investment contracts. There is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features applied under IFRS and therefore the range of possible fair values of these contracts cannot be measured reliably.\n\nBecause a variety of estimation techniques are employed and significant estimates made, comparisons of fair values between financial institutions may not be meaningful. Readers of these financial statements are thus advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group's financial position.\n\nFair value information is not provided for items that are not financial instruments or for other assets and liabilities which are not carried at fair value in the Group's consolidated balance sheet. These items include intangible assets, such as brands and acquired credit card relationships; premises and equipment; and shareholders' equity. These items are material and accordingly the Group believes that any fair value information presented would not represent the underlying value of the Group.\n\n## Valuation control framework\n\nThe key elements of the control framework for the valuation of financial instruments include model validation, product implementation review and independent price verification. These functions are carried out by appropriately skilled risk and finance teams, independent of the business area responsible for the products.\n\nModel validation covers both qualitative and quantitative elements relating to new models. In respect of new products, a product implementation review is conducted pre and post-trading. Pre-trade testing ensures that the new model is integrated into the Group's systems and that the profit and loss and risk reporting are consistent throughout the trade lifecycle. Post-trade testing examines the explanatory power of the implemented model, actively monitoring model parameters and comparing in-house pricing to external sources. Independent price verification procedures cover financial instruments carried at fair value. The frequency of the review is matched to the availability of independent data, monthly being the minimum. Valuation differences in breach of established thresholds are escalated to senior management. The results from independent pricing and valuation reserves are reviewed monthly by senior management.\n\nFormal committees, consisting of senior risk, finance and business management, meet at least quarterly to discuss and approve valuations in more judgemental areas, in particular for unquoted equities, structured credit, over-the-counter options and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA), funding valuation adjustment (FVA) and other valuation adjustments.\n\n## Valuation of financial assets and liabilities\n\nAssets and liabilities carried at fair value or for which fair values are disclosed have been classified into three levels according to the quality and reliability of information used to determine the fair values.\n\n## Level 1\n\nLevel 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Products classified as level 1 predominantly comprise listed equity shares, treasury bills and other government securities.\n\n## Level 2\n\nLevel 2 valuations are those where quoted market prices are not available, for example where the instrument is traded in a market that is not considered to be active or valuation techniques are used to determine fair value and where these techniques use inputs that are based significantly on observable market data. Examples of such financial instruments include most over-the-counter derivatives, financial institution issued securities, certificates of deposit and certain asset-backed securities.\n\n## Level 3\n\nLevel 3 portfolios are those where at least one input which could have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation is not based on observable market data. Such instruments would include the Group's venture capital and unlisted equity investments which are valued using various valuation techniques that require significant management judgement in determining appropriate assumptions, including earnings multiples and estimated future cash flows. Certain of the Group's asset-backed securities and derivatives, principally where there is no trading activity in such securities, are also classified as level 3.\n\nTransfers out of the level 3 portfolio arise when inputs that could have a significant impact on the instrument's valuation become market observable after previously having been non-market observable. In the case of asset-backed securities this can arise if more than one consistent independent source of data becomes available. Conversely, transfers into the portfolio arise when consistent sources of data cease to be available.",

The discount rates are derived from market observable interest rates, a risk margin that reflects loan credit ratings and an incremental illiquidity premium based on historical spreads at origination on similar loans.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nDebt securities measured at fair value and classified as level 2 are valued by discounting expected cash flows using an observable credit spread applicable to the particular instrument.\n\nWhere there is limited trading activity in debt securities, the Group uses valuation models, consensus pricing information from third-party pricing services and broker or lead manager quotes to determine an appropriate valuation. Debt securities are classified as level 3 if there is a significant valuation input that cannot be corroborated through market sources or where there are materially inconsistent values for an input. Asset classes classified as level 3 mainly comprise venture capital investments.\n\n## Equity investments\n\nUnlisted equity and fund investments are valued using different techniques in accordance with the Group's valuation policy and International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.\n\nDepending on the business sector and the circumstances of the investment, unlisted equity valuations are based on earnings multiples, net asset values or discounted cash flows.\n\n- \u00b7 A number of earnings multiples are used in valuing the portfolio including price earnings, earnings before interest and tax and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. The particular multiple selected is appropriate for the size and type of business being valued and is derived by reference to the current market-based multiple. Consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting the appropriate multiple\n- \u00b7 For fund investments the most recent capital account value calculated by the fund manager is used as the basis for the valuation and adjusted, if necessary, to align valuation techniques with the Group's valuation policy\n- \u00b7 Discounted cash flow valuations use estimated future cash flows, usually based on management forecasts, with the application of appropriate exit yields or terminal multiples and discounted using rates appropriate to the specific investment, business sector or recent economic rates of return. Recent transactions involving the sale of similar businesses may sometimes be used as a frame of reference in deriving an appropriate multiple\n\nUnlisted equity investments and investments in property partnerships held in the life assurance funds are valued using third-party valuations. Management take account of any pertinent information, such as recent transactions and information received on particular investments, to adjust the third-party valuations where necessary.\n\n## (B) Financial liabilities, excluding derivatives\n\n## Valuation hierarchy\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group's financial liabilities carried at fair value, excluding derivatives, comprised its financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and totalled \u00a323,123 million (2020: \u00a322,646 million). The table below analyses these financial liabilities by balance sheet classification and valuation methodology (level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 291 ). The fair value measurement approach is recurring in nature. There were no significant transfers between level 1 and 2 during the year.\n\n|                                                                                       | Level 1 \u00a3m   | Level 2 \u00a3m   | Level 3 \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|\n| At 31 December 2021                                                                   |              |              |              |            |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss                            |              |              |              |            |\n| Debt securities and other liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss | -            | 6,504        | 37           | 6,541      |\n| Trading liabilities:                                                                  |              |              |              |            |\n| Liabilities in respect of securities sold under repurchase agreements                 | -            | 14,962       | -            | 14,962     |\n| Other deposits                                                                        | -            | -            | -            | -          |\n| Short positions in securities                                                         | 1,569        | 51           | -            | 1,620      |\n|                                                                                       | 1,569        | 15,013       | -            | 16,582     |\n| Total financial liabilities carried at fair value, excluding derivatives              | 1,569        | 21,517       | 37           | 23,123     |\n| At 31 December 2020                                                                   |              |              |              |            |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss                            |              |              |              |            |\n| Debt securities in issue designated at fair value through profit or loss              | -            | 6,783        | 45           | 6,828      |\n| Trading liabilities:                                                                  |              |              |              |            |\n| Liabilities in respect of securities sold under repurchase agreements                 | -            | 14,996       | -            | 14,996     |\n| Other deposits                                                                        | -            | 6            | -            | 6          |\n| Short positions in securities                                                         | 778          | 38           | -            | 816        |\n|                                                                                       | 778          | 15,040       | -            | 15,818     |\n| Total financial liabilities carried at fair value, excluding derivatives              | 778          | 21,823       | 45           | 22,646     |",

The carrying amount of the securities is adjusted to reflect the effect of changes in own credit spreads and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn the year ended 31 December 2021, the own credit adjustment arising from the fair valuation of \u00a36,541 million (2020: \u00a36,828 million) of the Group's debt securities in issue designated at fair value through profit or loss resulted in a loss of \u00a386 million (2020: loss of \u00a375 million), before tax, recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Trading liabilities in respect of securities sold under repurchase agreements\n\nThe fair value of these liabilities is determined using discounted cash flow techniques. The discount rates are derived from observable repurchase agreement rate curves specific to the type of security sold under the repurchase agreement.\n\n## (C) Derivatives\n\n## Valuation hierarchy\n\nAll of the Group's derivative assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. At 31 December 2021, such assets totalled \u00a322,051 million (2020: \u00a329,613 million) and liabilities totalled \u00a318,060 million (2020: \u00a327,313 million).

The types of derivatives classified as level 2 and the valuation techniques used include:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest rate swaps which are valued using discounted cash flow models; the most significant inputs into those models are interest rate yield curves which are developed from publicly quoted rates\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange derivatives that do not contain options which are priced using rates available from publicly quoted sources",

For more complex option products, the Group calibrates its models using observable at-the-money data; where necessary, the Group adjusts for out-of-themoney positions using a market standard consensus pricing service\n\nComplex interest rate and foreign exchange products where inputs to the valuation are significant, material and unobservable are classified as level 3.\n\nWhere credit protection, usually in the form of credit default swaps, has been purchased or written on asset-backed securities, the security is referred to as a negative basis asset-backed security and the resulting derivative assets or liabilities have been classified as either level 2 or level 3 according to the classification of the underlying asset-backed security.\n\nCertain unobservable inputs used to calculate CVA, FVA, and own credit adjustments, are not significant in determining the classification of the derivative and debt instruments. Consequently, these inputs do not form part of the level 3 sensitivities presented.\n\n## Derivative valuation adjustments\n\nDerivative financial instruments which are carried in the balance sheet at fair value are adjusted where appropriate to reflect credit risk, market liquidity and other risks.\n\n(i) Uncollateralised derivative valuation adjustments\n\nThe following table summarises the movement on this valuation adjustment account during 2020 and 2021:\n\n|                                  | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                     | 474       | 423       |\n| Income statement (credit) charge | (18)      | 70        |\n| Transfers                        | -         | (19)      |\n| At 31 December                   | 456       | 474       |\n| Represented by:                  |           |           |\n|                                  | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n| Credit Valuation Adjustment      | 306       | 358       |\n| Debit Valuation Adjustment       | (26)      | (35)      |\n| Funding Valuation Adjustment     | 176       | 151       |\n|                                  | 456       | 474       |\n\nCredit and Debit Valuation Adjustments (CVA and DVA) are applied to the Group's over-the-counter derivative exposures with counterparties that are not subject to strong interbank collateral arrangements. These exposures largely relate to the provision of risk management solutions for corporate customers within the Commercial Banking division.\n\nA CVA is taken where the Group has a positive future uncollateralised exposure (asset). A DVA is taken where the Group has a negative future uncollateralised exposure (liability). These adjustments reflect interest rates and expectations of counterparty creditworthiness and the Group's own credit spread respectively.\n\nThe CVA is sensitive to:\n\n- \u00b7 The current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised asset\n- \u00b7 Expectations of counterparty creditworthiness\n- \u00b7 Expectations of future market volatility of the underlying asset\n\nMarket Credit Default Swap (CDS) spreads are used to develop the probability of default for quoted counterparties. For unquoted counterparties, internal credit ratings and market sector CDS curves and recovery rates are used. The loss given default (LGD) is based on market recovery rates and internal credit assessments.\n\nThe combination of a one-notch deterioration in the credit rating of derivative counterparties and a ten per cent increase in LGD increases the CVA by \u00a374/uni00A0million. Current market value is used to estimate the projected exposure for products not supported by the model, which are principally complex interest rate options that are traded in very low volumes. For these, the CVA is calculated on an add-on basis (although no such adjustment was required at 31 December 2021).\n\nThe DVA is sensitive to:\n\n- \u00b7 The current size of the mark-to-market position on the uncollateralised liability\n- \u00b7 The Group's own CDS spread\n- \u00b7 Expectations of future market volatility of the underlying liability\n\nA one per cent rise in the CDS spread would lead to an increase in the DVA of \u00a377 million.\n\nThe risk exposures that are used for the CVA and DVA calculations are strongly influenced by interest rates. Due to the nature of the Group's business the CVA/DVA exposures tend to be on average the same way around such that the valuation adjustments fall when interest rates rise. A one per cent rise in interest rates would lead to a \u00a365 million fall in the overall valuation adjustment to \u00a3215 million. The CVA model used by the Group does not assume any correlation between the level of interest rates and default rates.\n\nThe Group has also recognised a Funding Valuation Adjustment to adjust for the net cost of funding uncollateralised derivative positions. This adjustment is calculated on the expected future exposure discounted at a suitable cost of funds. A ten basis points increase in the cost of funds will increase the funding valuation adjustment by \u00a328 million.",

net market risk in the Group's trading positions within a time frame that is consistent with historical trading activity and spreads that the trading desks have accessed historically during the ordinary course of business in normal market conditions.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group's derivative trading business held mid to bid-offer valuation adjustments of \u00a363 million (2020: \u00a383

The earnings multiples used are derived from those of listed entities operating in the same sector with adjustments made for factors such as the size of the company and the quality of its earnings. The majority of the Group's venture capital investments are valued using an estimate of the company's maintainable earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines. A higher earnings multiple will result in a higher fair value\n\n## Reasonably possible alternative assumptions\n\nValuation techniques applied to many of the Group's level 3 instruments often involve the use of two or more inputs whose relationship is interdependent. The calculation of the effect of reasonably possible alternative assumptions included in the table above reflects such relationships.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nReasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of the Group's structured credit investment by flexing credit spreads.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nReasonably possible alternative assumptions have been determined in respect of swaptions in the Group's derivative portfolios which are priced using industry standard option pricing models. Such models require interest rate volatilities which may be unobservable at longer maturities. To derive reasonably possible alternative valuations these volatilities have been flexed within a range of 13 per cent to 168 per cent (2020: 13 per cent to 128 per cent).\n\nUnlisted equity, venture capital investments and investments in property partnerships\n\nThe valuation techniques used for unlisted equity and venture capital investments vary depending on the nature of the investment. Reasonably possible alternative valuations for these investments have been calculated by reference to the approach taken, as appropriate to the business sector and investment circumstances and as such the following inputs have been considered:\n\n- \u00b7 For valuations derived from earnings multiples, consideration is given to the risk attributes, growth prospects and financial gearing of comparable businesses when selecting an appropriate multiple\n- \u00b7 In line with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines, the values of underlying investments in fund investment portfolios\n- \u00b7 The discount rates used in discounted cash flow valuations\n\n## (4) Financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost\n\n## (A) Financial assets\n\n## Valuation hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses the fair values of the financial assets of the Group which are carried at amortised cost by valuation methodology (level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 291 ). Financial assets carried at amortised cost are mainly classified as level 3 due to significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation models. Where inputs are observable, debt securities are classified as level 1 or 2.\n\n|                                                                    |                   |               | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                                    | Carrying value \u00a3m | Fair value \u00a3m | Level 1 \u00a3m            | Level 2 \u00a3m            | Level 3 \u00a3m            |\n| At 31 December 2021                                                |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Loans and advances to banks and reverse repurchase agreements      | 10,533            | 10,529        | -                     | 3,532                 | 6,997                 |\n| Loans and advances to customers and reverse repurchase agreements: |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Stage 1                                                            | 450,342           | 452,758       | -                     | 51,221                | 401,537               |\n| Stage 2                                                            | 33,817            | 34,617        | -                     | -                     | 34,617                |\n| Stage 3                                                            | 4,862             | 4,851         | -                     | -                     | 4,851                 |\n| Purchased or originated credit-impaired                            | 10,767            | 10,767        | -                     | -                     | 10,767                |\n|                                                                    | 499,788           | 502,993       | -                     | 51,221                | 451,772               |\n| Debt securities                                                    | 6,835             | 6,876         | -                     | 6,739                 | 137                   |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements included in above amounts:           |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Loans and advances to banks and reverse repurchase agreements      | 3,532             | 3,532         | -                     | 3,532                 | -                     |\n| Loans and advances to customers and reverse repurchase agreements  | 51,221            | 51,221        | -                     | 51,221                | -                     |",

Due to their short-term nature, the carrying value of the variable rate loans and those relating to lease financing is assumed to be their fair value.\n\nTo determine the fair value of loans and advances to customers, loans are segregated into portfolios of similar characteristics. A number of techniques are used to estimate the fair value of fixed rate lending; these take account of expected credit losses based on historic trends, prevailing market interest rates and expected future cash flows. For retail exposures, fair value is usually estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows (including interest at contractual rates) at market rates for similar loans offered by the Group and other financial institutions. Certain loans secured on residential properties are made at a fixed rate for a limited period, typically two to five years, after which the loans revert to the relevant variable rate. The fair value of such loans is estimated by reference to the market rates for similar loans of maturity equal to the remaining fixed interest rate period. The fair value of commercial loans is estimated by discounting anticipated cash flows at a rate which reflects the effects of interest rate changes, adjusted for changes in credit risk.\n\nLoans and advances to banks\n\nThe carrying value of short-dated loans and advances to banks is assumed to be their fair value. The fair value of loans and advances to banks is estimated by discounting the anticipated cash flows at a market discount rate adjusted for the credit spread of the obligor or, where not observable, the credit spread of borrowers of similar credit quality.\n\n## Debt securities\n\nThe fair values of debt securities are determined predominantly from lead manager quotes and, where these are not available, by alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with the same obligor, market standard consensus pricing services, broker quotes and other research data.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements\n\nThe carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n## (B) Financial liabilities\n\nValuation hierarchy\n\nThe table below analyses the fair values of the financial liabilities of the Group which are carried at amortised cost by valuation methodology (level 1, 2 or 3, as described on page 291 ).\n\n|                                                  |                   |               | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   | Valuation hierarchy   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                  | Carrying value \u00a3m | Fair value \u00a3m | Level 1 \u00a3m            | Level 2 \u00a3m            | Level 3 \u00a3m            |\n| At 31 December 2021                              |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Deposits from banks and repurchase agreements    | 37,732            | 37,733        | -                     | 37,733                | -                     |\n| Customer deposits and repurchase agreements      | 477,384           | 477,546       | -                     | 477,546               | -                     |\n| Debt securities in issue                         | 71,552            | 74,665        | -                     | 74,665                | -                     |\n| Subordinated liabilities                         | 13,108            | 14,804        | -                     | 14,804                | -                     |\n| Repurchase agreements included in above amounts: |                   |               |                       |                       |                       |\n| Deposits from banks and repurchase agreements    | 30,085            | 30,085        | -                     | 30,085                | -                     |\n| Customer deposits and repurchase agreements      | 1,040             | 1,040         | -                     | 1,040                 | -                     |",

Fair value for other debt securities is calculated based on quoted market prices where available. Where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow techniques at a rate which reflects market rates of interest and the Group's own credit spread.\n\n## Subordinated liabilities\n\nThe fair value of subordinated liabilities is determined by reference to quoted market prices where available or by reference to quoted market prices of similar instruments. Subordinated liabilities are classified as level 2, since the inputs used to determine their fair value are largely observable.\n\nRepurchase agreements\n\nThe carrying amount is deemed a reasonable approximation of fair value given the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n## (5) Reclassifications of financial assets\n\nThere have been no reclassifications of financial assets in 2020 or 2021.\n\n## Note 49: Transfers of financial assets\n\nThere were no significant transferred financial assets which were derecognised in their entirety, but with ongoing exposure. Details of transferred financial assets that continue to be recognised in full are as follows.\n\nThe Group enters into repurchase and securities lending transactions in the normal course of business that do not result in derecognition of the financial assets as substantially all of the risks and rewards, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and other price risks are retained by the Group. In all cases, the transferee has the right to sell or repledge the assets concerned.\n\nAs set out in note 29, included within financial assets measured at amortised cost are loans transferred under the Group's securitisation and covered bond programmes. As the Group retains all or a majority of the risks and rewards associated with these loans, including credit, interest rate, prepayment and liquidity risk, they remain on the Group's balance sheet. Assets transferred into the Group's securitisation and covered bond programmes are not available to be used by the Group while the assets are within the programmes. However, the Group retains the right to remove loans from the covered bond programmes where they are in excess of the programme's requirements. In addition, where the Group has retained some of the notes issued by securitisation and covered bond programmes, the Group has the ability to sell or pledge these retained notes.\n\nThe table below sets out the carrying values of the transferred assets and the associated liabilities. For repurchase and securities lending transactions, the associated liabilities represent the Group's obligation to repurchase the transferred assets. For securitisation programmes, the associated liabilities represent the external notes in issue (note 29). The liabilities shown in the table below have recourse to the transferred assets.\n\n|                                                                   | 2021                                     | 2021                                         | 2020                                    | 2020                                        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                   | Carrying value of transferred  assets \u00a3m | Carrying value of associated  liabilities \u00a3m | Carrying value of transferred assets \u00a3m | Carrying value of associated liabilities \u00a3m |\n| Repurchase and securities lending transactions                    |                                          |                                              |                                         |                                             |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss             | 4,345                                    | 2,030                                        | 5,791                                   | 2,512                                       |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 8,085                                    | 6,244                                        | 6,025                                   | 5,105                                       |\n| Securitisation programmes                                         |                                          |                                              |                                         |                                             |\n| Financial assets at amortised cost:                               |                                          |                                              |                                         |                                             |\n| Loans and advances to customers 1                                 | 31,406                                   | 3,705                                        | 34,584                                  | 4,451                                       |\n\n- 1 The carrying value of associated liabilities excludes securitisation notes held by the Group of \u00a324,010 million (31 December 2020: \u00a327,448 million).",

The Group holds and provides cash and securities collateral in respective of derivative transactions covered by these agreements. The right to set off balances under these master netting agreements or to set off cash and securities collateral only arises in the event of non-payment or default and, as a result, these arrangements do not qualify for offsetting under IAS 32.\n\nThe effects of over-collateralisation have not been taken into account in the above table.",

        "page_content": "## Note 51: Financial risk management\n\nAs a bancassurer, financial instruments are fundamental to the Group's activities and, as a consequence, the risks associated with financial instruments represent a significant component of the risks faced by the Group.\n\nThe primary risks affecting the Group through its use of financial instruments are: market risk, which includes interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk; credit risk; liquidity risk; capital risk; and insurance risk. The following disclosures provide quantitative and qualitative information about the Group's exposure to these risks.\n\n## Market risk\n\n## (A) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises from the different repricing characteristics of the assets and liabilities. Liabilities are either insensitive to interest rate movements, for example interest free or very low interest customer deposits, or are sensitive to interest rate changes but bear rates which may be varied at the Group's discretion and that for competitive reasons generally reflect changes in the UK Bank Rate, set by the Bank of England. The rates on the remaining deposits are contractually fixed for their term to maturity.\n\nMany banking assets are sensitive to interest rate movements; there is a large volume of managed rate assets such as variable rate mortgages which may be considered as a natural offset to the interest rate risk arising from the managed rate liabilities. However, a significant proportion of the Group's lending assets, for example many personal loans and mortgages, bear interest rates which are contractually fixed. Interest rate sensitivity analysis relating to the Group's Banking activities is set out in the tables marked audited on page 146 .\n\nThe Group's risk management policy is to optimise reward while managing its market risk exposures within the risk appetite defined by the Board. The largest residual risk exposure arises from balances that are deemed to be insensitive to changes in market rates (including current accounts, a portion of variable rate deposits and investable equity), and is managed through the Group's structural hedge. The structural hedge consists of longer-term fixed rate assets or interest rate swaps and the amount and duration of the hedging activity is reviewed regularly by the Group Asset and Liability Committee.\n\nThe Group establishes hedge accounting relationships for interest rate risk using cash flow hedges and fair value hedges. The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt. The derivatives used to manage the structural hedge may be designated into cash flow hedges to manage income statement volatility. The economic items related to the structural hedge, for example current accounts, are not eligible hedged items under IAS 39 for inclusion into accounting hedge relationships. The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate customer loans, its fixed rate customer deposits and the majority of its subordinated debt, and to cash flow interest rate risk on its variable rate loans and deposits together with its floating rate subordinated debt. The Group applies netting between similar risks before applying hedge accounting.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness arises during the management of interest rate risk due to residual unhedged risk. Sources of ineffectiveness, which the Group may decide to not fully mitigate, can include basis differences, timing differences and notional amount differences. The effectiveness of accounting hedge relationships is assessed between the hedging derivatives and the documented hedged item, which can differ to the underlying economically hedged item.\n\nAt 31 December 2021 the aggregate notional principal of interest rate and other swaps (predominantly interest rate) designated as fair value hedges was \u00a3172,695 million (2020: \u00a3215,325 million) with a net fair value liability of \u00a3262 million (2020: asset of \u00a3211 million) (note 17). The gains on the hedging instruments were \u00a3944 million (2020: gains of \u00a3988 million). The losses on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risk were \u00a3767 million (2020: losses of \u00a3441 million). The gains and losses relating to the fair value hedges are recorded in net trading income.\n\nThe notional principal of the interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges at 31 December 2021 was \u00a3109,093 million (2020: \u00a3326,386 million) with a net fair value asset of \u00a35 million (2020: asset of \u00a330 million) (note 17). In 2021, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arises from cash flow hedges was a loss of \u00a369 million (2020: loss of \u00a32 million).\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nDuring 2021, the Group has continued to manage the transition to alternative benchmark rates under its Group-wide IBOR transition programme including delivery of the core changes required to its technology and business processes. Through this programme, the Group has ensured that the most appropriate benchmark rate is used for new products, has transitioned the vast majority of its legacy products to new benchmark rates for IBORs ceasing immediately after 31 December 2021 and has managed the impacts and risks relating to systems, processes, accounting and reporting. The Group does not expect material changes to its risk management approach and strategy as a result of interest rate benchmark reform.\n\nThe material risks identified include the following:\n\nConduct and litigation risk. The Group may be exposed to conduct and litigation charges as a direct result of inappropriate or negligent actions taken during IBOR transition resulting in detriment to the customer. The Group is working closely with its counterparties to avoid this outcome.\n\nMarket risk. IBOR transition is expected to lead to changes in the Group's market risk profile which will continue to be monitored and managed within the appropriate risk appetites. The key change is expected to be on the management of basis risk profile during the period when alternative benchmark rates are referenced in contracts up to the cessation of the in-scope IBOR index.\n\nCredit risk . Clients may wish to renegotiate the terms of existing transactions as a consequence of IBOR reform. This could lead to a change in the credit risk exposure of the client depending on the outcome of the negotiations. The Group will continue to monitor and manage changes within the appropriate risk appetites.\n\nAccounting risk. If IBOR transition is finalised in a manner that does not permit the application of the reliefs introduced in the IFRS Phase 2 amendments, the financial instrument may be required to be derecognised and a new instrument recognised. In addition, where instruments used in hedge accounting relationships are transitioned either at different times or to different benchmarks, this may result in additional volatility to the income statement either through hedge accounting ineffectiveness or failure of the hedge accounting relationships.\n\nOperational risk. Additional operational risks may arise due to the IBOR transition programme impacting all businesses and functions within the Group and leading to the implementation of changes to technology, operations, client communication and the valuation of in-scope financial instruments.",

US Dollar LIBOR is not expected to cease before 30 June 2023 and the Group continues to work on its planned transition to alternative benchmark rates for those financial contracts currently referencing US dollar LIBOR.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group had the following significant exposures impacted by interest rate benchmark reform which have yet to transition to the replacement benchmark rate:\n\n|                                                                   | Sterling LIBOR \u00a3m   | US Dollar  LIBOR \u00a3m   | Other LIBOR \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------|\n| Non-derivative financial assets                                   |                     |                       |                  |            |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss             | 1,753               | 268                   | -                | 2,021      |\n| Loans and advances to banks and reverse repurchase agreements     | -                   | 4,106                 | -                | 4,106      |\n| Loans and advances to customers and reverse repurchase agreements | 3,542               | 5,975                 | -                | 9,517      |\n| Debt securities                                                   | 126                 | -                     | -                | 126        |\n| Financial assets at amortised cost                                | 3,668               | 10,081                | -                | 13,749     |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 16                  | -                     | -                | 16         |\n| Other assets                                                      | -                   | -                     | -                | -          |\n|                                                                   | 5,437               | 10,349                | -                | 15,786     |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                              |                     |                       |                  |            |\n| Deposits from banks and reverse repurchase agreements             | -                   | -                     | -                | -          |\n| Customer deposits and reverse repurchase agreements               | -                   | 74                    | -                | 74         |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss        | -                   | 100                   | 3                | 103        |\n| Debt securities in issue                                          | -                   | 54                    | 26               | 80         |\n| Other liabilities                                                 | -                   | -                     | -                | -          |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                          | -                   | -                     | -                | -          |\n|                                                                   | -                   | 228                   | 29               | 257        |\n| Derivative notional/contract amount                               |                     |                       |                  |            |\n| Interest rate                                                     | 12,734              | 286,921               | -                | 299,655    |\n| Cross currency                                                    | -                   | 42,229                | -                | 42,229     |\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Sterling LIBOR balances in the above table relate to contracts that have not converted to a risk-free rate. The balance includes both contracts that mature in 2022 with further LIBOR interest rate fixings in the period and contracts where the counterparty has not yet agreed to fallback provisions that would have effect when LIBOR ceases. In both cases, these contracts will have both cash flows and valuations determined on a 'synthetic' LIBOR basis for reporting periods during 2022, unless they are transitioned to alternative benchmark rates.\n\nIn respect of the Group's hedge accounting relationships, for the purposes of determining whether:\n\n- \u00b7 A forecast transaction is highly probable\n- \u00b7 A hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk\n- \u00b7 Hedged future cash flows are expected to occur\n- \u00b7 An accounting hedging relationship should be discontinued because of a failure of the retrospective effectiveness test\n\nthe Group assumes that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged risk or the cash flows of the hedged item or hedging instrument are based is not altered by uncertainties resulting from interest rate benchmark reform. In addition, for a fair value hedge of a non-contractually specified benchmark portion of interest rate risk, the Group assesses only at inception of the hedge relationship and not on an ongoing basis that the risk is separately identifiable and hedge effectiveness can be measured. The Group's most significant hedge accounting relationships are exposed to the following interest rate benchmarks: Sterling LIBOR, US Dollar LIBOR and EURIBOR.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group expects that EURIBOR will continue to exist as a benchmark rate for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Group does not consider its fair value or cash flow hedges of the EURIBOR benchmark interest rate to be directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform and as a result does not anticipate changing the hedged risk to a different benchmark.\n\nThe notional amount of the hedged items that the Group has designated into cash flow hedge relationships that is directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform is \u00a33,258 million (2020: \u00a320,243 million), of which \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a316,523 million) relates to Sterling LIBOR and \u00a33,258 million (2020: \u00a33,720/uni00A0million) relates to US Dollar LIBOR. These are principally loans and advances to customers in Commercial Banking.\n\nThe interest rate benchmark reforms also affect assets and liabilities designated in fair value hedges. At 31 December 2021, the assets had a notional value of \u00a33,370 million and the liabilities had a notional value of \u00a322,437 million, all of which was in respect of US Dollar LIBOR. At 31 December 2020, the assets had a notional value of \u00a3107,340 million (of which \u00a3103,438 million was in respect of Sterling LIBOR) and the liabilities had a notional value of \u00a335,360 million (of which \u00a310,518 million was in respect of Sterling LIBOR). These fair value hedges principally relate to debt securities in issue.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the notional amount of the hedging instruments in hedging relationships to which these amendments apply was \u00a327,873 million, of which \u00a324,615 million relates to US Dollar LIBOR fair value hedges and \u00a33,258 million relates to US Dollar LIBOR cash flow hedges. At 31 December 2020, the notional amount of the hedging instruments in hedging relationships to which these amendments apply was \u00a3464,744 million, of which \u00a3116,498 million relates to Sterling LIBOR fair value hedges and \u00a3302,707 million relates to Sterling LIBOR cash flow hedges.",

        "page_content": "## Note 51: Financial risk management continued (B) Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe corporate and retail businesses incur foreign exchange risk in the course of providing services to their customers. All non-structural foreign exchange exposures in the non-trading book are managed centrally within allocated exposure limits. Trading book exposures in the authorised trading centres are allocated exposure limits. The limits are monitored daily by the local centres and reported to the market and liquidity risk function in London. Associated VaR and the closing, average, maximum and minimum are disclosed in the tables marked audited on page 148 .\n\nThe Group manages foreign currency accounting exposure via cash flow hedge accounting, utilising currency swaps and forward foreign exchange trades.\n\nRisk arises from the Group's investments in its overseas operations. The Group's structural foreign currency exposure is represented by the net asset value of the foreign currency equity and subordinated debt investments in its subsidiaries and branches. Gains or losses on structural foreign currency exposures are taken to reserves. The Group ceased all hedge accounting of the currency translation risk of the net investment in foreign operations in 2018.\n\nThe Group's main overseas operations are in the Americas and Europe. Details of the Group's structural foreign currency exposures are as follows:\n\n## (C) Functional currency of Group operations\n\n|          | 2021    | 2021         | 2021                   | 2020    | 2020         | 2020                   |\n|----------|---------|--------------|------------------------|---------|--------------|------------------------|\n|          | Euro \u00a3m | US Dollar \u00a3m | Other  non-Sterling \u00a3m | Euro \u00a3m | US Dollar \u00a3m | Other  non-Sterling \u00a3m |\n| Exposure | 115     | 134          | 7                      | 113     | 95           | 12                     |\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe Group's credit risk exposure arises in respect of the instruments below and predominantly in the United Kingdom. Credit risk appetite is set at Board level and is described and reported through a suite of metrics devised from a combination of accounting and credit portfolio performance measures, which include the use of various credit risk rating systems as inputs and assess credit risk at a counterparty level using three components: (i) the probability of default by the counterparty on its contractual obligations; (ii) the current exposures to the counterparty and their likely future development, from which the Group derives the exposure at default; and (iii) the likely loss ratio on the defaulted obligations, the loss given default. The Group uses a range of approaches to mitigate credit risk, including internal control policies, obtaining collateral, using master netting agreements and other credit risk transfers, such as asset sales and credit derivatives based transactions.\n\n## (A) Maximum credit exposure\n\nThe maximum credit risk exposure of the Group in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations is detailed below. No account is taken of any collateral held and the maximum exposure to loss, which includes amounts held to cover unit-linked and With Profits Funds liabilities, is considered to be the balance sheet carrying amount or, for non-derivative off-balance sheet transactions and financial guarantees, their contractual nominal amounts.\n\n|                                                                                              | 2021                 | 2021        | 2021            | 2020                 | 2020        | 2020            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n|                                                                                              | Maximum  exposure \u00a3m | Offset 1 \u00a3m | Net exposure \u00a3m | Maximum  exposure \u00a3m | Offset 1 \u00a3m | Net exposure \u00a3m |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 2,3 :                                  |                      |             |                 |                      |             |                 |\n| Loans and advances                                                                           | 29,538               | -

Credit policies and appetite statements are aligned to the Group's risk appetite and restrict exposure to higher risk countries and potentially vulnerable sectors and asset classes. Exposures are monitored to prevent both an excessive concentration of risk and single name concentrations. The Group's largest credit limits are regularly monitored by the Board Risk Committee and reported in accordance with regulatory requirements. As part of its credit risk policy, the Group considers sustainability risk (which incorporates Environmental (including climate), Social and Governance) in the assessment of Commercial Banking facilities.\n\nAt 31 December 2021 the most significant concentrations of exposure were in mortgages (comprising 64 per cent of total loans and advances to customers) and to financial, business and other services (comprising 17 per cent of the total).\n\n|                                                                                                                | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Agriculture, forestry and fishing                                                                              | 7,729     | 7, 8 3 6  |\n| Energy and water supply                                                                                        | 1,978     | 1,313     |\n| Manufacturing                                                                                                  | 4,110     | 4,956     |\n| Construction                                                                                                   | 4,440     | 5,096     |\n| Transport, distribution and hotels                                                                             | 13,463    | 14,341    |\n| Postal and telecommunications                                                                                  | 2,109     | 2,665     |\n| Property companies                                                                                             | 23,923    | 26,061    |\n| Financial, business and other services                                                                         | 84,754    | 92,555    |\n| Personal:                                                                                                      |           |           |\n| Mortgages 1                                                                                                    | 319,655   | 307,087   |\n| Other                                                                                                          | 24,604    | 25,363    |\n| Lease financing                                                                                                | 982       | 1,182     |\n| Hire purchase                                                                                                  | 15,861    | 16,148    |\n| Total loans and advances to customers and reverse repurchase agreements before allowance for impairment losses | 503,608   | 504,603   |\n| Allowance for impairment losses (note 18)                                                                      | (3,820)   | (5,760)   |\n| Total loans and advances to customers and reverse repurchase agreements                                        | 499,788   | 498,843   |\n\n- 1 Includes both UK and overseas mortgage balances.\n\nThe Group's operations are predominantly UK-based and as a result an analysis of credit risk exposures by geographical region is not provided.\n\n## (C) Credit quality of assets\n\n## Loans and advances\n\nThe analysis of lending has been prepared based on the division in which the asset is held; with the business segment in which the exposure is recorded reflected in the ratings system applied.

Consequently, the Group has no significant exposure to credit risk for such assets which back those contract liabilities.\n\n## Derivative assets\n\nAn analysis of derivative assets is given in note 17. The Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities. In respect of the Group's net credit risk relating to derivative assets of \u00a310,451 million (2020: \u00a313,747 million), cash collateral of \u00a35,658 million (2020: \u00a38,715 million) was held and a further \u00a3253 million was due from OECD banks (2020: \u00a3454 million).\n\n|                                        | 2021                   | 2021       | 2021     | 2020                   | 2020       | 2020     |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|----------|------------------------|------------|----------|\n|                                        | Investment  grade 1 \u00a3m | Other 2 \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Investment  grade 1 \u00a3m | Other 2 \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Trading and other                      | 20,193                 | 1,772      | 21,965   | 26,782                 | 2,015      | 28,797   |\n| Hedging                                | 81                     | 5          | 86       | 810                    | 6          | 816      |\n| Total derivative financial instruments | 20,274                 | 1,777      | 22,051   | 27, 592                | 2,021      | 29,613   |\n\n- 1 Credit ratings equal to or better than 'BBB'.\n- 2 Other comprises sub-investment grade (2021: \u00a31,471 million; 2020: \u00a31,499 million) and not rated (2021: \u00a3306 million; 2020: \u00a3522 million).",

Commitments to extend credit represent unused portions of authorisations to extend credit in the form of loans, guarantees or letters of credit. The Group is theoretically exposed to loss in an amount equal to the total guarantees or unused commitments, however, the likely amount of loss is expected to be significantly less. Most commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards.\n\n## (D) Collateral held as security for financial assets\n\nThe principal types of collateral accepted by the Group include: residential and commercial properties; charges over business assets such as premises, inventory and accounts receivable; financial instruments, cash and guarantees from third-parties. The terms and conditions associated with the use of the collateral are varied and are dependent on the type of agreement and the counterparty. The Group holds collateral against loans and advances and irrevocable loan commitments; qualitative and, where appropriate, quantitative information is provided in respect of this collateral below. Collateral held as security for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and for derivative assets is also shown below.\n\nThe Group holds collateral in respect of loans and advances to banks and customers as set out below. The Group does not hold collateral against debt securities, comprising asset-backed securities and corporate and other debt securities, which are classified as financial assets held at amortised cost.\n\n## Loans and advances to banks\n\nThere were reverse repurchase agreements which are accounted for as collateralised loans within loans and advances to banks with a carrying value of \u00a33,532 million (2020: \u00a32,686 million), against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of \u00a3620 million (2020: \u00a32,682 million).\n\nThese transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.\n\n## Loans and advances to customers\n\n## Retail lending\n\n## Mortgages\n\nAn analysis by loan-to-value ratio of the Group's residential mortgage lending is provided below. The value of collateral used in determining the loan-tovalue ratios has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account subsequent movements in house prices, after making allowances for indexation error and dilapidations. The market takes into account many factors, including environmental considerations such as flood risk and energy efficient additions, in arriving at the value of a home.\n\nIn some circumstances, where the discounted value of the estimated net proceeds from the liquidation of collateral (i.e. net of costs, expected haircuts and anticipated changes in the value of the collateral to the point of sale) is greater than the estimated exposure at default, no credit losses are expected and no ECL allowance is recognised.\n\n|                             | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Drawn balances   | Expected credit losses   | Expected credit losses   | Expected credit losses   | Expected credit losses   | Expected credit losses   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                             | Stage 1 \u00a3m       | Stage 2 \u00a3m       | Stage 3 \u00a3m       | POCI \u00a3m          | Total gross \u00a3m   | Stage 1 \u00a3m               | Stage 2 \u00a3m               | Stage 3 \u00a3m               | POCI \u00a3m                  | Total gross \u00a3m           |\n| At 31 December 2021         |                  |                  |                  |                  |                  |                          |                          |                          |                          |                          |\n| Less than 70 per cent       | 217,830          | 19,766           | 1,717            | 9,872            | 249,185          | 31                       | 247                      | 98                       | 110                      | 486                      |\n| 70 per cent to 80 per cent  | 42,808           | 1,632            | 134              | 572              | 45,146           | 11                       | 80                       | 38                       | 26                       | 155                      |\n| 80 per cent to 90 per cent  | 12,087           | 253              | 52               | 184              | 12,576           | 5                        | 28                       | 23                       | 16                       | 72                       |\n| 90 per cent to 100 per cent | 779              | 46               | 14               | 135              | 974              | -

At 31 December 2021, Stage 3 non-mortgage lending amounted to \u00a31,104 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3438 million (2020: \u00a3538 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3492 million).\n\nStage 1 and Stage 2 non-mortgage retail lending amounted to \u00a355,959 million (2020: \u00a358,183 million). Lending decisions are predominantly based on an obligor's ability to repay rather than reliance on the disposal of any security provided. Where the lending is secured, collateral values are rigorously assessed at the time of loan origination and are thereafter monitored in accordance with business unit credit policy.\n\nThe Group's credit risk disclosures for unimpaired non-mortgage retail lending report assets gross of collateral and therefore disclose the maximum loss exposure. The Group believes that this approach is appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 51: Financial risk management continued\n\n## Commercial lending\n\nReverse repurchase transactions\n\nAt 31 December 2021 there were reverse repurchase agreements which were accounted for as collateralised loans with a carrying value of \u00a351,221 million (2020: \u00a358,643 million), against which the Group held collateral with a fair value of \u00a352,690 million (2020: \u00a359,157 million), all of which the Group was able to repledge. These transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.\n\n## Stage 3 secured lending\n\nThe value of collateral is re-evaluated and its legal soundness re-assessed if there is observable evidence of distress of the borrower; this evaluation is used to determine potential loss allowances and management's strategy to try to either repair the business or recover the debt.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, Stage 3 secured commercial lending amounted to \u00a3636 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3198 million (2020: \u00a3739 million, net of an impairment allowance of \u00a3294 million). The fair value of the collateral held in respect of impaired secured commercial lending was \u00a3693 million (2020: \u00a3753 million). In determining the fair value of collateral, no specific amounts have been attributed to the costs of realisation. For the purposes of determining the total collateral held by the Group in respect of impaired secured commercial lending, the value of collateral for each loan has been limited to the principal amount of the outstanding advance in order to eliminate the effects of any over-collateralisation and to provide a clearer representation of the Group's exposure.\n\nStage 3 secured commercial lending and associated collateral relates to lending to property companies and to customers in the financial, business and other services; transport, distribution and hotels; and construction industries.\n\n## Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured lending\n\nFor Stage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending, the Group reports assets gross of collateral and therefore discloses the maximum loss exposure. The Group believes that this approach is appropriate as collateral values at origination and during a period of good performance may not be representative of the value of collateral if the obligor enters a distressed state.\n\nStage 1 and Stage 2 secured commercial lending is predominantly managed on a cash flow basis. On occasion, it may include an assessment of underlying collateral, although, for Stage 3 lending, this will not always involve assessing it on a fair value basis. No aggregated collateral information for the entire unimpaired secured commercial lending portfolio is provided to key management personnel.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (excluding equity shares)\n\nIncluded in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are reverse repurchase agreements treated as collateralised loans with a carrying value of \u00a314,921 million (2020: \u00a312,993 million). Collateral is held with a fair value of \u00a315,640 million (2020: \u00a313,169 million), all of which the Group is able to repledge. At 31 December 2021, \u00a37,251 million had been repledged (2020: \u00a310,049 million).\n\nIn addition, securities held as collateral in the form of stock borrowed amounted to \u00a314,100 million (2020: \u00a354,232 million). Of this amount, \u00a36,537 million (2020: \u00a352,887 million) had been resold or repledged as collateral for the Group's own transactions.\n\nThese transactions were generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard secured lending activities.\n\n## Derivative assets, after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements\n\nThe Group reduces exposure to credit risk by using master netting agreements and by obtaining collateral in the form of cash or highly liquid securities. In respect of the net derivative assets after offsetting of amounts under master netting arrangements of \u00a310,451 million (2020: \u00a313,747 million), cash collateral of \u00a35,658 million (2020: \u00a38,715 million) was held.\n\n## Irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group held irrevocable loan commitments and other credit-related contingencies of \u00a373,902 million (2020: \u00a376,515 million). Collateral is held as security, in the event that lending is drawn down, on \u00a317,149 million (2020: \u00a319,548 million) of these balances.\n\n## Collateral repossessed\n\nDuring the year, \u00a386 million of collateral was repossessed (2020: \u00a3125 million), consisting primarily of residential property.\n\nIn respect of retail portfolios, the Group does not take physical possession of properties or other assets held as collateral and uses external agents to realise the value as soon as practicable, generally at auction, to settle indebtedness. Any surplus funds are returned to the borrower or are otherwise dealt with in accordance with appropriate insolvency regulations. In certain circumstances the Group takes physical possession of assets held as collateral against commercial lending. In such cases, the assets are carried on the Group's balance sheet and are classified according to the Group's accounting policies.\n\n## (E) Collateral pledged as security\n\nThe Group pledges assets primarily for repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary for standard securitised borrowing contracts.\n\n## Repurchase transactions\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nThere are balances arising from repurchase transactions with banks of \u00a330,085 million (2020: \u00a318,767 million), which include amounts due under the Bank of England's Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME); the fair value of the collateral provided under these agreements at 31 December 2021 was \u00a339,918 million (2020: \u00a318,874 million).\n\nThere are balances arising from repurchase transactions with customers of \u00a31,040 million (2020: \u00a39,417 million); the fair value of the collateral provided under these agreements at 31 December 2021 was \u00a3903 million (2020: \u00a38,087 million).\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nThe fair value of collateral pledged in respect of repurchase transactions, accounted for as secured borrowing, where the secured party is permitted by contract or custom to repledge was \u00a314,350 million (2020: \u00a312,608 million).\n\n## Securities lending transactions\n\nThe following on-balance sheet financial assets have been lent to counterparties under securities lending transactions:\n\n|                                                                   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss             | 2,348     | 3,224     |\n| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income | 1,918     | 894       |\n| Total                                                             | 4,266     | 4,118     |",

Further details of these assets are provided in note 29.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group has insufficient financial resources to meet its commitments as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost. Liquidity risk is managed through a series of measures, tests and reports that are primarily based on contractual maturity. The Group carries out monthly stress testing of its liquidity position against a range of scenarios, including those prescribed by the PRA. The Group's liquidity risk appetite is also calibrated against a number of stressed liquidity metrics.\n\nThe table below analyses assets and liabilities of the Group, other than liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining contractual period at the balance sheet date; balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category. Liabilities arising from insurance and investment contracts are analysed on a behavioural basis. Certain balances, included in the table below on the basis of their residual maturity, are repayable on demand upon payment of a penalty.\n\n## (A) Maturities of assets and liabilities\n\n|                                                                    | Up to 1  month \u00a3m   | 1-3  months \u00a3m   | 3-6  months \u00a3m   | 6-9  months \u00a3m   | 9-12  months \u00a3m   | 1-2 years \u00a3m   | 2-5 years \u00a3m   | Over  5/uni00A0years \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| At 31 December 2021                                                |                     |                  |                  |                  |                   |                |                |                           |            |\n| Assets                                                             |                     |                  |                  |                  |                   |                |                |                           |            |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                 | 76,420              | -

The Group's assets and liabilities may be repaid or otherwise mature earlier or later than implied by their contractual terms and readers are, therefore, advised to use caution when using this data to evaluate the Group's liquidity position. In particular, amounts in respect of customer deposits are usually contractually payable on demand or at short notice. However, in practice, these deposits are not usually withdrawn on their contractual maturity.\n\nThe table below analyses financial instrument liabilities of the Group, excluding those arising from insurance and participating investment contracts, on an undiscounted future cash flow basis according to contractual maturity, into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date; balances with no fixed maturity are included in the over 5 years category.\n\n|                                                                 | Up to 1/uni00A0month \u00a3m   | 1-3 months \u00a3m   | 3-12 months \u00a3m   | 1-5 years \u00a3m   | Over 5/uni00A0years \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| At 31 December 2021                                             |                           |                 |                  |                |                          |            |\n| Deposits from banks and repurchase agreements                   | 2,436                     | 699             | 959              | 35,200         | 240                      | 39,534     |\n| Customer deposits and repurchase agreements                     | 457,607                   | 6,312           | 6,613            | 7, 2 55        | 676                      | 478,463    |\n| Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss      | 6,371                     | 5,037           | 4,071            | 2,130          | 5,826                    | 23,435     |\n| Debt securities in issue                                        | 5,804                     | 5,722           | 16,728           | 34,562         | 10,606                   | 73,422     |\n| Liabilities arising from non-participating investment contracts | 45,040                    | -               | -                | -              | -                        | 45,040     |\n| Lease liabilities                                               | 2                         | 64              | 167              | 605            | 927                      | 1,765      |\n| Subordinated liabilities                                        | 54                        | 78              | 677              | 9,558          | 9,114                    | 19,481     |\n| Total non-derivative financial liabilities                      | 517,314                   | 17,912          | 29,215           | 89,310         | 27, 389                  | 681,140    |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                                |                           |                 |                  |                |                          |            |\n| Gross settled derivatives - outflows                            | 39,184                    | 30,271          | 32,267           | 39,429         | 21,709                   | 162,860    |\n| Gross settled derivatives - inflows                             | (38,231)                  | (29,283)        | (31,453)         | (38,137)       | (19,834)                 | (156,938)  |\n| Gross settled derivatives - net flows                           | 953                       | 988             | 814              | 1,292          | 1,875                    | 5,922      |\n| Net settled derivative liabilities                              | 12,099                    | 60              | 52               | 429            | 1,350                    | 13,990     |\n| Total derivative financial liabilities                          | 13,052                    | 1,048           | 866              | 1,721          | 3,225                    | 19,912     |",

The Group measures both its capital requirements and the amount of capital resources that it holds to meet those requirements through applying capital directives and regulations as implemented in the UK by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and supplemented through additional regulation under the PRA Rulebook and associated statements of policy, supervisory statements and other guidance. Regulatory capital ratios are considered a key part of the budgeting and planning processes and forecast ratios are reviewed by the Group Asset and Liability Committee. Target capital levels take account of current and future regulatory requirements, capacity for growth and to cover uncertainties. Details of the Group's capital resources are provided in the table marked audited on page 180 .\n\nEach insurance company within the Group is regulated by the PRA. The insurance businesses are required to calculate solvency capital requirements and available capital in accordance with Solvency II. The Insurance business of the Group calculates regulatory capital on the basis of an internal model, which was approved by the PRA on 5 December 2015, with the latest major change to the model approved in November 2020. The capital position of the Group's insurance businesses is reviewed on a regular basis by the Insurance and Wealth Executive Committee.\n\n## Insurance risk\n\nInsurance underwriting risk is the risk of adverse developments in the timing, frequency and severity of claims for insured/underwritten events and in customer behaviour, leading to reductions in earnings and/or value and arises within the Group's Insurance business. Insurance underwriting risk is measured using a variety of techniques including stress, reverse stress and scenario testing, as well as stochastic modelling. Current and potential future insurance underwriting risk exposures are assessed and aggregated on a range of stresses including risk measures based on 1-in-200 year stresses for the Insurance business' regulatory capital assessments and other supporting measures where appropriate. The Group also mitigates insurance underwriting risk via the use of reinsurance arrangements.\n\n## Note 52: Consolidated cash flow statement\n\n## (A) Change in operating assets\n\nChange in financial assets held at amortised cost\n\n(2,516)\n\n( 7, 6 3 4)\n\n(12,423)\n\nChange in financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\n(15,565)\n\n( 8 ,147)\n\n(9,973)\n\nChange in derivative financial instruments\n\n6,132\n\n(2,894)\n\n(1,846)\n\nChange in other operating assets\n\n1,447\n\n25\n\n13,193\n\nChange in operating assets\n\n(10,502)\n\n(18,650)\n\n(11, 0 49)\n\n(B) Change in operating liabilities\n\n|                                                                      | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Change in deposits from banks and repurchase agreements              | 6,266     | 3,287     | (2,140)   |\n| Change in customer deposits and repurchase agreements                | 17, 295   | 38,805    | 3,248     |\n| Change in financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss | 391       | 1,085     | (9,480)   |\n| Change in derivative financial instruments                           | (9,258)   | 1,534     | 4,402     |\n| Change in debt securities in issue                                   | (15,896)  | (10,142)  | 6,631     |\n| Change in investment contract liabilities                            | 6,588     | 993       | 2,625     |\n| Change in other operating liabilities 1                              | (432)     | 175       | (1,644)   |\n| Change in operating liabilities                                      | 4,954     | 35,737    | 3,642     |\n\n- 1 Includes a decrease of \u00a3197 million (2020: decrease of \u00a3172 million; 2019: increase of \u00a382 million) in respect of lease liabilities.\n\n2021\n\n\u00a3m\n\n\u00a3m\n\n\u00a3m\n\n2020\n\n2019",

The acquisition will enable the Group to re-platform its pensions and retirement proposition.\n\nFollowing completion, Embark Group Limited issued 6,457 shares (0.5 per cent of total share capital) to an employee of Embark Group Limited for consideration of \u00a32 million. The Group will consolidate Embark from 31 January 2022. The employee is expected to retain a 0.5 per cent non-controlling interest in Embark Group Limited for a period of at least two years.\n\nBecause of the limited time available between the acquisition and the approval of these financial statements, the Group is still in the process of establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and the associated identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. At 31 December 2021, Embark had net assets of \u00a355 million including cash at bank of \u00a343 million, intangible assets and goodwill of \u00a329 million and trade and other receivables of \u00a33 million. Acquisitionrelated costs of \u00a310 million have been included in operating expenses for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## Share buyback\n\nThe Board has announced its intention to implement an ordinary share buyback of up to \u00a32.0 billion. This represents the return to shareholders of capital surplus to that required to provide capacity to grow the business, meet current and future regulatory requirements and cover uncertainties. The share buyback programme will commence as soon as is practicable and is expected to be completed, subject to continued authority from the PRA, by 31 December 2022.\n\n## Note 54: Future accounting developments\n\nThe following pronouncements are not applicable for the year ending 31 December 2021 and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements. Save as disclosed below, the impact of these accounting changes is still being assessed by the Group and reliable estimates cannot be made at this stage.\n\nWith the exception of IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts and certain other minor amendments, as at 23 February 2022 these pronouncements have been endorsed for use in the United Kingdom.\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nIFRS 17 requires insurance contracts and participating investment contracts to be measured on the balance sheet as the total of the fulfilment cash flows and the contractual service margin. The fulfilment cash flows consist of the present value of future cash flows, together with an explicit risk adjustment, and are required to be remeasured at each reporting date. The contractual service margin is equal and opposite to any day one gain in the fulfilment cash flows of a group of contracts and represents the unearned profit of the insurance contracts. Changes to estimates of future cash flows from one reporting date to another are recognised either as an amount in profit or loss or as an adjustment to the expected profit for providing insurance coverage, depending on the type of change and the reason for it. The effects of some changes in discount rates can either be recognised in profit or loss or in other comprehensive income as an accounting policy choice. The risk adjustment is released to profit and loss as an insurer's risk reduces. Profits which are currently recognised through a value in-force asset under IFRS 4 will no longer be recognised at inception of an insurance contract. Instead, the expected profit for providing insurance coverage is recognised in the contractual service margin and released to profit or loss over time as the insurance coverage is provided.\n\nThe standard will have a significant impact on the accounting for the insurance and participating investment contracts issued by the Group as, while the profits which emerge under IFRS 17 would not be different over the lifetime of an insurance contract compared to current accounting, the timing of profit recognition means that profits from insurance contracts for a given reporting period would be lower than under IFRS 4. Transition from IFRS 4 to IFRS 17 will result in a reduction to retained earnings as a proportion of previously recognised profits from insurance contracts is included in the contractual service margin established as a liability, reflecting the retrospective application of IFRS 17 to the existing book of insurance contracts written by the Group.\n\nThe standard is not expected to be effective until 1 January 2023, with a transition date of 1 January 2022 (reflecting the starting point for comparative results), and management is currently unable to quantify with reasonable assurance the estimated impact on transition to IFRS 17. This is because the impact on transition will need to incorporate economic conditions and risks at the time of the transition date, and calculation of the transition impacts is planned to be undertaken during 2022.\n\nThe Group's IFRS 17 project is progressing to plan. Work has focused on interpreting the requirements of the standard, developing methodologies, disclosures and accounting policies, and implementing the changes required to reporting and other systems. The development of the Group's data warehousing and actuarial liability calculation processes required for IFRS 17 reporting continues to progress, with testing underway and business readiness activity due to take place in 2022, ahead of full implementation from 1 January 2023.\n\n## Minor amendments to other accounting standards\n\nThe IASB has issued a number of minor amendments to IFRSs effective 1 January 2022 and in later years (including IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets ). These amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the parent company financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 December\n\n## Note 1: Basis of preparation and accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements of Lloyds Banking Group plc have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nThe financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and all derivative contracts. The accounting policies of the Company are the same as those of the Group which are set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Investments in subsidiaries are carried at historical cost, less any provisions for impairment. Fees payable to the Company's auditors by the Group are set out in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Company has presented its balance sheet on a liquidity basis, a change for the prior year, as it believes that this provides a more relevant presentation of its balance sheet given the Company's position as the ultimate parent undertaking of a financial services group without a fixed operating cycle. There is no impact on the carrying amounts of the comparative information. The comparative balance sheet has been presented on the same liquidity basis.\n\n## Note 2: Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\n|                 | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Debt securities | 20,362    | 14,362    |\n\nThe assets held at fair value through profit or loss represent holdings of debt securities issued by subsidiary companies. The contractual terms of such instruments contain certain write-down and conversion features, and so are not considered to satisfy the solely payments of principal and interest test.\n\n## Note 3: Amounts due from subsidiaries\n\nThese comprise short-term lending to subsidiaries, repayable on demand. As required by IFRS 9, the Company has established an allowance for impairment losses for amounts due from its subsidiaries (31 December 2021: \u00a33 million; 31 December 2020: \u00a33 million) based on the probability of its subsidiaries defaulting on the amounts payable in the next 12 months. The carrying value of the amounts owed by subsidiaries is a reasonable approximation to fair value.\n\n## Note 4: Deferred tax\n\nAs at 31 December 2021 the Company carried a deferred tax asset of \u00a326 million (2020: \u00a310 million); there was no deferred tax liability at 31 December 2021 or 31 December 2020. The movement in the deferred tax asset during 2021 primarily related to share-based payments (giving rise to a \u00a317 million credit to equity).\n\n## Note 5: Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss represent debt securities in issue which are accounted for at fair value to significantly reduce an accounting mismatch. The changes in the credit risk of these liabilities are linked to the changes in credit risk on corresponding assets that the Company holds at fair value through profit or loss, representing debt securities issued by subsidiaries. Given the economic relationship between these assets and liabilities, the Company presents changes in the credit risk of its liabilities in profit or loss in order to avoid creating or enlarging an accounting mismatch.\n\nThe amount contractually payable on maturity of the debt securities held at fair value through profit or loss at 31 December 2021 was \u00a39,388 million, which was \u00a3360 million lower than the balance sheet carrying value (2020: \u00a38,060 million which was \u00a3575 million lower than the balance sheet carrying value). At 31 December 2021 there was a cumulative \u00a3542 million increase in the fair value of these liabilities attributable to changes in credit risk (2020: increase of \u00a3541 million), of which \u00a31 million arose in 2021 and \u00a3440 million arose in 2020; this is determined by reference to the quoted credit spreads of the Company.\n\n## Note 6: Debt securities in issue\n\nThese comprise notes issued by the Company in a number of currencies, although predominantly Euros and US Dollars, with maturity dates ranging up to 2038.",

If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is and we would ask that shareholders take steps to protect themselves. We strongly recommend seeking advice from an independent financial adviser authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Shareholders can verify whether a firm is authorised via the Financial Services Register which is available at www.fca.org.uk\n\nIf a shareholder is concerned that they may have been targeted by such a scheme, please contact the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 or use the online 'Share Fraud Reporting Form' available from their website (see above). We would also recommend contacting the Police through Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or visiting www.actionfraud.org.uk for further information.\n\nImportant shareholder and registrar information\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Company website\n\nwww.lloydsbankinggroup.com\n\n## Shareholder information\n\nhelp.shareview.co.uk\n\n(from here you will be able to email your query securely)\n\n## Registrar\n\nEquiniti Limited Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing\n\nWest Sussex BN99 6DA\n\n## Shareholder helpline\n\n0371 384 2990* from within the UK +44 121 415 7066 from outside the UK\n\n- * Lines are open from 8.30 am to 5.30 pm Monday to Friday, excluding English and Welsh public holidays.\n\nThe company registrar is Equiniti Limited.

Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about the Group's or its directors' and/or management's beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. Words such as, without limitation, 'believes', 'achieves', 'anticipates', 'estimates', 'expects', 'targets', 'should', 'intends', 'aims', 'projects', 'plans', 'potential', 'will', 'would', 'could', 'considered', 'likely', 'may', 'seek', 'estimate', 'probability', 'goal', 'objective', 'deliver', 'endeavour', 'prospects', 'optimistic' and similar expressions or variations on these expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. These statements concern or may affect future matters, including but not limited to: projections or expectations of the Group's future financial position, including profit attributable to shareholders, provisions, economic profit, dividends, capital structure, portfolios, net interest margin, capital ratios, liquidity, riskweighted assets (RWAs), expenditures or any other financial items or ratios; litigation, regulatory and governmental investigations; the Group's future financial performance; the level and extent of future impairments and write-downs; the Group's ESG targets and/or commitments; statements of plans, objectives or goals of the Group or its management and other statements that are not historical fact; expectations about the impact of COVID-19; and statements of assumptions underlying such statements. By their nature, forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend upon circumstances that will or may occur in the future. Factors that could cause actual business, strategy, plans and/or results (including but not limited to the payment of dividends) to differ materially from forward looking statements include, but are not limited to: general economic and business conditions in the UK and internationally; market related risks, trends and developments; risks concerning borrower and counterparty credit quality; fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, exchange rates, stock markets and currencies; volatility in credit markets; volatility in the price of our securities; any impact of the transition from IBORs to alternative reference rates; the ability to access sufficient sources of capital, liquidity and funding when required; changes to the Group's credit ratings; the ability to derive cost savings and other benefits including, but without limitation, as a result of any acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transactions; inability to capture accurately the expected value from acquisitions; potential changes in dividend\n\npolicy; the ability to achieve strategic objectives; insurance risks; management and monitoring of conduct risk; exposure to counterparty risk; credit rating risk; tightening of monetary policy in jurisdictions in which the Group operates; instability in the global financial markets, including within the Eurozone, and as a result of ongoing uncertainty following the exit by the UK from the European Union (EU) and the effects of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement; political instability including as a result of any UK general election and any further possible referendum on Scottish independence; operational risks; conduct risk; technological changes and risks to the security of IT and operational infrastructure, systems, data and information resulting from increased threat of cyber and other attacks; natural pandemic (including but not limited to the COVID-19 pandemic) and other disasters; inadequate or failed internal or external processes or systems; acts of hostility or terrorism and responses to those acts, or other such events; geopolitical unpredictability; risks relating to sustainability and climate change (and achieving climate change ambitions), including the Group's ability along with the government and other stakeholders to measure, manage and mitigate the impacts of climate change effectively; changes in laws, regulations, practices and accounting standards or taxation; changes to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements and similar contingencies; assessment related to resolution planning requirements; the policies and actions of governmental or regulatory authorities or courts together with any resulting impact on the future structure of the Group; failure to comply with anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing, anti-bribery and sanctions regulations; failure to prevent or detect any illegal or improper activities; projected employee numbers and key person risk; increased labour costs; assumptions and estimates that form the basis of our financial statements; the impact of competitive conditions; and exposure to legal, regulatory or competition proceedings, investigations or complaints. A number of these influences and factors are beyond the Group's control. Please refer to the latest Annual Report on Form 20-F filed by Lloyds Banking Group plc with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), which is available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov, for a discussion of certain factors and risks. Lloyds Banking Group plc may also make or disclose written and/or oral forward-looking statements in other written materials and in oral statements made by the directors, officers or employees of Lloyds Banking Group plc to third parties, including financial analysts. Except as required by any applicable law or regulation, the forward-looking statements contained in this document are made as of today's date, and the Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements contained in this document whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
