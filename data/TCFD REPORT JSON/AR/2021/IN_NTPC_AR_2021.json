While resumption of economic activity and the revival of investment have driven demand, supply has been challenged by availability issues and logistics bottlenecks. Globally, the fuel prices have increased significantly, and this has made Energy Security the topmost priority for every nation.\n\nThe country faced an unprecedented coal crisis last year which continued this year as well. Domestic coal supply has not kept pace with the required demand, leading to increased need for importing coal. Further, the abnormal increase in LNG and imported coal prices have led to decrease in power generation from these sources which has increased the gap between demand and supply. This led to substantial increase in the electricity generation costs which reflected in the all-time high levels of Market Clearing Prices in the Power Exchange.\n\nYour Company has been carefully monitoring the fuel supply situation and has taken corrective actions on a continuous basis to ensure energy security for the country by ensuring reliable fuel supplies. This has been done by arranging maximum possible coal supplies from domestic sources, ramping up coal production from captive mines and sourcing imported coal to ensure that no station is starved of fuel.\n\nThe developments across the globe are expected to accelerate the energy transition plans of every nation. As part of your Company's energy transition programme, along with renewable energy sources, we have started working on storage technologies and discussions are underway for adding Nuclear capacity as well. We are also working with NITI Aayog and have signed a Statement of Intent for preparing our 'Net Zero' plan in line with the country's commitment.\n\nOn the business front, FY 2021-22 was another transformative year for your Company. We have improved our generation share and rolled out important initiatives that will ensure continued success in the future.\n\n## Robust growth despite supply chain disruptions:\n\nThe Company's generation crossed the 350 BUs mark for the first time and recorded an all-time high generation of 360 BUs, registering a growth of 15% as compared to the country's generation growth of 8% in the same period. This means, we generated almost 1 BU on an average every day. Further, in FY 2022-23, till Q1, your Company has generated 104.42 BU, registering a growth of 21.7% year-on-year and the coal stations operated at over 80% PLF.\n\nIn the current fiscal, your Company achieved the 100 BUs generation mark in 88 days which is the best achievement till date. We have registered the highest single day generation of 1245 MUs on June 10, 2022. These numbers indicate that the growth is substantial and is likely to continue going forward.\n\nYour Company achieved capacity addition of 3372 MW and commercial capacity addition of 4032 MW. Further, 172.52 MW renewable capacity has been added in FY 2022-23 till date taking NTPC group installed capacity to 69,134.2 MW.\n\nCoal production from the captive mines stood at 14.02 MMT for FY 2021-22, registering a growth of 27%. Mining operations started at one more mine, Chatti Bariatu and the captive coal production target for FY 2022-23 has been set as 26 MMT. This will help ensure fuel security for your Company's power stations.\n\nDespite numerous challenges, considerable acceleration in your Company's growth momentum in the recent past encourages me to assure you that the Company will continue to grow and prosper despite the issues emerging on the global and national business horizons.\n\n## Renewables - Growth engine for future:\n\nOn  the  renewables  front,  we  won  bids  totaling  3265  MW  in  FY  2021-22  and commissioned 502 MW of new capacity. With this, the total renewable capacity won  through  competitive  bidding  has  reached  7562  MW  and  total  renewable commissioned capacity crossed the 2 GW mark.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that your Company has commissioned India's largest floating solar plant at Ramagundam in Telangana. With this, we have achieved commissioning of 222 MW of floating solar projects and another 40 MW is under construction. These indicate we are progressing well on the renewables side along with the conventional business.\n\nWe have formed a new Company, NTPC Green Energy Limited (NGEL) under which\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

    {
        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwe plan to consolidate almost all our green assets. We have got requisite approvals from the Government for transferring our RE assets to the new Company. We are in the process of identifying strategic investors for NGEL and plan to complete the process in the current fiscal.\n\nWe have started putting in place firm plans for achieving 60 GW of renewable capacity by 2032 as committed earlier. Apart from the 2 GW capacity which is already commissioned, over 4 GW of capacity is in the construction stage and 5 GW capacity is in the tendering stage. The work at the largest renewable energy park (4750 MW) at Khavda in Gujarat has started. We have also signed MoU with Government of Rajasthan for allocation of land parcels for setting up aggregate renewable capacity of 10 GW. We have also taken action for setting up of around 1600 MW of merchant capacity.\n\nYour Company is working on multiple fronts and multiple models to realize the targeted capacity addition in the Renewables. Further, efforts are on for partnering with Commercial and Industrial (C&I) consumers for supplying renewable and RTC power.\n\nYour Company is also progressing well in the green hydrogen space. Work is in progress at Leh on an integrated project for mobility, where five intra-city buses would ply using green hydrogen. In addition to the green methanol pilot project at Vindhyachal, the work for blending green hydrogen with natural gas (PNG) at Kawas is also in progress.\n\n## Outstanding Financial performance:\n\nDespite several challenges in the business, your Company has posted strong financial results. The total income stood at ' 120,042.43 crore as against previous year income of ' 103,552.71 crore, registering an increase of 15.92%. The Company registered its highest ever profit of ' 16,111.42 crore as against ' 13,769.52 crore in FY 2020-21, registering an increase of 17.01%.\n\nConsistent efforts made by your Company in improving the performance of JVs and Subsidiaries has yielded high returns. They have earned a profit of ' 4,004 crore in FY 2021-22 against ' 3,033 crore in FY 2020-21. We have accounted for dividend income of ' 2,134.34 crore from our JVs and Subsidiaries as against ' 1,274.19 crore during FY 2020-21.\n\nIn FY 2021-22, the Board of your Company has recommended final dividend @ 30% of paid-up capital i.e @ ' 3/- per share subject to approval of Shareholders in the Annual General Meeting in addition to the interim dividend @ 40% of paid-up capital, i.e @ ' 4/- per share already paid. This is the 29 th consecutive year that the Company has paid a dividend.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYour Company incurred a Capex of ' 21,035.87 crore on a standalone basis and group capex of ' 34,490.55 crore. With the commercialization of projects, the regulated equity reached ' 70,890 crore on a standalone basis.\n\nThe bills realization stood at ' 1,16,148 crore which is 100% of the billed amount. Your Company enjoys the most favored borrower status due to its prudent management of debt financing. The proactive refinancing strategy adopted by your Company to leverage market conditions for availing low-cost debt has resulted in your Company being able to raise the most competitive debt in the market. We are continuously working on optimization, process improvement to reduce the overheads and increase profitability for ensuring sustained returns to the shareholders.\n\nNTPC Renewable Energy Limited obtained the highest domestic credit rating of 'AAA' within one year of its incorporation and has been able to tie up its maiden domestic 'Green' loan at a very competitive rate.\n\n## Sustainability- Growth with inclusiveness:\n\nSustainability remains one of the key pillars of our business and we at NTPC have been challenging ourselves every day with new targets to better our sustainability performances. We are tirelessly working to make our business model sustainable throughout the entire value chain and we have ensured that our sustainability priorities cover varying geographical, economic and social contexts. We are consistently striving to become more transparent in the timely disclosure of our social, environmental and economic performances. Towards this end, we adopted the integrated reporting framework early and increased the scope through inclusion of many more sustainability standards and ESG frameworks.\n\nGlobally energy business is transitioning towards a more secure, resilient, and greener future. We wish to promote a transition that is transparent and just, avoiding inequalities and unemployment and at the same time open and creative which is capable of utilizing talents and unleashing passions, strengthening the bond with communities of engaging customers and suppliers. Our\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncurrent energy efficiency improvement efforts and energy diversification avenues have helped us in reducing the specific GHG emission by 2% in FY 2021-22 vis-\u00e0-vis FY 2011-12.

Our ash utilization has increased from 41% in FY 2015-16 to 81.67 % in FY 2021-22. To improve safety at our workplace, we have imparted 1.36 million Man-hours of safety training (including contract workers) in FY 2021-22. We have taken efficiency measures at war scale and set tougher targets for reduction of water footprint. We have been able to reduce our specific water consumption by 4.82%.\n\nBeing a responsible corporate organization, community engagement is one of our business priorities. In FY 2021-22 we spent ' 356.72 crore towards various CSR activities. As part of our Sustainable Supply Chain policy, we are engaging with our suppliers to assess their sustainability performance and conducting capacity building programmes on ESG. We have resumed the Girl Empowerment Mission programme, which was interrupted for the last two years due to COVID-19 imposed restrictions and trained over 2500 school going girls. The programme is expected to create a long-lasting positive impact on the young girls and on the society itself when they grow up.\n\nYour Company received 'Company with Best CSR Practice Award' in 8 th Asia Business Responsibility Summit organized by Asian Centre for Corporate Governance and Sustainability.\n\n## Power Sector Outlook:\n\nThe Indian power sector is one of the most diversified in the world. India is the third largest producer and second largest consumer of electricity worldwide. With installed capacity of over 400 GW, the country registered highest peak demand of 211.86 GW on June 10, 2022, and energy met was 4722 MUs. Growing population along with increasing electrification and per capita usage will further provide impetus to the rising demand for electricity. As per the national infrastructure pipeline 2019-25, energy sector projects accounted for the highest share.\n\nMany power sector reforms are being introduced by the Government to bring efficiency, promote de-carbonization and ensure (24X7) reliable and affordable power supply. As the largest generator of the country, your Company carries the responsibility of providing adequate power to meet the grid requirement. This provides enough opportunities for multifold growth of your Company.\n\nYour Company believes that meeting the long-term energy requirement of the country with reliability and affordability is the prime objective. Considering the changes happening across the globe, while giving utmost thrust for adding renewable capacity, need has been felt for adding some coal-based capacity as it will provide resilience to the sector for meeting the increasing demand. Accordingly, your Company is considering a few expansion projects at the existing pit-head plant locations. In this direction, we have already finalized the tender for (2X660 MW) capacity at Talcher (TTPS) as a replacement project.\n\n## Growth with governance - Excellence with ethics:\n\nYour Company takes proactive steps to ensure sound corporate governance and is committed to ethical corporate practices based on conscience, transparency, fairness, professionalism and accountability. Our core values embody the spirit of sound governance and act as a guiding beacon for the employees and management. Your Company saw 'Nil'' audit observations from Controller and Auditor General of India (CAG) for FY21 and also for FY22.\n\nYour Company is committed to sustainable wealth creation for all its stakeholders by adopting best practices. Transparency, accountability, fairness and extensive communication with stakeholders are integral to our functioning. We believe in system driven performance and performance-oriented systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accomplishments in other areas:\n\nAs informed earlier, your Company emerged as the successful bidder in acquisition of Jhabua (1X600 MW) power station in Madhya Pradesh through NCLT. It is pertinent to mention that the resolution plan to facilitate the acquisition has been approved by NCLT recently and it has paved the way for completion of the acquisition process.\n\nYour Company has signed MoU with Energy Vault for development of Gravity Energy Storage System. Fly ash will be used for manufacturing of Blocks. Plans have been chalked out for implementation of 100 MWh storage at one of the existing power stations.\n\nYour Company is actively working on the Biomass and Waste-to-Wealth solutions. We have already fired 77,000 MT of biomass pellets and prevented nearly 45,000 acres of farm fire. Work on the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

NVVNL has also been appointed as the trading licensee for Indian Railways. They have also started electric buses at Bengaluru in addition to Port Blair.\n\nYour Company's International Business Development group has secured PMC contracts for 2,960 MW solar projects in Africa and South & Central America through International Solar Alliance in FY 2021-22. Further, (2X660 MW) coal-based project in Bangladesh will also be made operational in the current fiscal.\n\nYour Company has been conferred 'Excellence' in the prestigious CII-ITC Sustainability Award-2021 in 'Corporate Social Responsibility' category, twice in a row. We have also won the ATD BEST award-2022. Your Company was also adjudged as one of the 'Most preferred workplaces-2022'.\n\nI am also happy to inform you that the Flue gas-based desalination plant at Simhadri and Solar desalination plant at Vallur got approvals from BIS. This shall help in supply of treated water commercially.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Commitment for the future:\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that that the period of low dispatch of power from our stations and 'supply overhang' in the country seems to be over. Due to the strong demand, it is expected that the PLF of coal-based stations may further increase. Even though\n\nour coal-based project pipeline has become slim, all the remaining projects are either pithead or situated on the mine. With the commissioning of these projects, our generation share shall see a further rise. As we march ahead in our capacity addition programme, we are planning to achieve 75 GW capacity by August 15, 2023.\n\nWe are constantly focusing on strengthening our base of existing businesses while building new business models. We are always looking to improve our maintenance practices so that we operate our fleet most efficiently,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\neconomically and reliably. The digital initiatives taken by your Company have already yielded good results. We strongly believe that Digitalization, Process Optimization and Consolidation is the only way forward for progressive organizations.\n\nYour Company is constantly working on creating a future ready workforce by building critical skills. Recent initiative of collaborating with IIT Bombay for re-skilling our workforce in emerging areas is a step in that direction.\n\n## Grateful acknowledgements:\n\nI take this opportunity to place on record my sincere thanks and gratitude to the Government of India, particularly Ministry of Power, Ministry of Coal, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, DIPAM, CERC, CEA, CAG, State Governments, our valued Customers, Auditors, Vendors, other authorities and agencies that provide unstinted support.\n\nI convey my appreciation to my colleagues on the Board for their invaluable contribution in strengthening the Company. I express my sincere thanks to investors, shareholders, employees and customers for their continued trust and support. Your Company values your trust and confidence and shall continue to work tirelessly to take it forward.\n\nWith new hope and resilience, we are focusing on sustaining our high level of performance and achieving the committed targets. We are consolidating our actions in all facets of business which shall lead us from a 'Power Generating Company' to a 'Sustainable Integrated Energy Conglomerate'.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(Gurdeep Singh) Chairman & Managing Director\n\n<!-- image -->",

The tariff of electricity generated from various stations of your Company is in the process of determination by CERC based on station specific petitions filed as per these Regulations for the above-mentioned period. Further, CERC has also issued the First Amendment to Tariff Regulations, 2019 regarding servicing of capital and operational expenditure incurred on installation and operation of Emission Control Systems through determination of supplementary capacity charges and supplementary energy charges. CERC has also issued Second  Amendment  to  the  Tariff  Regulations,  2019 regarding determination of transfer price of coal from captive coal mines by the generating company.\n\nCERC (Sharing of Inter State Transmission Charges and Losses)  Regulations,  2020  effective  from  1  November 2020  provide  the  framework  for  sharing  of  interstate transmission charges and losses by the various users.\n\n## 6.5  Relinquishment of power from stations that have completed 25 years from COD\n\nMinistry of Power (MOP) has issued Guidelines on enabling the Discoms to either continue or exit from the PPA after completion of the term of the PPA i.e., beyond 25 years or  a  period  specified  in  the  PPA  and  allow  flexibility to  the  Generators  to  sell  power  in  any  mode  after State/ Discom exit from PPA. These guidelines provide a detailed methodology to be followed by Discoms to exit from PPAs with central generating stations beyond 25  years.  The  Discoms  are  required  to  take  approval from their respective SERC and give a 6-month notice to the generating company before exiting from the PPA of stations that have completed 25 years from COD. Further, CERC Tariff Regulations 2019 also provide Discoms the first right of refusal to accept the special tariff arrangement offered by generating company for procuring power from stations that have completed 25 years.\n\nCertain  states  like  Odisha,  Rajasthan  and  Delhi  have relinquished their allocation from coal stations, such as, Farakka-I&II, Kahalgaon-I, Unchahar-I and Dadri-I, which has  been  re-allocated  by  MoP  to  other  needy  States requiring  power.  Further,  Punjab,  Haryana,  Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi have sought to relinquish their allocation in Anta GPS, Auraiya GPS and Dadri GPS",

This mechanism helps in optimization of total schedule of the Inter State Generating  Stations  based  on  the  variable  cost, resulting in savings in cost of procurement for the Discoms.\n- \u0083 Subsequently,  the  scope  of  the  SCED  has  been expanded to include the state regulated generating stations  and  the  merchant  generators  based  on their willingness to participate in the scheme. Vide Order dated 31.3.2022, it has now been extended indefinitely until further orders. POSOCO has been asked to submit a detailed feedback report on sixmonthly basis.\n- \u0083 SCED has resulted in cumulative savings of ' 2,116 crore in generation cost from start of the SCED pilot in April 2019 up to March 2022 thereby resulting in increased saving in the cost of power procurement of the Discoms.\n- \u0083 The  generating  stations  of  your  Company  are participating in the SCED mechanism starting from April 2019 and contributing in a significant way in reduction in power purchase cost of the Discoms.\n\n## 6.7   Strengthening Customer Relationship\n\nCustomer Focus is one of the core values of your Company (ICOMIT). In line with this, your Company has taken up several initiatives targeted towards the external Customers. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) are some of the important parts of these initiatives. As part of the CRM, your Company has been implementing several structured activities with the objective of sharing its experiences and best practices with  the  customers,  capturing  their  feedbacks  and expectations, and addressing their issues. Some of these activities are described below:\n\n- -Your  Company  offers  training  programs  to  the representatives of beneficiary companies at Power Management Institute (PMI), the apex training institute of your Company on free of cost basis. In 2021-22, 53 participants from various customer organizations attended training in 8 programs.\n- -Your  Company  has  also  put  in  place  Customer Satisfaction  Index  (CSI)  Survey  scheme,  to  gather customer's feedbacks through a survey and respond to  their  requirements.  This  CSI  survey  has  been conducted  in  2021-22  and  the  score  falls  under Excellent category.\n\n- -To  further  strengthen  customer  relationship,  your Company has sponsored 10 officials of beneficiaries / Discoms to the PGDM (Executive) programme of the NTPC School of Business for the year 2021-22 as a capacity building initiative of power sector personnel equipping them with managerial and leadership skills.\n\n## 6.8  Power Trading in Power Exchange\n\nIn  line  with  CERC  (IEGC)  (5 th Amendment)  Regulations 2017, a generating company can sell the un-requisitioned surplus (URS) power based on consent of the beneficiary states. The gains realized from the sale of URS are to be shared with beneficiaries in the ratio of 50:50, subject to a cap of 7 paisa per kwh. The URS power can be sold both in the Day Ahead Market (DAM) and Real Time Market (RTM) platforms of the Power Exchanges. Your Company has been participating in various trading platforms for sale of any un-requisitioned surplus (URS) power as under:\n\n- i. Day Ahead Market (DAM) Any sale of URS power in the Day Ahead Market (DAM), which operates during 10:00 to 12:00 Hrs of the previous day requires prior consent of the Discoms, as they would have to give up their right to reschedule this power after it is sold in the Market. This Market constitutes around 75%80% of the volume of power traded in the Power Exchanges. Apart from selling the URS power based on consent of the Discoms, your Company also sells the Regulated power of Discoms due to non- payment of  outstanding  dues,  as  and  when  opportunities arise.\n- ii. Real Time Market (RTM) Real Time Market has been implemented in the country since 1 st June 2020 with participation on voluntary basis. The main objective of RTM is to provide a market mechanism to the generating  stations  to  sell  their  surplus  power  in the market and to provide an opportunity to the Discoms to buy power from the market to meet their contingent requirements. RTM is being implemented in the form of 48 half-hourly auctions conducted during the delivery date and provides options to the generators and the Discoms to participate in the  market  through  price  sensitive  bidding.  For generators, to sell their URS in the RTM, no consent is required from the beneficiaries. The gain sharing principle remains same as that the URS sale in the Day Ahead Market (DAM).\n\nYour Company has been participating in both the DAM and the RTM for selling URS power in the Power Exchange through its trading arm NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited, subsidiary co. Besides selling the URS power, it has also been selling any regulated power or merchant power also in the Power Exchanges. In the FY 2021-22, around 1,949 Million Units of power has been sold in the DAM and RTM in Power Exchanges. Corresponding gains for this sale has been shared with the beneficiaries as per the extant regulatory provisions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Plant efficiency of USC units is expected to be around 41.5% which is higher by 3.5% percentage point over a conventional subcritical 500 MW unit.\n\nUltra-super critical based units of Khargone (2X660MW) STPP have already been commissioned.\n\nFor the first time in your Company, Air Cooled Condenser (ACC) system has been adopted at North Karanpura STPP and Patratu STPP, JV Co. which will bring a significant reduction  in  specific  water  consumption  for  these projects.\n\n## 8.2.1 Biomass Co-firing Utilization of Agro residue for Power Generation & reduce pollution\n\nAs part of its commitment towards clean environment, your Company has taken a new initiative to utilise agro residue for power generation. This is intended to cut down  carbon  emissions  and  also  to  discourage  crop residue burning by farmers after harvesting by adding economic value to the crop residue and providing extra income  to  farmers  and  employment  in  rural  sector. Biomass  co-firing  is  a  unique  method  to  utilize  coalbased power plant infrastructure to produce renewable energy by simply replacing some of the coal with biomassbased fuel. Being carbon neutral fuel, biomass co-firing is a technology recognized by UNFCCC as a measure of reducing greenhouse gas emission.\n\nAfter  successfully  demonstrating  biomass  co-firing  at your Company Dadri plant, your Company has started commercial  scale  biomass  co-firing  at  other  stations also. Your Company has so far awarded contracts for procurement of 12.35 LMT of biomass pellet for 20 stations of your Company under various short-term contracts (3 months, 6 months and 9 months) and Long-term contract (4 Years) for Dadri station. Supply has been already started at 13 stations of your Company.  Your Company is the highest consumer of Biomass pellets in coal-based power sector with 77,456 metric tonnes of biomass pellets fired in 13 stations of your Company as on 20.7.2022.\n\nAs mandate by Guidelines issued by Ministry of Power on 8.10.2021 for utilisation of Agro-residue based biomass in coal-based power plants, your Company was the first company to initiate procurement process on long term basis. In the first lot, your Company is procuring 9.20 MMT of biomass pellets for seven years for stations in NCR or in close proximity to NCR. Tender has been floated for Dadri, Unchahar, Tanda stations and Joint Venture APCPLJhajjar. The tender is in advance stage of finalisation and the orders will be placed soon.\n\n## 8.2.2 Waste to energy (WtE) and disposing municipal solid waste (MSW)\n\nKeeping its commitment  towards  clean & green environment  and  Swachh  Bharat  Mission  (SBM),  your\n\n<!-- image -->",

The plant is processing about 600 TPD of MSW and  generating  about  60-80  TPD  of  compost.  Sanitary land fill facility and Leachate treatment facility have also been created at Varanasi to ensure scientific disposal of municipal solid & liquid waste.\n\nIn  addition,  your  Company  has  commissioned  24  TPD thermal gasification-based demonstration scale WtE plant at  Varanasi.  The  Municipal  Solid  Waste  (MSW)  is  first converted to produce gas, which is then used to generate approximately  200  kW  of  electric  power.  Further,  to promote Make in India concept, this Project has been awarded to Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises (MSME) vendor.\n\n## 8.2.3 Renewable energy\n\nRenewable energy is central focus for your Company. To be in step with ambitious targets, the Company is exploring all  avenues  for  renewable  capacity  addition  to  look beyond conventional large scale solar and wind parks. Your Company is utilizing roofs of power plant buildings for solar power generation and integrating to the existing plant infrastructure.

Koldam HEPP (4x200 MW) is on the river Satluj, in District  Bilaspur  (Himachal  Pradesh).  All  the  four units of 200 MW each were declared commercially operational in 2015. Since then, the project is running exceedingly well. The generation for the financial year 2021-22 was 3120.13 MUs against design energy of  3055  MUs.  Owing  to  excellent  operation  and maintenance practices, the Station achieved yearly availability of 98.5% and DC of 108.82% in FY 202122, which is highest amongst all the Hydro Power Stations in the country for the last 5 years in a row.\n\nKoldam has been accorded Integrated Management Systems  (IMS)  Certification  which  includes  ISO 9001:2015  for  Quality  Management  System,  ISO 45001:2015 for Environment Management System & ISO 14001:2018 for Occupational Health & Safety Management System in March 2021.\n\nKoldam  in  FY  2021-22  has  been  bestowed  with Golden Peacock Environment Management Award\n\n(winner amongst all Stations in power generation category)  for  its  commitment  for  Environmental improvement.  Koldam  HPP  was  also  awarded with  Greentech  Energy  Conservation  Award  & Greentech Safety Award for its best practices for energy conservation and accident free performance. Towards  water  conservation,  backwash  water from the Water treatment plant and effluent from the  Sewerage  Treatment  plant  is  being  used  for Horticulture purposes in Township area.\n\nKoldam  in  Nov'21  has  also  organized  an  O&M Workshop (HydroCon'2021) with participation from several hydro power producing companies including NHPC, THDC, NEEPCO, SJVN, AD Hydro, JSW Energy, and  equipment  manufacturers  for  sharing of experiences and best practices of Hydro O&M which turned out to be a great success.\n\n- B.   Tapovan Vishnugad HEPP (4x130 MW) is on River Dhauliganga, in District Chamoli (Uttarakhand). The Project  is  under  advance  stage  of  construction with a physical progress of nearly 75%. Generator Transformer & Switchyard (GIS) Package is completed. Powerhouse  Building  works  are  completed  and architectural works are in progress. Erection (Box-up) of two out of four turbines is completed.\n\nOn  7.2.2021,  unprecedented  devasting  glacier debris flow in Dhauligaga river caused by glacier rock fall in Nanda Gunti Glacier in the catchment of Rishigaga River (a tributary of Dhauligaga River) which  inundated  the  under-construction  Barrage of  your  Company  Tavopan  Vishnugad  HEPP.  The debris/silt/deposit  material  entered  and  chocked the Desilting Basin including Intake Adit tunnel, Head Race Tunnel (HRT), Silt Flushing Tunnel (SFT), Barrage & Gate Operating Chamber Area etc., entrapping the manpower & equipment/vehicles engaged in these areas. This devastating flood resulted in extensive damage to breast wall, bridge deck, washing away of spillway gates along with hydraulic cylinders and a pier control room. All the approach roads/access to the project components located in Barrage, Desilting, Intake area, Chormi Adit, Tail Race Tunnel were either washed away or damaged. The progress of work has been affected due to this natural disaster.\n\nPresently all the muck from Barrage, Intake, Desilting Chamber, Conduit, Gate Operating Chamber, Transfer Structure has been removed. 28% of muck have also been removed from HRT and SFT. A comprehensive testing of various structures of barrage has been conducted  by  SERC  &  CBRI  Team  in  Dec'2021  & March'2022 and all structures were found integral and repairable. The repair, restoration and balance works are in progress and first Unit is likely to be commissioned by Sept. 2024.\n\n- C. Lata  Tapovan  HEPP  (3x57  MW) is  in  upstream  of Tapovan-Vishnugad  HEPP,  in  District  Chamoli  in\n\n<!-- image -->",

As per this, the charges of Deviation from Schedule would be same as the weighted average Ancillary Service Charges deployed at that point of time (block). For a period of one year or any date to be notified by the Commission, the deviation charges would be the maximum of the prices of Day Ahead Market, Real Time Market and the Ancillary Services Mechanism. For the generators, the band of deviations has been narrowed whereby within a band of 2% only there is no penalty and beyond this band the penalty increases for both over and under-injections. The actual date of implementation of these Regulations will be notified by CERC.",

IMF, in the World Economic Outlook, released in April 2022, has placed the growth projection for India at 8.9% for the calendar year 2021, which is the highest among the Emerging Market and Developing Economies.\n\nQuarterly growth rate analysis depicts that GDP has grown by 20.1%, 8.4%, 5.4% and 4.1% during Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 of the financial year 2021-22, respectively. After robust growth in  Q1,  the  growth  trajectory  remained  tepid  in  the  other three quarters on account of higher prices of Oil and other commodities, hiccups in the recovery of the contact-intensive services due to the emergence of the Omicron variant, and the geopolitical situation in Russia and Ukraine.\n\nFor the electricity sector, Indices of Industrial Production (IIP) has shown a growth of 7.9% over the last fiscal. The growth is,  however,  less  as  compared  to  that  of  the  mining  and manufacturing sectors, which have grown by 12.2% and 11.7% respectively.\n\nFurther, as per World Economic Outlook, April 2022, the growth projection for India in the calendar year 2022 has been pegged at 8.2%, slightly lower as compared to the calendar year 2021 due to the spill-over effect of the geopolitical conflict between Ukraine and Russia, considering India as a net oil importer. This may reflect weaker domestic demand as higher oil prices are expected to weigh on private consumption and investment. However, as gathered from the report, projections for India are still highest among the Emerging Market and Developing Economies.\n\nFinancial year 2021-22 has seen India's power sector move further along the path of meeting the aspirations of our rapidly developing nation. Universal access to affordable power in a sustainable manner has been the guiding principle for the Power sector. India has twin goals, to ensure 24x7 adequate and reliable energy access and simultaneously, accelerate the clean energy transition by reducing the country's reliance on fossil-based  energy  and  shifting  to  cleaner  and  renewable energy sources. To meet these goals following major reforms were taken up during the financial year 2021-22:\n\n## Draft National Electricity Policy 2021\n\nIntending to make electricity available 24x7 to all households in the next five years, MOP released the Draft National Electricity Policy (NEP) on 27 April 2021. The key highlights of the draft NEP are as follows:\n\n- \u0083 The NEP 2021 covers multiple areas such as the financial\n\nhealth  of  distribution  utilities,  aggregate  technical  & commercial losses, balancing and ramping requirements, and the development of an efficient transmission system.\n\n- \u0083 Introduction of suitable market mechanisms for developing efficient markets for electricity. Introduction of capacity markets and auction mechanisms, longer duration forward contracts and derivatives, market-based ancillary services, and new green markets.\n- \u0083 The  gradual  shift  towards  light-touch  regulations  and shifting  of  focus  on  emerging  tasks  such  as  market monitoring and surveillance, ensuring resource adequacy, balancing, demand response, etc. and achieving 100% prepaid metering within 3 years.\n- \u0083 Promotion of manufacturing goods and services in the power  sector  under  the  Make  in  India  initiative  and Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.\n\n## Policies for Promotion of RE\n\nWith a commitment to increase non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, the following initiatives have been taken to promote RE capacity addition.\n\n- \u0083 Electricity (Promotion of Generation of Electricity from Must-Run Power Plant) Rules, 2021\n- \u0083 Introduction of Green Day Ahead Market (GDAM)\n- \u0083 Waiver of ISTS Charges and Losses for Solar & Wind Power\n- \u0083 Bundling  with  RE  and  Storage  Power  for  Flexibility  in Generation  and  Scheduling  of  Thermal/Hydro  Power Stations. The Scheme seeks to improve the operational efficiencies and financial sustainability of all DISCOMs/ Power Departments.\n\n## Green Hydrogen and Ammonia policy\n\nNotified by MOP, the green hydrogen and ammonia policy offers to set up manufacturing zones for the production of these chemicals,  connectivity  to  the  ISTS  (inter-state  transmission system) on a priority basis and waiver of transmission charges for 25 years subject to production facility being commissioned before June 2025.\n\n## Policies for DISCOMs empowerment\n\nDuring the financial year 2021-22, GOI launched the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) to help DISCOMs. Further, MOP has issued various guidelines for improving the financial health of DISCOMs. Some of them are:\n\n- \u0083 Short-term Procurement of Power by Distribution Licensee, through a tariff-based bidding process.\n- \u0083 Timeline for replacement of existing meters with smart meters with pre-payment feature.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The sector with its three pillars: Generation, Transmission and Distribution, is crucial to India's infrastructure and economic growth. The global stature of the Indian Power Sector is depicted well by its positioning in terms of generation capacity. India is ranked 3rd in the world in terms of electricity generation, 4th in installed renewable energy capacity, and 6th in installed Hydro capacity, as reported by international agencies like IEA, Statista, IRENA etc.\n\nThe achievements and various issues/ challenges faced by the Power Sector and key initiatives taken by the Ministry of Power are discussed in the following paragraphs.\n\n## Snapshot 2021-22\n\n- \u0083 The gross annual generation of the country (including imports from Bhutan) increased from 1,382 BUs in the previous year to 1,492 BUs in the financial year 2021-22 (including renewables), a growth of about 8%.\n- \u0083 Generation from Renewable sources increased by about 16% from 147 BUs to 171 BUs (excluding Hydro) while generation from conventional sources increased by about 7% from 1,235 BUs to 1,321 BUs.\n- \u0083 A generation capacity of 4,878 MW (excluding renewables) was added during the financial year 2021-22 compared to 5,436 MW added during the previous year.\n- \u0083 With  the  addition  of  15,964  MW,  renewable  energy capacity has reached 156.6 GW (including large hydro) at the end of the financial year 2021-22, an increase of 11.3% over the previous year.\n- \u0083 14,895 Ckms of transmission lines were added during the year as compared to 16,750 Ckms in the previous year.\n- \u0083 78,982 MVA of transformer capacity was added during the year as against 56,575 MVA in the previous year.\n- \u0083 PLF of coal-based stations increased to 58.76% in the financial year 2021-22 from 54.62% in the previous year.\n- \u0083 During the financial year 2021-22, the energy deficit has remained constant at 0.4% however peak demand deficit has increased from 0.4% to 1.2%, YoY basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Existing Installed Capacity\n\nThe total installed capacity in the country as on 31 March 2022  was  more  than  399  GW  (including  renewables)  with Private Sector contributing about 49% of the installed capacity followed by State Sector with 26% share and Central Sector with 25% share.\n\n| Sector   | Total Capacity (MW)   |   % share |\n|----------|-----------------------|-----------|\n| Central  | 99,005                |        25 |\n| State    | 1,04,855              |        26 |\n| Private  | 1,95,637              |        49 |\n| Total    | 3,99,497              |       100 |\n\nMode-wise installed capacity in the country as on 31 March 2022 is as under:\n\n| Mode             | Total Capacity (MW)   |   % share |\n|------------------|-----------------------|-----------|\n| Thermal          | 2,36,109              |        59 |\n| Nuclear          | 6,780                 |         2 |\n| Hydro            | 46,723                |        12 |\n| RES (Renewables) | 1,09,885              |        27 |\n| Total            | 3,99,497              |       100 |\n\n(Source: Central Electricity Authority)\n\n## Capacity Utilization and Generation\n\nSector wise PLF in % (Coal based stations)\n\n| Sector      |   2021-22 |   2020-21 |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Central     |     69.62 |     63.78 |\n| State       |     54.98 |     46.71 |\n| Private     |     66.95 |     57.18 |\n| Private IPP |     52.62 |     54.23 |\n| All India   |     58.76 |     54.62 |\n\n(Source: Central Electricity Authority)\n\n## Generation\n\nSector-wise and fuel-wise break-up of conventional generation (in BUs) for the financial year 2021-22 is detailed as under:\n\n| Sector         | Thermal   | Hydro   | Nuclear   | Bhutan  Import   |   Total |\n|----------------|-----------|---------|-----------|------------------|---------|\n| Central        | 415       | 58      | 47        | --               |     520 |\n| State          | 336       | 79      | --        | --               |     415 |\n| Private        | 364       | 14      | --        | --               |     378 |\n| Bhutan  Import | --        | --      | --        | 8                |       8 |\n| Total          | 1115      | 151     | 47        | 8                |    1321 |\n\n(Source: Central Electricity Authority)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Their shares of electricity consumption during the financial year 2020-21, were approximately 17.5%, 8.3%, 25.7%, 41.1%, 1.5% and 5.9%, respectively. During the financial year 2021-22, although absolute consumption of all the sectors has increased, the percentage consumption of agriculture and domestic consumption in the total consumption has  increased  marginally  whereas  for  other  sectors  it  has decreased slightly.\n\nIn this context, Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA) launched with the objective to provide energy access to all by providing last-mile connectivity, has played an  important  role.  Under  this  scheme,  about  99.99%  of households have been electrified. Out of the remaining 17,301 un-electrified & partially electrified villages, infrastructure work has been completed in 17,297 Villages (97%) while physical work has been completed in 14 out of 15 districts.\n\n## Transmission\n\nThe total inter-regional transmission capacity of the country has increased from 1,05,050 MW as at 31 March 2021 to 1,12,250 MW as at 31 March 2022, recording a growth of 6.8%. This augmentation of the national grid is essential for supporting the higher injection of renewables into the grid for the transfer of power from RE-rich states to other states.\n\n## Distribution\n\nDistribution  is  the  key  link  in  realizing  the  Government  of India's vision of supplying reliable 24x7 Power for All. For this, the financial health of distribution companies is of prime importance  so  that  they  can  discharge  their  functions  & responsibilities efficiently. However, their poor financial health has remained a matter of concern.\n\nAccumulated losses have increased at a CAGR of around 8.6% from the financial year 2015-16 to the financial year 2019-20. To reverse this trend, reduction of AT&C losses and the closure of the gap between ACS (Average Cost of Supply) and ARR (Average Revenue Realization) are critical factors.\n\nGOI has launched the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS) to help DISCOMs improve their operational efficiencies and financial sustainability by providing result-linked financial assistance  to  strengthen  supply  infrastructure  based  on meeting pre-qualifying criteria and achieving basic minimum benchmarks. RDSS has an outlay of ' 3,03,758 Crore over 5 years i.e., FY 2021-22 to FY 2025-26. The outlay includes an estimated Government Budgetary Support (GBS) of ' 97,631 Crore. The main objectives of RDSS are:\n\n- \u0083 Reduction of AT&C losses to pan-India levels of 12-15% by FY 2024-25.\n- \u0083 Reduction of ACS-ARR gap to zero by FY 2024-25.\n- \u0083 Improvement in the quality, reliability, and affordability of  power  supply  to  consumers  through  a  financially sustainable and operationally efficient distribution sector.\n\nThe Scheme comprises of two components:\n\n- \u0083 Part  A:  Financial  support  for  Prepaid  Smart  Metering, System Metering, and  Upgradation  of  Distribution Infrastructure; and\n- \u0083 Part B: Training and capacity building and other enabling and supporting activities.\n\nThe scheme is expected to play a major role in improving the financial conditions of DISCOMs.\n\n## Power Trading\n\nIn India, power is transacted largely through long-term Power Purchase  Agreements  (PPA)  entered  between  Generating companies  and  the  distribution  utilities.  A  small  portion  is transacted  through  various  short-term  (contract  period<1 Year) mechanisms. This includes Day Ahead Market and RealTime Market (RTM), followed by bilateral contracts (through traders,  term-ahead  contracts  on  power  exchanges,  and directly between DISCOMs) and through Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM).\n\nIn the financial year 2021-22, around 95% of power generated in the country was transacted through the long-term PPA route and about 5% of the power was transacted through short-term trading mechanisms.\n\n## Key Initiatives/Reforms & Regulatory Changes in Power Sector\n\n## 1. CERC Regulations\n\n## a.

Your Company is also exploring business opportunities in the areas of power generation, PMC, O&M contracting, R&M of power plants, capability building, etc. in the regions such as the Middle East, South East Asia, CIS regions, Latin America and Africa.\n\n## 6. Inorganic growth opportunities\n\nYour Company is looking for suitable opportunities for the  acquisition  of  stressed  power  projects  subject  to techno-commercial viability. In the financial year 202122, your Company has submitted the final Resolution Plan for Jhabua Power Limited (1x600 MW), which has been successfully negotiated and submitted to the Committee of Creditors (CoC). The same was approved unanimously during the meeting of CoC. Resolution Professional has filed the Resolution Plan for approval of NCLT.\n\nYour Company is also in discussions with PFC and REC for the possible acquisition of power assets with a minority stake and O&M support under a lender-backed resolution plan.\n\nYour Company through NVVN has purchased a 5% equity stake in M/s PXIL on 31 January 2022 for participating in the Energy Exchange business. Discussions with M/s HPX, the third Energy Exchange is in progress.\n\n## 7. Efficiency improvement\n\nYour  Company  has  laid  major  stress  on  the  efficient utilization  of  resources  and  the  use  of  technological advancements for improving energy efficiency. Till March 2022, your Company along with its JVs and Subsidiaries, has implemented 17,620 MW capacity based on Super Critical technology with commissioning of 3,580 MW of Supercritical power plant capacity.\n\nYour Company has commissioned the country's first two Ultra-Super Critical (USC) power units with a capacity of 1,320 MW (2 units of 660 MW each) at Khargone. Your Company aims to enhance the overall efficiency of its coal plants, thereby achieving a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions. Adoption of USC parameters shall result in a reduction of CO2 emission (as also others like NOx and SOx) by around 8% when compared to conventional subcritical  power  plants  for  every  unit  of  electricity generated.\n\nFurther, for reduction of CO2 emission, Torrefied biomass co-firing up to 20% and provision of CCU of up to 10-20% is being kept in the future thermal projects.\n\nFor the first-time, Air-Cooled Condenser (ACC) System has been adopted at North Karanpura STPP and Patratu STPP, which will bring a significant reduction in specific water consumption for the projects.\n\n## 8. Consultancy\n\nNTPC  Consultancy  Wing  has  been  offering  services related to the power sector in India and abroad in the areas like Owner's Engineer Services, Lender's Engineer Services, Project Management & Construction Supervision, O&M, Renovation & Modernization, Quality Assurance, Inspection  services,  Customized  Training  &  IT  related Services, ERP, Procurement, Recruitment, FGD/ De-NOx installations, Renewable energy, coal mining, etc.\n\n## THREATS/CHALLENGES/CONCERNS\n\n## 1. RE Power Capacity Growth\n\nThe following factors may increase the input cost leading to challenges for the fast-paced growth of RE projects:\n\n- \u0083 Imposition of basic customs duty on imported solar cells and modules (starting from 1 April 2022), and an increase in the GST rate for 'specified renewable energy parts,' from 5% to 12% will adversely affect the growth of the RE sector.\n- \u0083 Supply  chain  disruption  for  solar  PV  cells  and modules has led to unprecedented volatility in the prices. The present geopolitical situation has further increased the landed prices of modules which have negatively affected the growth of the RE sector.\n- \u0083 The lack of reliable data sources for wind mast data and the unavailability of good wind land locations has not allowed a boost to wind growth in the country.\n- \u0083 There  is  an  increasing  trend  of  unavailability  of connectivity for RE projects which is also slowing the RE growth.\n\nYour  Company  intends  to  have  a  long-term  contract for  sourcing  solar  modules,  to  mitigate  the  effects  of fluctuating prices of solar components.\n\n## 2. Flexible operation of Thermal Units\n\nTo integrate variable RE into the grid, coal-based power plants  must  regulate  their  generation  to  maintain  grid balance. Therefore, the influx of more RE power in the grid would require many coal-based plants to operate at technical minimum capacity, frequent load fluctuations, and two-shift operations. This will result in lower efficiency at partial load leading to a higher cost of generation. Other factors like the cost of balancing services and reduced life due to flexible operation of the thermal plant would also adversely affect the cost of generation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Environmental Concerns\n\nThe environmental concerns particularly relating to coalbased thermal stations have emerged as a major challenge to the sector. To comply with new standards for water consumption, PM, SOx, NOx and mercury, thermal power plants need to install emission control equipment like FGDs (Flue Gas Desulphurisation), and DSI (Dry Sorbent Injection) along with necessary combustion modifications and retrofitting of ESPs (Electrostatic Precipitator). The cost of retrofitting appropriate systems to meet these norms will have an adverse impact on tariffs. Logistics and supply chain for sourcing the consumables and disposing of the waste generated impose additional challenges.\n\nFurther, as per new environment norms, all plants must achieve 100% ash utilization within a 'compliance period' based  on  their  level  of  Ash  utilization  during  FY'22. Environmental compensation may have to be paid if these norms are not met.\n\nVarious initiatives have  been  undertaken  for  the development of new products and processes for bulk Ash utilization and as a result novel technologies & products such as Geo Polymeric (GPC) Road, Geo polymeric Pavers & Tetrapod, etc. have been successfully developed and implemented.\n\n## 4. Non-availability of Gas\n\nGOI  has  accorded  higher  priority  for  allocation  of domestic gas to CGD (City Gas Distribution) sector. Due to the diversion of allocated gas to the CGD sector as per MOP&NG guidelines, allocated domestic gas (APM/NonAPM) supplies to your Company became Nil w.e.f. 16 June 2021. Further, due to high reserve prices and onerous terms & conditions, the Power sector is not able to tie up new domestic gas from the KG basin.\n\nGas  stations  are  dependent  upon  costlier  RLNG  for declaring capacity/generation, however, the generation schedule on RLNG is not available on a sustained basis.\n\n## 5. Coal Shortage\n\nThe  unprecedented  rise  in  power  demand  coupled with constraints in coal transportation and a steep rise in the price of imported coal may result in inadequate coal stock at thermal plants, pushing them below critical levels. Your Company is making all efforts to secure fuel supply from captive coal mines as well as other domestic sources.  Import  of  coal  has  also  been  undertaken  as per the requirement and in alignment with Government guidelines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUTLOOK FOR THE COMPANY\n\n## Strategic focus of the Company\n\nYour  Company  is  a  market  leader  in  power  generation, supplying more than 24% of the Country's electricity supply with around 17% of installed capacity, and thus plays a key role in India's economic activity. As a State-owned utility, your Company's priority is to provide accessible, affordable and reliable power to the consumers and support the country's economic  development.  Your  Company  has  a  diversified portfolio of coal, gas, solar, wind, hydro, and small hydrobased power plants and has integrated both backward and forward, into coal mining and power trading respectively. The stature of your Company is well depicted by its worldwide rankings such as 2nd Independent Power Producer (IPP) in the S&P Global Energy Company rankings, 14th in Fortune India 500 companies (2021) and 11th largest among Indian companies (Global Rank: 484) in Forbes Global 2000 companies (2022).\n\nDuring the first half of the financial year 2021-22, the Indian economy recovered at a fast pace, but the growth trajectory flattened during the latter half, largely because of the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As the crisis unfolded, it resulted in the rising prices of Oil, Coal, and other commodities. The coal sector in India also grappled with demand-supply imbalances for reasons which include a sharp rise in power demand, supply  disruptions  caused  by  extended  monsoon,  and  a reduction in imports on the back of a steep rise in international prices. Despite these difficulties, your Company has managed to secure sufficient fuel and supply power to the beneficiaries as per their demand. This is also reflected in the fact that during the financial year 2021-22, the average PLF of the NTPC coal stations at 71%, was way higher than the country average of 59%.\n\nYour Company is continuing to pursue its long-term plan with a target to achieve a total installed capacity of 130 GW by 2032. The focus is on RE capacity addition with a roadmap of adding 60 GW by 2032. For consolidation and unlocking the value of the green business, your Company has incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, NTPC Green Energy Limited (NGEL) on 7 April 2022. The purpose is to hive off the identified Renewable Energy Assets of NTPC along with NREL to NGEL and carrying out monetization of NGEL through IPO or strategic investment route.\n\nYour Company envisages enhancing its current presence in consultancy  services,  power  trading,  and  ancillary  services and has targeted a 25% market share in ancillary services and storage by 2032 under its long-term plan. It is also planning to make a foray into the Hydrogen Economy and production of  Green  Chemicals  (Methanol  &  Ammonia)  supported  by research & development and collaboration with OEM/OES, research institutes, etc.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nYour Company is looking for opportunities to expand and diversify  its  business  in  new  areas  both  domestically  and\n\n<!-- image -->",

Capacity charges for 2021-22, has been billed as per the provisions of Tariff Regulations 2019.\n\n## Energy charges\n\nThe energy charges cover the primary and secondary fuel cost and limestone consumption cost (where applicable). Energy charges for coal-based station are to be calculated based on normative heat rate, normative APC, weighted average landed price of primary fuel & secondary fuel and weighted average GCV of coal on 'as received' less 85 Kcal/kg on account of\n\nvariation during storage & weighted average GCV of secondary fuel respectively as per the Tariff Regulations 2019.\n\nEnergy charges for gas-based station have been calculated based on normative heat rate, weighted average landed price of primary fuel and weighted average GCV of primary fuel.\n\n## Other charges\n\nBesides the capacity and energy charges, the other elements of tariff are:\n\n- \u0083 Special Allowance: For the financial year 2021-22, special allowance  has  been  considered  for  units  which  have completed 25 years as on 31 March 2021 in terms of Tariff Regulations 2019.\n- \u0083 Sharing  of  gains  due  to  variation  in  norms:  As  per Regulation 60, financial gains on account of controllable parameters- station heat rate, auxiliary consumption and secondary fuel oil consumption, have been accounted for based on monthly operating parameters, to be shared with the beneficiaries on annual basis, in the ratio of 50:50.\n- \u0083 CERC has issued order dated 6 December 2021, accordingly, financial gains for all generating stations may now be computed for the period 2014-19 as per Regulation 8(6) of Tariff Regulations 2014 based on difference of Normative Energy Charge Rate for the month considering normative SHR, APC & SOC and actual Energy Charge Rate for the month considering actual SHR, actual APC and actual SOC on cumulative basis up to the month of a Financial year. The difference in financial gains already accounted for the period 2014-19, computed as per above order has been accounted in the current year.\n- \u0083 Sharing of Non-Tariff Income: As per Regulation 62, nontariff income from rent of land or building, sale of scrap and advertisements has been accounted for, to be shared with beneficiaries on annual basis, in the ratio of 50:50.\n- \u0083 Compensation for degradation: Compensation for degradation  of  heat  rate,  APC  and  secondary  fuel consumption due to part load operations and multiple start/stop of units are being accounted as per CERC order dated 5 May 2017 relating to operating procedures and the compensation mechanism in terms of Grid Code.\n- \u0083 Incentive:  As  per  Regulation  49(B)(a),  incentive  to  be accounted  for  ex-bus  schedule  energy  corresponding to  scheduled  generation  in  excess  of  ex-bus  energy corresponding to 85% PLF.\n\nWith  effect  from  1  April  2019,  CERC  issued  directions  for implementation of the pilot project on Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) for inter-state generating stations. This mechanism helps in optimization of total schedule of the Inter State Generating Stations based on the variable cost, resulting in savings in cost of procurement for the DISCOMs. CERC  has  extended  the  implementation  of  the  SCED  pilot until further orders to gain more insights on different aspects related to optimal scheduling and dispatch across multiple market avenues.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There is further increase in fuel cost by ~9.60% because of quantity variation as a result of increased commercial generation in coal & gas plants. However, there is a decrease of ~1.63% due to decrease in previous year fuel cost.\n\nAn increase of ' 5,486.33 crore in fuel cost is attributable to new commercial capacity added during the year as well as on commercial capacity added during previous year which was operational for part of the previous year as compared to full year operations during the current year.\n\nOverall, fuel cost per unit generated increased to ' 2.15 in the financial year 2021-22 from ' 1.96 in the financial year 2020-21.\n\nThe power plants of the Company use coal and natural gas as the primary fuels. Oil is used as a secondary fuel for coalfired  plants  and  naphtha  as  an  alternate  fuel  in  gas-fired plants. Under the tariff norms set by the CERC, your Company is allowed to pass on fuel charges through the tariff, provided the Company meets specified operating parameters.\n\n## 2.1.2 Employee benefits expense (Note 40)\n\nEmployee benefits expense includes salaries & wages, bonus, allowances, benefits, contribution to provident & other funds and welfare expenses.\n\nEmployee  benefits  expense  have  increased  to ' 5,289.51 crore in the financial year 2021-22 from ' 4,942.19 crore in the financial year 2020-21.\n\nAn amount of ' 195.55 crore is attributable to new commercial capacity added during the year as well as on commercial capacity added during previous year which was operational for part of the previous year as compared to full year operations during the current year.\n\nIn terms of expenses per unit of generation, it is ' 0.18 in the  financial  year  2021-22.  These  expenses  account  for approximately 7% of operational expenditure in the financial year 2021-22.\n\n## 2.1.3 Other expenses (Note 43)\n\nOther expenses primarily consist of the expenses for repair and maintenance of plant & machinery, buildings, cost of captive coal produced, water charges, security expenses, corporate social responsibility, electricity duty, travelling, power charges, insurance,  training  and  recruitment  and  provisions.  These expenses are approximately 12% of operational expenditure in the financial year 2021-22.

This is due to increase in the gross PPE by ' 26,833.54 crore in the financial year 2021-22 over the previous year.\n\nThe increase in gross block is largely on account of increase in commercial capacity by 2,871.68 MW resulting in additional capitalization on account of commercial declaration of new units. The depreciation on new units capitalized during the year is on pro-rata basis. Further, depreciation for units declared commercial during financial year 2020-21 aggregating to 2,490 MW has been charged for the entire financial year 2021-22 as against a pro-rata charge during the financial year 2020-21.

The tariff is based on allowable costs like interest, depreciation, operation & maintenance expenses, etc. with a stipulated return. This form of rate regulation is known as cost-of-service regulations, which provide the Company to recover its costs of providing the goods or services plus a fair return.\n\nExchange differences arising from settlement/ translation of monetary item denominated in foreign currency to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations are recognized on an undiscounted basis as 'Regulatory deferral account debit/credit balance' by credit/debit to 'Movements in regulatory deferral account balances' during construction period and adjusted from the year in which the same becomes recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries. Accordingly, an amount of (-) ' 729.75 crore for the year ended as at 31 March 2022 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance' (31 March 2021: (-) ' 382.42 crore accounted as 'Regulatory deferral  account  debit  balance'.).  Further,  an  amount  of ' 35.82 crore (31 March 2021: ' 13.92 crore) has been realized/ recognized during the year.\n\nConsidering the methodology followed by the CERC for allowing impact  of  the  previous  pay  revision,  various  tariff  orders issued by the CERC under Regulations, 2014 and the abovementioned provision related to the change in law of CERC Tariff Regulations, 2014, a regulatory asset has been created (Regulatory  deferral  account  debit  balance)  towards  the increase in O&M expenditure due to the pay revision. This was taken up with CERC through truing up tariff petition. CERC has been allowing the same progressively and during the year, the expenditure has been allowed in respect of few stations and accordingly an amount of ' 127.02 crore (31 March 2021: Nil) has been adjusted and an amount of ' 359.58 crore (31 March 2021: Nil) has been reversed. Balance orders are expected in the coming years.\n\nCERC  Regulations  provide  that  deferred  tax  liability  up  to 31 March 2009 shall be recovered from the beneficiaries as and when the same gets materialized. Further, for the period commencing from 1 April 2014, CERC Tariff Regulations provide for grossing up of the return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income. The Company has recognised a regulatory deferral account debit balance for such deferred tax liabilities (net) in the financial statements. Regulatory deferral account debit balance for deferred tax liability for the period commencing from 1 April 2014 will be reversed in future years when the related deferred tax liability forms part of current tax. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,569.33 crore (31 March 2021: ' 1,437.85 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2022 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.\n\nThe  petition  filed by  the  Company  before  CERC  for reimbursement of the expenditure on transportation of ash has been favourably considered by CERC vide order dated 5 November 2018 and it was allowed to reimburse the actual\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nadditional expenditure incurred towards transportation of ash in terms of MOEF notification under change in law, as additional O&M expenses, w.e.f. 25 January 2016, subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory asset has been created towards ash transportation expenses in respect of stations where there is shortfall in revenue from sale of ash over and above ash transportation expenses. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,439.06 crore (31 March 2021: ' 1,003.79 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2022 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'. Further, the expenditure has been allowed by CERC during the year in respect of few stations and accordingly an amount of ' 55.58 crore (31 March 2021: Nil) has been adjusted.\n\nCERC  Regulations  provide  that  the  capital  expenditure  in respect of existing generating station incurred /projected to be incurred, inter-alia, towards liabilities to meet award of arbitration (i) within the original scope of work after the COD up to the cut-off date (Regulations 24); (ii) within the original scope of work and after the cut-off date (Regulations 25); and (iii) beyond the original scope of work (Regulation 26), will be admitted by CERC subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory deferral account debit balance has been accounted corresponding to the amount debited to Statement of profit & loss in respect of arbitration cases amounting to Nil for the year ended 31 March 2022 (31 March 2021: ' 110.81 crore). Further, 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance' amounting to ' 110.81 crore (31 March 2021: Nil) has been reversed based on assessment of its recoverability, by debit to Statement of profit and loss.\n\nAccordingly, for the financial year 2021-22, net movement in regulatory deferral account balances (net of tax) is ' 1,312.06 crore whereas for the financial year 2020-21, ' 1,779.39 crore was recognized as net movement in regulatory deferral account balances (net of tax).\n\n## 3.

Materiality Assessment\n\nMateriality assessment is a foundational and integral aspect of our Integrated Report, enabling us to gather insights on the  relative  importance  of  specific  Environmental,  Social and Economic issues and their impact on value creation. We conduct this exercise on regular time intervals (gap of 3-4 years) owing to significant change in business processes, external environment,  geographical  expansion,  global  trends  etc.  A structured  methodology  has  been  adopted  for  materiality assessment with engagement with both internal and external stakeholders. The details about methodology and engagements undertaken can be accessed from NTPC's website. (https:// www.ntpc.co.in/en/materiality-analysis)\n\nWe  undertook  a  fresh  materiality  assessment  methodology in FY 2021-22 in accordance with the IIRC Framework and GRI Standards through a credible third party i.e. M/s PwC. This exercise was helpful in prioritising inputs from relevant stakeholders, as mentioned in earlier (Stakeholder) section, through continuous interactions, into NTPC's decision making process.  Our  material  topics  also  provide  further  insights into  the  challenges,  risks  and  opportunities  our  company might face as described in the risk chapter of this report. The effective management of material issues is critical to our business sustainability as it direct our strategic planning and management priorities towards achieving the ultimate goal of long-term sustainable value creation for our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   1 | Occupational health and safety   | 10   | Governance practices                         |\n|-----|----------------------------------|------|----------------------------------------------|\n|   2 | Business ethics and integrity    | 11   | Economic value creation                      |\n|   3 | Energy management                | 12   | Waste management                             |\n|   4 | Climate change                   | 13   | Supply chain management                      |\n|   5 | Digital transformation           | 14   | New businesses and investments               |\n|   6 | Water & effluents management     | 15   | Employee development and talent retention    |\n|   7 | Labour practices                 | 16   | Biodiversity and natural resource management |\n|   8 | Air emissions                    | 17   | Innovation and R&D                           |\n|   9 | Community engagement             |      |                                              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The wastes generated from our processes are either recycled into useful materials, used as  raw  material  for  another  industry  or  are  disposed/ processed as per regulations. We are in the process of forward and backward integration of our core business of power generation through coal mines for captive use, and acquisition  of  companies  involved  in  power  generation business. No disruptive changes took place in our supply chain during the reporting year. Incremental changes in our overall business processes are reported in the relevant sections. We are continuously evolving our business model to broaden value creation for our various stakeholders. Integrated planning and execution is at the core of this evolution from business model to a 'value creation' model. We base our 'value creation' model on six 'capitals' which serve as a stock for our inputs.\n\nFor each of the inputs withdrawn, we add elements of value for our stakeholders through our business processes & functions in tandem with the external environment and our mission, vision and core values. This is enabled through strategy formulation, risk identification, resource allocation and periodic performance monitoring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our Value Creation Model\n\nOur contribution towards the nation is being pursued in response to continuing economic growth in India combined with increasing decarbonisation efforts, speedier diffusion of  digitization  and  decentralization.  NTPC's  integrated framework is designed to steer action in pursuit of its core values, vision and mission in the face of changing external and  internal  operating  environment.  For  this,  NTPC  has adopted the six capitals approach proposed as part of the International Integrated Reporting Council's <IR> Framework. This integrated framework is designed to determine and pursue action by each function and business to contribute to  our  transformation  and  value  creation  and  thereby\n\nrepresent our commitment towards a sustainable future. NTPC conducts continuous monitoring and analysis of its external environment to identify threats and opportunities that may pose any risk to the organization, its strategy and its business model. There are several steps being taken to mitigate or manage key risks or to create value from key opportunities, including the identification of the associated strategic  objectives,  strategies,  policies,  targets  and  KPI. Based on the regular review of our business activities and outcome with a focus on the organization's outlook we strategize our approach in terms of MOU with government, internal management agenda to mitigate or manage our risks and maximize our opportunities.\n\nNTPC Rojmal (Wind) NTPC Rojmal (Wind)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## b.

We  have  undertaken  EIA  studies based  on  which  Environmental  Management  Plans  for  all stations are prepared and implemented. Our environmental policy focusses on optimum utilization of natural resources, minimization of waste by reduce, reuse & recycle, adoption of latest technologies and augmentation of older units for higher efficiency. We are in a continuous process of environment performance  improvement  with  the  techno-economically feasible engineering solutions to ensure compliance. Accordingly,  we  are  regularly  upgrading  our  technologies and operational practices for maintaining the environmental parameters as per the norms of regulatory agencies. Out of total stations 33 are ISO:14001 certified. Rest newly commercialized plants are in the process of getting ISO certification. We have also established an environmental grievance mechanism for recording all grievances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water & Effluent Management\n\nFor electricity production, water is a prime resource, and we use water in a judicious and sustainable manner. The water consumption is being monitored continuously through online water metering systems. Water consumption of the stations\n\nis continually optimized by practicing 3R principle (Reduce, Recycle & Reuse), which is the core of our Water Policy.\n\nIn almost all of our Thermal Power Plants, water is used in a closed cycle cooling system with cooling towers, so that there is no pollution of water bodies. In all other processes, very little water loss is incurred except in the cooling water system where significant amount is lost as evaporation, drift and blow down. We are increasing Cycles of Concentration (COC) to efficiently use water and reduce amount of blow down. The high TDS blow down water is reused in other processes. We are in the process of implementing ZLD (Zero Liquid Discharge) at all of our stations. Till date 16 of our generating stations have implemented ZLD. The implementation at rest of stations is in advanced stage and current discharge is in conformity with  stipulated  norms  and  conditions.  Hence,  there  is  no significant impact on the water bodies and related habitats by the organization's discharges of water (treated effluents) and runoff.\n\nIncreasing reuse and recycling of effluents has also led to a decrease in fresh water withdrawal requirements over the years. However, increasing penetration of renewables into the grid is slowly forcing the thermal units to operate at very low PLF, leading to increase of per unit water consumption. Further, implementation of wet FGD system at all stations is going to make the water consumption reduction process challenging.\n\n## Water Withdrawal\n\nFor operation of our plants, water is drawn by our stations from various sources of water bodies such as rivers, reservoirs, canals. Sea water is used by our coastal plants.\n\n## Water Withdrawal by Source Data\n\n| KPI                                                                                | Unit    | FY 2021-22            | FY 2021-22          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                                                    |         | Non Water Stress Area | Water stressed area |\n| Withdrawal from scarce source:                                                     |         | 0                     | 0                   |\n| Surface water (Rivers,lakes, reservoir, Wetland)                                   |         |                       |                     |\n| - freshwater ( \u2264  1,000 mg/l Total Dissolved Solids)                               | Lakh KL | 19,095                | 33,652              |\n| - other water (> 1,000 mg/l Total Dissolved Solids)                                | Lakh KL | 0                     | 0                   |\n| Ground water                                                                       |         |                       |                     |\n| - freshwater ( \u2264  1,000 mg/l Total Dissolved Solids)                               | Lakh KL | 0                     | 0                   |\n| - other water (> 1,000 mg/l Total Dissolved Solids)                                | Lakh KL | 0                     | 0                   |\n| Water from thirdparty                                                              |         |                       |                     |\n| - freshwater ( \u2264  1,000 mg/l Total Dissolved Solids)                               | Lakh KL | 0                     | 1.50                |\n| - other water (> 1,000 mg/l Total Dissolved Solids)                                | Lakh KL | 0                     | 0                   |\n| Withdrawal from non scarce source:                                                 |         | 0                     | 0                   |\n| Sea water                                                                          | Lakh KL | 0                     | 0                   |\n| - fresh water ( \u2264  1,000 mg/l Total Dissolved Solids) (used as is  and dissalated) | Lakh KL | 0                     | 0                   |\n| - other water (> 1,000 mg/l Total Dissolved Solids)                                | Lakh KL | 1465                  | 111                 |\n| Total Fresh Water Withdrawal                                                       | Lakh KL | 19095                 | 33654               |\n\n<!-- image -->",

There has been emphasis on its further improvement through measurement, monitoring and implementation of conservation plans.\n\nThe basic input materials in power generation are fuel (coal/ gas as primary fuel and oil as secondary fuel) which are as such totally consumed in boiler and hence there is no scope for recyclability of input materials for thermal power generation. Similarly,  the  chemicals  during  water  treatment  are  totally consumed and not recycled.\n\nSeveral  steps  for  improvement  in  cycle  efficiency  have been taken resulting in increase in efficiency and significant improvement in fuel saving (Coal and Oil) per unit of energy generated. As far as coal is concerned, adoption of higher size units (higher steam parameters) for power generation and replacement of coal with Biomass is leading to improvement of design/operational efficiency which in turn is reducing the specific  coal  consumption.  NTPC  has  already  fired  ~40386 metric  tonnes  of  biomass  pellets  at  its  various  plants  by March'22 in FY' 2021-22 vs 24600 MT used in FY'2020-21.\n\nThe trends for improvement in performance parameters of specific coal consumption and specific oil consumption are shown in table below:\n\n| Type        | Units    | FY 2019-20   | FY 2020-21   | FY 2021-22   |\n|-------------|----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Coal        | MMT      | 187.53       | 195.39       | 226.55       |\n| Coal        | Kcal/Kg  | 3,495.00     | 3,487.57     | 3,487.06     |\n| Natural Gas | MMSCM    | 1,957.86     | 2,602.45     | 2,030.91     |\n| Natural Gas | Kcal/SCM | 9,500.00     | 9,329.26     | 9,320.97     |\n| Naptha      | MT       | 97.90        | 18,279.54    | 8,923.49     |\n| Naptha      | Kcal/Kg  | 11,368.00    | 11,278.11    | 11,352.90    |\n| LDO         | KL       | 1,10,322.84  | 1,03,297.55  | 1,39,853.77  |\n| LDO         | Kcal/KL  | 9,521.00     | 9,588.00     | 9,384.69     |\n| HFO         | KL       | 50,726.27    | 47,561.55    | 49,821.36    |\n| HFO         | Kcal/KL  | 9,891.00     | 9,893.18     | 9,761.40     |\n| HSD         | KL       | 86.57        | 284.69       | 18,177.57    |\n| HSD         | Kcal/KL  | 9,024.00     | 8,754.50     | 9,053.50     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this regard particularly, adoption of higher size units has led to efficiency improvement, leading to a reduction in per unit coal consumption. We are supplementing these efforts with cofiring of  agro-residues,  implementation  of  Energy  and  Efficiency Management System, reduction in Auxiliary Power Consumption to further reduce our overall energy consumption.\n\n## Energy intensity\n\nThe  Net  Energy  Intensity  of  the  Group,  which  provides  a measure of its operational efficiency and reducing share of fossil based generation, amounted to 10.08 MJ/kWh in FY 2021-22.

It is a market-based mechanism to enhance the cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency improvements in energy-intensive large industries through certification of energy savings achieved by improvement in Net Heat Rate. Achieved improvement in NHR can be traded in terms of Energy Savings Certificates (ESCerts). Under  PAT  cycle-I,  NTPC  stations  had  exceeded  Net  Heat Rate improvement targets and earned a net 170653 ESCerts. Currently, NTPC has a stock of 161759 EScerts (balance from PAT cycle-I) that will be used for PAT cycle-II. PAT cycles II & III have been completed in March 2019 & 2020, respectively, and notification of EScerts earned is awaited.\n\nAll Coal and Gas stations of NTPC are Designated Consumers under  the  Government  of  India's  Performance,  Achieve, and Trade (PAT) Scheme.  Our stations, except a few, have achieved their PAT targets, and after the PAT cycle I&II NTPC, as a company, has a net surplus of 119809 ESCerts.\n\nTo meet given PAT targets, our stations are executing various schemes and adopting best O&M practices to improve our Net Heat Rate. Prominent activities are listed under the 'Energy Conservation' head.\n\nFor us, EC is not only a means of reducing costs but also a part  of  a  sustainable  consumption  strategy  to  conserve national energy reserves. In this regard, adopting higher size units has improved efficiency, leading to reduced per unit coal consumption. We are supplementing these efforts with cofiring of agro-residues and implementing Energy and Efficiency Management System.

We have been taking a lot of initiatives to conserve energy through energy and operational efficiency measures. APC of coal plants has decreased compared to previous years due to efficient operations due to the country's high power demand.\n\n## Air (Non-GHG) Emissions Management\n\nWe have made consistent efforts to reduce our air emissions through state-of-the-art technologies and monitoring systems. As per the new notifications of the Ministry of Environment, Forests  and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and NTPC's Brighter Plan targets  for reducing the limits for specific water consumption and  stack emissions from thermal power plants for SOx, NOx, PM  and mercury emissions, NTPC is leading the power sector in country by implementing the requisite measures.\n\nWe have installed the Continuous Emission Monitoring System. (CEMS) in all running units to monitor emissions of Particulate Matter (PM), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) in flue gases. The emissions are monitored on a real-time basis. These results are directly linked with the servers of regulatory agencies,  namely  CPCB/SPCB.  Additionally,  we  regularly conduct off-line monitoring of our stacks. Ambient air quality monitoring is also monitored through an online Ambient Air Quality Monitoring System (AAQMS).\n\nFor controlling PM emissions majority of NTPC stations are equipped with more than 99.8% efficient ESPs. Further, ESP augmentation through Renovation & Modernisation (R&M) has been taken up wherever necessary.\n\nTo control the SOx emission, NTPC has installed the Lime  based wet FGD (Flue Gas Desulphurisation) system in stage-V  (500 MW) of Vindhyachal station. Dry sorbent injection (DSI)  based FGD has been commissioned and operational for SOx  emission control in units (840 MW) of Dadri (Stage-I).\n\nFGD systems are under the advanced stage of erection at Dadri (Stage-II) and Jhajjar plants. With these, the commissioning of  FGD in NTPC Units with a capacity of 60+ GW is in various\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstages of progress. Award for FGD in balance NTPC units with a capacity of 880 MW is being done.\n\nFor  controlling  the  NOx,  various  De-NOx  techniques  are being  implemented at NTPC stations based on the prescribed regulatory  limits  and  our  goals  as  per  Brighter  Plan  2032. Combustion  Modification  in  35  units  of  around  16  GW, including  units located in NCR, i.e., 2 units of Dadri, 3 units of Jhajjar, have  already been completed. Further, an award is already placed for  Combustion modification for 34 units of around 14GW. Work is in progress for five units (2.1 GW) and balanced 10 units (3.4 GW) would also be done at the earliest.\n\nWe  are  monitoring  Mercury  emissions  from  our  plants.  At many  stations, mercury emissions are below the minimum detectable  limit (MDL). In all such cases, for FY 2021-22, 50% of MDL is  considered while calculating mercury load. We are also upgrading our technologies and systems to ensure a reduction in the consumption of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS).\n\nWe have already phased out the use of PCBs from all our operations.\n\n| Name of Indicator             | FY 2019-20   | FY 2020-21   | FY 2021-22   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| SOx (MT)                      | 12,79,366.20 | 15,52,253.67 | 16,21,348.84 |\n| Specific SOx (gm/Kwh)         | 4.41         | 4.94         | 4.50         |\n| NOx (MT)                      | 6,12,983.06  | 6,02,831.58  | 6,40,419.16  |\n| Specific NOx (gm/Kwh)         | 2.11         | 1.93         | 1.78         |\n| Particular Matter PM (MT)     | 89,246.82    | 88,431.33    | 91,115.35    |\n| Specific PM (gm/Kwh)          | 0.31         | 0.28         | 0.25         |\n| Mercury (MT)                  | 10.18        | 4.66         | 7.23         |\n| Specific Mercury   (gm/Kwh)   | 0.04         | 0.00         | 0.00         |\n| ODS (CFC-11 equivalent  (kg)) | 1,194.00     | 23,499.86    | 403.00       |\n\nFGD Installation at NTPC, Telangana\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are committed to reduce the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission intensity  of  our  power  generation.  Our  decarbonization strategy is four-pronged.\n\n## Our climate change strategy\n\n## Fuel Diversification\n\nAs on 31.03.2022, NTPC group has 1657 MW, 163 MW and 3757 MW of Solar, Wind and Hydro capacity respectively, total amounting to 5.577 GW. Our current non-fossil portfolio is ~17 GW including commissioned, under construction and under tendering capacities. By 2032, NTPC will have 60 GW of cumulative renewable capacity.\n\n## Technology Upgradation & Efficiency Improvement\n\nWe have adopted comparatively cleaner and energy-efficient technologies that reduce GHG emissions per unit of electricity generated. We are continuously moving from sub-critical to supercritical and onto ultra-supercritical technology. NTPC is among early adopters of supercritical and ultrasupercritical boilers in India, which save ~2% of fuel per unit of power generated  resulting  in  8%  reduction  of  emission  intensity\n\nwith respect to conventional subcritical power plants. It also increase efficiency by around 8%. As on 31.03.2022, NTPC had already commissioned 28 units based on super critical and ultra super critical technologies with a total capacity of 19,740 MW.\n\nAlso, we did energy saving of around 1693.5 TJ in FY'22. In the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme of GoI, NTPC has exceeded the targets and have earned 170653 EScerts.\n\n## Research & Development\n\nCO 2 is the largest gaseous pollutant in several major industry viz fossil fuel power plants, cement, sugar, textile etc. We are working on to capture CO 2 from waste flue gases & convert it to hydrocarbon viz Methanol. This will ensure that we generate a clean fuel as well sequester carbon from the environment further adding great economic value. We are working on the following two projects:\n\n- a)   Project-1: Design & Setup of 10 TPD CO 2 to Methanol Plant at NTPC Vindhyachal.\n- b)   Project-2: Development of Indigenous Catalyst & Reactor for Methanol Synthesis\n\nWe are also utilizing agro-residue for power generation, which will help us further reduce equivalent amount of fossil based CO 2 emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our goal of building the economy could only be achieved by respecting the ecology. Thus, we put in our most sincere efforts to try to give back to nature more than we take. Envisioning a clear and comprehensive goal to preserve our nature, we have developed a dedicated NTPC Biodiversity Policy in 2018, which got revised in year 2022. The policy clearly states our vision and guidelines for conservation, restoration and enhancement of biodiversity. Also, NTPC is a proud member of Indian Business and Biodiversity initiative.\n\nNTPC  does  not  construct  and  maintain  transmission  and distribution corridors. For power project areas, these aspects are  covered  in  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  Studies, undertaken according to Terms of Reference prescribed by MOEF&CC. If any specifically important ecosystem exists within the study area, additional studies are undertaken and their recommendations are adopted.",

However, the project and all its components are located outside the sanctuary as well as eco-sensitive zone of the sanctuary, except for the water intake structure.\n- \u00b7 In case of Feroze Gandhi Unchahar Thermal Power Station, District Rae Bareli (Uttar Pradesh), Samaspur Bird Sanctuary was established by State Government in 1987 much after the project construction was started by UP State Electricity Board  in  1981.  NTPC  took  over  the  project  in  1992.

NTPC established 3x250 MW within the same premises after a decision in PMO in 2005. The project and all its component were located outside the sanctuary. However, the State Govt. declared the eco-sensitive zone of the sanctuary in 2021 and some components of the project are falling within the eco-sensitive zone after 2021.\n\nOur vision of having a healthy ecology around begins from inside of our plants. Not only do we put in our best efforts to  avoid  disturbance  to  ecology  of  the  surrounding  area by  minimizing  discharge/disposal  of  waste/effluents,  but we also give a special thrust to afforestation and green belt development at all our projects covering vast tracts of land in and around projects. At some of the projects (like Rihand and National Capital Power Project), we have converted barren stretches of land into lush green environments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A total of 45 species were recorded from the NTPC Dadri wetlands (including Wetland 1 and Wetland 2). Out of these, 42 species are  classified  as  'wetland  dependent'  as  per  the  Asian Waterbird Census data sheets.\n\nThe results of the Census/Assessment point out to the presence of  many  species,  that  too  in  good  numbers.  The  wetland complex at NTPC Dadri was indeed a stopover site for migratory avifauna, where they gather in relatively large numbers to feed on their way to other larger wetlands throughout the Indian subcontinent. The wetland represents a high species richness when compared with the total area/size of the waterbodies and therefore is also of high conservation significance.\n\n## Cheer Pheasant at Koldam\n\nAt our Koldam Hyroelectric Power Plant (HEPP), where habitat of  Cheer  Pheasant  (Catreus  wallichii),  which  is  included  in IUCN Red List species (under vulnerable category) existed in some area of Majathal Wild Life Sanctuary, which falls under submergence area of Koldam HEPP. In order to restore the area of Majthal Wildlife Sanctuary involved in Koldam Project, NTPC has identified jointly with wildlife Wing of GoHP 500 ha of land in and around Majthal Wildlife Sanctuary for Cheer Pheasant habitat, acquired the land and handed over to State Government to get it notified as a sanctuary. In addition, another 10 km 2 wildlife habitat has been identified in consultation with State Forest Department of HP to get it notified as a Sanctuary. Various  schemes  such  as  compensatory  afforestation,  CAT\n\nplan, RIM plantation, development of fisheries etc. towards environmental and bio-diversity conservation are already being implemented through the concerned authorities. We have also made  financial  contributions  towards  the  various  schemes being implemented by the state government at Koldam HEPP to restore/ enhance the wildlife habitats.\n\nFurther, we have taken various voluntary initiatives towards conservation  of  aquatic  and  terrestrial  wildlife  around our operations. Our Simhadri Station in Andhra Pradesh is supporting  the  Central  Marine  Fisheries  Research  Institute (CMFRI) to deploy artificial reefs near the coast. These reefs simulate coral beds, and function as a comfortable habitat for fish and diverse marine organisms. The first deployment of artificial reefs in Andhra Pradesh was successfully done off the Muthalampalem coast.\n\nConservation Activities under CAT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In case of hydro power project at Kol Dam, offset habitat has been created with the help of State Forest Department. The comparative study is yet to be undertaken.\n\n## Badarpur Biodiversity Park\n\nWe have taken up the development of Mega Eco Park at Badarpur spread over 884 acres, one of the largest man-made parks in not only India but will be bigger than New York Central Park spread over 842 acres. Eco Park is being developed over already closed Badarpur station's Ash dyke.\n\n## Afforestation\n\nNTPC  since  its  inception  has  been  carrying  out  massive plantation to mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. NTPC's afforestation efforts not only add to India's green cover and oxygen bank but also perform the role of 'sinks' for the polluting emissions from the stations etc.\n\nNTPC  has  developed  nurseries  in  plants  and  townships  to develop seed and seedlings, plants for in-house plantation and  horticulture  activities.  Plantation  activities  in  NTPC  is done through State Forest Departments through MOUs. The MOUs specify the plantation year, maintenance years of the plantation, fund flow details and survival percentages of the plantation. NTPC has made Guidelines of Afforestation based on which the afforestation is done in NTPC projects.\n\nThe plantation activities undertaken by NTPC can be classified into five broad categories.\n\n- 1. Development of green belt around the plant: The green belt helps in reducing pollution by trapping particulate due to plant operations, reduce the noise level originating from running machines in the plant, acts as a carbon sink thereby reducing the temperature in the surrounding and improves the oxygen content of the atmosphere. Till date all the running stations of NTPC have green belts and for new stations green belts are being developed.\n- 2. Plantation  by  individual  stations:  In  order  to  create additional carbon sinks in line with India's NDC-2030 NTPC has decided to plant 10 million trees from 2016 to 2026 with 1 million trees per year across India through different NTPC stations.\n- 3. Distribution of fruit bearing trees to farmers and township residents by NTPC projects: NTPC distributes small saplings of fruit bearing trees, flower trees and vegetable bearing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nplants to the local farmers and township residents. The aim is to encourage plantation by township residents and farmers in their individual land holdings. These trees are supplied free of cost to the farmers and the residents.

With an investment of about ' 25 Crores, this project will be benefitting the local population, Indore City,and Madhya Pradesh at large as the project is aimed to enhance  green  cover,  improve  water  retention,  the  crop diversity including to promote organic farming and marketing. The project is being taken up involving Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) Headquartered at Seol and Indian Institute of Forest Management Bhopal. This project is also one of its kind in India and implementation is likely to become a role model for replication across the country.\n\nNarmada Landscape Restoration Project funded by NTPC Ltd. and USAID aims to establish the first of its kind Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) model in India that will incentivize the agriculture and forest community to improve and maintain water  resources  in  River  Narmada  in  Khargone  district  of Madhya Pradesh. PES has been globally recognized\n\nOne of the earliest, best-known cases illustrating the 'Payments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfor Ecosystem Services' principle is New York City, which, in the early 1990s, began paying for land management in the Catskills watershed to ensure safe drinking water for the city, avoiding the cost of building an expensive water treatment plant.\n\nIn case of NLRP, the city is Indore which picks up water for its municipal supply from River Narmada in Jalud. Landscape in  the  river  catchment  includes  agriculture  and  forest  and NLRP is deeply engaged with the community to introduce and build  capacity  on  sustainable  landscape  practices  through government  support,  collective/institutional  building,  and demonstration. In the process, the project will impact 10,000 hectares  of  landscape  in  the  area  around  NTPC  Khargone Thermal Power Plant.\n\nThe project in its 18 months has made remarkable progress in selecting key intervention locations and monitoring points for improvement in water quality and quantity.\n\n- I. Monitoring  equipment like  Hot  Air  Oven,  Rain-gauge, Electronic  Balance,  H-Flume,  Soil  Auger,  Enamel  gauge, Automatic water stage level recorder, PAN Evaporimeter, Soil  Moisture  Meter,  Infiltrometer,  and  Water  sampler have  been  installed  both  in  the  field  and  Maheshwar Project office to periodically collect data on water and soil parameters.\n\n<!-- image -->",

NLRP is demonstrating organic farming activities to promote sustainable alternatives for Fertilizers and Pesticides that will positively impact the water resources in River Narmada. Trainings and demonstrations in the field on Vermi-compost, NADEP Compost and Sanjeewak to be used as suitable alternative for fertilizers while use of pheromone traps and t-guards to reduce the dependency on pesticides is underway.\n\nMany farmers like Ramsingh Kharte and Gabbarsingh Chouhan themselves said that the productivity of our soil has decreased drastically and only inputs like Vermi-compost and FYM can restore it. They were trying to apply this in their fields, but lack of availability and knowledge restricted them to adopt such practice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMrs. Raiku Bai (a female farmer) w/o Ramesh Dodhve said, 'I always tried to reduce the cost of cultivation through sustainable and natural ways but due to lack of knowledge and proper guidance, I couldn't succeed. After getting guidance from the project team, I know well about how to prepare Sanjeewak and use that infield.'\n\nOne of a demo farmer Mr. Bhuresingh Rathode said 'Maine sirf 2 ekad ke chane ke khet me Pheromone trap or T-Guard lagaya tha, jisse waha mujhe apne dusre kheto ki tulna me na ke barabar dawai, kito ke liye dalni padhi.

The contributions  to  the  fund  for  the  year  are  recognized  as expense and are charged to the profit or loss. Our obligation is to make such fixed contributions and to ensure a minimum rate of return to the members as specified by the Government of India.\n\nThe  gratuity  is  funded  by  the  Company  and  is  managed by separate trust.

To this end, we have formed the Internal Complaints Committees  at  our  operational  locations  where  complaints against  sexual  harassment  can  be  registered.  Every  three years, the constitution of these committees is changed and new members are nominated. This is supported by the AntiSexual Harassment Policy (Prevention, Prohibition & Redressal of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace) covering All female employees (regular, contractual, temporary, trainees) which ensures a free and fair enquiry process. During FY 202122, Two cases of sexual harassment were reported, which were resolved and no other cases are pending as on date.\n\n<!-- image -->",

During the reporting year, no complaints on Human Right related issues like child labour, forced labour at workplace were reported.\n\n## Security Practices\n\nAt  NTPC,  ensuring  security  for  the  workforce  is  our  prime concern.  We  understand  our  responsibility  for  establishing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand maintaining a secured working environment for all our installations,  workforce,  data  and  operations.  This  is  being taken care of by deploying CISF at all units of NTPC as per norms of Ministry of Home Affairs. Similarly, ex-servicemen security agencies are deployed in the non-core areas in our sites like project townships, HQs, Offices etc. duly sponsored by the Directorate General of Resettlement, under Ministry of Defence, as per norms set by the DPE. GoI imparts training and refresher courses to these personnel in security systems and human rights aspects before their formal induction to the service.\n\nConcrete  steps  are  being  taken  for  upgrading  surveillance systems  at  all  projects/stations  by  installing  state-of-the-art security systems.\n\nAt NTPC, we have introduced CLIMS (Contract Labour Information Management System), a biometric labour attendance system for contract labours. Besides improving security, this has helped in monitoring and execution of labour payments and benefits.\n\n## People before PLF\n\nPeople before PLF (Plant Load Factor)' is the guiding philosophy behind the entire gamut of HR policies at NTPC. We value our employee and believe that the quality of benefits for our employees is one of the motivation factor in improving employee retention and enhancing their productivity.\n\nAt  NTPC,  regular  feedback  is  taken  from  employees  by conducting  annual  employee  satisfaction  surveys  through external agencies. The satisfaction index for FY 2021-22 was 79%. The purpose is to seek employee feedback on various systems such as satisfaction w.r.t safety and security, grievancehandling  mechanism,  organization  commitment,  monetary benefits, job satisfaction, welfare facilities, recognition and",

To  make  a comprehensive hazard identification, input was taken from historical  accident  and  incident  data  from  different  (Coal, gas and Hydro) stations. To enrich this exercise further data of other power utilities were also referred. The hierarchy of controls of hazards followed in preparing this document is elimination  of  hazard,  substitution  of  hazard,  engineering controls, administrative controls and PPEs in respective order. These documents serve as overall input to the stations while preparing station specific HIRAC document. Also, this is useful for capacity building of line executive or new entrants.\n\n## Incident Investigation:\n\nOur aim is to reach the target of zero injuries and incidents across all our operating stations. We have a formal process for investigation of all accidents to examine each case in detail and in depth to find out the causes of accidents, the extent of losses caused, the circumstances / individuals responsible and to obtain considered recommendations for prevention of  recurrences  in  similar  or  related  nature  of  accidents. Incident investigation is done as per chapter 1a 'Guidelines for Constitution of Enquiry Committees & Conduct of Enquiries' of as per NTPC Safety Manual 2015.\n\n## NTPC Safety Framework:\n\nNTPC safety framework system has been rolled out across company. This Framework is a guidance document to the various functions and roles. It contains a set of expectations that ensure that all efforts are aligned with the overall Policy and objectives of NTPC.

Safety Committees:\n\nWorker's  participation  in  safety  management  as  per section 41 of factories act is done along with management representative. The safety committee meeting being held on quarterly basis to discuss the safety and health issues of station and measures to mitigate these issues.\n\n## Safety Training\n\nAll  the  agency  workers  are  given  safety  induction  training during their initial employment. In addition, 23 job specific training modules are also prepared, and the agency workers are given the training as per their job requirement. Every year efforts are made to ensure that all our workforce undergo these safety trainings. The training programs covers topics such as electrical safety, material handling, working at height, road safety, and chemical handling, etc. These topics relate to the key work-related hazards and risks for our business, apart from topics pertaining to general operations and best practices on occupational health and safety.\n\nTo imbibe emergency response procedures into our routine systems,  we  have  successfully  established  NTPC  Safety Academy at Unchahar, where our employees and stakeholders are provided hands-on training on safety and emergencies. A safety committee at each of our operating stations has been constituted as per the Factories Act.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our Supplier/contractor Safety Performance evaluation contains following controls:\n\n- \u00b7 Contractor safety assessment\n- \u00b7 Contractor risk control\n- \u00b7 Worker role competence\n- \u00b7 NTPC's  CLIMS  (Contract  Labor  Information  Management System) system are the criterion for entering or gate pass system at site.\n- \u00b7 The contractor shall ensure that all personnel working at site having a photo Identity card before they are engaged for any work and properly mentioned details like validity, Category/designation  and  work  area  etc.  This  ID  card should be issued only after ensuring their screening test, medical fitness and safety induction training. If any agency worker  found  to  be  involved  in  unsafe  act,  they  are counselled to follow proper safety behaviour. With 03 nos of repeated unsafe acts, the worker is debarred from duty.\n- \u00b7 To  strengthen  the  existing  Safety  Rules  for  O&M/ Construction and Erection works and to create a safe environment during execution of works at various projects of NTPC, various safety rules have been incorporated in Bidding  Documents.  These  Safety  Rules  lay  down  the safety requirements for safe execution of project activities, responsibilities  of  the  Contractor,  and  all  concerned involved  in  Construction  and  Erection.  The  Contractor, including his sub-contractors, while executing the Works, shall strictly comply with these Safety rules and statutory requirements (including amendments thereof), as applicable, in respect of safety of personnel, equipment and materials at site area under execution of the Contractor.\n- \u00b7 The provisions pertaining to Penalty/Reward for Safety are specified in bidding document. Any violation of the contractual conditions in question will produce specific penalties  up  to  termination  of  the  contract  and/or suspension of qualification.\n\n- \u00b7 Drinking  of  Alcoholic  beverages  is  strictly  prohibited. Employees under the influence of any intoxicants, even to the slightest degree, shall not be permitted to remain at work. Each contractor should maintain 'breath analyzer' to determine the intoxicated workers at site.\n- In order to strengthen the existing Safety Rules for O&M/ Construction and Erection works and to create a safe environment during execution of works at various projects of NTPC, the following safety rules have been incorporated in Bidding Documents.\n- \u00b7 Concerned  site  and  the  Contractor  shall  establish  Site regulations setting out the rules to be observed in the execution of the Contract at the Site and shall comply therewith. The Contractor shall prepare and submit to the Employer, with a copy to the Project Manager, proposed Site  regulations  for  the  Employer's  approval,  which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such Site regulations shall include, but shall not be limited to, rules in respect of security, safety of the Facilities including gate control, sanitation, medical care, and fire prevention.\n- \u00b7 NTPC  has  formulated  Safety  Rules  for  Construction  & Erection of Power Plants and is available in public domain. These Safety Rules lay down the safety requirements for safe execution of project activities, responsibilities of the Contractor, and all concerned involved in Construction and Erection.  The  Contractor,  including  his  sub-contractors, while  executing  the  Works,  shall  strictly  comply  with these Safety rules and statutory requirements (including amendments thereof), as applicable, in respect of safety of personnel, equipment and materials at site area under execution of the Contractor.\n- \u00b7 The provisions pertaining to Penalty/Reward for Safety are specified in bidding document. A BOQ item namely 'Amount linked to Safety Aspects/ compliance to Safety Rules' are specified in the Price Schedules wherein Contractor will be  required  to  quote  an  amount  subject  to  minimum percentage (as specified in the Bidding documents) of Service  portion  of  Contract  (i.e.  Civil  plus  Installation/ Erection plus Structural Works).

Recently corporate safety has developed standard safety induction training module for uniform implementation across NTPC. Safety induction training is must before issuing gate pass for plant entry. 23 Job specific training modules have been identified and being developed. Corporate  safety  is  developing  trainers  on  these  modules from each project, so that further job specific training can be arranged at projects with a uniformity across NTPC. Safety peptalk and toolbox talks are provided to workers before start of the job by supervisor / engineer so that workers are made aware about the hazards involved in the job.\n\n## Work Related Injuries\n\nAll work related injuries are reported as per the established system of accident reporting in the NTPC Safety manual. All incidents  resulting  into  injury  are  investigated  as  per  the established procedure in NTPC Safety manual. The gist of fatal accidents and reportable accidents are uploaded at Safety intranet. Details of the accident after investigation is shared through meetings (virtually/ physically) with all projects so that cause and recommendations can be communicated for timely action.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll work related injuries are also shared with senior persons in  each  project  through  mobile  application  for  immediate corrective action if required.\n\n## NTPC Safety App: Suraksha\n\nCorporate safety in consultation with Corporate IT has launched mobile app 'Suraksha' which has a facility of reporting of work related injuries and incidents. Data of the app is fetched in SAP in real time basis. Capturing of latest data helps analysis of work related injuries and in taking corrective action to prevent their recurrence in NTPC. Till date more than 11000 employees have downloaded and using this app.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health\n\nOur NTPC hospitals provide round the clock service to our employees and their dependents across locations. We also have empaneled 250+ specialty and super specialty hospitals across approx. 25 cities/towns for providing specialist treatment to our employees. Ambulances equipped with Advanced Life Support systems are available at power plants to cater to medical emergencies. 100% preventive medical checkup is mandatory for all employees. Also, various lectures & camps are organized through specialists on medical & lifestyle regularly for greater awareness. The organization works for holistic welfare across physical, mental, and spiritual/purposeful wellbeing through conduction of several programs like Snehal, Kshitiz, Sparsh, etc.",

We organize different awareness programs to teach them work-life balance to generate healthy habits, ergonomics, etc. and we also ensure the involvement of our employees in such activities.\n\n## Occupational Health Services\n\nAdequate  medical  facilities  have  been  established  at  site as required under statutory provision like First aid centre, Ambulance  room,  qualified  medical  doctor  etc.  Annual health  check-up  of  employees  and  their  spouse  is  being conducted annually. To minimize the risks, regular monitoring of the workplace for hazards like dust/coal dust, gas or vapor, illumination, noise- level is carried out and trend analysis is done. We also regularly hold awareness sessions for our employees and  contract  workers  on  industrial  hazards,  occupational diseases, lifestyle modifications etc.\n\n## Workers Related Ill Health\n\nNo incident of work-related ill health or occupational disease case were recorded during the reporting year. Further, no legal cases or potential risks related to health and safety including diseases and judgments affecting members of the public were recorded.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSafety Role Assignment\n\nWork place monitoring for work related ill health hazards like Dust/Coal dust , Gas or vapour, noise level etc. is done and record is maintained. Actions to mitigate these hazards are taken accordingly.\n\n## Emergencies Management\n\nIn line with our long-term goals, we have established effective engineering controls at all our stations to indicate and monitor emergency situations at our sites. Detailed emergency plans have been developed at all stations as per statutory provisions.\n\nResponsibilities  are  assigned  to  all  concerned  to  handle emergency  situations.  We  conduct  regular  mock-drills  at our  stations  to  check  the  healthiness  of  the  System  and procedures. Observations/suggestions, pursuant to such drills are complied with. We regularly conduct awareness programs on disaster management plan through in-house and external expert faculties.\n\n## Safety Indicators\n\nThere is a robust incident reporting system across NTPC which is  closely  monitored  in  terms  of  Lead  and  Lag  indicators. Since activities representing Lead indicators are proactive in nature, NTPC gives due importance in promoting such activities. They help in identifying potential hazard in terms of unsafe\n\n<!-- image -->",

Based on the feedback  received  from  customers,  NTPC  provides  various support  services  to  them,  identifies  potential  areas  of collaboration, and share each other's best practices.\n\nWe have also put in place a Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI) survey system to gather customers' feedback through a survey and respond to their requirements. As per the CSI survey conducted in FY 2021-22, 96.6% of our customers are satisfied and there are no complaints from customers. However, as part  of  the  Tariff  determination  process  under  the  overall Regulatory System, different cases have been filed by NTPC against CERC/Customers or filed at the Appellate Tribunal/ Courts  by  different  beneficiaries  against  NTPC/CERC.  Total number of pending complaints against NTPC by SEBs in APTEL or court is 100 as of date. We are working diligently to meet the expectations of all customers and aiming to improve the score further.\n\nNTPC makes it a point to participate in all Regional Power Committee  Meetings, Technical Coordination Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmeetings,  Commercial  Committee  meetings,  and  Operation Coordination Committee Meetings, regularly organized by respective Regional Power  Committees,  which  has representation of all customers of the region.

Moreover, the energy bills are generated through ERPSAP software by NTPC and delivered to the authorized person of Discom as per the Power Purchase PPA.\n\nNo complaints have been received concerning breaches of customer privacy, neither have any leaks, thefts, or losses of customer data has been identified during FY 2021-22.\n\n## Health and safety impacts of our product\n\nNTPC sells electricity to Discoms at busbars of its generating stations, which is then transmitted through the grid owned by Power grid (CTU/STU) and finally supplied by the Discoms to  end  consumers  through  its  distribution  network.  As  a responsible power producer, we offer technical and managerial support services to our clients to the best of our capabilities, as required, even though we are not directly involved in the businesses of transmission and distribution. We offer various customer support activities in different areas, including health and safety aspects to the customers in the form of workshops and seminars.\n\nWe take due care in displaying safety instructions in the local languages. Our sole product cannot be labelled as electricity due to its intrinsic nature. However, NTPC has been complying with  the  Grid  Code  and  Grid  standards  -  national  and international - wherever applicable.\n\nNo incidence of non-compliance with regulations and voluntary codes concerning the health and safety impacts of our product and services during their lifecycles was reported.\n\n## Marketing Strategy\n\nOur marketing strategy is largely managed by our commercial function for Power Generation business and by Consultancy and Business Development wing for other avenues. Commercial department analyses the demand and supply situation in the region and markets power from new proposed Projects.\n\nWe approach all State Power distribution utilities of the region, for getting requisition of power from the new proposed Station, based on which viability of the project is studied further. Based on  the  consent  received,  Power  Purchase  Agreements  are signed with the State Power Utilities. Allocation of power from the new Generating Station to the respective willing customers (state utilities) is done by the Ministry of Power, Government of India.\n\nWitnessing the rising demand for clean and sustainable energy, we have been investing and redirecting our strategy to provide renewable energy to interested customers. We are significantly reducing the dependency on coal and gas through renewable power infusion.\n\nHowever,  due  to  the  recent  thrust  on  renewable  energy generation in the country, there is a probability of a reduction in scheduled generation from coal/gas plants due to renewable power  infusion  as  a  result  of  the  addition  of  renewable capacity, Renewable Power Obligation and subdued demand of  electricity. Our  commercial  function  makes  the  unrequisitioned surplus power thereof available to interested\n\nconsumers through Power Exchange or bilateral agreement. We have created an online portal with direct connectivity to customers/ beneficiaries and RLDC for ease of transactions.\n\nDuring FY 2021-22, no non-compliance concerning marketing communications was reported.\n\n## Our Suppliers\n\nNTPC's business model consists of procuring physical assets, raw materials and services for our production processes and subsequent evacuation of power through our intermediate customer to the end-user. We are committed to augmenting the supply chain sustainability and reducing negative externalities of  business  operations.  We  seek  to  institute  triple  bottom line approach in our value chain and encourage our supply chain partners to follow the best environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices in their business operations.\n\nNo. of suppliers (Total company wide)\n\n| Supplier Category   | No.    |\n|---------------------|--------|\n| Domestic            | 13,455 |\n| Foreign             | 3,917  |\n| Total               | 17,372 |\n\nApart from above, our other JV and Subsidiary companies have vendor base of 1269.\n\n## Vendor enlistment statistics\n\nWe have a process of onboarding for all the vendors through pre-qualification,  which  ensures  vendor  credentials  and capability  to  execute  assignments;  adherence  to  health, safety, and  environment  norms;  and  compliance  with statutory requirements, including human rights.

The platform provides better control and compliance  with  various  policies  and  guidelines.  Currently, there is 1 shared service centres catering to the procurements of over 40 of our sites.\n\nAs a result of the SSC, we are able to screen all our vendors continuously for any negative impacts on the environment, society or any potential human rights violations. Assessments are carried out through physical inspections as well. Only those suppliers that clear our screening process are pursued any procurement opportunity. We maintain a policy of not engaging with/terminating business relationships with the suppliers who cannot clear our screening process.\n\nHuman Rights provisions are built into our bidding documents for supply cum erection and civil packages invited on competitive bidding  basis  covering  our  suppliers  and  contractors.  All our supply chain partners are committed to ensuring that no instances of child labour or any form of forced or compulsory labour take place at any of our vendors' site locations. We have a defined set of policies and frameworks to ensure that no human rights of local indigenous communities are violated throughout our supply chain.\n\nWe  practice  a  fair,  equitable,  and  transparent  tendering procedure. We are also actively soliciting feedback from our vendors  to  continuously  improve  our  vendor  management systems for improved vendor relationships.\n\nFollowing actions have been taken to adjust payment policies and procedures\n\n- 1.  NTPC has launched a vendor payment portal for all the suppliers/contractors for bill tracking for the supply of goods and services rendered.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2. NTPC has now on-boarded all the three TReDS platforms approved by the Reserve Bank of India. TReDS aims to provide  liquidity  to  the  MSME  seller  by  the  financiers present on the TReDS platform at very attractive interest rates, without a recourse, much before the due date of payment.\n- 3.

Significant accounting policies\n\nA summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements are as given below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements.\n\nThe Company has elected to utilize the option under Ind AS 101-'First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards' by not applying the provisions of Ind AS 16-'Property, plant and equipment'& Ind AS 38- 'Intangible assets' retrospectively and continue to use the previous GAAP carrying amount as a deemed cost under Ind AS at the date of transition to Ind AS i.e. 1 April 2015. Therefore, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as per the previous GAAP as at 1 April 2015, i.e. the Company's date of transition to Ind AS, were maintained on transition to Ind AS.\n\n## 1. Property, plant and equipment\n\n## 1.1.  Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. Cost  comprises purchase price including import duties and non-refundable purchase  taxes after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the present value of initial estimate of cost of dismantling, removal and restoration.\n\nSubsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment that are significant in value and have different useful lives as compared to the main asset, they are recognized separately.\n\nDeposits, payments/liabilities made provisionally towards compensation, rehabilitation and other expenses relatable to land in possession are treated as cost of land.\n\nIn the case of assets put to use, where final settlement of bills with contractors is yet to be effected, capitalization is done on provisional basis subject to necessary adjustment in the year of final settlement.\n\nAssets and systems common to more than one generating unit are capitalized on the basis of engineering estimates/ assessments.\n\nItems of spare parts, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment which meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are capitalized. Other spare parts are carried as inventory and recognized in the statement of profit and loss on consumption.\n\nThe acquisition or construction of some items of property, plant and equipment although not directly increasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, may be necessary for the Company to obtain future economic benefits from its other assets. Such items are recognized as property, plant and equipment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent expenditure is recognized in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nExpenditure on major inspection and overhauls of generating unit is capitalized, when it meets the asset recognition criteria. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous inspection and overhaul is derecognized.\n\nThe cost of replacing major part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized regardless of whether the replaced part has been depreciated separately. If it is not practicable to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the Company uses the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.\n\n## 1.3.  Decommissioning costs\n\nThe present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.\n\n## 1.4. De-recognition\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gains and losses on de-recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between sale proceeds from disposal, if any, and the carrying amount of  property, plant and equipment and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nIn circumstance, where an item of property, plant and equipment is abandoned, the net carrying cost relating to the property, plant and equipment is written off in the same period.\n\n## 1.5. Depreciation/amortization\n\nDepreciation is recognized in statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the generation of electricity business, integrated coal mining and on the assets of Corporate & other offices of the Company, covered under Part B of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, is charged on straight-line method following the rates and methodology notified by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) Tariff Regulations.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the oil & gas exploration, power plants not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations and consultancy business is charged on straight-line method following the useful life specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets referred below.\n\nDepreciation on the following assets is provided on their estimated useful lives, which are different from the useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, ascertained on the basis of technical evaluation/ assessment:\n\n| a)   | Kutcha roads                                                 | 2 years                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| b)   | Enabling works                                               |                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|      | -   residential buildings                                    | 15 years                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|      | -   internal electrification of residential buildings        | 10 years                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|      | -                                                            | non-residential buildings including their internal electrification, water supply,  sewerage & drainage works, railway sidings, aerodromes, helipads and airstrips. 5 years |\n| c)   | Personal computers & laptops including peripherals.          | 3 years                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| d)   | Photocopiers, fax machines, water coolers and refrigerators. | 5 years                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| e)   | Temporary erections including wooden structures.             | 1 year                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Intangible assets and intangible assets under development\n\n## 3.1.  Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAn intangible asset is recognized if and only if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Company and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nIntangible assets that are acquired by the Company, which have finite useful lives, are recognized at cost. Subsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises purchase price including import duties, non -refundable taxes after deducting trade discounts and rebates and any directly attributable expenses of preparing the asset for its intended use.\n\nExpenditure on development activities is capitalized only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Company intends to & has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.\n\nExpenditure incurred which are eligible for capitalizations under intangible assets are carried as intangible assets under development till they are ready for their intended use.\n\n## 3.2.  Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent expenditure is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\n## 3.3. De-recognition\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gain or loss on de-recognition of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of intangible assets and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 3.4. Amortization\n\nCost of software recognized as intangible asset, is amortized on straight-line method over a period of legal right to use or 3 years, whichever is less. Other intangible assets are amortized on straight-line method over the period of legal right to use or life of the related plant, whichever is less.\n\nThe amortization period and the amortization method of intangible assets with a finite useful life is reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, wherever required.\n\n## 4. Regulatory deferral account balances\n\nExpense/income recognized in the statement of profit and loss to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations are recognized as 'Regulatory deferral account balances'.\n\nRegulatory deferral account balances are adjusted in the year in which the same become recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries.\n\nRegulatory deferral account balances are evaluated at each balance sheet date to ensure that the underlying activities meet the recognition criteria and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with such balances will flow to the entity. If these criteria are not met, the regulatory deferral account balances are derecognized.\n\n## 5. Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources\n\n## 5.1.

All such carried over costs are subject to review for impairment.\n\nCost of surveys and prospecting activities conducted in the search of oil and gas are expensed in the year in which these are incurred.\n\n## 5.2.  Coal mining exploration activities\n\nExploration and evaluation assets comprise capitalized costs which is generally the expenditure incurred associated with finding the mineral by carrying out topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling, trenching, sampling, expenditure for activities in relation to evaluation of technical feasibility and commercial viability, acquisition of rights to explore etc.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred after obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are capitalized as exploration and evaluation assets under 'Intangible assets under development' and stated at cost less impairment if any. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment indicators at least annually.\n\nOnce the proved reserves are determined and development of mine/project is sanctioned, Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to 'Development of Coal Mines' under 'Capital Work in Progress'. However, if proved reserves are not determined, exploration and evaluation asset is derecognized.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are expensed as and when incurred.\n\n## 6. Development expenditure on coal mines\n\nWhen proved reserves are determined and development of mines/project is sanctioned, exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to 'Development of coal mines' under 'Capital work-in-progress'.\n\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/ producing asset or replaces part of the existing development/producing asset. Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.\n\nThe development expenditure capitalized is net of value of coal extracted during development phase.\n\nDate of commercial operation of integrated coal mines shall be determined on the occurring of earliest of following milestones as provided in CERC tariff regulations:\n\n- 1) The first date of the year succeeding the year in which 25 % of the peak rated capacity as per the mining plan is achieved; or\n- 2) The first date of the year succeeding the year in which the value of production exceeds the total expenditure in that year; or\n- 3) The date of two years from the date of commencement of production;\n\nOn the date of commercial operation, the assets under capital work-in-progress are classified as a component of property, plant and equipment under 'Mining property'.\n\nGains and losses on de-recognition of assets referred above, are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective assets and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 6.1.  Stripping activity expense/adjustment\n\nExpenditure incurred on removal of mine waste materials (overburden) necessary to extract the coal reserves is referred to as stripping cost. The Company has to incur such expenses over the life of the mine as technically estimated.\n\nCost of stripping is charged on technically evaluated average stripping ratio at each mine with due adjustment for stripping activity asset and ratio-variance account after the mines are brought to revenue.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Mines closure, site restoration and decommissioning obligations\n\nThe Company's obligations for land reclamation and decommissioning of structure consist of spending at mines in accordance with the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India. The Company estimates its obligations for mine closure, site restoration and decommissioning based on the detailed calculation and technical assessment of the amount and timing of future cash spending for the required work and provided for as per approved mine closure plan. The estimate of expenses is escalated for inflation and then discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and risk, such that the amount of provision reflects the present value of expenditure required to settle the obligation. The Company recognizes a corresponding asset under property, plant and equipment as a separate item for the cost associated with such obligation. Upon commercial declaration of mines, the mine closure, site restoration and decommissioning obligations are amortized on straight line method over the balance life of the mine.\n\nThe value of the obligation is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds and the same is recognized as finance costs.\n\nFurther, a specific escrow account is maintained for this purpose as per approved mine closure plan. The progressive mine closure expenses incurred on year to year basis, forming part of the total mine closure obligation, are initially recognized as receivable from escrow account and thereafter adjusted with the obligation in the year in which the amount is withdrawn from escrow account after concurrence of the certifying agency.\n\n## 7. Joint operations\n\nThe Company has joint arrangements with others for operations in the nature of joint operations. The Company recognizes, on a line-by-line basis its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint operations as per the arrangement which are accounted based on the respective accounting policies of the Company.\n\n## 8. Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs consist of (a) interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as described in Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' (b) interest expense on lease liabilities  recognized in accordance with Ind AS 116- 'Leases' and (c) exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.\n\nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction/exploration/ development or erection of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost of such asset until such time the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. Qualifying assets are assets which necessarily take substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.\n\nWhen the Company borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the borrowing costs incurred are capitalized. When Company borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the capitalization of the borrowing costs is computed based on the weighted average cost of all borrowings that are outstanding during the period and used for the acquisition, construction/exploration or erection of the qualifying asset. However, borrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, are excluded from this calculation, until substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.\n\nIncome earned on temporary investment made out of the borrowings pending utilization for expenditure on the qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nCapitalization of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets for their intended use  are complete.\n\nOther borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n## 9. Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average basis. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates, trade discounts and other\n\n<!-- image -->",

Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\nThe diminution in the value of obsolete, unserviceable, surplus and non-moving items of stores and spares is ascertained on review and provided for.\n\nSteel scrap is valued at estimated realizable value.\n\n## 10.  Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks, cash on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## 11.  Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Company will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Company for the cost of depreciable asset are recognized as income in statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis over the period and in the proportion in which depreciation is charged. Grants that compensate the Company for expenses incurred are recognized over the period in which the related costs are incurred and the same is deducted from the related expenses.\n\n## 12.  Fly ash utilization reserve fund\n\nProceeds from sale of ash/ash products along-with income on investment of surplus fund are transferred to 'Fly ash utilization reserve fund' in terms of provisions of gazette notification dated 3 November 2009 issued by Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. The fund is utilized towards expenditure on development of infrastructure/ facilities, promotion & facilitation activities for use of fly ash.\n\n## 13.  Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of reimbursement, if any.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the Company. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment of the management/independent experts. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current management estimate.\n\nContingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company. Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial statements when inflow of economic benefits is probable on the basis of judgment of management. These are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements.\n\n## 14.  Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency spot exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the year in which it arises with the exception that exchange differences on long term monetary items related to acquisition of property, plant and equipment recognized up to 31 March 2016 are adjusted to the carrying cost of property, plant and equipment.\n\nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currency which are measured in terms of historical cost are recorded using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. In case of advance consideration received or paid in a foreign currency, the date of transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it), is when the Company initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\n## 15.  Revenue\n\nCompany's revenues arise from sale and trading of energy, consultancy, project management & supervision services, income on assets under lease, supply of coal from integrated coal mines and other income. Revenue from other income comprises interest from banks, employees, contractors etc., dividend from investments in joint venture & subsidiary companies, dividend from mutual fund investments, surcharge received from beneficiaries for delayed payments, sale of scrap, other miscellaneous income, etc.\n\n## 15.1. Revenue from sale of energy\n\nThe majority of the Company's operations in India are regulated under the Electricity Act, 2003. Accordingly, the CERC determines the tariff for the Company's power plants based on the norms prescribed in the tariff regulations as applicable from time to time. Tariff is based on the capital cost incurred for a specific power plant and primarily comprises two components: capacity charge i.e. a fixed charge that includes depreciation, return on equity, interest on working capital, operating & maintenance expenses, interest on loan and energy charge i.e. a variable charge primarily based on fuel costs. Tariff for Company's integrated coal mines are also determined by CERC based on the norms prescribed in the CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the products or services and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when (or as) control over the products or services is transferred to a customer.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. As at each reporting date, revenue from sale of energy includes an accrual for sales delivered to beneficiaries but not yet billed i.e. contract assets/ unbilled revenue.\n\nThe incentives/disincentives are accounted for based on the norms notified/approved by the CERC as per principles enunciated in Ind AS 115 - 'Revenue from contracts with customers'. In cases of power stations where the same have not been notified/approved, incentives/disincentives are accounted for on provisional basis.\n\nPart of revenue from energy sale where CERC tariff Regulations are not applicable is recognized based on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries and trading of power through power exchanges.\n\nExchange differences arising from settlement/translation of monetary items denominated in foreign currency to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per the CERC Tariff Regulations are accounted as 'Regulatory deferred account balances' and such balances are adjusted in the year in which the same becomes recoverable/payable to the beneficiaries.\n\nExchange differences on account of translation of foreign currency borrowings recognized up to 31 March 2016, to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per the CERC Tariff Regulations are accounted as 'Deferred foreign currency fluctuation asset' with corresponding credit to 'Deferred income from foreign currency fluctuation'. Deferred income from foreign currency fluctuation account is amortized in the proportion in which depreciation is charged on such exchange differences and same is adjusted against depreciation expense. Fair value changes in respect of forward exchange contracts for derivatives recoverable from/payable to the beneficiaries as per the CERC Tariff Regulations, are recognized in sales.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Revenue from services\n\nRevenue from consultancy, project management and supervision services rendered is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the services, which is determined on output method and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when control over the services is transferred to a customer.\n\nReimbursement of expenses is recognized as other income, as per the terms of the service contracts.\n\nContract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either to the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for modifications of contracts involves assessing whether the services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract, if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the standalone selling price.\n\n## 15.3. Other income\n\nInterest income is recognized, when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exist, on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate, using the effective interest rate method (EIR). For debt instruments measured either at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), interest income is recorded using the EIR.For credit impaired financial assets the EIR is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss allowance). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the EIR, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nFor purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets interest income is recognized by calculating the credit-adjusted EIR and applying that rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The credit-adjusted EIR is the interest rate that, at original recognition, discounts the estimated future cash flows (including credit losses) to the amortized cost of the POCI assets.\n\nScrap other than steel scrap is accounted for as and when sold.\n\nInsurance claims for loss of profit are accounted for in the year of acceptance. Other insurance claims are accounted for based on certainty of realization.\n\nRevenue from rentals and operating leases is recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreement.\n\nThe interest/surcharge on late payment/overdue trade receivables for sale of energy is recognized when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exists.\n\nInterest/surcharge recoverable on advances to contractors and suppliers as well as warranty claims wherever there is uncertainty of realization/acceptance are not treated as accrued and are therefore, accounted for on receipt/ acceptance.\n\nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss only when the right to receive is established, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the Company, and the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably.\n\n## 16.  Employee benefits\n\n## 16.1. Defined contribution plans\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions to separate entities and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an employee benefits expense in statement of profit\n\n<!-- image -->",

Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. Contributions to a defined contribution plan that are due after more than 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the service are discounted to their present value.\n\nThe Company has a defined contribution pension scheme which is administered through a separate trust. The obligation of the Company is to contribute to the trust to the extent of amount not exceeding 30% of basic pay and dearness allowance less employer's contribution towards provident fund, gratuity, post-retirement medical facility (PRMF) or any other retirement benefits. The Company's contribution towards pension is made to National Pension System Trust (NPS) for the employees opted for the scheme. The contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme of the Company/NPS for the year are recognized as an expense and charged to the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 16.2. Defined benefit plans\n\nA defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Company's liability towards gratuity, pension scheme at two of the stations in respect of taken over employees from the erstwhile state government power utility, post-retirement medical facility (PRMF), baggage allowance for settlement at home town after retirement, farewell gift on retirement and provident fund scheme to the extent of interest liability on provident fund contribution are in the nature of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Company pays fixed contribution to the provident fund at predetermined rates to a separate trust, which invests the funds in permitted securities. The contributions to the fund for the year are recognized as expense and are charged to the statement of profit and loss. The obligation of the Company is to make such fixed contributions and to ensure a minimum rate of return to the members as specified by the Government of India.  Shortfall in the fund assets,  if any, is made  good by the company and charged to the statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe gratuity is funded by the Company and is managed by separate trust. The Company has PRMF, under which retired employee and the spouse are provided medical facilities in the Company hospitals/empaneled hospitals. They can also avail treatment as out-patient subject to a ceiling fixed by the Company.\n\nThe Company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.\n\nThe actuarial calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is available to the Company if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.  Remeasurement comprising of actuarial gain and losses, return on plan assets ( excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability)  & effect of asset ceiling ( excluding the amount included in net interest on the net defined liability)  and  the  same  are recognized in the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they arise.\n\nPast service costs are recognized in statement of profit and loss on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and the date that the Company recognizes related restructuring costs. If a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs, the current service cost and the net interest for the period after the re-measurement are determined using the assumptions used for the re-measurement.\n\n## 16.3. Other long-term employee benefits\n\nBenefits under the Company's leave encashment, long-service award and economic rehabilitation scheme constitute other long term employee benefits.\n\nThe Company's net obligation in respect of these long-term employee benefits is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted. The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.\n\nA liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under performance related pay if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## 17.  Other expenses\n\nExpenses on ex-gratia payments under voluntary retirement scheme, training & recruitment and voluntary community development are charged to statement of profit and loss in the year incurred.\n\nExpenditure on research is charged to revenue as and when incurred. Expenditure on development is charged to revenue as and when incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for intangible asset as per Ind AS 38- 'Intangible assets'.\n\nPreliminary expenses on account of new projects incurred prior to approval of feasibility report/techno economic clearance are charged to statement of profit and loss.\n\nNet pre-commissioning income/expenditure is adjusted directly in the cost of related assets and systems.\n\nTransit and handling losses of coal as per Company's norms are included in cost of coal.\n\n## 18.  Income tax\n\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax expense is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year computed as per the provisions of Income Tax Act, 1961, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they materialize, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against the current tax liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the sufficient taxable profits will be available in future to allow all or part of deferred tax assets to be utilized.\n\nAdditional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognized at the same time that the liability to pay the related dividend is recognized. The income tax consequences of dividends are recognized in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where the Company originally recognized those past transactions or events.\n\n<!-- image -->",

MAT credit is recognized as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future taxable profit will be available against which MAT credit can be utilized.\n\nWhen there is uncertainty regarding income tax treatments, the Company assesses whether a tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty on taxable income, tax bases and unused tax losses and unused tax credits is recognized. The effect of the uncertainty is recognized using the method that, in each case, best reflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the Company evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately, or in conjunction with another or several other uncertain tax treatments, based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.\n\n## 19.  Leases\n\n## 19.1. As lessee\n\nThe Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and leases for low value underlying assets. For these short-term and leases for low value underlying assets, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. Right-of use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option to extend the lease will be exercised/option to terminate the lease will not be exercised.\n\nThe right-of-use assets (other than land and buildings) are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment losses and adjusted for any reassessment of lease liabilities.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated/amortized   from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset by the end of lease term or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the purchase option will be exercised. Otherwise, Right-of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments.  In calculating the present value, lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset if the Company changes its assessment whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.\n\n## 19.2. As lessor\n\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A specific asset is subject of a lease if fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that specified asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the customer the right to control the use of the underlying asset. Arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease but convey rights to customers/ suppliers to use an asset in return for a payment or a series of payments are identified as either finance leases or operating leases.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Capacity payments are apportioned between capital repayments relating to the provision of the plant, finance income and service income.  The finance income element of the capacity payment is recognized as revenue, using a rate of return specific to the plant to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in each period. The service income element of the capacity payment is the difference between the total capacity payment and the amount recognized as finance income and capital repayments and recognized as revenue as it is earned.\n\nThe amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded in the balance sheet as financial assets, classified as 'Finance lease receivables', at the amount  equal  to the net investment in the lease.\n\n## Accounting for operating leases\n\nWhere the Company determines a long term PPA to be or to contain a lease and where the Company retains the principal risks and rewards of ownership of the power plant, the arrangement is considered an operating lease.\n\nFor operating leases, the power plant is capitalized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over its economic life. Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement.\n\n## 20.  Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment considering the provisions of Ind AS 36 - 'Impairment of Assets'. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the 'cash-generating unit', or 'CGU').\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are reduced from the carrying amounts of the assets of the CGU.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n\n## 21.  Operating segments\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 108-'Operating segments', the operating segments used to present segment information are identified on the basis of internal reports used by the Company's management to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance. The Board of Directors is collectively the Company's 'Chief Operating Decision Maker' or 'CODM' within the meaning of Ind AS 108. The indicators used for internal reporting purposes may evolve in connection with performance assessment measures put in place.\n\nSegment results that are reported to the CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses, finance costs, income tax expenses and corporate income that are not directly attributable to segments.\n\nRevenue directly attributable to the segments is considered as segment revenue. Expenses directly attributable to the segments and common expenses allocated on a reasonable basis are considered as segment expenses.\n\nSegment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, Capital Wok in Progress, intangible assets other than goodwill and intangible assets under development.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the purpose of segment reporting, property, plant and equipment have been allocated to segments based on the extent of usage of assets for operations attributable to the respective segments. Unallocated assets comprise investments, income tax assets, corporate assets and other assets that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\nSegment liabilities include all operating liabilities in respect of a segment and consist principally of trade payable, payable for capital expenditure and other payables, provision for employee benefits and other provisions. Unallocated liabilities comprise equity, income tax liabilities, loans and borrowings and other liabilities and provisions that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\n## 22.  Business Combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method as at the date of the acquisition, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Company. The consideration transferred in the acquisition and the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair values on their acquisition date. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Where the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the consideration transferred, after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognized as capital reserve. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## 23.  Dividends\n\nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Company's shareholders are recognized as changes in equity in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders and the Board of Directors respectively.\n\n## 24.  Material prior period errors\n\nMaterial prior period errors are corrected retrospectively by restating the comparative amounts for the prior periods presented in which the error occurred. If the error occurred before the earliest period presented, the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest period presented, are restated.\n\n## 25.  Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year.\n\nDiluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss  attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\n\nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any bonus shares issued during the financial year.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per equity share are also computed using the earnings amounts excluding the movements in regulatory deferral account balances.\n\n## 26.  Statement of cash flows\n\nStatement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in Ind AS 7-'Statement of cash flows'.\n\n## 27.  Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. The Company recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability only when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## 27.1. Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll financial assets are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially\n\n<!-- image -->",

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets, which are not valued at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\n## Debt instruments at amortized cost\n\nA 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:\n\n- (a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and\n- (b)   Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nAfter initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.\n\n## Debt instrument at FVTOCI (Fair value through OCI)\n\nA 'debt instrument' is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:\n\n- (a)  The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and\n- (b)   The asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI\n\nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the OCI. However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from the equity to the statement of profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.\n\n## Debt instrument at FVTPL (Fair value through profit or loss)\n\nFVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.\n\nIn addition, the Company may elect to classify a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Interest income on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\n## Investment in Equity instruments\n\nAll equity investments in entities other than subsidiaries and joint venture companies are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.\n\nIf the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to statement of profit and loss, even on sale/ disposal of investments. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on sale / disposal of the investments.\n\nEquity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Dividend on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\nEquity investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures companies are accounted at cost less impairment, if any.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amount of the investment is estimated. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) is primarily de-recognized (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or\n- \u00b7 The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nThe difference between the carrying amount and the amount of consideration received/receivable is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except for equity instruments classified as at FVTOCI, where such differences are recorded in OCI.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109-'Financial instruments', the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:\n\n- (a) Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortized cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits and bank balance.\n- (b) Financial assets that are debt instruments and are measured as at FVTOCI.\n- (c) Lease receivables under Ind AS 116.\n- (d) Trade receivables, unbilled revenue and contract assets under Ind AS 115.\n- (e) Loan commitments which are not measured as at FVTPL.\n- (f) Financial guarantee contracts which are not measured as at FVTPL.\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets/unbilled revenue, the Company applies the simplified approach required by Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments, which requires lifetime expected losses to be recognized from initial recognition.\n\nFor recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure (other than purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets), the Company determines that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12month ECL.\n\nFor purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, a loss allowance is recognized for the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credited losses since initial recognition.\n\n## 27.2. Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and financial liabilities at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of liabilities subsequently measured at amortized cost net of directly attributable transaction cost. The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, borrowings including bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Gains and losses are recognized in statement of  profit and  loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to borrowings, trade payables and other contractual liabilities.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.\n\nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/losses attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. These gains/losses are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on disposal. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The Company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nWhen the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortised cost is changed as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, the Company updated the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the reform. A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:\n\n- -the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and\n- -the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.\n\nWhen changes were made to a financial asset or financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Company first updates the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by interest rate benchmark reform and does not recognise a modification gain or loss in the profit & loss statement. After that, the Company applies the policies on accounting for modifications to the additional changes.\n\n## 27.3. Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the Company are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' and the amount recognized less the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with the principles of Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Derivative financial instruments\n\nInitial recognition and subsequent measurement\n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks of foreign currency loans. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken to statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 27.5. Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## 28.  Non -Current Assets Held for Sale\n\nThe Company classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.\n\nManagement must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nNon-Current Assets held for sale and disposal groups are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less cost of disposal.\n\nNon-current assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortized.\n\n## D. Use of estimates and management judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may impact the application of accounting policies and the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenue expenses and related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The estimates and management's judgments are based on previous experience & other factors considered reasonable and prudent in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\n\nIn order to enhance understanding of the financial statements, information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements is as under:\n\n## 1. Formulation of accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies are formulated in a manner that results in financial statements containing relevant and reliable information about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they apply. Those policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial.\n\n## 2. Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.\n\nUseful life of the assets of the generation of electricity business and integrated coal mines (where tariff is regulated) is determined by the CERC Tariff Regulations in accordance with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the expected market outlook and future cash flows associated with the power plants. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 4. Defined benefit plans and long-term employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefit obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial assumptions which include mortality and withdrawal rates as well as assumptions concerning future developments in discount rates, the rate of salary increases and the inflation rate. The Company considers that the assumptions used to measure its obligations are appropriate and documented. However, any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the resulting calculations.\n\n## 5. Revenues\n\nThe Company records revenue from sale of energy based on tariff rates approved by the CERC as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, as per principles enunciated under Ind AS 115. However, in cases where tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## 6. Leases not in legal form of lease\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules as per Ind AS 116 in determining whether an arrangement contains a lease. In assessing arrangements entered into by the Company, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the right to use the underlying asset, substance of the transactions including legally enforceable agreements and other significant terms and conditions of the arrangements to conclude whether the arrangement meets the criteria as per Ind AS 116.\n\n## 7. Assets held for sale\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply the accounting of non-current assets held for sale under Ind AS 105 - 'Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations'. In assessing the applicability, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the availability of the asset for immediate sale, management's commitment for the sale and probability of sale within one year to conclude if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.\n\n## 8. Regulatory deferral account balances\n\nRecognition of regulatory deferral account balances involves significant judgments including about future tariff regulations since these are based on estimation of the amounts expected to be recoverable/payable through tariff in future.\n\n## 9. Provisions and contingencies\n\nThe assessments undertaken in recognizing provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with Ind AS 37-'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets'. The evaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events require best judgment by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential loss. Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.\n\n## 10.  Impairment test of investments in Subsidiaries and Joint Venture Companies\n\nThe recoverable amount of investment in subsidiaries and joint venture companies is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the future cash flows associated with the operations of the investee Company. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 11.  Income taxes\n\nSignificant estimates are involved in determining the provision for current and deferred tax, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the event the Hon'ble High Court grants relief to the Company, the amount would be adjusted against Current liabilities - Provisions - Provision for arbitration awards (Note 34). Management expects that the total cost incurred, anticipated expenditure on the safety and stabilisation measures, other recurring site expenses and interest costs as well as claims of contractors/vendors for various packages for this project will be compensated in full by the GOI. Hence, no provision is considered necessary.\n- b) The Company had ascertained that the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) entered into for Stage-I of a power station with the beneficiary falls under the definition of finance lease. Accordingly, the written down value of the specified assets was derecognized from PPE and accounted as Finance Lease Receivable (FLR) on transition to Ind AS. The Company has continued to classify this arrangement with its customer as lease based on the practical expedient provided in Ind AS 116. Accordingly, recovery of capacity charges towards depreciation, interest on loan capital & return on equity (pre-tax) components from the beneficiary are continued to be adjusted against FLR. The interest component of the FLR and amount received on account of revision of tariff of previous periods in respect of the above three elements are continued to be recognised as 'Interest income on Assets under finance lease' under 'Revenue from operations' (Note 37).\n- c) As per the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India for preparation of Mine Closure Plan, Escrow Accounts have been opened for each captive mine and the balances held in these escrow accounts are presented as 'Mine closure deposit'. Up to 80% of the total deposited amount including interest accrued in the escrow account shall be released after every five years in line with the periodic examination of the closure plan as per the Guidelines. Interest earned on the escrow account is added to mine closure deposit account.\n\n## 10.

As per this policy, an agreement has been signed between the Company and the Ministry of Railways, GOI on 6 June 2016. As per the agreement, railway projects agreed between the Company and Railways will be constructed, maintained and operated by Railways and ownership of the line and its operations and maintenance will always remain with them. Railways will pay upto 7% of the amount invested through freight rebate on freight volumes every year till the funds provided by the Company are fully recovered along-with interest (equal to the prevailing rate ofdividend payable by Railways at the time of signing of respective agreements), subject to the rebate not exceeding the freight amount in the accounting year, after commercial operation date (COD) of the railway projects. The advance is adjusted at projects which have achieved COD based on confirmation from Railways towards freight rebate in consonance with the agreement terms and the interest portion is recognised in Note-38-'Other income'.\n- e) Secured capital advances are secured against the hypothecation of the construction equipment/material supplied by the contractors/suppliers.\n- f) Loans given to employees are measured at amortized cost. The deferred payroll expenditure represents the benefits on account of interest rate on loans being lower than the market rate of interest. The same is amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the loan.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, DTL as at 31 March 2009 is recoverable on materialisation from the beneficiaries. Regulations, 2014 and Regulations, 2019 provide for grossing-up the rate of return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income.

Energy and Other charges for the year ended 31 March 2022 have been recognized at ' 64,043.74 crore (31 March 2021: ' 51,652.25 crore) as per the operational norms specified in the Regulations 2019.\n- b) Capacity charges for the year ended 31 March 2022 include ' 1,317.57 crore (31 March 2021: ' 107.71 crore) pertaining to earlier years on account of impact of CERC orders and other adjustments. Energy and other charges for the year ended 31 March 2022 include ' 620.48 crore (31 March 2021: ' 1,046.94 crore) pertaining to earlier years on account of revision of energy charges due to grade slippages and other adjustments.\n- c) Sales for the year ended 31 March 2022 include ' 87.60 crore (31 March 2021: ' 81.88 crore) on account of deferred tax materialized which is recoverable from beneficiaries as per Regulations, 2019.\n- d) During the previous year ended 31 March 2021, excess tax provision of ' 1,889.05 crore was reversed consequent to adjustment of tax provision created in accordance with Vivad se Vishwas Scheme (VsVs Scheme) notified through 'The Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Act, 2020'. Correspondingly, sales amounting to ' 1,101.47 crore was reversed on account of income tax recoverable from / (refundable to) the beneficiaries as per Regulations, 2004.\n- e) Energy sales include electricity duty amounting to ' 1,352.73 crore (31 March 2021: ' 1,212.88 crore).\n- f) Revenue from operations for the year ended 31 March 2022 include ' 3,551.54 crore (31 March 2021: ' 3,115.55 crore) on account of sale of energy through trading (gross).\n- g) Other operating revenue includes ' 63.51 crore (31 March 2021: ' 60.97 crore) towards energy internally consumed, valued at variable cost of generation and the corresponding amount is included in power charges in Note 43.\n- h) CERC Regulations provides that where after the truing-up, the tariff recovered is less/more than the tariff approved by the Commission, the generating Company shall recover from /pay to the beneficiaries the under/over recovered amount along-with simple interest. Based on the above, the interest recoverable from the beneficiaries amounting to ' 857.02 crore (31 March 2021: ' 27.82 crore) has been accounted as 'Interest from beneficiaries'. Further, the amount payable to the beneficiaries has been accounted as 'Interest to beneficiaries' in Note 43.\n- i) Provision written back-others represents write back of provision of water charges in one of the projects which is no longer required.\n- j) The Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) signed in respect of two power stations (one thermal and one gas) were operative initially for a period of five years with the respective beneficiaries which may be extended, renewed or replaced as the parties mutually agree. The Company has continued to classify these arrangement with its customers as lease based on the practical expedient provided in Appendix C of Ind AS 116. Accordingly, recovery of capacity charges towards depreciation, interest on loan capital & return on equity (pre-tax) components from the beneficiaries are considered as lease rentals on the assets which are on operating lease. The operations of one of the stations was suspended on 31 March 2021 and hence there are no revenues from the station during the year.\n- k) The Company had ascertained that the PPA entered into for Stage-I of a power station with the beneficiary falls under the definition of finance lease. Accordingly, the written down value of the specified assets was derecognized from PPE and accounted as Finance Lease Receivable (FLR) on transition date to Ind AS. The Company has continued to classify this arrangement with its customer as lease based on the practical expedient provided in Appendix C of Ind AS 116. Accordingly, recovery of capacity charges towards depreciation (including AAD), interest on loan capital & return on equity (pre-tax) components from the beneficiary are continued to be adjusted against FLR. The interest component of the FLR and amount received on account of revision of tariff of previous periods in respect of the above three elements are continued to be recognised as 'Interest income on Assets under finance lease'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Exceptional items\n\n| Particulars                              | As at  31 March 2022   | ' Crore As at  31 March 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Special rebate to beneficiaries-Covid-19 | -                      | 1,363.00                       |\n\n- a) In line with the directions of MOP  issued in accordance with the announcement of GOI under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Special Economic and Comprehensive package, a rebate on the capacity charges during the lockdown period in view of Covid 19 pandemic, was accounted during the previous year 2020-21 and disclosed as exceptional item.\n- 47. a) The Company has a system of obtaining periodic confirmation of balances from banks and other parties. There are no unconfirmed balances in respect of bank accounts and borrowings from banks & financial institutions. With regard to receivables for energy sales, the Company sends demand intimations to the beneficiaries with details of amount paid and balance outstanding which can be said to be automatically confirmed on receipt of subsequent payment from such beneficiaries. In addition, reconciliation with beneficiaries and other customers is generally done on quarterly basis. So far as trade/other payables and loans and advances are concerned, the balance confirmation letters/emails with the negative assertion as referred in the Standard on Auditing (SA) 505 (Revised) 'External Confirmations', were sent to the parties. Some of such balances are subject to confirmation/reconciliation. Adjustments, if any will be accounted for on confirmation/reconciliation of the same, which in the opinion of the management will not have a material impact.\n- b) In the opinion of the management, the value of assets, other than property, plant and equipment and non-current investments, on realisation in the ordinary course of business, will not be less than the value at which these are stated in the Balance Sheet.\n- c) The levy of transit fee/entry tax on supplies of fuel to some of the power stations has been paid under protest as the matters are sub-judice at various courts. In case the Company gets refund/demand from fuel suppliers/tax authorities on settlement of these cases, the same will be passed on to respective beneficiaries.\n- 48. a) The environmental clearance (EC) granted by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India (MoEF), based on the recommendations of Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), for one of the Company's project consisting of three units of 800 MW each, whose carrying cost as at 31 March 2022 is ' 14,874.47 crore (31 March 2021: ' 15,115.02 crore), was challenged before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) vide appeal no.12/2012. The NGT disposed off the appeal vide Order dated March 13, 2014, inter alia, directing that the order of clearance be remanded to the MoEF to pass an order granting or declining clearance to the project proponent afresh in accordance with the law and the judgement of the NGT and also directed that the EC shall be kept in abeyance and the Company shall maintain status quo in relation to the project during the period of review by the Committee or till fresh order is passed by the MoEF, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe Company filed an appeal challenging the NGT order before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India which stayed the order of the NGT and the matter is sub-judice and pending for listing in the Court. The Company has been complying with various conditions stipulated in the EC and reporting to the appropriate environment authorities periodically. The EAC has been accepting the amendments sought by the Company in the EC.\n\nDuring the year the Company has obtained a legal opinion based on which the Company does not envisage any threat to the continuance to the project. All the units of the project have been declared commercial in the earlier years and are fully operational since September 2018.\n\n- b) The Company is executing a thermal power project consisting of two units of 800 MW each in the State of Telangana whose carrying cost of the project as at 31 March 2022 is ' 10,233.66 crore (31 March 2021: ' 9,376.31 crore). The project construction commenced in the year 2016 after obtaining the requisite approval and Environment Clearance (EC) from MOEF&CC (Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change). On 27 May 2021, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has passed an order instructing MOEF&CC to keep the EC granted for the project in abeyance for a period of seven months or till the period the re-appraisal is done and additional conditions imposed by the MOEF&CC, whichever is earlier. NGT has further directed the MOEF&CC to conduct additional studies pertaining to Environment Impact Assessment of the project, to be carried out through the Company, for further assessment by its Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) and get recommendations of the EAC for imposing additional conditions by the MOEF&CC, if any, on the Company for allowing the units to operate.\n\nThe Company filed an appeal before Hon'ble Supreme Court of India against the directions of NGT. The Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has passed the order on 20 July 2021 and directed that while the EC is in abeyance, various  construction  activities  at  site  may  be  continued  till  the  commissioning  of  the  project  and  the  various studies  as  directed  by  NGT  are  to  be  conducted  simultaneously.

Both the units of the project are in advanced stage of construction and the commissioning is envisaged in the year 2022-23.\n\n- c) The Company is executing a hydro power project in the state of Uttarakhand, where all the clearances were accorded. A case was filed in Hon'ble Supreme Court of India after the natural disaster in Uttarakhand in June 2013 to review whether the various existing and ongoing hydro projects have contributed to environmental degradation. Hon'ble Supreme Court of India on 7 May 2014, ordered that no further construction shall be undertaken in the projects under consideration until further orders, which included the said hydro project of the Company. In the proceedings, Hon'ble Supreme Court is examining to allow few projects which have all clearances which includes the project of the Company where the work has been stopped. Aggregate cost incurred on the project up to 31 March 2022 is ' 163.57 crore (31 March 2021: ' 163.86 crore). Management is confident that the approval for proceeding with the project shall be granted, hence no adjustment is considered necessary in respect of the carrying value of the project.\n\n## 49 Disclosure as per Ind AS 1 'Presentation of financial statements'\n\n## a) Changes in significant accounting policies:\n\nDuring the year, following changes to the accounting policies have been made:\n\n- i) Depreciation on Hospital equipment and Furniture and fixtures has been revised based on review of their useful lives.

As per Para 64 of Ind AS 19, in case of surplus in a defined benefit plan, an entity shall measure the net defined benefit asset at the lower of actual surplus or the value of the assets ceiling determined using the discount rate. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Further, paragraph 65 provides that a net defined benefit asset may arise where a defined benefit plan has been overfunded or where actuarial gains have arisen.\n\nAs per the provisions of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the Company has no right to the benefits either in the form of refund from the plan or lower future contribution to the plan towards the net surplus of ' 58.39 cror e (31 March 2021: ' 94.41 crore) determined through actuarial valuation. Accordingly, Company has not recognised the surplus as an asset, and the remeasurement loss /gains in 'Other Comprehensive Income', as these pertain to the Provident Fund Trust and not to the Company.\n\nAs per the provisions of Employee's Provident Funds Scheme 1952, the employer shall be liable to make good the loss to the Trust in the event of any loss as a result of any fraud, defalcation, wrong investment decisions etc. to the Trust. Keeping in view the above, a provision of ' 17.86 cror e (31 March 2021 ' Nil) has been recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss during the year, towards such loss to the trust.\n\n## B. Gratuity and pension\n\n- a) The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan. Every employee who has rendered continuous service of five years or more is entitled to gratuity at 15 days salary (15/26 X last drawn basic salary plus dearness allowance) for each completed year of service subject to a maximum of ' 0.20 crore on superannuation, resignation, termination, disablement or on death, considering the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, as amended. The gratuity scheme is funded by the Company and is managed by separate trust. The liability for gratuity scheme is recognised on the basis of actuarial valuation.\n- b) The Company has pension schemes at two of its stations in respect of employees taken over from erstwhile state government power utilities. These pension schemes are unfunded. The liability for the pension schemes is recognised on the basis of actuarial valuation.\n\nBased on the actuarial valuation obtained in this respect, the following table sets out the status of the gratuity and pension plan and the amounts recognised in the Company's financial statements as at balance sheet date:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Defined benefit obligations\n\n## i. Actuarial assumptions\n\nThe following were the principal actuarial assumptions at the reporting date:\n\n| Particulars                    | As at   31 March 2022   | As at   31 March 2021   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Discount rate                  | 7.00%                   | 6.75%                   |\n| Expected return on plan assets |                         |                         |\n| Gratuity                       | 7.00%                   | 6.75%                   |\n| Pension                        | 7.00%                   | 6.75%                   |\n| PRMF                           | 7.00%                   | 6.75%                   |\n| Annual increase in costs       | 6.50%                   | 6.50%                   |\n| Salary escalation rate         | 6.50%                   | 6.50%                   |\n\nThe estimates of future salary increases considered in actuarial valuation, take account of inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market. Further, the expected return on plan assets is determined considering several applicable factors mainly the composition of plan assets held, assessed risk of asset management and historical returns from plan assets.\n\n## ii. Sensitivity analysis\n\nReasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below.\n\n## ' Crore\n\n| Particulars                              | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                          | Increase              | Decrease              | Increase              | Decrease              |\n| Discount rate (0.5% movement)            | (182.34)              | 190.97                | (169.87)              | 178.76                |\n| Annual increase in costs (0.5% movement) | 88.24                 | (86.23)               | 78.57                 | (76.36)               |\n| Salary escalation rate (0.5% movement)   | 99.96                 | (95.54)               | 98.22                 | (93.17)               |\n\nAlthough the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. This analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\n## G. Risk exposure\n\nThrough its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:\n\n## a) Asset volatility\n\nThe plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to government bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. Most of the plan asset investments are in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk with derivatives to minimise risk to an acceptable level. A portion of the funds are invested in equity securities and in alternative investments which have low correlation with equity securities. The Company has a risk management strategy where the aggregate amount of risk exposure on a portfolio level is maintained at a fixed range. Any deviations from the range are corrected by rebalancing the portfolio. The Company intends to maintain the above investment mix in the continuing years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is particularly significant where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.\n\nThe Company ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the employee benefit plans. Within this framework, the Company's ALM objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency.\n\nThe Company actively monitors how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the employee benefit obligations. The Company has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. The Company uses derivatives to manage some of its risk. Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.\n\nA large portion of assets consist of government and corporate bonds. The plan asset mix is in compliance with the requirements of the respective local regulations.\n\n## H.

Further, MoP has requested MoC to consider the request of NTPC for surrendering the coal blocks without appropriation of Performance Securities.\n\n## (ii) Mandakini\n\nAfter approval of Mining Plan of Mandakini-B coal block by MoC, mine development activities at Mandakini-B coal block could not be proceeded due to the resistance of the villagers which was beyond control of the Company. Considering the above, the Company has approached Ministry of Coal on 26 December 2020 for surrendering these blocks, with a request for consideration of reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Company. The Company expects that whenever these two coal blocks are allotted to any other company, the cost incurred towards exploration and GR would be reimbursed from the new allocatee through MOC as per past experience of the Company. Keeping in view the above, an amount of ' 53.93 crore ( 31 March 2022: ' 53.93 crore) has been accounted as recoverable and included under Note-17 'Current assets -Other financial assets'.\n\nMoC has encashed the BG (Performance Security) of ' 168.00 crore on 22 March 2021 citing delay in achieving of the milestones of efficiency parameters which were beyond the control of the Company. The Company approached MoP on 30 March 2021 to take up the matter in Alternate Mechanism for Resolution of CPSE Disputes (AMRCD). Pending resolution of the dispute through AMRCD, the amount of BG encashed by MOC has been disclosed as recoverable from MOC under 'Claims recoverable' in Note-17-'Current assets-Other financial assets' . This issue is regularly being taken up with MoC by the Company and MoP for early settlement.\n\n(iii) The Coal Block Development and Production Agreement (CBDPA) signed by the Company with MOC is silent about the recoverability of expenditure incurred in case of termination of the CBDPA. Moreover, the fresh auction / allocation of mines by MOC may also take substantial time and is dependent upon the coal demandsupply scenario of the country in the days to come. Considering the uncertainty involved on the recoverability of the amounts in respect of Banai, Bhalumunda and Mandakini-B coal blocks , the amount disclosed as claims recoverable has since been fully provided for. Further, the balance expenditure incurred at these blocks which may not be recovered has also been provided for fully (Refer Note 5- 'Non-current assets - Intangible assets under development').\n\n## b) Badam\n\nIn the year 2018-19, the Company took over Barauni Thermal Power Station from Bihar State Power Generation Company Limited (BSPGCL). Ministry of Coal, Government of India has transferred Badam coal mine, the linked coal mine of Barauni TPS. Environment Clearance for the project is available. Stage-I Forest Clearance was transferred to the Company from BSPGCL on 14 January 2020. Application for Stage-II forest clearance is pending with Forest Department, Govt. of Jharkhand. Mining lease is pending with Govt. of Jharkhand and tendering process for appointment of MDO is in progress.\n\n## c) Assets and liabilities of coal exploration and evaluation activities are as under:\n\n'\n\nCrore\n\n| Particulars   |   As at   31 March 2022 |   As at   31 March 2021 |\n|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Assets        |                  134.04 |                  108.38 |\n| Liabilities   |                    1.67 |                    4.07 |\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021, there are no income, expenses and operating cash flows from coal exploration activities.

The Company has taken adequate measures to address such concerns by developing adequate systems and practices.\n\nIn order to institutionalize the risk management in the Company, an elaborate Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework has been developed. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company's risk management framework. As a part of the implementation of ERM framework, a 'Risk Management Committee (RMC)' with functional directors as its members has been entrusted with the responsibility to identify and review the risks, formulate action plans and strategies to mitigate risks on short-term as well as long-term basis.\n\nThe RMC meets every quarter to deliberate on strategies. Risks are regularly monitored through reporting of key performance indicators. Outcomes of RMC are submitted for information of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Company. Credit risk arises principally from trade receivables, unbilled revenue, loans, cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.\n\n## Trade receivables & unbilled revenue\n\nThe Company primarily sells electricity to bulk customers comprising mainly state utilities owned by State Governments. The Company has a robust payment security mechanism in the form of Letters of Credit (LC) backed by the Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA). The TPAs were signed among the Govt. of India, RBI and the individual State Governments subsequent to the issuance of the One Time Settlement Scheme of SEBs dues during 2001-02 by the GOI, which were valid till October 2016. Govt of India\n\n<!-- image -->",

Most of the States have signed these extended TPAs and signing is in progress for the balance states.\n\nCERC Tariff Regulations allow payment against monthly bill towards energy charges within a period of forty five days from the date of bill and levy of surcharge @ 18% p.a. on delayed payment beyond forty five days. GOI has notified Electricity (Late Payment Surcharge) Rules, 2021 on 22 February 2021.These rules envisage that base rate of LPSC to be considered as SBI one year MCLR, as on 1 April of the financial year, plus five percent. The rate of LPSC shall be increased by 0.5 percent for every month of delay, provided that the LPSC shall not be more than 3 percent higher than the base rate at any time.\n\nA default occurs when in the view of management there is no significant possibility of recovery of receivables after considering all available options for recovery.\n\nAs per the provisions of the TPA, the customers are required to establish LC covering 105% of the average monthly billing of the Company for last 12 months. The TPA also provided that if there is any default in payment of current dues by any State Utility, the outstanding dues can be deducted from the State's RBI account and paid to the concerned CPSU. There is also provision of regulation of power by the Company in case of non payment of dues and non-establishment of LC.\n\nThese payment security mechanisms have served the Company well over the years. The Company has not experienced any significant impairment losses in respect of trade receivables in the past years. Since the Company has its power stations as well as customers spread over various states of India, geographically there is no concentration of credit risk.\n\nUnbilled revenue primarily relates to the Company's right to consideration for sale effected but not billed at the reporting date and have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same type of contracts.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe Company limits its exposure to credit risk by investing in only Government of India Securities, State Government Securities and other counterparties have a high credit rating. The management actively monitors the interest rate and maturity period of these investments. The Company does not expect the counterparty to fail to meet its obligations, and has not experienced any significant impairment losses in respect of any of the investments.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe Company has given loans to employees, subsidiary companies, joint venture companies and other parties. Loans to the employee are secured against the mortgage of the house properties and hypothecation of vehicles for which such loans have been given in line with the policies of the Company. The loan provided to group companies are collectible in full and risk of default is negligible. Loan to APIIC is against a guarantee given by the Government of Andhra Pradesh vide GO dated 3 April 2003.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Company held cash and cash equivalents of ' 17.04 crore (31 March 2021: ' 90.05 crore). The cash and cash equivalents are held with banks with high rating.\n\n## Balances with banks and financial institutions, other than cash and cash equivalents\n\nThe Company held balances with banks and financial institutions, including earmarked balances, of ' 2,438.55 crore (31 March 2021: ' 2,248.41 crore). In order to manage the risk, Company places deposits with only high rated banks/institutions.\n\n## (i) Exposure to credit risk\n\nThe carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:\n\n| Particulars                                                                                         | As at   31 March 2022   | ' Crore As at   31 March 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Financial assets for which loss allowance is measured using 12 months Expected  Credit Losses (ECL) |                         |                                 |\n| Non-current investments                                                                             | 29,881.07               | 28,125.65                       |\n| Non-current loans                                                                                   | 1,288.40                | 1,498.12                        |\n| Other non-current financial assets*                                                                 | 1,017.98                | 1,092.84                        |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, no loss allowance for impairment has been recognised.\n\n- (b)   Financial assets for which loss allowance is measured using life-time expected credit losses as per simplified approach\n\nThe Company has customers (State government utilities) with capacity to meet the obligations and therefore the risk of default is negligible or nil. Further, management believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on historical payment behaviour and extensive analysis of customer credit risk.

The Company's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company's reputation.\n\nThe Company has an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of short, medium and longterm funding and liquidity management requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Company's Treasury department is responsible for managing the short-term and long-term liquidity requirements of the Company. Short-term liquidity situation is reviewed daily by the Treasury department. The Board of directors has established policies to manage liquidity risk and the Company's Treasury department operates in line with such policies. Any breaches of these policies are reported to the Board of Directors.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for setting up of policies and procedures to manage market risks of the Company. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the risk management committee.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency risk on certain transactions that are denominated in a currency other than entity's functional currency, hence exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises. The risk is that the functional currency value of cash flows will vary as a result of movements in exchange rates.\n\nThe currency profile of financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 are as below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Therefore, currency risk in respect of such exposure would not be very significant.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSince the impact of strengthening or weakening of INR against USD, EURO, JPY and other currencies on the statement of profit and loss would not be very significant; therefore, sensitivity analysis for currency risk is not disclosed.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nCertain contracts of the Company for construction of power plants with vendors awarded through International Competitive Bidding are denominated in a third currency i.e. a currency which is not the functional currency of any of the parties to the contract. The Company has awarded the above contracts without any intention to enter into any derivative contract or to leverage/ take position and without any option/intention to net settle at any point of time during the tenure of the contract. The Company has not separately recognised the foreign currency embedded derivative and has not designated the entire hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss considering the same as not practicable and absence of a reliable valuation model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk because the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. The Company manages the interest rate risks by entering into different kinds of loan arrangements with varied terms (e.g. fixed rate loans, floating rate loans, rupee term loans, foreign currency loans, etc.).\n\nAt the reporting date, the interest rate profile of the Company's interest-bearing financial instruments is as follows:\n\nCrore\n\n|                               |               | '             |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Particulars                   | 31 March 2022 | 31 March 2021 |\n| Financial Assets:             |               |               |\n| Fixed-rate instruments        |               |               |\n| Loans to related parties      | 839.15        | 892.25        |\n| Loans to others               | 22.39         | 23.28         |\n| Bank deposits                 | 2,344.28      | 2,190.08      |\n| Total                         | 3,205.82      | 3,105.61      |\n| Variable-rate instruments     |               |               |\n| Loans to related parties      | 164.33        | 278.66        |\n| Total                         | 164.33        | 278.66        |\n| Financial Liabilities:        |               |               |\n| Fixed-rate instruments        |               |               |\n| Bonds                         | 59,675.42     | 52,355.90     |\n| Foreign currency loans/notes* | 27,581.74     | 32,626.33     |\n| Rupee term loans              | 50.73         | 84.61         |\n| Commercial paper              | 6,631.26      | 12,859.74     |\n| Lease obligations             | 983.08        | 872.42        |\n| Total (A)                     | 94,922.23     | 98,799.00     |\n| Variable-rate instruments     |               |               |\n| Foreign currency loans/notes  | 14,733.13     | 12,729.58     |\n| Rupee term loans              | 64,340.13     | 64,937.58     |\n| Cash credit                   | -             | -             |\n| Total (B)                     | 79,073.26     | 77,667.16     |\n| Total (A+B)                   | 1,73,995.49   | 1,76,466.16   |\n\n## Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed-rate instruments\n\nThe Company's fixed rate instruments are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject to interest rate risk, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.\n\n## Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments\n\nA change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. The analysis is performed on the same basis for the previous year.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Changes to contractual cash flows as a result of replacing the existing benchmark interest rate on an economically equivalent basis as a direct consequence of the interest rate benchmark reform are accounted for by adjusting the effective interest rate without recognizing any direct modification gains or losses. There is no material impact on the change of the benchmark rate. The Company also plans to replace the USD LIBOR with the Term SOFR before the end of its publication on June 30, 2023.\n\n(Note: IBOR-Inter Bank Offered Rates, LIBOR-London Interbank Offered Rate, TONA-Tokyo Overnight Average Rate, SOFR - Secured Overnight Financing Rate)\n\n## 65.

To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Company has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the Ind AS. An explanation of each level follows underneath the table.\n\n| Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value- recurring fair  value measurement as at 31 March 2022   | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | ' Crore  Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------------|\n| Financial assets:                                                                                                |           |           |           |                  |\n| Investments in quoted equity instruments - PTC India Ltd.                                                        | 98.70     | -         | -         | 98.70            |\n| Investments in unquoted equity instruments                                                                       | -         | -         | 3.78      | 3.78             |\n|                                                                                                                  | 98.70     | -         | 3.78      | 102.48           |\n\n'\n\nCrore\n\n| Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value- recurring fair  value measurement as at 31 March 2021   | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Financial assets:                                                                                                |           |           |           |         |\n| Investments in quoted equity instruments - PTC India Ltd.                                                        | 93.30     | -         | -         | 93.30   |\n| Investments in mutual funds                                                                                      | -         | 499.99    | -         | 499.99  |\n| Investments in unquoted equity instruments                                                                       | -         | -         | 3.78      | 3.78    |\n|                                                                                                                  | 93.30     | 499.99    | 3.78      | 597.07  |\n\nThe Company has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. This includes a valuation team that has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements and reports directly to the Director (Finance). The valuation team regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the valuation team assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. Significant valuation issues are reported to the Company's Audit Committee.\n\nFair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows.\n\nLevel 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes investments in quoted equity instruments. Quoted equity instruments are valued using quoted prices on national stock exchange.\n\nLevel 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. This level includes mutual funds which are valued using the closing NAV.\n\nLevel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities included in Level 3 is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from prevailing market transactions and dealer quotes of similar instruments.\n\nThere have been no transfers in either direction for the years ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021.\n\n## c)   Valuation technique used to determine fair value:\n\nSpecific valuation techniques used to fair value of financial instruments include:\n\n- i) For financial instruments other than at ii), iii) and iv) - the use of quoted market prices\n- ii) For investments in mutual funds - Closing NAV is used.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Also, carrying amount of claims recoverable approximates its fair value as these are recoverable immediately.\n\nThe fair values for loans, borrowings, non-current trade payables and payable for capital expenditure were calculated based on cash flows discounted using a current discount rate. They are classified at respective levels  based on availability of quoted prices and inclusion of observable/non observable inputs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Capital Management\n\nThe Company's objectives when managing capital are to:\n\n- -safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and\n- -maintain an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity.\n\nThe Board of Directors has the primary responsibility to maintain a strong capital base and reduce the cost of capital through prudent management in deployment of funds and sourcing by leveraging opportunities in domestic and international financial markets so as to maintain investors, creditors & markets' confidence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital, which the Company defines as returns from operating activities divided by total shareholders' equity deployed in operating activities. The Board of Directors also monitors the level of dividends to equity shareholders in line with the dividend distribution policy of the Company.\n\nUnder the terms of major borrowing facilities, the Company is required to comply with the following financial covenants:\n\n- (i) Total liability to networth ranges between 2:1 to 3:1.\n- (ii) Ratio of EBITDA to interest expense shall not at any time be less than 1.75 : 1.\n- (iii)   Debt service coverage ratio not less than 1.10:1 (in case of foreign currency borrowings).\n\nThere have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interest bearing borrowings.\n\nThe Company monitors capital, using a medium term view of three to five years, on the basis of a number of financial ratios generally used by industry and by the rating agencies. The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.\n\nThe Company monitors capital using gearing ratio which is net debt divided by total equity. Net debt comprises of noncurrent borrowings (including current maturities and interest accrued there on) and current borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Equity includes equity share capital and reserves that are managed as capital. The gearing ratio at the end of the reporting period was as follows:\n\n| Particulars                             | As at   31 March 2022   | ' Crore As at   31 March 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Borrowings (including interest accrued) | 1,73,012.41             | 1,75,593.75                     |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents         | 17.04                   | 90.05                           |\n| Net Debt                                | 1,72,995.37             | 1,75,503.70                     |\n| Total Equity                            | 1,28,051.07             | 1,18,985.49                     |\n| Net Debt to Equity Ratio                | 1.35                    | 1.48                            |\n\n## 67.  Disclosure as per Ind AS 114, 'Regulatory Deferral Accounts'\n\n## (i) Nature of rate regulated activities\n\nThe Company is mainly engaged in generation and sale of electricity. The price to be charged by the Company for electricity sold to its beneficiaries is determined by the CERC which provides extensive guidance on the principles and methodologies for determination of the tariff for the purpose of sale of electricity. The tariff is based on allowable costs like interest, depreciation, operation & maintenance expenses, etc. with a stipulated return.\n\nThis form of rate regulation is known as cost-of-service regulations which provide the Company to recover its costs of providing the goods or services plus a fair return.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement\n\n- (a)   As per the CERC Tariff Regulations, any gain or loss on account of exchange risk variation during the construction period shall form part of the capital cost till the declaration of Commercial Operation Date (COD) to be considered for calculation of tariff. The CERC during the past period in tariff orders for various stations has allowed exchange differences incurred during the construction period in the capital cost. Accordingly, exchange differences arising during the construction period is within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, such exchange differences are also within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\nIn view of the above, exchange differences arising from settlement/translation of monetary item denominated in foreign currency to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations are recognized on an undiscounted basis as 'Regulatory deferral account debit/credit balance' by credit/debit to 'Net Movements in Regulatory deferral account balances' and adjusted from the year in which the same becomes recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries. Accordingly, an amount of (-) ' 729.75 crore for the year ended as at 31 March 2022 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance' (31 March 2021: (-) ' 382.42 crore accounted as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.). Further, an amount of ' 35.82 crore (31 March 2021: ' 13.92 crore) has been realized/recognized during the year.\n\n- (b)   Revision of pay scales of employees of PSEs w.e.f. 1 January 2017 has been implemented based on the guidelines issued by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). The guidelines provide payment of superannuation benefits @ 30% of basic + DA to be provided to the employees of CPSEs which includes gratuity at the enhanced ceiling of ' 0.20 crore from the existing ceiling of ' 0.10 crore. As per Proviso 8(3) of Terms and Conditions of Tariff Regulations 2014 applicable for the period 2014-19, truing up exercise in respect of Change in Law or compliance of existing law will be taken up by CERC. The increase in gratuity limit from ' 0.10 crore to ' 0.20 crore falls under the category of 'Change in law' and a regulatory asset has been created. The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 has since been amended and the ceiling has been increased to ' 0.20 crore.\n\nConsidering the methodology followed by the CERC for allowing impact of the previous pay revision, various tariff orders issued by the CERC under Regulations, 2014 and the above-mentioned provision related to the change in law of CERC Tariff Regulations, 2014, a regulatory asset has been created upto 31 March 2019 (Regulatory deferral account debit balance) towards the increase in O&M expenditure due to the pay revision. This was taken up with CERC through truing up tariff petition. CERC has been allowing the same progressively and during the year, the expenditure has been allowed in respect of few stations and accordingly an amount of ' 127.02 crore (31 March 2021: ' Nil) has been adjusted and an amount of ' 359.58 crore (31 March 2021: ' Nil) has been reversed. Balance orders are expected in the coming years.\n\n- (c) CERC Regulations provide that deferred tax liability upto 31 March 2009 shall be recovered from the beneficiaries as and when the same gets materialized. Further, for the period commencing from 1 April 2014, CERC Tariff Regulations provide for grossing up of the return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income. The Company has recognised a regulatory deferral account debit balance for such deferred tax liabilities (net) in the financial statements. Regulatory deferral account debit balance for deferred tax liability for the period commencing from 1 April 2014 will be reversed in future years when the related deferred tax liability forms part of current tax. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,569.33 crore (31 March 2021: ' 1,437.85 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2022 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.\n- (d)   The petition filed by the Company before CERC for reimbursement of the expenditure on transportation of ash, was favourably considered by CERC vide order dated 5 November 2018 and it was allowed to reimburse the actual additional expenditure incurred towards transportation of ash in terms of MOEF notification under change in law, as additional O&M expenses, w.e.f. 25 January 2016 subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory asset has been created towards ash transportation expenses in respect of stations where there is shortfall in revenue from sale of ash over and above ash transportation expenses. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,439.06 crore (31 March 2021: ' 1,003.79 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2022 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'. Further, the expenditure has been allowed by CERC during the year in respect of few stations and accordingly an amount of ' 55.58 crore (31 March 2021: ' Nil) has been adjusted.\n- (e)   CERC Regulations provide that the capital expenditure in respect of existing generating station incurred /projected to be incurred , inter-alia , towards liabilities to meet award of arbitration  (i) within the original scope of work after the COD upto the cut off date (Regulations 24) ; (ii) within the original scope of work and after the cut off date (Regulations 25); and  (iii)  beyond the original scope of work (Regulation 26),  will be admitted by CERC subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory deferral account debit balance has been accounted corresponding to  the amount debited to Statement of profit & loss in respect of arbitration cases amounting to ' Nil for the year ended 31 March 2022 (31 March 2021: ' 110.81 crore). Further,'Regulatory deferral account debit balance' amounting to ' 110.81 crore (31 March 2021: ' Nil)  has been reversed based on assessment of its recoverability, by debit to Statement of profit and loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Contract balances\n\nContract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables revenue when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms. The contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from the customers which are referred as 'advances from customers / payable to beneficiaries'.\n\nThe following table provides information about trade receivables including unbilled revenue, contract assets and advances from customers/payable to beneficiaries:\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                      | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                  | Current               | Non-current           | Current               | Non-current           |\n| Trade receivables including unbilled revenue     | 22,293.32             | -                     | 22,976.26             | -                     |\n| Contract assets                                  | 4,649.50              | -                     | 2,987.87              | -                     |\n| Advances from customers/payable to beneficiaries | 1,493.79              | -                     | 1,390.20              | -                     |\n\nThe amount of revenue recognised from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to change in transaction prices is ' 1,938.05 crore (31 March 2021 : ' 1,154.64 crore).\n\n## V. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\n\nPerformance obligations related to sale of energy:\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations, where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. Therefore, transaction price to be allocated to remaining performance obligations cannot be determined reliably for the entire duration of the contract.\n\nPerformance obligations related to other contracts:\n\nFor rest of the contracts, transaction price for remaining performance obligations amounts to ' 1,037.51 crore (31 March 2021: ' 723.34 crore) which shall be received over the contract period in proportion of the work performed/services provided by the Company.\n\n## VI. Practical expedients applied as per Ind AS 115:\n\n- a. The company has not disclosed information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected duration of one year or less and where the revenue recognised corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date.\n- b. The Company does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Company has not adjusted any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\n\nVII. The Company has not incurred any incremental costs of obtaining contracts with a customer and therefore, not recognised an asset for such costs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

(Refer Note13). In case of any claim on the Company from the banks in this regard, entire amount shall be recoverable from the beneficiaries along with surcharge. Others include contingent liabilities disclosed on an estimated basis relating to likely claims that may arise  in connection with abandoned oil exploration activities, land use agreements, service tax reimbursements, etc.\n\nSome of the beneficiaries have filed appeals against the tariff orders of the CERC. The amount of contingent liability in this regard is not ascertainable.\n\n## B. Contingent assets\n\n- (i) While determining the tariff for some of the Company's power stations, CERC has disallowed certain capital expenditure incurred by the Company. The Company aggrieved over such issues has filed appeals with the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL)/Hon'ble Supreme Court against the tariff orders issued by the CERC. Based on past experience, the Company believes that a favourable outcome is probable. However, it is impracticable to estimate the financial effect of the same as its receipt is dependent on the outcome of the judgement.\n- (ii)   CERC Tariff Regulations provide for levy of Late Payment Surcharge by generating company in case of delay in payment by beneficiaries beyond specified number of days from the date of presentation of bill. However, in view of significant uncertainties in the ultimate collection of the said surcharge from some of the beneficiaries against partial bills as estimated by the management, an amount of ' 184.17 crore as on 31 March 2022 (31 March 2021: ' 181.93 crore) has not been recognised.\n\n## C.

The other information comprises the Corporate Governance Report, and the information included in the Directors' Report including Annexures, Management Discussion and Analysis, Business Responsibility Report and other company related information (but does not include the Standalone Financial Statements and our auditors' report thereon), which are expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Standalone Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWhen we read other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions, if required.\n\n## Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, total comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements, that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate Internal Financial Controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the\n\n<!-- image -->",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n- 1.

Statement of Compliance\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared on going concern basis following accrual system of accounting and comply with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended, and other relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and the provisions of the Electricity Act, 2003 to the extent applicable.\n\nThese financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors in its meeting held on 20 May 2022\n\n## 2. Basis of measurement\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for:\n\n- \u00b7 Certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) that are measured at fair value (refer serial no. 28 of accounting policy regarding financial instruments); and\n- \u00b7 Plan assets in the case of employees defined benefit plans that are measured at fair value.\n\nThe methods used to measure fair values are discussed in notes to the financial statements.\n\nHistorical cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the consideration given to acquire assets at the time of their acquisition or the amount of proceeds received in exchange for the obligation, or at the amounts of cash or cash equivalents expected to be paid to satisfy the liability in the normal course of business. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\n## 3. Functional and presentation currency\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees ( ' ) which is the Company's functional currency.

Significant accounting policies\n\nA summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are as given below. These accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group has elected to utilize the option under Ind AS 101 - 'First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards' by not applying the provisions of Ind AS 16 - 'Property, plant and equipment' & Ind AS 38 - 'Intangible assets' retrospectively and continue to use the previous GAAP carrying amount as a deemed cost under Ind AS at the date of transition to Ind AS i.e. 1 April 2015. Therefore, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as per the previous GAAP as at 1 April 2015, i.e. the Group's date of transition to Ind AS, were maintained on transition to Ind AS.\n\n## 1. Basis of consolidation\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiary companies and joint venture companies are drawn up to the same reporting date as of the Company for the purpose of consolidation.\n\n## 1.1  Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the relevant activities of the investee. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is acquired by the Group and are continued to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.\n\nThe Group combines the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by line adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies in line with Group's accounting policies.\n\nNon-controlling interests (NCI) in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement  of  profit  and  loss,  consolidated  statement  of  changes  in  equity  and  consolidated  balance  sheet respectively.\n\nChanges in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in statement of profit and loss. All amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities of the subsidiary i.e. reclassified to consolidated statement of profit and loss or transferred to equity as specified by applicable Ind AS. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nInterests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, after initially being recognized at cost in the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nUnder the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Group's share of the post-acquisition profits or losses of the investee in profit and loss, and the Group's share of other comprehensive income (OCI) of the investee in OCI. Dividends received or receivable from joint ventures are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nWhen the Group's share of losses in an equity-accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, which includes any long term interest that, in substance, form part of Group investment in joint venture, the Group does not recognize further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture. Losses recognized using the equity method in excess of the entity's investment in ordinary shares are applied to the other components of the entity's interest in an associate or a joint venture in the reverse order of their seniority i.e. priority in liquidation.\n\nThe statement of profit and loss reflects the Group' share of results of operations of the joint venture. Any change in the OCI of those investee is presented as presented as part of the Group OCI. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in these entities. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of joint ventures to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nThe carrying amount of equity accounted as investments are tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in D.11 below.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to apply equity method of accounting for an investment because of a loss of joint control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount recognized in statement of profit and loss. This fair value becomes the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as a financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in OCI in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIf the ownership interest in a joint venture is reduced but joint control is retained, only a proportionate share of the amounts previously recognized in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss where appropriate.\n\n## 2. Property, plant and equipment\n\n## 2.1.  Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment is recognized as an asset if and only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are initially recognized at cost. Cost comprises purchase price including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any cost directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management and the present value of initial estimate of cost of dismantling, removal and restoration.\n\nSubsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nWhen parts of an item of property, plant and equipment that are significant in value and have different useful lives as compared to the main asset, they are recognized separately.\n\nDeposits, payments/liabilities made provisionally towards compensation, rehabilitation and other expenses relatable to land in possession are treated as cost of land.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other spare parts are carried as inventory and recognized in the statement of profit and loss on consumption.\n\nThe acquisition or construction of some items of property, plant and equipment although not directly increasing the future economic benefits of any particular existing item of property, plant and equipment, may be necessary for the Group to obtain future economic benefits from its other assets. Such items are recognized as property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 2.2.  Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent expenditure is recognized in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nExpenditure on major inspection and overhauls of generating unit is capitalized, when it meets the asset recognition criteria. Any remaining carrying amount of the cost of the previous inspection and overhaul is derecognized.\n\nThe cost of replacing major part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized regardless of whether the replaced part has been depreciated separately. If it is not practicable to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the Group uses the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when incurred.\n\n## 2.3.  Decommissioning costs\n\nThe present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of the asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met.\n\n## 2.4. De-recognition\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gains and losses on de-recognition of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined as the difference between sale proceeds from disposal, if any, and the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nIn circumstance, where an item of property, plant and equipment is abandoned, the net carrying cost relating to the property, plant and equipment is written off in the same period.\n\n## 2.5. Depreciation/amortization\n\nDepreciation is recognized in statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the generation of electricity business, integrated coal mining and on the assets of Corporate & other offices of the Group, covered under Part B of Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013, is charged on straight-line method following the rates and methodology notified by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) Tariff Regulations.\n\nDepreciation on the assets of the oil & gas exploration, power plants not governed by CERC Tariff Regulations and consultancy business is charged on straight-line method following the useful life specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 except for the assets referred below.\n\nDepreciation on the following assets is provided on their estimated useful lives, which are different from the useful lives as prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, ascertained on the basis of technical evaluation/ assessment:\n\n<!-- image -->",

Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAn intangible asset is recognized if and only if it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nIntangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have finite useful lives, are recognized at cost. Subsequent measurement is done at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Cost comprises purchase price including import duties, non-refundable taxes after deducting trade discounts and rebates and any directly attributable expenses of preparing the asset for its intended use.\n\nExpenditure on development activities is capitalized only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to & has sufficient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.\n\nExpenditure incurred which are eligible for capitalizations under intangible assets are carried as intangible assets under development till they are ready for their intended use.\n\n## 4.2.  Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent expenditure is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits deriving from the cost incurred will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\n## 4.3. De-recognition\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or upon their disposal. Gain or loss on de-recognition of an intangible asset is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of intangible assets and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 4.4.

Other intangible assets are amortized on straight-line method over the period of legal right to use or life of the related plant, whichever is less.\n\nThe amortization period and the amortization method of intangible assets with a finite useful life is reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, wherever required.\n\n## 5. Regulatory deferral account balances\n\nExpense/income recognized in the statement of profit and loss to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations are recognized as 'Regulatory deferral account balances'.\n\nRegulatory deferral account balances are adjusted in the year in which the same become recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Oil and gas exploration activities\n\nAll exploration costs incurred in drilling and equipping exploratory and appraisal wells, cost of drilling exploratory type stratigraphic test wells are initially capitalized as 'Exploratory wells-in-progress' under 'Intangible assets under development' till the time these are either transferred to oil and gas assets  when  a well is ready for commercial production or expensed as exploration cost (including allocated depreciation) as and when determined to be dry or of no further use, as the case may be.\n\nCosts of exploratory wells are not carried over unless it could be reasonably demonstrated that there are indications of sufficient quantity of reserves and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic & operating viability of the project. All such carried over costs are subject to review for impairment.\n\nCost of surveys and prospecting activities conducted in the search of oil and gas are expensed in the year in which these are incurred.\n\n## 6.2.  Coal mining exploration activities\n\nExploration and evaluation assets comprise capitalized costs which is generally the expenditure incurred associated with finding the mineral by carrying out topographical, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, exploratory drilling, trenching, sampling, expenditure for activities in relation to evaluation of technical feasibility and commercial viability, acquisition of rights to explore etc.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred after obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are capitalized as exploration and evaluation assets under 'Intangible assets under development' and stated at cost less impairment if any. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment indicators at least annually.\n\nOnce the proved reserves are determined and development of mine/project is sanctioned. Exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to 'Development of Coal Mines' under 'Capital Work in Progress'. However, if proved reserves are not determined, exploration and evaluation asset is derecognized.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the mining right or the legal right to explore are expensed as and when incurred.\n\n## 7. Development expenditure on coal mines\n\nWhen proved reserves are determined and development of mines/project is sanctioned, exploration and evaluation assets are transferred to 'Development of coal mines' under 'Capital work-in-progress'.\n\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalized only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development/ producing asset or replaces part of the existing development/producing asset. Any remaining costs associated with the part replaced are expensed.\n\nThe development expenditure capitalized is net of value of coal extracted during development phase.\n\nDate of commercial operation of integrated coal mines shall be determined on the occurring of earliest of following milestones as provided in CERC tariff regulations:\n\n- 1) The first date of the year succeeding the year in which 25% of the peak rated capacity as per the mining plan is achieved; or\n- 2) The first date of the year succeeding the year in which the value of production exceeds the total expenditure in that year; or\n- 3) The date of two years from the date of commencement of production;\n\nOn the date of commercial operation, the assets under capital work-in-progress are classified as a component of property, plant and equipment under 'Mining property'.\n\nGains and losses on de-recognition of assets referred above, are determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective assets and are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Stripping activity expense/adjustment\n\nExpenditure incurred on removal of mine waste materials (overburden) necessary to extract the coal reserves is referred to as stripping cost. The Group has to incur such expenses over the life of the mine as technically estimated.\n\nCost of stripping is charged on technically evaluated average stripping ratio at each mine with due adjustment for stripping activity asset and ratio-variance account after the mines are brought to revenue.\n\nNet of the balances of stripping activity asset and ratio variance at the Balance Sheet date is shown as 'Stripping activity adjustment' under the head 'Non-current assets/Non-current provisions' as the case may be, and adjusted as provided in the CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n## 7.2.  Mines closure, site restoration and decommissioning obligations\n\nThe Group's obligations for land reclamation and decommissioning of structure consist of spending at mines in accordance with the guidelines from Ministry of Coal, Government of India. The Group estimates its obligations for mine closure, site restoration and decommissioning based on the detailed calculation and technical assessment of the amount and timing of future cash spending for the required work and provided for as per approved mine closure plan. The estimate of expenses is escalated for inflation and then discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money and risk, such that the amount of provision reflects the present value of expenditure required to settle the obligation. The Group recognizes a corresponding asset under property, plant and equipment as a separate item for the cost associated with such obligation. Upon commercial declaration of mines, the mine closure, site restoration and decommissioning obligations are amortized on straight line method over the balance life of the mine.The value of the obligation is progressively increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds and the same is recognized as finance costs.\n\nFurther, a specific escrow account is maintained for this purpose as per approved mine closure plan. The progressive mine closure expenses incurred on year to year basis, forming part of the total mine closure obligation, are initially recognized as receivable from escrow account and thereafter adjusted with the obligation in the year in which the amount is withdrawn from escrow account after concurrence of the certifying agency.\n\n## 8. Joint operations\n\nThe Group has joint arrangements with others for operations in the nature of joint operations. The Group recognizes, on a line-by-line basis its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint operations as per the arrangement which are accounted based on the respective accounting policies of the Group.\n\n## 9. Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs consist of (a) interest expense calculated using the effective interest method as described in Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' (b) interest expense on lease liabilities recognized in accordance with Ind AS 116- 'Leases' and(c) exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs.\n\nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction/exploration/ development or erection of qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost of such asset until such time the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. Qualifying assets are assets which necessarily take substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.\n\nWhen the Group borrows funds specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the borrowing costs incurred are capitalized. When Group borrows funds generally and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the capitalization of the borrowing costs is computed based on the weighted average cost of all borrowings that are outstanding during the period and used for the acquisition, construction/exploration or erection of the qualifying asset. However, borrowing costs applicable to borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, are excluded from this calculation, until substantially all the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are complete.\n\nIncome earned on temporary investment made out of the borrowings pending utilization for expenditure on the qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nCapitalization of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets for their intended use are complete.\n\nOther borrowing costs are recognized as an expense in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cost includes cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is determined on weighted average basis. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates, trade discounts and other similar items. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\nThe diminution in the value of obsolete, unserviceable, surplus and non-moving items of stores and spares is ascertained on review and provided for.\n\nSteel scrap is valued at estimated realizable value.\n\n## 11.  Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at banks, cash on hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## 12.  Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of depreciable asset are recognized as income in statement of profit and loss on a systematic basis over the period and in the proportion in which depreciation is charged. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognized over the period in which the related costs are incurred and the same is deducted from the related expenses.\n\n## 13.  Fly ash utilization reserve fund\n\nProceeds from sale of ash/ash products along-with income on investment of surplus fund are transferred to 'Fly ash utilization reserve fund' in terms of provisions of gazette notification dated 3 November 2009 issued by Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. The fund is utilized towards expenditure on development of infrastructure/ facilities, promotion & facilitation activities for use of fly ash.\n\n## 14.  Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is recognized if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as a finance cost.\n\nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, the receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of profit and loss net of reimbursement, if any.\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are disclosed on the basis of judgment of the management/independent experts. These are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current management estimate.\n\nContingent assets are possible assets that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. Contingent assets are disclosed in the financial statements when inflow of economic benefits is probable on the basis of judgment of management. These are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Foreign currency transactions and translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency spot exchange rates at the date the transaction first qualifies for recognition.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the year in which it arises with the exception that exchange differences on long term monetary items related to acquisition of property, plant and equipment recognized up to 31 March 2016 are adjusted to the carrying cost of property, plant and equipment.\n\nNon-monetary items denominated in foreign currency which are measured in terms of historical cost are recorded using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. In case of advance consideration received or paid in a foreign currency, the date of transaction for the purpose of determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or part of it), is when the Group initially recognizes the non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet\n- \u00b7 Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and\n- \u00b7 All resulting exchange differences are recognized in OCI.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities are recognized in OCI. The associated exchange differences are reclassified to profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on disposal of the net investment.\n\n## 16.  Revenue\n\nGroup's revenues arise from sale and trading of energy, consultancy, project management & supervision services, income on assets under lease, supply of coal from integrated coal mines and other income. Revenue from other income comprises interest from banks, employees, contractors etc., dividend from mutual fund investments, surcharge received from beneficiaries for delayed payments, sale of scrap, other miscellaneous income, etc.\n\n## 16.1. Revenue from sale of energy\n\nThe majority of the Group's operations in India are regulated under the Electricity Act, 2003. Accordingly, the CERC determines the tariff for the Group's power plants based on the norms prescribed in the tariff regulations as applicable from time to time. Tariff is based on the capital cost incurred for a specific power plant and primarily comprises two components: capacity charge i.e. a fixed charge that includes depreciation, return on equity, interest on working capital, operating & maintenance expenses, interest on loan and energy charge i.e. a variable charge primarily based on fuel costs. Tariff for Group's integrated coal mines are also determined by CERC based on the norms prescribed in the CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the products or services and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognizes revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when (or as) control over the products or services is transferred to a customer.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. As at each reporting date, revenue from sale of energy includes an accrual for sales delivered to beneficiaries but not yet billed i.e. contract assets/ unbilled revenue.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In cases of power stations where the same have not been notified/approved, incentives/disincentives are accounted for on provisional basis.\n\nPart of revenue from energy sale where CERC tariff Regulations are not applicable is recognized based on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries and trading of power through power exchanges.\n\nExchange differences arising from settlement/translation of monetary items denominated in foreign currency to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per the CERC Tariff Regulations are accounted as 'Regulatory deferred account balances' and such balances are adjusted in the year in which the same becomes recoverable/payable to the beneficiaries.\n\nExchange differences on account of translation of foreign currency borrowings recognized up to 31 March 2016, to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per the CERC Tariff Regulations are accounted as 'Deferred foreign currency fluctuation asset' with corresponding credit to 'Deferred income from foreign currency fluctuation'. Deferred income from foreign currency fluctuation account is amortized in the proportion in which depreciation is charged on such exchange differences and same is adjusted against depreciation expense. Fair value changes in respect of forward exchange contracts for derivatives recoverable from/payable to the beneficiaries as per the CERC Tariff Regulations, are recognized in sales.\n\nRevenue from sale of energy through trading is recognized based on the rates, terms & conditions mutually agreed with the beneficiaries as per the guidelines issued by Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, Government of India.\n\nRebates allowed to beneficiaries as early payment incentives are deducted from the amount of revenue.\n\n## 16.2. Revenue from services\n\nRevenue from consultancy, project management and supervision services rendered is measured based on the consideration that is specified in a contract with a customer or is expected to be received in exchange for the services, which is determined on output method and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Group recognizes revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs when control over the services is transferred to a customer.\n\nReimbursement of expenses is recognized as other income, as per the terms of the service contracts.\n\nContract modifications are accounted for when additions, deletions or changes are approved either to the contract scope or contract price. The accounting for modifications of contracts involves assessing whether the services added to an existing contract are distinct and whether the pricing is at the standalone selling price. Services added that are not distinct are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that are distinct are accounted for prospectively, either as a separate contract, if the additional services are priced at the standalone selling price, or as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract if not priced at the standalone selling price.\n\n## 16.3. Other income\n\nInterest income is recognized, when no significant uncertainty as to measurability or collectability exist, on a time proportion basis taking into account the amount outstanding and the applicable interest rate, using the effective interest rate method (EIR). For debt instruments measured either at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), interest income is recorded using the EIR. For credit impaired financial assets the EIR is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial asset (after deduction of the loss allowance). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the EIR, the group estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nFor purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI) financial assets interest income is recognized by calculating the credit-adjusted EIR and applying that rate to the amortized cost of the asset. The credit-adjusted EIR is the interest rate that, at original recognition, discounts the estimated future cash flows (including credit losses) to the amortized cost of the POCI assets.\n\nScrap other than steel scrap is accounted for as and when sold.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Employee benefits\n\n## 17.1. Defined contribution plans\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions to separate entities and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an employee benefits expense in statement of profit and loss in the period during which services are rendered by employees. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available. Contributions to a defined contribution plan that are due after more than 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the service are discounted to their present value.\n\nThe Group has a defined contribution pension scheme which is administered through a separate trust. The obligation of the Group is to contribute to the trust to the extent of amount not exceeding 30% of basic pay and dearness allowance less employer's contribution towards provident fund, gratuity, post-retirement medical facility (PRMF) or any other retirement benefits. The Group's contribution towards pension is made to National Pension System Trust (NPS) for the employees opted for the scheme. The contributions to the defined contribution pension scheme of the  Group/NPS for the year are recognized as an expense and charged to the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 17.2. Defined benefit plans\n\nA defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan. The Group's liability towards gratuity, pension scheme at two of the stations in respect of taken over employees from the erstwhile state government power utility, post-retirement medical facility(PRMF), baggage allowance for settlement at home town after retirement, farewell gift on retirement and provident fund scheme to the extent of interest liability on provident fund contribution are in the nature of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Group pays fixed contribution to the provident fund at predetermined rates to a separate trust, which invests the funds in permitted securities. The contributions to the fund for the year are recognized as expense and are charged to the statement of profit and loss. The obligation of the Group is to make such fixed contributions and to ensure a minimum rate of return to the members as specified by the Government of India. Shortfall in the fund assets, if any, is made good by the Group and charged to the statement of profit and loss.\n\nThe gratuity is funded by the Group and is managed by separate trust. The Group has PRMF, under which retired employee and the spouse are provided medical facilities in the Group hospitals/empaneled hospitals. They can also avail treatment as out-patient subject to a ceiling fixed by the Group.\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The discount rate is based on the prevailing market yields of Indian government securities as at the reporting date that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.\n\nThe actuarial calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs, the current service cost and the net interest for the period after the re-measurement are determined using the assumptions used for the re-measurement.\n\n## 17.3. Other long-term employee benefits\n\nBenefits under the Group's leave encashment, long-service award and economic rehabilitation scheme constitute other long term employee benefits.\n\nThe Group's net obligation in respect of these long-term employee benefits is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.

Short-term benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.\n\nA liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under performance related pay if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## 18.  Other expenses\n\nExpenses on ex-gratia payments under voluntary retirement scheme, training & recruitment and voluntary community development are charged to statement of profit and loss in the year incurred.\n\nExpenditure on research is charged to revenue as and when incurred. Expenditure on development is charged to revenue as and when incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria for intangible asset as per Ind AS 38- 'Intangible assets'.\n\nPreliminary expenses on account of new projects incurred prior to approval of feasibility report/techno economic clearance are charged to statement of profit and loss.\n\nNet pre-commissioning income/expenditure is adjusted directly in the cost of related assets and systems.\n\nTransit and handling losses of coal as per Group's norms are included in cost of coal.\n\n## 19.  Income tax\n\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax expense is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year computed as per the provisions of Income\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they materialize, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against the current tax liabilities, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority.\n\nDeferred tax is recognized in statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in OCI or equity, in which case it is recognized in OCI or equity, respectively.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the sufficient taxable profits will be available in future to allow all or part of deferred tax assets to be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are not recognized for taxable temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint venture where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets are not recognized for deductible temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in subsidiaries and interest in joint arrangements where it is not probable that the differences will reverse in the foreseeable future  or taxable profit will not be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized.\n\nAdditional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognized at the same time that the liability to pay the related dividend is recognized. The income tax consequences of dividends are recognized in profit or loss, other comprehensive income or equity according to where the Group originally recognized those past transactions or events.\n\nDeferred tax assets include Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) paid in accordance with the tax laws in India, which is likely to give future economic benefits in the form of availability of set off against future income tax liability. MAT credit is recognized as deferred tax asset in the balance sheet when the asset can be measured reliably and it is probable that the future taxable profit will be available against which MAT credit can be utilized.\n\nWhen there is uncertainty regarding income tax treatments, the Group assesses whether a tax authority is likely to accept an uncertain tax treatment. If it concludes that the tax authority is unlikely to accept an uncertain tax treatment, the effect of the uncertainty on taxable income, tax bases and unused tax losses and unused tax credits is recognized. The effect of the uncertainty is recognized using the method that, in each case, best reflects the outcome of the uncertainty: the most likely outcome or the expected value. For each case, the Group evaluates whether to consider each uncertain tax treatment separately, or in conjunction with another or several other uncertain tax treatments, based on the approach that best prefixes the resolution of uncertainty.\n\n## 20.  Leases\n\n## 20.1. As lessee\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (1) the contact involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and leases for low value underlying assets. For these short-term and leases for low value underlying assets, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. Right-of use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option to extend the lease will be exercised/option to terminate the lease will not be exercised.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe right-of-use assets (other than land and buildings) are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation/amortization and impairment losses and adjusted for any reassessment of lease liabilities.\n\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated/amortized from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset, if the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset by the end of lease term or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the purchase option will be exercised. Otherwise, Right-of-use assets are depreciated/ amortized from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. In calculating the present value, lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rate. Lease liabilities are re-measured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset if the Group changes its assessment whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option.\n\n## 20.2. As lessor\n\nAt the inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. A specific asset is subject of a lease if fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of that specified asset. An arrangement conveys the right to use the asset if the arrangement conveys to the customer the right to control the use of the underlying asset. Arrangements that do not take the legal form of a lease but convey rights to customers/ suppliers to use an asset in return for a payment or a series of payments are identified as either finance leases or operating leases.\n\n## Accounting for finance leases\n\nWhere the Group determines a long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to be or to contain a lease and where the off taker has the principal risk and rewards of ownership of the power plant through its contractual arrangements with the Group, the arrangement is considered a finance lease. Capacity payments are apportioned between capital repayments relating to the provision of the plant, finance income and service income. The finance income element of the capacity payment is recognized as revenue, using a rate of return specific to the plant to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in each period. The service income element of the capacity payment is the difference between the total capacity payment and the amount recognized as finance income and capital repayments and recognized as revenue as it is earned.\n\nThe amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded in the balance sheet as financial assets, classified as 'Finance lease receivables', at the amount equal to the net investment in the lease.\n\n## Accounting for operating leases\n\nWhere the Group determines a long term PPA to be or to contain a lease and where the Group retains the principal risks and rewards of ownership of the power plant, the arrangement is considered an operating lease.\n\nFor operating leases, the power plant is capitalized as property, plant and equipment and depreciated over its economic life. Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement.\n\n## 21.  Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment considering the provisions of Ind AS 36 - 'Impairment of Assets'. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

Impairment losses are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Impairment losses recognized in respect of CGUs are reduced from the carrying amounts of the assets of the CGU.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of accumulated depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n\n## 22.  Operating segments\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 108 - 'Operating segments', the operating segments used to present segment information are identified on the basis of internal reports used by the Group's management to allocate resources to the segments and assess their performance. The Board of Directors is collectively the Group's 'Chief Operating Decision Maker' or 'CODM' within the meaning of Ind AS 108. The indicators used for internal reporting purposes may evolve in connection with performance assessment measures put in place.\n\nSegment results that are reported to the CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Unallocated items comprise mainly corporate expenses, finance costs, income tax expenses and corporate income that are not directly attributable to segments.\n\nRevenue directly attributable to the segments is considered as segment revenue. Expenses directly attributable to the segments and common expenses allocated on a reasonable basis are considered as segment expenses.\n\nSegment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, capital work in progress, intangible assets other than goodwill and intangible assets under development.\n\nSegment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, capital work in progress, intangible assets under development, advances for capital expenditures, trade and other receivables, inventories and other assets that can be directly or reasonably allocated to segments. For the purpose of segment reporting, property, plant and equipment have been allocated to segments based on the extent of usage of assets for operations attributable to the respective segments. Unallocated assets comprise investments, income tax assets, corporate assets and other assets that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\nSegment liabilities include all operating liabilities in respect of a segment and consist principally of trade payable, payable for capital expenditure and other payables, provision for employee benefits and other provisions. Unallocated liabilities comprise equity, income tax liabilities, loans and borrowings and other liabilities and provisions that cannot reasonably be allocated to segments.\n\n## 23.  Business Combinations\n\nAcquisition of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the date of the acquisition, which is the date at which control is transferred to the Group. The consideration transferred in each business combination is measured at the aggregate of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree, equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree and fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair values on their acquisition date (except certain assets and liabilities which are required to be measured as per the applicable standard) and the non-controlling interest is initially recognized at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets.\n\nAcquisition related costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred, amount of any non-controlling interest recognized in the acquired entity and acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities recognized. Where the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the consideration transferred, amount of any non-controlling interest recognized in the acquired entity and acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity after reassessing the fair values of the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is recognized as capital reserve on consolidation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves.\n\nIf the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognized in statement of profit and loss or OCI, as appropriate. When the Group obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, then it considers such an acquisition as a business combination achieved in stages.\n\n## 24.  Dividends\n\nDividends and interim dividends payable to the Group's shareholders are recognized as changes in equity in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders and the Board of Directors respectively.\n\n## 25.  Material prior period errors\n\nMaterial prior period errors are corrected retrospectively by restating the comparative amounts for the prior periods presented in which the error occurred. If the error occurred before the earliest period presented, the opening balances of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest period presented, are restated.\n\n## 26.  Earnings per share\n\nBasic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the financial year.\n\nDiluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares.\n\nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any bonus shares issued during the financial year.\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per equity share are also computed using the earnings amounts excluding the movements in regulatory deferral account balances.\n\n## 27.  Statement of cash flows\n\nStatement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method prescribed in Ind AS 7 - 'Statement of cash flows'.\n\n## 28.  Financial instruments\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability only when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## 28.1. Financial assets\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nAll financial assets are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets, which are not valued at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\n## Debt instruments at amortized cost\n\nA 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:\n\n- (a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and\n- (b)   Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.\n\n## Debt instrument at FVTOCI (Fair value through OCI)\n\nA 'debt instrument' is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:\n\n- (a)   The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and\n- (b)   The asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI\n\nDebt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the OCI. However, the Group recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified from the equity to the statement of profit and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.\n\n## Debt instrument at FVTPL (Fair value through profit or loss)\n\nFVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.\n\nIn addition, the Group may elect to classify a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Interest income on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\n## Investment in Equity instruments\n\nAll equity investments in entities other than subsidiaries and joint venture companies are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Group decides to classify the same either as at FVTOCI or FVTPL. The Group makes such election on an instrument by instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.\n\nIf the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to statement of profit and loss, even on sale/disposal of investments. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on sale / disposal of the investments.\n\nEquity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Dividend on such investments is presented under 'Other income'.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Group of similar financial assets) is primarily de-recognized (i.e. removed from the Group's balance sheet) when:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or\n- \u00b7 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nThe difference between the carrying amount and the amount of consideration received/receivable is recognized in the statement of profit and loss except for equity instruments classified as at FVOCI, where such differences are recorded in OCI.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the Group reverts to recognizing impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL.\n\nFor purchased or originated credit impaired financial assets, a loss allowance is recognized for the cumulative changes in lifetime expected credited losses since initial recognition.\n\n## 28.2. Financial liabilities\n\n## Initial recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and financial liabilities at amortized cost, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and, in the case of liabilities subsequently measured at amortized cost net of directly attributable transaction cost. The Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, borrowings including bank overdrafts, financial guarantee contracts and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:\n\n## Financial liabilities at amortized cost\n\nAfter initial measurement, such financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognized in statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR amortization process Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in finance costs in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to borrowings, trade payables and other contractual liabilities.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.\n\nGains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/losses attributable to changes in own credit risk is recognized in OCI. These gains/losses are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity on disposal. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The Group has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.\n\n## De-recognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the statement of profit and loss.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nWhen the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortised cost changed as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, the Group updated the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the reform. A change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows is required by interest rate benchmark reform if the following conditions are met:\n\n- -the change is necessary as a direct consequence of the reform; and\n- -the new basis for determining the contractual cash flows is economically equivalent to the previous basis - i.e. the basis immediately before the change.\n\nWhen changes were made to a financial asset or financial liability in addition to changes to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Group first updated the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by interest rate benchmark reform. After that, the Group applied the policies on accounting for modifications to the additional changes.\n\n## 28.3. Financial guarantee contracts\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts issued by the Group are those contracts that require a payment to be made to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because the specified debtor fails to make a payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Financial guarantee contracts are recognized initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined as per impairment requirements of Ind AS 109 - 'Financial Instruments' and the amount recognized less the cumulative amount of income recognized in accordance with the principles of Ind AS 115 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\n## 28.4. Derivative financial instruments\n\n## Initial recognition and subsequent measurement\n\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its foreign currency risks and interest rate risks of foreign currency loans. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken to statement of profit and loss.\n\n## 28.5. Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n## 29.  Non-current assets held for sale\n\nThe Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Use of estimates and management judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that may impact the application of accounting policies and the reported value of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. The estimates and management's judgments are based on previous experience & other factors considered reasonable and prudent in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.\n\nIn order to enhance understanding of the financial statements, information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements is as under:\n\n## 1. Formulation of accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies are formulated in a manner that results in financial statements containing relevant and reliable information about the transactions, other events and conditions to which they apply. Those policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is immaterial.\n\n## 2. Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.\n\nUseful life of the assets of the generation of electricity business and integrated coal mines (where tariff is regulated) is determined by the CERC Tariff Regulations in accordance with Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## 3. Recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the expected market outlook and future cash flows associated with the power plants. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 4. Defined benefit plans and long-term employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefit obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial assumptions which include mortality and withdrawal rates as well as assumptions concerning future developments in discount rates, the rate of salary increases and the inflation rate. The Group considers that the assumptions used to measure its obligations are appropriate and documented. However, any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the resulting calculations.\n\n## 5. Revenues\n\nThe Group records revenue from sale of energy based on tariff rates approved by the CERC as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, as per principles enunciated under Ind AS 115. However, in cases where tariff rates are yet to be approved, provisional rates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Leases not in legal form of lease\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply lease accounting rules as per Ind AS 116 in determining whether an arrangement contains a lease. In assessing arrangements entered into by the Group, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the right to use the underlying asset, substance of the transactions including legally enforceable agreements and other significant terms and conditions of the arrangements to conclude whether the arrangement meets the criteria as per Ind AS 116.\n\n## 7. Assets held for sale\n\nSignificant judgment is required to apply the accounting of non-current assets held for sale under Ind AS 105 - 'Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations'. In assessing the applicability, management has exercised judgment to evaluate the availability of the asset for immediate sale, management's commitment for the sale and probability of sale within one year to conclude if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.\n\n## 8. Regulatory deferral account balances\n\nRecognition of regulatory deferral account balances involves significant judgments including about future tariff regulations since these are based on estimation of the amounts expected to be recoverable/payable through tariff in future.\n\n## 9. Provisions and contingencies\n\nThe assessments undertaken in recognizing provisions and contingencies have been made in accordance with Ind AS 37 - 'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets'. The evaluation of the likelihood of the contingent events require best judgment by management regarding the probability of exposure to potential loss. Should circumstances change following unforeseeable developments, this likelihood could alter.\n\n## 10.  Classification of joint arrangements\n\nGroup's joint arrangements in the nature of joint operations and joint ventures require unanimous consent from all parties sharing control for decisions about the relevant activities. Parties are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities incurred by the joint arrangements. These arrangements are classified and accounted for as either joint operation or joint venture in accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 111 - 'Joint Arrangements'.\n\n## 11.  Impairment test of investments in Joint Venture Companies\n\nThe recoverable amount of investment in joint venture companies is based on estimates and assumptions regarding in particular the future cash flows associated with the operations of the investee Company. Any changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on the measurement of the recoverable amount and could result in impairment.\n\n## 12.  Income taxes\n\nSignificant estimates are involved in determining the provision for current and deferred tax, including amount expected to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This will be accounted for on settlement of the price thereof by the State Government Authorities.\n- d) Land includes 1,275.84 acres of freehold land of value ' 44.92 crore (31 March 2021: 1,281.32 acres of value ' 118.32 crore) and 377.11 acres of right of use land of value ' 3.10 crore (31 March 2021: 395 acres of value ' 3.10 crore) not in possession of the Company.

The land has been amortized considering the rate of depreciation provided by the CERC in the tariff regulations and the fact that it will not have any economic value due to deposit of silt and other foreign materials.\n- g) Possession of land measuring 98 acres (31 March 2021: 98 acres) consisting of 79 acres of freehold land (31 March 2021: 79 acres) and 19 acres of right of use land (31 March 2021: 19 acres) of value ' 0.21 crore (31 March 2021: ' 0.21 crore) was transferred to Uttar Pradesh Rajya Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Ltd.

The consideration received from erstwhile UPSEB is disclosed under Note 35 - Current liabilities - Other financial liabilities.\n- h) Adjustment to Land-right of use includes an amount of ' 776.05 crore, being the cost de-recognised consequent to order of APIIC for cancellation of 1200 acres of land allotted to the Company in the state of Andra Pradesh. Further, the depreciation/ amortisation provided till the end of previous financial year amounting to ' 131.92 crore has also been written back. The order provides allotment of alternate land in lieu of the same, subject to attached conditions.

It is expected that many of the items of PPE are expected to be used in the proposed new power plant while few are under transfer to other units of the Company. Notwithstanding the above, the net realisable value of the assets of the station has been assessed which is more than its carrying value.\n- j) Refer Note 73 regarding property, plant and equipment under lease.\n- k) Spare parts of ' 5 lakh and above, stand-by equipment and servicing equipment which meet the definition of property, plant and equipment are capitalized.\n- l) Property, plant and equipment costing ' 5,000/- or less, are depreciated fully in the year of acquisition.\n- m) Refer Note 25 and Note 32 for information on property, plant and equipment pledged as security by the Group.\n- n) Refer Note 75(C)(a) for disclosure of contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amount will be adjusted with the cost of related work or recovered from the party, depending upon the outcome of the legal proceedings.\n- d) Advances to contractors and suppliers include payments to Railways amounting to ' 1,862.94 crore (31 March 2021: ' 1,963.25 crore) under customer funding model as per policy on 'Participative model for rail-connectivity and capacity augmentation projects' issued by the Ministry of Railways, GOI. As per this policy, an agreement has been signed between the Company and the Ministry of Railways, GOI on 6 June 2016. As per the agreement, railway projects agreed between the Company and Railways will be constructed, maintained and operated by Railways and ownership of the line and its operations and maintenance will always remain with them. Railways will pay upto 7% of the amount invested through freight rebate on freight volumes every year till the funds provided by the Company are fully recovered along-with interest (equal to the prevailing rate of dividend payable by Railways at the time of signing of respective agreements), subject to the rebate not exceeding the freight amount in the accounting year, after commercial operation date (COD) of the railway projects. The advance is adjusted at projects which have acheived COD based on confirmation from Railways towards freight rebate in consonance with the agreement terms and the interest portion is recognised in Note-41-'Other income'.\n- e) Secured capital advances are secured against the hypothecation of the construction equipment/material supplied by the contractors/suppliers.\n- f) Loans given to employees are measured at amortized cost. The deferred payroll expenditure represents the benefits on account of interest rate on loans being lower than the market rate of interest. The same is amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining period of the loan.\n\n## 12.

Though this amount is not repayable to the beneficiaries, keeping in view the matching principle, and in line with the opinion of the Expert Advisory Committee (EAC) of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), this was treated as deferred revenue to the extent depreciation chargeable in the accounts is considered to be higher than the depreciation recoverable in tariff in future years. Since AAD is in the nature of deferred revenue and does not constitute a liability, it has been disclosed in this note separately from equity and liabilities.\n- b) Foreign exchange rate variation (FERV) on foreign currency loans and interest thereon is recoverable from/payable to the customers in line with the Tariff Regulations. Keeping in view the opinion of the EAC of ICAI, the Company is recognizing deferred  foreign  currency  fluctuation  asset  by  corresponding  credit  to  deferred  income  from  foreign  currency fluctuation in respect of the FERV on foreign currency loans adjusted in the cost of property, plant and equipment, which is recoverable from the customers in future years as provided in accounting policy no.

(a) The Group has a system of obtaining periodic confirmation of balances from banks and other parties. There are no unconfirmed balances in respect of bank accounts and borrowings from banks & financial institutions. With regard to receivables for energy sales, the Group sends demand intimations to the beneficiaries with details of amount paid and balance outstanding which can be said to be automatically confirmed on receipt of subsequent payment from such beneficiaries. In addition, reconciliation with beneficiaries and other customers is generally done on quarterly basis. So far as trade/other payables and loans and advances are concerned, the balance confirmation letters/emails with the negative assertion as referred in the Standard on Auditing (SA) 505 (Revised) 'External Confirmations', were sent to the parties. Some of such balances are subject to confirmation/reconciliation. Adjustments, if any will be accounted for on confirmation/reconciliation of the same, which in the opinion of the management will not have a material impact.\n- (b)  In the opinion of the management, the value of assets, other than property, plant and equipment and non-current investments, on realisation in the ordinary course of business, will not be less than the value at which these are stated in the Balance Sheet.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As per Para 64 of Ind AS 19, in case of surplus in a defined benefit plan, an entity shall measure the net defined benefit asset at the lower of actual surplus or the value of the assets ceiling determined using the discount rate. The asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Further, paragraph 65 provides that a net defined benefit asset may arise where a defined benefit plan has been overfunded or where actuarial gains have arisen.\n\nAs per the provisions of the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the Group has no right to the benefits either in the form of refund from the plan or lower future contribution to the plan towards the net surplus of ' 32.83 crore (31 March 2021: ' 94.61 crore) determined through actuarial valuation. Accordingly, Group has not recognised the surplus as an asset, and the actuarial gains in 'Other Comprehensive Income', as these pertain to the Provident Fund Trust and not to the Group.\n\nAs per the provisions of Employee's Provident Funds Scheme 1952, the employer shall be liable to make good the loss to the Trust in the event of any loss as a result of any fraud, defalcation, wrong investment decisions etc. to the Trust. Keeping in view the above, a provision of ' 17.86 crore (31 March 2021 ' Nil) has been recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss during the year, towards such loss to the trust.\n\n## B. Gratuity and pension\n\n- a) The Group has a defined benefit gratuity plan. Every employee who has rendered continuous service of five years or more is entitled to gratuity at 15 days salary (15/26 X last drawn basic salary plus dearness allowance) for each completed year of service subject to a maximum of ' 0.20 crore on superannuation, resignation, termination, disablement or on death, considering the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act,1972, as amended.\n- b) The Group has pension schemes at two of its stations in respect of employees taken over from erstwhile state government power utilities. These pension schemes are unfunded. The liability for the pension schemes is recognised on the basis of actuarial valuation.\n\nBased on the actuarial valuation obtained in this respect, the following table sets out the status of the gratuity and pension plan and the amounts recognised in the Group's financial statements as at balance sheet date:\n\n| Particulars                             | As at   31 March 2022   | ' Crore As at   31 March 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Net defined benefit (asset)/liability : |                         |                                 |\n| Gratuity (funded)                       | 88.05                   | 128.12                          |\n| Gratuity (non-funded)                   | 183.91                  | 190.35                          |\n| Pension (non-funded)                    | 560.57                  | 569.36                          |\n|                                         | 832.53                  | 887.83                          |\n| Breakup                                 |                         |                                 |\n| Non-current                             | 690.28                  | 706.24                          |\n| Current                                 | 142.25                  | 181.59                          |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Post-Retirement Medical Facility (PRMF)\n\nThe Group has Post-Retirement Medical Facility (PRMF), under which the retired employees and their spouses are provided medical facilities in the Group hospitals/empanelled hospitals. They can also avail treatment as out-patient subject to a ceiling fixed by the Group. The liability for the same is recognised annually on the basis of actuarial valuation. A trust has been constituted for its employees superannuated on or after 1 January 2007, for the sole purpose of providing post retirement medical facility to them.\n\nBased on the actuarial valuation obtained in this respect, the following table sets out the status of the PRMF and the amounts recognised in the Group's financial statements as at balance sheet date:\n\n| Particulars                                          |   As at   31 March 2022 | ' Crore As at   31 March 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Net defined benefit (asset)/liability - (funded)     |                  207.47 | 189.46                          |\n| Net defined benefit (asset)/liability - (non-funded) |                    0.08 | -                               |\n|                                                      |                  207.55 | 189.46                          |\n| Non-current                                          |                    0.08 | -                               |\n| Current                                              |                  207.47 | 189.46                          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sensitivity analysis\n\nReasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below.\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                              | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                          | Increase              | Decrease              | Increase              | Decrease              |\n| Discount rate (0.5% movement)            | (209.62)              | 219.39                | (190.73)              | 200.32                |\n| Annual increase in costs (0.5% movement) | 94.21                 | (91.99)               | 90.61                 | (78.32)               |\n| Salary escalation rate (0.5% movement)   | 114.25                | (109.62)              | 99.50                 | (94.54)               |\n\nAlthough the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan, it does provide an approximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period. This analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligations as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\n## G. Risk exposure\n\nThrough its defined benefit plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:\n\n## a) Asset volatility\n\nThe plan liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to bond yields; if plan assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. Most of the plan asset investments are in fixed income securities with high grades and in government securities. These are subject to interest rate risk and the fund manages interest rate risk with derivatives to minimise risk to an acceptable level. A portion of the funds are invested in equity securities and in alternative investments which have low correlation with equity securities. The equity securities are expected to earn a return in excess of the discount rate and contribute to the plan deficit. The Group has a risk management strategy where the aggregate amount of risk exposure on a portfolio level is maintained at a fixed range. Any deviations from the range are corrected by rebalancing the portfolio. The Group intends to maintain the above investment mix in the continuing years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is particularly significant where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.\n\nThe Group ensures that the investment positions are managed within an asset-liability matching (ALM) framework that has been developed to achieve long-term investments that are in line with the obligations under the employee benefit plans. Within this framework, the Group's ALM objective is to match assets to the pension obligations by investing in long-term fixed interest securities with maturities that match the benefit payments as they fall due and in the appropriate currency.\n\nThe Group actively monitors how the duration and the expected yield of the investments are matching the expected cash outflows arising from the employee benefit obligations. The Group has not changed the processes used to manage its risks from previous periods. The Group uses derivatives to manage some of its risk. Investments are well diversified, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.\n\nA large portion of assets consists of government and corporate bonds. The plan asset mix is in compliance with the requirements of the respective local regulations.\n\n## H.

The Company expects that whenever these two coal blocks are allotted to any other company, the cost incurred towards exploration and GR would be reimbursed from the new allocatee through MOC as per past experience of the Company. Keeping in view the above, an amount of ' 53.93 crore (31 March 2022: ' 53.93 crore) has been accounted as recoverable and included under Note-18 'Current assets-Other financial assets'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company approached MoP on 30 March 2021 to take up the matter in Alternate Mechanism for Resolution of CPSE Disputes (AMRCD). Pending resolution of the dispute through AMRCD, the amount of BG encashed by MOC has been disclosed as recoverable from MOC under 'Claims recoverable' in Note18-'Current assets-Other financial assets' . This issue is regularly being taken up with MoC by the Company and MoP for early settlement.\n\n- (iii)   The Coal Block Development and Production Agreement (CBDPA) signed by the Company with MOC is silent about the recoverability of expenditure incurred in case of termination of the CBDPA. Moreover, the fresh auction / allocation of mines by MOC may also take substantial time and is dependent upon the coal demand-supply scenario of the country in the days to come. Considering the uncertainty involved on the recoverability of the amounts in respect of Banai, Bhalumunda and Mandakini-B coal blocks , the amount disclosed as claims recoverable has since been fully provided for. Further, the balance expenditure incurred at these blocks which may not be recovered has also been provided for fully (Refer Note 5'Non-current assets - Intangible assets under development').\n\n## b) Badam\n\nIn the year 2018-19, the Company took over Barauni Thermal Power Station from Bihar State Power Generation Company Limited (BSPGCL). Ministry of Coal, Government of India has transferred Badam coal mine, the linked coal mine of Barauni TPS. Environment Clearance for the project is available. Stage-I Forest Clearance was transferred to the Company from BSPGCL on 14 January 2020. Application for Stage-II forest clearance is pending with Forest Department, Govt. of Jharkhand. Mining lease is pending with Govt. of Jharkhand and tendering process for appointment of MDO is in progress.'\n\n- c) Assets and liabilities of coal exploration and evaluation activities are as under:\n\n## ' Crore\n\n| Particulars   |   As at  31 March 2022 |   As at  31 March 2021 |\n|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Assets        |                 134.04 |                 108.38 |\n| Liabilities   |                   1.67 |                   4.07 |\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021, there are no income, expenses and operating cash flows from coal exploration activities.

General Information\n\nThe Group has two reportable segments, as described below, which are the Group's strategic business units. The strategic business units offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different technology and marketing strategies. For each of the strategic business units, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) reviews internal management reports on at least a quarterly basis.\n\nThe following summary describes the operations in each of the Group's reportable segments:\n\nGeneration of energy: Generation and sale of bulk power to State Power Utilities.\n\nOthers: It includes providing consultancy, project management & supervision, energy trading, oil and gas exploration and coal mining.\n\nInformation regarding the results of each reportable segment is included below. Performance is measured based on segment profit before income tax, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Board of Directors. Segment profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries.\n\nTransfer prices between operating segments are on an arm's length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has taken adequate measures to address such concerns by developing adequate systems and practices.\n\nIn order to institutionalize the risk management in the Group, an elaborate Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework has been developed. The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the parent company's risk management framework. As a part of the implementation of ERM framework, a 'Risk Management Committee (RMC)' with functional directors as its members has been entrusted with the responsibility to identify and review the risks, formulate action plans and strategies to mitigate risks on short-term as well as long-term basis.\n\nThe RMC meets every quarter to deliberate on strategies. Risks are regularly monitored through reporting of key performance indicators. Outcomes of RMC are submitted for information of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises principally from trade receivables, unbilled revenue, loans, cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.\n\n## Trade receivables & unbilled revenue\n\nThe Group primarily sells electricity to bulk customers comprising mainly state utilities owned by State Governments. The Company has a robust payment security mechanism in the form of Letters of Credit (LC) backed by the Tri-Partite Agreement (TPA). The TPAs were signed among the Govt. of India, RBI and the individual State Governments subsequent to the issuance of the One Time Settlement Scheme of SEBs dues during 2001-02 by the GOI, which were valid till October 2016. Govt of India subsequently approved the extension of these TPAs for another period of 10 years. Most of the States have signed these extended TPAs and signing is in progress for the balance states.\n\nCERC Tariff Regulations allow payment against monthly bill towards energy charges within a period of forty five days from the date of bill and levy of surcharge @ 18% p.a. on delayed payment beyond forty five days. On 22 February 2021, Ministry of power has issued a notification and accordingly Late Payment Surcharge (LPSC) shall be payable on the payment outstanding after the due date at the base rate of LPSC applicable for the period for the first month of default and the rate of LPSC for the successive months of default shall increase by 0.5 percent for every month of delay provided that the LPSC shall not be more than 3 percent higher than the base rate at any time.\n\nA default occurs when in the view of management there is no significant possibility of recovery of receivables after considering all available options for recovery.\n\nAs per the provisions of the TPA, the customers are required to establish LC covering 105% of the average monthly billing of the Company for last 12 months. The TPA also provided that if there is any default in payment of current dues by any State Utility the outstanding dues can be deducted from the State's RBI account and paid to the concerned CPSU. There is also provision of regulation of power by the Group in case of non payment of dues and non-establishment of LC.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, no loss allowance for impairment has been recognised.\n\n## (b)   Financial assets for which loss allowance is measured using life time expected credit losses as per simplified approach\n\nThe Group has customers (State government utilities) with capacity to meet the obligations and therefore the risk of default is negligible or nil. Further, management believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectible in full, based on historical payment behaviour and extensive analysis of customer credit risk. Hence, no impairment loss has been recognised during the reporting periods in respect of trade receivables and unbilled revenue.\n\n## (iii)   Ageing analysis of trade receivables\n\nRefer Note 14(g)\n\n## (iv)   Reconciliation of impairment loss provisions\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of financial assets during the year was as follows:\n\n## ' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                                        | Trade  receivables   | Advances   | Claims  recoverable   | Total    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| Balance as at 1 April 2020                                         | 188.57               | 0.14       | 0.12                  | 188.83   |\n| Impairment loss recognised                                         | -                    | -          | 343.51                | 343.51   |\n| Amounts written off / written back / adjustment  during the period | (358.27)             | 0.03       | 0.01                  | (358.23) |\n| Balance as at 31 March 2021                                        | 546.84               | 0.11       | 343.62                | 890.57   |\n| Impairment loss recognised                                         | -                    | -          | 3.16                  | 3.16     |\n| Amounts written off / written back / adjustment  during the period | 67.39                | -          | -                     | 67.39    |\n| Balance as at 31 March 2022                                        | 479.45               | 0.11       | 346.78                | 826.34   |\n\nBased on historic default rates, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of any other financial assets as the amounts of such allowances are not significant.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Group's Treasury department is responsible for managing the short-term and long-term liquidity requirements of the Group. Short-term liquidity situation is reviewed daily by the Treasury department. The Board of directors has established policies to manage liquidity risk and the Group's Treasury department operates in line with such policies. Any breaches of these policies are reported to the Board of Directors.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.\n\nThe Board of directors is responsible for setting up of policies and procedures to manage market risks of the Group. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the risk management committee.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on certain transactions that are denominated in a currency other than entity's functional currency, hence exposure to exchange rate fluctuations arises. The risk is that the functional currency value of cash flows will vary as a result of movements in exchange rates.\n\nThe currency profile of financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 are as below:\n\n| 31 March 2022 Particulars                                               | USD       | EURO     | JPY       | Others    | ' Crore Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Financial assets                                                        |           |          |           |           |                 |\n| Trade and other receivables                                             | 0.33      | -        | -         | -         | 0.33            |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                               | 0.01      | -        | -         | 0.02      | 0.03            |\n| Other financial assets                                                  | -         | 0.70     | -         | -         | 0.70            |\n| Total                                                                   | 0.34      | 0.70     | -         | 0.02      | 1.06            |\n| Financial liabilities                                                   |           |          |           |           |                 |\n| Foreign currency bonds                                                  | 18,015.88 | 4,307.65 | -         | 2,034.03* | 24,357.56       |\n| Unsecured foreign currency loans from banks and  financial institutions | 3,528.07  | 2,853.83 | 13,314.62 |           | 19,696.52       |\n| Secured foreign currency loans from banks                               | 136.20    | -        | -         | -         | 136.20          |\n| Trade payables and other financial liabilities                          | 2,961.37  | 1,481.53 | 151.64    | 30.38     | 4,624.92        |\n| Total                                                                   | 24,641.52 | 8,643.01 | 13,466.26 | 2,064.41  | 48,815.20       |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Therefore, currency risk in respect of such exposure would not be very significant.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSince the impact of strengthening or weakening of INR against USD, Euro, JPY and other currencies on the statement of profit and loss would not be very significant; therefore, sensitivity analysis for currency risk is not disclosed.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nCertain contracts of the Group for construction of power plants with vendors awarded through International Competitive Bidding are denominated in a third currency i.e. a currency which is not the functional currency of any of the parties to the contract. The Group has awarded the above contracts without any intention to enter into any derivative contract or to leverage/ take position and without any option/intention to net settle at any point of time during the tenure of the contract. The Group has not separately recognised the foreign currency embedded derivative and has not designated the entire hybrid contract at fair value through profit or loss considering the same as impracticable and absence of a reliable valuation model.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk arising mainly from non-current borrowings with floating interest rates. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. The Group manages the interest rate risks by entering into different kinds of loan arrangements with varied terms (e.g. fixed rate loans, floating rate loans, rupee term loans, foreign currency loans, etc.).\n\nAt the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group's interest-bearing financial instruments is as follows:\n\n| Particulars             | 31 March 2022   | ' Crore 31 March 2021   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| Financial Assets:       |                 |                         |\n| Fixed-rate instruments  |                 |                         |\n| Loan to related parties | 20.53           | 20.52                   |\n| Loans to others         | 22.46           | 23.36                   |\n| Bank deposits           | 3,180.71        | 3,391.19                |\n| Total                   | 3,223.70        | 3,435.07                |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are therefore not subject to interest rate risk, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flows will fluctuate because of a change in market interest rates.\n\n## Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments\n\nA change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased (decreased) profit or loss by the amounts shown below.

To provide an indication about the reliability of the inputs used in determining fair value, the Group has classified its financial instruments into the three levels prescribed under the accounting standard. An explanation of each level follows underneath the table.\n\n' Crore\n\n| Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value- recurring fair  value measurement as at 31 March 2022   | Level 1   | Level 2   | Level 3   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|\n| Financial assets:                                                                                                |           |           |           |         |\n| Investments in quoted equity instruments - PTC India Ltd.                                                        | 98.70     | -         | -         | 98.70   |\n| Investments in unquoted equity instruments                                                                       | -         | -         | 5.40      | 5.40    |\n|                                                                                                                  | 98.70     | -         | 5.40      | 104.10  |\n\n<!-- image -->",

This includes a valuation team that has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements and reports directly to the Director (Finance). The valuation team regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the valuation team assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that these valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the valuations should be classified. Significant valuation issues are reported to the audit committee.\n\nFair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:\n\nLevel 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes investments in quoted equity instruments. Quoted equity instruments are valued using quoted prices on national stock exchange.\n\n- Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. This level includes mutual funds which are valued using the closing NAV.\n\nLevel 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities included in Level 3 is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from prevailing market transactions and dealer quotes of similar instruments.\n\nThere have been no transfers in either direction for the years ended 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021.\n\n## (c)   Valuation technique used to determine fair value:\n\nSpecific valuation techniques used to fair value of financial instruments include:\n\n- i) For financial instruments other than at ii), iii) and iv) - the use of quoted market prices.\n- ii) For investments in mutual funds - Closing NAV is used.\n- iii)   For financial liabilities (vendor liabilities, debentures/bonds, foreign currency notes, domestic/foreign currency loans): Discounted cash flow; appropriate market borrowing rate of the entity as of each balance sheet date used for discounting.\n- iv) For financial assets (employee loans) - Discounted cash flow; appropriate market rate (SBI lending rate) as of each balance sheet date used for discounting.\n\n## (d)   Fair value of financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars               | Level   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   |\n|---------------------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                           |         | Carrying  amount      | Fair value            | Carrying  amount      | Fair value            |\n| Financial assets          |         |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| Loans                     | 3       | 830.18                | 830.18                | 814.10                | 822.00                |\n| Finance lease receivables | 3       | 355.49                | 355.49                | 437.77                | 437.77                |\n| Claims recoverable        | 3       | 915.05                | 915.05                | 742.10                | 742.10                |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Disclosure as per Ind AS 114, 'Regulatory Deferral Accounts'\n\n## (i) Nature of rate regulated activities\n\nThe Group is mainly engaged in generation and sale of electricity. The price to be charged by the Group for electricity sold to its beneficiaries is determined by the CERC which provides extensive guidance on the principles and methodologies for determination of the tariff for the purpose of sale of electricity. The tariff is based on allowable costs like interest, depreciation, operation & maintenance expenses, etc. with a stipulated return.\n\nThis form of rate regulation is known as cost-of-service regulations which provide the Group to recover its costs of providing the goods or services plus a fair return.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement\n\n- (a)   As per the CERC Tariff Regulations, any gain or loss on account of exchange risk variation during the construction period shall form part of the capital cost till the declaration of Commercial Operation Date (COD) to be considered for calculation of tariff. The CERC during the past period in tariff orders for various stations has allowed exchange differences incurred during the construction period in the capital cost. Accordingly, exchange differences arising during the construction period is within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\nFurther, any loss or gain on account of exchange differences on foreign currency loans for opearting stations shall be recoverable from / payable to beneficiaries on actual payment basis, as per the said Regulations. Accordingly, such exchange differences are also within the scope of Ind AS 114.\n\nIn view of the above, exchange differences arising from settlement/translation of monetary item denominated in foreign currency to the extent recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries in subsequent periods as per CERC Tariff Regulations are recognized on an undiscounted basis as 'Regulatory deferral account debit/credit balance' by credit/debit to 'Net Movements in Regulatory deferral account balances' and adjusted from the year in which the same becomes recoverable from or payable to the beneficiaries. Accordingly, an amount of (-) ' 807.87 crore for the year ended as at 31 March 2022 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance' (31 March 2021: (-) ' 390.80 crore accounted as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.). Further, an amount of ' 35.82 crore (31 March 2021: ' 13.92 crore) has been realized/recognized during the year.\n\n- (b)   Revision of pay scales of employees of PSEs w.e.f. 1 January 2017 has been implemented based on the guidelines issued by Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). The guidelines provide payment of superannuation benefits @ 30% of basic + DA to be provided to the employees of CPSEs which includes gratuity at the enhanced ceiling of ' 0.20 crore from the existing ceiling of ' 0.10 crore. As per Proviso 8(3) of Terms and Conditions of Tariff Regulations 2014 applicable for the period 2014-19, truing up exercise in respect of Change in Law or compliance of existing law will be taken up by CERC. The increase in gratuity limit from ' 0.10 crore to ' 0.20 crore falls under the category of 'Change in law' and a regulatory asset has been created. The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 has since been amended and the ceiling has been increased to ' 0.20 crore.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsidering the methodology followed by the CERC for allowing impact of the previous pay revision, various tariff orders issued by the CERC under Regulations, 2014 and the above-mentioned provision related to the change in law of CERC Tariff Regulations, 2014, a regulatory asset has been created upto 31 March 2019 (Regulatory deferral account debit balance) towards the increase in O&M expenditure due to the pay revision. This was taken up with CERC through truing up tariff petition. CERC has been allowing the same progressively and during the year, the expenditure has been allowed in respect of few stations and accordingly an amount of ' 127.02 crore (31 March 2021: ' Nil) has been adjusted and an amount of ' 359.58 crore (31 March 2021: ' Nil) has been reversed. Balance orders are expected in the coming years.\n\n- (c) CERC Regulations provide that deferred tax liability upto 31 March 2009 shall be recovered from the beneficiaries as and when the same gets materialized. Further, for the period commencing from 1 April 2014, CERC Tariff Regulations provide for grossing up of the return on equity based on effective tax rate for the financial year based on the actual tax paid during the year on the generation income. The Company has recognised a regulatory deferral account debit balance for such deferred tax liabilities (net) in the financial statements. Regulatory deferral account debit balance for deferred tax liability for the period commencing from 1 April 2014 will be reversed in future years when the related deferred tax liability forms part of current tax. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,753.50 crore (31 March 2021: ' 1,539.61 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2022 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'.\n- (d)   The petition filed by the Company before CERC for reimbursement of the expenditure on transportation of ash, was favourably considered by CERC vide order dated 5 November 2018 and it was allowed to reimburse the actual additional expenditure incurred towards transportation of ash in terms of MOEF notification under change in law, as additional O&M expenses, w.e.f. 25 January 2016 subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory asset has been created towards ash transportation expenses in respect of stations where there is shortfall in revenue from sale of ash over and above ash transportation expenses. Accordingly, an amount of ' 1,492.47 crore (31 March 2021: ' 1,003.79 crore) for the year ended 31 March 2022 has been accounted for as 'Regulatory deferral account debit balance'. Further, the expenditure has been allowed by CERC during the year in respect of few stations and accordingly an amount of ' 55.58 crore (31 March 2021: ' Nil) has been adjusted.\n- (e)   CERC Regulations provide that the capital expenditure in respect of existing generating station incurred /projected to be incurred , inter-alia , towards liabilities to meet award of arbitration (i) within the original scope of work after the COD upto the cut off date (Regulations 24) ; (ii) within the original scope of work and after the cut off date (Regulations 25); and (iii) beyond the original scope of work (Regulation 26), will be admitted by CERC subject to prudence check. Keeping in view the above, regulatory deferral account debit balance has been accounted corresponding to the amount debited to Statement of profit & loss in respect of arbitration cases amounting to ' Nil for the year ended 31 March 2022 (31 March 2021: ' 110.81 crore). Further,'Regulatory deferral account debit balance' amounting to ' 110.81 crore (31 March 2021: ' Nil) has been reversed based on assessment of its recoverability, by debit to Statement of profit and loss.\n- (f) CERC while determining the annual fixed cost of the Tuirial Hydro Electric Project (TrHEP) of NEEPCO, a subsidiary of the Company, for the period of 30.10.2017 to 31.03.2019 by CERC, allowed depreciation @2% for the said purposes in line with the decision of the Public Investment Board (PIB) of the Govt. of India. The rates and methodology as per the CERC tariff regulations based on which depreciation for TrHEP has been calculated and charged to the Statement of Profit & Loss vary from that allowed to recover through tariff as per the CERC order. Due to higher rate of depreciation as per the CERC regulations, depreciation charged for the first 12 (twelve) years of operation TrHEP will be more than that of the depreciation recoverable through tariff, which will be reversed in future periods during remaining period of normative life of the generating station. Accordingly, the lower depreciation realized during the earlier period of its operation will be recovered/adjusted during later period. In view of above, an amount of ' 41.18 crore (31 March 2021: ' 41.20 crore) being the difference of depreciation to the extent recoverable/ adjustable in future period has been recognized as Regulatory deferral account debit balances.\n\n## (iii)   Risks associated with future recovery/reversal of regulatory deferral account balances:\n\n- (a)   demand risk due to changes in consumer attitudes, the availability of alternative sources of supply.\n- (b) regulatory risk on account of changes in regulations and submission or approval of a rate-setting application or the entity's assessment of the expected future regulatory actions.\n- (c)   other risks including currency or other market risks, if any.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Contract balances\n\nContract assets are recognised when there is excess of revenue earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables revenue when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms. The contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from the customers which are referred as 'advances from customers / payable to beneficiaries'.\n\nThe following table provides information about trade receivables including unbilled revenue, contract assets and advances from customers/payable to beneficiaries:\n\n' Crore\n\n| Particulars                                      | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2022   | As at 31 March 2021   | As at 31 March 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                                  | Current               | Non-current           | Current               | Non-current           |\n| Trade receivables including unbilled revenue     | 27,342.08             | -                     | 28,199.83             | -                     |\n| Contract assets                                  | 5,299.22              | -                     | 3,393.97              | -                     |\n| Advances from customers/payable to beneficiaries | 1,815.68              | -                     | 1,740.18              | -                     |\n\nThe amount of revenue recognised from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, mainly due to change in transaction prices is ' 2,033.82 crore (31 March 2021 : ' 1,185.02 crore).\n\n## V. Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\n\nPerformance obligations related to sale of energy:\n\nRevenue from sale of energy is accounted for based on tariff rates approved by the CERC (except items indicated as provisional) as modified by the orders of Appellate Tribunal for Electricity to the extent applicable. In case of power stations, where the tariff rates are yet to be approved/items indicated provisional by the CERC in their orders, provisional\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrates are adopted considering the applicable CERC Tariff Regulations. Revenue from sale of energy is recognized once the electricity has been delivered to the beneficiary and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Beneficiaries are billed on a periodic and regular basis. Therefore, transaction price to be allocated to remaining performance obligations cannot be determined reliably for the entire duration of the contract.\n\nPerformance obligations related to other contracts:\n\nFor rest of the contracts, transaction price for remaining performance obligations amounts to ' 1,037.51 crore (31 March 2021: ' 723.34 crore) which shall be received over the contract period in proportion of the work performed/services provided by the Group.\n\n## VI. Practical expedients applied as per Ind AS 115:\n\n- a. The Group has not disclosed information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected duration of one year or less and where the revenue recognised corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity's performance completed to date.\n- b. The Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group has not adjusted any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\n- VII.  The Group has not incurred any incremental costs of obtaining contracts with a customer and therefore, not recognised an asset for such costs.\n\n## 73.  Disclosure as per Ind AS 116 'Leases'\n\n## (A)   Group as Lessee\n\n- (i) The Group's significant leasing arrangements are in respect of the following assets:\n- (a)   Premises for residential use of employees, offices and guest houses/ transit camps on lease which are not non-cancellable and are usually renewable on mutually agreeable terms. The company generally incurs amount on improvements which are significant to the respective lease and hence the cancellable period of the lease during which the company intends to continue considering the past experience / practice, is considered for the purpose of determining the lease period.\n- (b)   The Group has taken electrical vehicles on operating lease for a period of five to six years, which can be further extended at mutually agreed terms. Lease rentals are subject to escalation of 10% per annum.\n- (c)   A helicopter on wet lease basis.\n- (d)   The Group has taken certain vehicles (other than electrical) on lease for a period of more than one year to four years, which can be further extended at mutually agreed terms. There are no escalations in the lease rentals as per terms of the agreement. However, the Group has purchase option for some of such vehicles at the end of the lease term.\n- (e)   The Group had entered into an agreement for movement of coal through inland waterways for one of its stations. As per the agreement, the operator was to design, finance, build, operate and maintain the unloading and material handling infrastructure for 7 years after which it was to be transferred to the Company at ' 1/-. Refer Note no. 63(iii)(b).\n- (f) The Group acquires land on leasehold basis for a period generally ranging from 5 years to 99 years from the government authorities which can be renewed further based on mutually agreed terms and conditions. The leases are non cancellable. These leases are capitalised at the present value of the total minimum lease payments to be paid over the lease term. Future lease rentals are recognised as 'Lease liablities' at their present values. The Right-of-use land is amortised considering the signifcant accounting policies of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nConsidering the requirement of Standard on Auditing (SA 600) on 'Using the work of Another Auditor' including materiality, we draw attention to the following matters in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements:\n\n- (a) Note No. 40 (a)regarding billing and accounting of sales on provisional basis considering the provisions of  Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) Tariff Regulations.\n- (b) Note No. 63 (iii)(b) with respect to appeal filed by the Holding Company with the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi in the matter of Arbitral award pronounced against the Holding Company and the related provision made/disclosure of contingent liability as mentioned in the said note.\n\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context. Considering the requirement of Standard on Auditing (SA 600) on 'Using the work of Another Auditor' including materiality, below Key Audit Matters have been reproduced from the Independent Auditors' report on the audit of Standalone Financial Statements of the Holding Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report related to the Consolidated Financial Statements, but does not include the Consolidated Financial Statements and our auditors' report thereon. The other information is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors' report.\n\nOur opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWhen we read the other information, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions, if required.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these Consolidated Financial Statements in terms of the requirements of the Act, that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group including its joint ventures in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Ind AS Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its joint ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group and its Joint Ventures or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of its joint ventures.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility for the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the  Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the\n\n<!-- image -->",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its joint ventures to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in  the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Matters\n\n- a) We did not audit the financial statements/ financial information  of Ten subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statement, whose financial statements reflects total Assets of ' 81,181.42 crore and Net Assets ' 30,050.28 crore as at 31 March 2022; total Revenues of ' 17,279.03 crore and Net Cash Inflows amounting to ' (78.46) crore for the year ended on that date, as considered in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the subsidiaries and joint ventures, incorporated in India, in terms of their reports referred to in the 'Other Matters' paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls of the Group and its Joint Venture Companies incorporated in India, with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",
