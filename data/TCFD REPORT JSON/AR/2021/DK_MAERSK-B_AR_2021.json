Moller - Maersk continued to increase capacity, expand offerings to keep cargo moving and enable supply chains for its customers. The financial performance across Ocean, Logistics & Services and Terminals was unprecedented with revenue up 55%, EBITDA almost tripled, and EBIT was up almost five times.\n\n## Revenue\n\n(USD million)\n\n## 61,787\n\n(/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/colon.tf /three.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/four.tf/zero.tf) (/two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf/colon.tf /three.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf)\n\nRevenue increased by USD 22.0bn, mainly driven by higher freight rates in Ocean, volume increases and acqui sitions in Logistics & Services and higher global demand and increased storage income in Terminals.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\n(USD million)\n\n16,537\n\n(/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/colon.tf /four.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/four.tf/eight.tf) (/two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf/colon.tf /two.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/four.tf/zero.tf)\n\nFree cash flow increased by USD 11.9bn, positively impacted by higher cash flow from operating activities of USD 14.2bn, partly offset by higher gross CAPEX of USD 1.7bn and increased lease payments of USD 569m.\n\n## EBIT\n\n(USD million)\n\n## 19,674\n\n(/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/colon.tf /four.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/eight.tf/six.tf) (/two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf/colon.tf /one.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/two.tf/five.tf)\n\nEBIT increased by USD 15.5bn, positively impacted by the increase in EBITDA of USD 15.8bn.

Moller - Maersk debt free and able to continue to invest in decarbonisation, organic growth, primarily in Logistics & Services, complemented by acquisitions with six announced in 2021, while returning significant cash to shareholders through share buy-backs and dividends of USD 3bn in 2021.\n\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) , last twelve months, increased significantly to 45.3% (9.4%), as earnings improved significantly, only to a lesser extend offset by an increase in invested capital.\n\n## Record results in Ocean and contracting with customers\n\nGREEN METHANOL: 12 large ocean-going vessels of ~16,000 TEU by 2024 and 2025 EBIT-MARGIN: 37.2% with a target of > 6%\n\nProfitability increased substantially in 2021, due to increase in revenue from significantly higher freight rates as a result of the global COVID-19 recovery. Total operating costs increased by 17% to USD 26.8bn (USD 22.9bn), impacted by higher bunker price and container handling costs from operational congestion and bottlenecks.\n\nA significant and increasing part of Ocean volumes is on long-term contracts as part of the strategic transformation, with an increase in the rates of around 50% or USD ~1,000 per FFE during 2021. Through an increase in the contract length, more than 1.5m FFE were signed on multi-year deals by end of 2021. Contract customers also drive organic growth in Logistics & Services through the provision of end-to-end supply chain solutions.\n\n## Momentum in Logistics & Services growth\n\nM&A: Six businesses acquired CONTRACT LOGISTICS: 85 new warehouses opened\n\nRevenue increased by 41%, with an organic contribution of 34%, and 62% of the organic revenue growth came from top 200 Ocean customers underlining the integrator strategy. The e-commerce space was strengthened with the acquisitions of Visible Supply Chain Management, B2C Europe and HUUB, and the intended acquisition of Senator International will expand the air freight network. The intended acquisition of LF Logistics is expected to close in 2022 adding 223 warehouses to the existing portfolio. EBITDA was USD 907m (USD 454m) with a margin of 9.2% (6.5%) and EBIT increased to USD 623m (USD 264m) with a margin of 6.3% (3.8%), above the target of 6%.\n\n## Increased profitability in Terminals\n\nROIC: 10.9% with a target of > 9%\n\nRevenue: Increased to USD 4.0bn (USD 3.2bn)\n\nTerminals enjoyed a continued strong momentum in closing performance gap with ROIC above peer average and a 11% year-on-year volume growth. Growth is centred around either adding new locations offering synergies with Ocean or expanding the existing container terminal portfolio with a strategic focus on efficiency and improving quality, including investments in digitalisation and automation. With a mix of 75% revenue from shipping line and 25% from landside customers, strong financial and operational synergies are generated between Terminals and Ocean.\n\n## Deployed capacity and major market disruptions\n\nThe supply side of the logistics industry continued to be disrupted by COVID-19 and capacity shortages, where container availability and air capacity remained tight, and wait times for vessels outside of ports remained lengthy given the bottlenecks in landside transportation and warehousing.\n\nTo support the customer demand and ease the congestion impact, A.P. Moller - Maersk substantially increased capacity by 6.4% in 2021 to help customers mitigate the issues. SEE PAGE 46\n\nCongestion had a profound impact on terminal operations, exemplified by how APM Terminals Pier 400 in Los Angeles, USA, experienced congestion and how it affected different parts of terminal operation.

        "page_content": "## Letter from the Chairman and the CEO\n\nAlso, in 2021, the world was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. People and businesses around the world faced immense challenges to health, to livelihoods and to global supply chains.\n\nAcross A.P. Moller - Maersk globally, we have lost more than 90 colleagues to COVID-19, and many more colleagues have lost friends and family members.\n\nWe remained focused on protecting our people, supporting our customers and contributing to society by keeping goods flowing despite very challenging conditions. This was only possible through the incredible commitment and efforts from our 95,000 employees around the world.\n\n## Strategy strongly verified by customers\n\nFive years ago, A.P. Moller - Maersk was a diversified conglomerate. We are now well on our way to becoming a fully integrated logistics company that offers ocean, air and land transportation as well as fulfilment services and digital supply chain management to our customers globally.\n\nThe vision we defined in 2016 of becoming The Global Integrator of Container Logistics - connecting and simplifying our customers supply chains, has been validated by customer demand over the last two years. Our strategy of offering end-toend and integrated logistics based on control of crucial capacity: ships, containers, warehouses, ports and aircrafts has delivered massive growth in Logistics & Services.\n\nAfter decades of optimisation, keeping cost and inventory to a minimum, many customers now see the need to rethink their supply chain as resilience, flexibility, connectivity, and the ability to rapidly respond to supply chain shocks have become key competitiveness drivers. As a result, logistics is moving up the strategic agenda.\n\nThe conversations with our customers changed during the year, from procurement-led freight rate discussions to more holistic partnership-based discussions focused on how we truly partner with them to solve their problems and keep their supply chains running end to end.\n\nJim Hagemann Snabe Chairman of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS\u00f8ren Skou CEO of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S\n\n## Significant progress on the transformation\n\nExceptional market conditions led to record-high growth and profitability in A.P. Moller - Maersk due to significant increase in container freight rates in Ocean. In response to the extraordinary market situation, we expanded the fleet and container capacity, grew our global warehousing footprint and increased the terminal capacity. While we spent a tremendous effort on mitigating impacts to our customers, we also made fundamental strategic progress in building a more stable, more profitable Ocean business that is less affected by industry dynamics, as we significantly increased the volumes carried on contracts based on expanded relationships with customers.\n\nWe have built a profitable growth engine in Logistics & Services, outperforming the market on top-line growth. We grew the Logistics & Services business by 41% in 2021, of which 34% was organic growth, predominantly with our largest customers in Ocean. In the coming years, we expect to continue to grow organically well above market growth in Logistics & Services.\n\nDuring 2021, we made milestone acquisitions in Logistics & Services to close capability gaps and strengthen our geographical presence. We have acquired well-managed, profitable businesses to super charge logistic growth through cross-selling to our 70,000 Ocean customers.",

        "page_content": "We acquired Visible Supply Chain Management, B2C Europe and HUUB, bringing strong e-commerce capabilities to A.P. Moller - Maersk in North America and Europe, respectively. In the fall, we announced the intended acquisition of Senator International, a leading air-based logistics company with global reach. And at the end of 2021, we announced the intention to acquire LF Logistics, a significant contract logistics player with premium reputation and vast footprint across Asia- Pacific. By bringing these companies into the A.P. Moller - Maersk group, we further accelerate our ambition to be an end-to-end logistics partner fully capable of increasing ease, flexibility and speed in our customer's supply chains.\n\nIn our Terminals business, we set out to strengthen profitability by focusing on efficiency and utilisation, a journey that already in 2021 resulted in strong financial performance with a ROIC of 10.9%, hence above our target of minimum 9%. We are thus well placed to continuously deliver strong and stable earnings in Terminals, despite adding resources to mitigate bottlenecks.\n\n## 'In response to the extraordinary market\n\nsituation, we expanded the fleet and container capacity, grew our global warehousing footprint and increased the terminal capacity. While we spent a tremendous effort on mitigating impacts to our customers, we also made fundamental strategic progress.'\n\nA key enabler of our strategy is the digital transformation, where we have accelerated our activities during 2021, and we see increased digital adoption by our customers. Turnover on our Maersk.com platform (Maersk.com, Twill.net, mobile, EDI) reached USD 38bn, as we have been rolling out new digital platforms to standardise and improve customer experience.\n\nDuring the year, the traffic on Maersk.com increased by 15%, and search for our Ocean products increased by 52%. The number of bookings processed on our mobile app increased more than 15-fold, indicating a huge shift in how customers prefer to engage with us. Additionally, we offer instant booking confirmation for\n\n70% of the transactions on Maersk.com and provide an instant confirmation for delivery orders, an industry first.\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the success of our transformation depends on our ability to retain and attract world-class talent. We now have a strong product and engineering team of close to 5,000 talented people. During 2021 we welcomed more than 1,300 new engineering colleagues and thereby we significantly reduced our dependence on external contractors.\n\n## ESG integrated into core business\n\nDuring the year, we have reframed our sustainability work into a comprehensive ESG strategy, establishing the multiple ESG demands from stakeholders as a prerequisite for the successful delivery of our business strategy. As we embark on integrating our updated ESG ambitions across the business, we are committed to tying performance on the key ESG metrics to executive remuneration from 2023.\n\nDecarbonisation of logistics is the area where we can make the greatest impact. Already in 2018, A.P. Moller - Maersk took a leadership role with a strong commitment to decarbonise our shipping operations by 2050 and develop scalable solutions to help the entire industry reduce its carbon footprint. Since then, we have continuously accelerated our actions and ambitions and are convinced that while shipping is a so-called hard-to-abate industry, there is a credible pathway to decarbonisation over the next two decades through green fuels based on Power-to-X technology.\n\nThe biggest immediate challenge is the availability and cost of the green fuels of the future. Governments and industry must work together across the value chain to address this. But it is doable.\n\nIn 2021 and early 2022, we took decisive action by ordering 12 large container vessels capable of operating on green methanol, to be delivered in 2024 and 2025.\n\nFinally, we can now launch new targets and a more ambitious vision to decarbonise not just shipping, but our entire shipping and logistics business by 2040 - ten years ahead of the original commitment - and to halve our impact from scope 1 and 2 emissions over the next decade. We are committed to ensuring alignment of our targets with the science-based 1.5-degree pathway. We continue to be grateful for the strong support of our customers, shareholders and societal stakeholders on this journey, and we look forward to working with them in the coming years to build and scale a market for cost-competitive, decarbonised logistics solutions that will help take the world's global supply chain in the direction of the 1.5\u00b0C threshold by 2030.",

And we are committed to ensuring that our business practices are responsible and transparent across our entire operations and supply chain, with high standards of compliance and ensuring our employees act ethically and in accordance with our values.\n\n## Financial performance in 2021\n\n2020 was the year a microscopic virus brought the world to a halt - 2021 continued to bear its repercussions and knock-on effects, and many of the challenges faced in 2020 continued; we continued to show strength and exceptional dedication to serve our customers and keep their supply chains running. As a result of the continuation of exceptional market conditions, the financial performance of A.P. Moller - Maersk set new records, and our results have enabled us to invest in our long-term transformation, digitisation and decarbonisation while at the same time providing our shareholders with solid cash returns.\n\n## 2022 - Accelerating the transformation\n\nThe record-high financial performance of 2021 has enabled us to accelerate the investment in our long-term transformation, digitisation and decarbonisation, while at the same time providing our shareholders with solid cash returns.\n\nIn 2022, we will continue to focus on growing our Logistics & Services business, expanding our product portfolio across all relevant segments and increase crossselling to our customers to deliver profitable, organic growth. We will continue to close capability gaps and add digital platforms to our portfolio, while harvesting the commercial synergies from the acquisitions announced in 2021.\n\nIn Ocean, our focus will be on developing existing products, as well as continuing to increase the level of long-term contracts, serving the needs of our long-standing customers with whom our integrated offering resonates the strongest. Further, we remain focused on optimising our transportation network and cost structure to ensure earnings are stabilised, delivering sustainable returns in our largest business.\n\nIn Terminals, our focus continues to be on maintaining the current momentum on profitability while leveraging the synergies with the Ocean and Logistics & Services business.\n\nFinally, we stand committed to restoring schedule reliability. The challenge is multifaceted, and we have taken multi-faceted action to make meaningful progress during 2022 and offer our customers a more consistent service, despite highly challenging market conditions.\n\n'In 2021 and early 2022, we took decisive action by ordering 12 large container vessels capable of operating on green methanol, to be delivered in 2024 and 2025.'\n\n## Thank you for your continued support\n\nWe would like to thank our customers for trusting us with their supply chains during a highly uncertain year. We will continue to do our utmost to serve their needs and alleviate disruptions that impact their businesses.\n\nMassive and joint efforts are still needed to work through uncertainties triggered by the pandemic. We stay committed to contributing to a fast, just and sustainable recovery.\n\nWe would also like to thank our largest shareholder A.P. Moller Holding A/S and the Board of Directors for their competent guidance and support throughout the year. In 2021, Dorothee Blessing stepped down and we welcomed Amparo Moraleda as a new member of the Board, adding valuable and relevant experience within digital transformation, remuneration and strategy.\n\nFinally, we thank our 95,000 colleagues deeply for their truly extraordinary efforts to keep trade moving under such challenging conditions. The company is as strong as ever, our strategy is working and is being executed well and even more importantly, we have laid the groundwork for long-term, sustainable growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJim Hagemann Snabe\n\nChairman of A.P.

        "page_content": "## Market insights\n\nThe global economy recovered in 2021 following the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns in 2020. Strong demand put pressure on global supply chains, above all in the USA as imports surged.\n\nConsumer demand for goods was supported by economic policy and the ability to make purchases online, while services demand such as tourism and restaurants remained subdued in the first half of the year. At the same time, the supply side of the logistics industry continued to be disrupted by COVID-19 and capacity shortages, where container availability and air capacity remained tight, and wait times for vessels outside of ports remained lengthy given the bottlenecks in landside transportation and warehousing. Strong demand combined with supply shortages led to sharp increases in cost of logistics services.\n\nGoing forward, the global growth outlook remains strong for 2022, but risks are mounting for most regions. Moreover, it is highly uncertain if goods consumption will continue to drive up demand for logistics and container flows, especially when demand for services normalises. The 2022 outlook for freight rates mainly rests on when market disruptions will normalise. For an illustration of the major market disruptions from 2021 and ongoing. SEE PAGE 46\n\n## Macroeconomics\n\nEconomic activity in 2021 was supported by the swift roll-out of vaccines and extensive fiscal programmes and loose monetary policy in many countries, leading to high levels of consumer spending and business investment, above all in the USA. Sales via the e-commerce channel expanded sharply and supported a massive shift in spending patterns towards consumer goods. Meanwhile, demand for services such as travels and dining at restaurants remained subdued due to COVID-19 restrictions, although services demand began to normalise in H2 2021. Large economies such as the USA and China recovered to pre-crisis levels during 2021 and are currently running at or above pre-crisis trend. Meanwhile, the Euro area and Japan are rapidly recovering, but not yet fully back to pre-crisis levels, and Europe and\n\nthe USA are currently experiencing a new strong wave of COVID-19 cases. Inventories remained extraordinarily low due to shortages of semiconductors and other production inputs.\n\nGoing forward, the global growth outlook remains strong for 2022, led by expectations of robust business investments, strong demand, rising wages and relatively cheap capital. Moreover, inventory replenishment will support goods trade well into 2022, and the channel shift to e-commerce is likely to persist. But risks to the outlook are increasing, most clearly for China and Brazil, and with headwinds building for the USA and European consumer. It is highly uncertain if goods consumption will continue to drive up container demand. In the USA, consensus forecasters project fairly flat consumption profiles from current high levels. Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) is also softening in key countries, and the fiscal impulse will start to turn negative in 2022 in many economies. Finally, households' appetite for services, such as travelling, could begin to take up a larger share of the wallet than usual if the pandemic dissipates during 2022, and the degree of e-commerce penetration remains to be seen.\n\n## Logistics industry developments\n\nDemand for logistics services recovered strongly in 2021 across global supply chains, following the sharp downturn in 2020. The demand recovery, above all in the USA, supported volume activity in the broader freight markets. Global container sea freight increased by 8% in 2021, and air cargo volumes (CTK) rose more than 20% in the period from January to November. According to Drewry, port throughput volumes increased by 6.5% in 2021, mainly driven by North America and South Asia, but with all regions showing significant growth rates.\n\nHowever, the sharp increase in demand tested the flexibility of the supply side of the logistics industry and led to landside bottlenecks. Warehousing capacity was not geared to the shift in spending patterns and the growing e-commerce demand. A shortage of truck drivers, for example in the USA, meant that much of the container volume sat idle at capacity-constrained facilities, negatively impacting manufacturing and retail supply chains. Supplier delivery times rose significantly and although port productivity was much higher than pre-COVID-19 levels, significant delays remain a challenge with vessels sitting two to three times longer at anchor outside Los Angeles than before COVID-19. For an illustration of how APM Terminals Pier 400 in Los Angeles, USA, experienced congestion and how it affects different parts of the terminals operation. SEE PAGE 59",

Altogether, the challenged supply chains led to sharp increases in freight rates.\n\nGlobal supply chains have been affected by several shocks during the past 12 months. A study by Allianz Research decomposes those shocks into three main categories to either demand, measured by US retail sales, industrial production or logistics measured by suppliers' delivery times, and PMI surveys. It suggests that a shock to demand has been mostly contributing positively to global trade growth since July 2020, see figure 1. On the other hand, industrial production had a massive positive impact in summer 2020, most likely reflecting factories recovering from the COVID-19 lockdowns. Furthermore, the recent negative shock from logistics congestion has been contributing more than in previous periods. This could indicate that some goods that were in demand were not transported due to unmet demand, leading to a drawdown in inventories. This also suggests that some of these goods will instead be transported in 2022 together with a normalisation of inventory levels.\n\nTrade flows for some segments and industries have grown much faster than others during the last year's recovery. In particular, transportation (containers) of retail technology goods increased 18% y/y in January to October 2021 compared to the same period in 2019, see figure 2, while automotive, paper and forestry, and mining\n\nhardly grew. These developments were closely linked to increased demand from work-from-home and e-commerce penetration as well as less money of the wallet spend on services such as package holidays and restaurant visits. Going forward, it is reasonable to believe that goods categories that have significantly overperformed its trend will begin to slow, and spending on services will re-bound as already evident during H2 2021. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether workfrom-home and the e-commerce penetration will have a longer lasting impact on consumer goods demand. Meanwhile, the outlook for automotive volumes is heavily dependent on the pace of electric vehicles (EV) adoption and the sourcing of battery packs. For apparel volumes, the pace of automation adoption and ecosystem shifts are key to the outlook. The wild cards for most commodity groups are the impact of the ESG agenda, the coming shifts in consumer behaviour, and the impact of climate change on sourcing patterns, e.g., agriculture.\n\nLooking ahead, there is little visibility into when capacity constraints will abate. While the overall demand outlook for trade flows is expected to moderate in 2022, the demand asymmetry (USA-led) and supply bottlenecks will most likely take some time to unwind.\n\n## By verticals\n\nGrowth y/y (%)\n\n(January - August 2021 vs January - August 2019) y/y\n\n<!-- image -->",

More volumes were moved in H2 2021 than ever before, despite the logistics challenges. Compared to 2019, container volumes in 2021 were 6% higher, and volumes are now back to trend levels, see figure 3. In H2 2021, global container demand growth moderated to 1%, down from double-digit growth rates in H1 2021 which were supported by the very weak container volumes in H1 2020.\n\nThe 2021 recovery was broad-based across regions, see figure 4, but particularly imports to North America grew fast by 13% and to Latin America by 20%, reflecting the strong demand for consumer goods. Goods consumption stalled in recent months in Europe, and production in the automotive sector was hit hard by input shortages. Consequently, European container imports from the Far East decreased in Q3 2021, but recovered again in Q4, driving down the full-year 2021 growth to 8%. Asian imports from the USA\n\nFigure /three.tf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal container volumes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand Europe declined by 6% in 2021, reflecting weaker Chinese demand for construction materials in H2 2021 and the importance of getting empty containers back to China. North-South container trade grew 8% in 2021.\n\nLooking ahead at 2022, global container demand growth is expected to increase in the lower end of the 2-4% interval, despite the strong economic outlook. The modest growth scenario reflects expectations that the current misalignment between goods and services demand will normalise during 2022 as the COVID-19 pandemic dissipates and tourism and other service sectors approaches pre-crisis levels, as well as strong base effects for goods consumption. The exact growth profile in 2022/2023 is, however, difficult to forecast given the uncertainties about when disruptions will ease, how quickly inventory restocking will follow, and when the extraordinary consumer goods demand will normalise.",

In particular, landside disruptions continued to substantially constrain supply chain capacity, and bottle necks in ports reduced effective vessel capacity. At the end of Q4, the nominal global container fleet stood at 25m TEU, an increase of 4.5% compared to Q4 2020. Deliveries amounted to 1,075k TEU (153 vessels) while only 17k TEU were scrapped, reflecting the challenged capacity situation. The order book reached 23% of the global\n\n## Figure /five.tf\n\n## Deutsche Bank congestion index vs freight rates\n\nFigure /six.tf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regional congestions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfleet in Q4 on the back of continued high activity in new ordering. With the idle fleet remaining low (1% of the fleet at the end of Q4), the underlying demand-supply balance deteriorated slightly towards the end of the year. According to Alphaliner, the nominal global container fleet will grow by 4% in 2022.\n\n## Freight rates\n\nFreight rates, as measured by the China Composite Freight Index (CCFI), were on average 168% higher in 2021 compared to 2020, see figure 5. Although demand only outgrew effective supply by a margin in 2021, the broader disruptions, mainly on the landside, drove freight rates away from fundamentals. A congestion index constructed by Deutsche Bank measuring vessel delays at ports captures well the increase in freight rates during 2021. And a further deep dive shows that port congestions were mainly apparent on the US West Coast, peaking at around three times above the normal in November 2021, while congestions in China and Europe were around 50-75% above normal, cf. Clarkson, see figure 6. Asia to US West Coast freight rates increased by 104%, and Asia to US East Coast rose by 95%. Freight rates increased even more on the Asia to North Europe trades by 274% and by 264% from Asia to Mediterranean Europe.\n\nUncertainty of developments in freight rates remains high not only because of the macroeconomic, geopolitical and goods demand environment, but mainly because of the ongoing congestion and potentially fundamental changes in the industry itself. The 2022 outlook for freight rates mainly rests on when market disruptions will normalise.",

Moller - Maersk is transforming its business model to create a more profitable and resilient Ocean business through differentiated value propositions to the customers.\n\nOver the last two years, it has been gradually building five differentiated Ocean products which have created a great deal of interest from customers. The products are designed based on the recognition that customers have different needs when it comes to how they want to get access to space and the level of speed and reliability of their Ocean transport. Each of the products includes different elements adding value to customers depending on their needs and thus building preference and loyalty and increasing the resilience of the Ocean business. The differentiated Ocean products are already changing long-existing dynamics in the industry, and focus starts to shift to long-term value rather than rate procurement for many customers. Long-term relationships are becoming even more important and the share of volumes on long-term contracts has been increasing within the last year, contributing to the stability and predictability of the Ocean business and a markedly different approach than in the past.\n\nDelivering on the value propositions behind those products requires a superior product in Ocean as the foundation. A.P. Moller - Maersk is performing well compared to the industry in terms of reliability, but does not meet customer expectations at absolute level. It is consequently implementing new initiatives, including\n\n## Five differentiated Ocean products\n\n## Twill by Maersk\n\nFully digital product, partnering with small to medium sized enterprise Beneficial Cargo Owners (BCO) to serve their end-toend needs\n\n## Maersk Spot\n\nFully digital product, offering a load guaranteed product to forwarders, with an option to buy a wide variety of add-ons\n\n## Block space contract\n\nContract product for forwarders, offering full commitment to secured space with fixed weekly allocation and time guarantee\n\n## Flexible contract\n\nContract product for BCOs, offering full commitment to secured space with configurable flexibility options and time guarantee\n\n## Unlimited contract\n\nPremium contract product for BCOs, offering full commitment to secured space offered with 100% volume flexibility and time guarantee\n\nredesigning the network to be more reliable by design and building new digitally empowered operational capabilities to manage supply and demand more effectively. Further integration with hubs continues to strengthen the reliability of the network while also providing more optionality for customers to manage their cargo, including the ability to redirect cargo in transit. In addition, data-driven optimisation of shipments already in the planning stage will enable significantly better shipment-level reliability.\n\nA disciplined approach to CAPEX which focuses on growing through efficiency and on replacement rather than growing capacity further contributed.\n\nThe ability to meet customer needs with differentiated value propositions, and at the same time flexibly adjusting capacity to demand and lifting operational efficiencies, creates a more stable and resilient Ocean business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. A strong and profitable growth engine in Logistics & Services\n\nThe strategy is based on the insight that many companies are currently dissatisfied with the performance and resilience of their supply chain. There was a large unmet need to offer and deliver consistently an integrated solution at scale that would guarantee outcomes, provide more transparency and ultimately lower total cost of ownership.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has embarked on a customer-centric approach to take on a larger responsibility for its customers' supply chains. It has defined the three 'by Maersk' service models - Transported by Maersk, Fulfilled by Maersk, and Managed by Maersk - to address this challenge and create much better customer outcomes. Each of the models aim to truly integrate for customers, which means the ability to bring it all together, to organise and optimise, to assume responsibility and deliver accountability. The many supply chain disruptions of the last year have only increased the immediate need for a profound change for even more customers, and the growth proves A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategic intent.\n\nIn 2021, significant progress has been made in improving capabilities and footprint across the Logistics & Services portfolio with a total of six acquisitions and numerous organic investments in capabilities and physical assets. In Transported by Maersk, operational control has been expanded in particular on air with the intended acquisition of Senator International and by expanding capacity in the",

In Fulfilled by Maersk, the global warehousing footprint has grown, and progress is being made on building a global network, replicating the fulfilment capabilities gained through the acquisition of Performance Team in 2020. In 2021, three more acquisitions in this space with Visible, B2C Europe, Huub and the intended acquisition of LF Logistics support the proposition especially for e-commerce customers and respond to growing customer needs within business-toconsumer fulfilment and delivery. In Managed by Maersk, cutting-edge capabilities have been launched to better meet customer needs, especially the Maersk NeoNav supply chain orchestration product. The efforts to close capability gaps via acquisitions as well as investments into organic growth of the footprint will continue.\n\nOcean customers have been buying more and more Logistics & Services products in 2021, and there has been a significant increase in customer satisfaction and a strong willingness to engage on a long-term partnership. These developments prepare A.P. Moller - Maersk to deliver truly integrated logistics to its customers at scale, critically supported by data integration, automation, and complemented with digital products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3. A world-class terminal operator, providing operational excellence\n\nTerminals are a key pillar to a high-quality and more profitable Ocean product through the hubs, as well as an overall value-generating business by itself. Significant progress has been made on the path to a profitable, best-in-class terminal operator pursuing growth opportunities selectively where synergies with Ocean are strongest. The strategy for Terminals consequently has, and continues to be, focused on improving safety, results, customer satisfaction, operational excellence and selective growth.\n\n- \u00b7 Signi/ficant improvement in results with potential to improve further: The improvements are the result of improvement initiatives in the terminals and further supported by realising synergies with the Ocean business.\n- \u00b7 Recognised for the service to all shipping line customers served in a similar way in gateway terminals whilst leveraging the unique relationship with Ocean: Terminal's customer satisfaction measured by Net Promoter Score (NPS) has been on average growing double-digit per year since 2017. Additional services expanding the offering to both shipping lines and shippers are being launched to create value for customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Best in-class operator: Improving operational efficiency, quality and stability is the core component of the strategic direction and the performance improvement seen in Terminals. Fundamental changes to the operating model with standardised ways of working, improvement levers and automation initiatives in a modular approach are driving the improvements while mitigating implementation risks.\n- \u00b7 Selective growth, building on the improvements of the last four years: Focusing on organic growth and investments in existing locations, selecting new investments with synergies with Ocean and Logistics & Services and building on being the best owner in many locations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4. Technology driving business advantage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTechnology enablement is critically important for all value creation elements. It enables creation of new products and services to customers, facilitates a seamless contemporary customer experience end-to-end, enables standardisation and automation of processes, and powers the next levels of operational excellence and efficiency. Technology is thus driving business advantage across all elements.\n\nThe acceleration of technological capabilities is boosting A.P. Moller - Maersk's solution offering within integrated logistics, and it is further enabling high-level of automation, improved operational safety and cost savings across the back-end processes for all its businesses. Over the last years, A.P. Moller - Maersk's digital transformation is enabling a standardised, technology-enabled, process-led, and data-driven foundation, essentially redefining how A.P. Moller - Maersk serves its customers and how it operates within. The three main components of this digital transformation have been:",

Its products and services serve commercial and residential customers in more than 100 countries via 10 production facilities, 20+ logistics centres and 30+ service centres globally.\n\nOne of the factories is located in Chuzhou, China. Due to its hinterland location 500600km from the nearest port in Shanghai or Ningbo, the company has been facing more severe container shortage caused by the pandemic than others in coastal locations. Jinko Solar's supply chain has been further disrupted as transportation costs are higher and there is a shortage of long-haul trucking capacity between loading port and factory. As a result, storage of finished products at the factory site has become an issue, especially when production grew 30% year-on-year in 2021 and is expected to continue at similar pace for the next three years. The disruptions and challenges have caused instability, inefficiency and extra costs across the company's supply chain, calling for integrated solutions.\n\n'We are very pleased to expand our  strategic\n\ncooperation with A.P. Moller - Maersk, and deepen our resources to jointly develop flexible and convenient solutions.'\n\nMr. Kangping Chen, CEO of Jinko Solar Co., Ltd\n\n'In Jinko Solar, we have a great partner where priorities align well. Supply chains require a strong focus on resilience, flexibility and reducing exposure to local and global disruptions, where operational excellence and innovation represent the backbone for us,' said Manuel Olberding, Global Head of Technology Vertical at Maersk.\n\nTo ease its customer's headaches at origin, Maersk conducted a study for setting up a CFS facility (Container Freight Station) to relieve the storage pressure and increase the turnover of container equipment. The study identified Nanjing as the ideal location to set up the CFS facility, catering for the demands of the Chuzhou factory for lower storage costs and shorter distance to factory, while enabling expandable space from 2,700 to 6,000 sqm by Q1 2022. The domestic transportation route was also optimised by using a barge from Nanjing to Ningbo on consideration of lower costs, lower carbon emissions and better container availability.",

A.P. Moller - Maersk provided a professional customs house brokerage service with VAT deferment and delivered a cross-dock facility, enabling a change to flatbed truck for final delivery that matched the requirements of both Jinko Solar and consignees.\n\n## Stability restored\n\nSince the implementation of these initiatives, Jinko Solar's production has been stabilised and conducted according to plan without disruption, as the increasing volume of finished goods can be sent to the CFS facility right after production. With higher flexibility for empty container pick-up, the shipping time was reduced from 14 days to seven by shipping the empty containers via domestic barge. Also, cargo flow was stabilised due to better equipment availability to Nanjing, ensuring the right cargo to be shipped out at the right time.\n\n'As an international container shipping company with integrated logistics capabilities, A.P. Moller - Maersk has been an important strategic partner for Jinko Solar since 2017. We are very pleased to expand our strategic cooperation with A.P. Moller - Maersk, and deepen our resources to jointly develop flexible and\n\nconvenient solutions to manage the current shortage of containers due to the pandemic and improve transport efficiency,' said Mr. Kangping Chen, CEO of Jinko Solar, and continued: 'As the world's leading, integrated module manufacturer, we remain optimistic about the growth in demand for solar energy and expect increasing shipment capacity will provide strong support for our global shipment growth over the next few years. By leveraging our mature global customer marketing system, together with A.P. Moller - Maersk's extensive network of end-to-end integrated transportation and logistics expertise, we believe that we will be able to share more timely information and provide long-term premium logistics solutions to our global customers.'\n\nThrough supply chain optimisation, logistics costs decreased by 30%, and carbon emissions dropped 67% for origin transportation. Both numbers indicate that Jinko Solar has managed to run an integrated, end-to-end logistics solution from the factory in China to project sites across Europe with high efficiency in difficult conditions.\n\n'Our team takes tremendous efforts every day to provide Jinko Solar with dynamic and sustainable supply chain solutions as a modern logistics company. We look forward to continuing and further expanding with Jinko Solar on this journey,' added Manuel Olberding.",

In this climate, A.P. Moller - Maersk continued to be guided by the priorities to care for colleagues, support and deliver value to customers, and help society recover, and the company launched accelerated targets and took substantial action towards the goal of decarbonising logistics by 2040.\n\nWhile the global economy began to show evidence of recovery, 2021 was also the year when the vast majority of governments, industry, and civil society stakeholders came together in unprecedented agreement that the global community is operating on a strictly  limited greenhouse gas budget and cannot wait until 2030 to take action to reach a net zero world by mid-century. The decade of action has begun.\n\nFor full reporting on ESG strategy and performance. SEE THE 2021 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has a decade-long tradition of working with sustainability based on the company's Core Values, customer and broader stakeholder engagement, regulatory and voluntary commitments to global standards and an aspiration to create positive impact while integrating responsibility for sustainability programmes and targets into the business.\n\nBuilding on that strength, in 2021, A.P. Moller - Maersk reframed its sustainability work into a comprehensive strategy for Environment, Social and Governance (ESG), core to the purpose of the company and an integral part of and prerequisite for the success of the Global Integrator strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moller - Maersk's ESG strategy highlights three core commitments:\n\n- \u00b7 We will take leadership in the decarbonisation of logistics\n- \u00b7 We will ensure that our people thrive at work by providing a safe and inspiring workplace\n- \u00b7 We operate based on responsible business practices.\n\nEach of these commitments are supported by a set of strategic targets, and A.P. Moller - Maersk will be linking executive remuneration to the ESG performance from 2023.\n\nThe strategy overall is structured in 14 categories covering all material responsibilities, risks and opportunities across the environment, social and governance dimensions. These categories are the foundation of A.P. Moller - Maersk's ESG work, and the company reports on progress across all the categories in the Annual Sustainability Report.\n\n## Climate change: A new vision to deliver net zero by 2040\n\nA climate emergency demands an emergency response, and A.P. Moller - Maersk has set new, bold and aggressive targets to decarbonise logistics. This matches what two thirds of the company's largest customers demand, as they themselves have set Paris-aligned\n\nscience-based targets including scope 3 emissions, which implies their supply chains must be decarbonised. This year saw further acceleration of the customer demand for decarbonised shipping as witnessed for example in the establish ment of the cargo owners for Zero Emissions Vessels (coZEV) platform, committing to using only decarbonised freight by 2040, and in the volume growth of the Maersk ECO Delivery shipping product, which tripled during 2021.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk remains committed to having its decarbonisation targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and will take the required steps to ensure alignment when the methodology for the shipping sector is finalised.\n\n## Accelerating the pathway to Ocean decarbonisation\n\nThe bulk of A.P. Moller - Maersk's direct emissions comes from the operation of its vessels, and it remains core to the company's decarbonisation journey to define and execute pathways towards climate neutrality in terms of its fleet and the fuels on which they operate. In 2021 and early 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk made a series of announcements accelerating on the company's decarbonisation milestones, including the order for 12 large ocean-going container vessels capable of being operated on green methanol, to be delivered in 2024 and 2025. Green is defined as fuels or energy that have low or very low greenhouse gas emissions on a life cycle basis. Read more in the Ocean segment. SEE PAGE 47",

        "page_content": "Finding the fuels of the future is a comprehensive task. A.P. Moller - Maersk is not pursuing one single solution but exploring several pathways and expects a mix of different green fuels to exist alongside each other, giving shipowners in the future a choice based on, e.g., ship types, operational and geographical requirements.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk continues to pursue CO/uni2082 emissions reductions in its current fleet. Due to supply chain congestion challenges the company unfortunately saw reduced efficiency in 2021, with an increase in EEOI by 6.9%. A.P. Moller - Maersk's new Ocean target is a 50% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions intensity from a 2020 baseline, in line with a 1.5-degree pathway. This corresponds to a 72% reduction from a 2008 baseline, making the new 2030 target considerably more ambitious than the previous 60% reduction target.\n\n## Green solutions for customers\n\nMaersk ECO Delivery is an ocean transport customer offering that uses low- carbon and sustainable fuels, instead of conventional fossil fuels. Since its launch in 2019, Maersk ECO Delivery's customer demand has grown more than 170% year on year. A.P. Moller - Maersk expects the significant growth of this solution to continue in the coming years, and the company has set targets to expand green offerings to comprise ECO Delivery solutions for land and air transport solutions as well.\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024-2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNet zero ambition launched\n\nECO Delivery introduced\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvestment in 13 green methanol vessels\n\nNew decarbonisation vision and accelerated commitments\n\nWorld's first container ship in operation on green methanol\n\nTwelve 16,000 TEU vessels capable of operating on green methanol\n\nNet zero across our business and 100% green solutions to customers\n\nRead more about the roadmap for decarbonising the Logistics & Services business.

This is the most ambitious target set by any terminal operator to date. Planned activities include energy optimisation programmes as well as collaborations with suppliers and partners, among other things on co-developing wind and solar farms and other sources of green energy supply. Read more in the Terminals segment. SEE PAGE 60\n\n## The use of Natural Climate Solutions\n\nIncluded in the roadmap to reach A.P. Moller - Maersk's new targets for 2040 is the use of Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) to increase the company's impact over and beyond what can be achieved with direct emission reductions. A.P. Moller - Maersk follows strict principles for the use of NCS, including in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 NCS will not be used to reach science-based targets with the exception of the use of carbon removal (referred to as neutralisation) to neutralise residual emissions in the 2040 net zero year in accordance with the net zero criteria of the Science Based Targets initiative\n- \u00b7 The green products offered to customers will not be based on use of NCS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2030\n\n2040\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Aligned with a Science Based Targets initiative 1.5-degree pathway\n- \u00b7 Industry-leading green customer offerings across the supply chain\n\n## OUR COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS TO DECARBONISE THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS IN TIME AND TO SOCIETY TO ACT AND DRIVE IMPACT IN THIS DECADE\n\n2030: Industry-leading green customer offerings across the supply chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2030: Aligned with a Science Based Targets\n\ninitiative 1.5\u00b0C pathway\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2040: Net zero emissions across the business and 100% green solutions to customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPriority future\n\nfuels defined\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Human capital\n\nTo succeed in the transformation of A.P. Moller - Maersk to a provider of end-to-end, digitally enabled and sustainable logistics solutions, the company must attract and retain talented colleagues at all levels. A.P. Moller - Maersk's new People Strategy builds on past strengths while focusing on new capability areas needed for successful strategy execution. The company's key ambition is to nurture a knowledge-driven organisation, capable of executing reliably, and made effective by the power of empathy.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk will monitor progress on human capital management by using the score in the employee survey conducted bi-annually as a leading indicator, with the aim of reaching top quartile scores for engagement by 2025.\n\n## Safety and security\n\nIn the area of safety and security, A.P. Moller - Maersk's commitment is to ensure that everyone gets home safe by preventing fatal and life-altering incidents.\n\nIt is with extreme regret that the company saw four people lose their lives while on active duty for A.P. Moller - Maersk in 2021. Follow-up and mitigating actions are done for each of these tragic events, and the company will continue to push leader engagement, process design and behavioural motivation aimed at having a fatality free workplace.\n\nEfforts to protect the health of all employees from the COVID-19 virus persist. A.P. Moller - Maersk has invested in safe seafarer crew changes and commutes, and this challenge is under control. Given the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, getting as many employees as possible fully vaccinated is the best way to continue protecting colleagues while also supporting customers and helping society by keeping supply chains running. A.P. Moller - Maersk has supported the operation of vaccine camps, especially in locations with poor vaccine access. More than 10,000 Maersk seafarers were vaccinated by year-end, and nearly 100% of all on-signing crew are now vaccinated.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk wants safety to be embedded into the fabric of the business, and to ensure the presence of the capacity to manage risks under variable conditions. This must be enacted through leadership that engages with front-line employees and provides the support needed to make safe operations easier.\n\nThe strategic targets set to drive and track progress are to have 100% of High Potential Incidents trigger frontline Learning Teams follow-up to enable leaders and the frontline teams to learn from and prevent similar incidents in the future, and that the company's Top 900 global leadership is upskilled in A.P. Moller - Maersk's safety and security principles by 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Green finance\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk launched its first Green Finance Framework in November 2021 to align the company's finance strategy with its decarbonisation ambitions.\n\nThe first instrument under the framework was a 10-year, EUR 500m green bond that will support the funding of the first series of green container vessels. The bond received a strong reception from the investor community, as witnessed by it being oversubscribed more than seven times, with a final booking value of EUR 3.7bn, and priced at a coupon rate of 0.75%, the lowest coupon ever for A.P. Moller - Maersk.\n\n## EU taxonomy\n\nThe first EU taxonomy reporting for A.P. Moller - Maersk shows that the company holds the potential to contribute significantly to the green transition, with 94% of revenue, 93% of CAPEX and 90% of OPEX reported as taxonomy-eligible. It is likely that a significantly lower share of activities will comply with the substantial contribution criteria. While A.P. Moller - Maersk therefore expects to report a low share of taxonomy- aligned activities from 2022, there is significant opportunity to increase the alignment as the company progresses on its decarbonisation pathway.

        "page_content": "## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI)\n\nIn 2021, A.P. Moller - Maersk set new targets towards 2025 for the representation of gender at all management levels. The targets are partnered with a gender action plan focused on three main areas: attraction, retention and inclusion, and accountability across functional areas. The target for women on the Board of Directors was met in 2021, where three out of 10 board members were women. The 2021 targets for gender and nationality representation in leadership were not met.\n\nThe company's first global inclusion survey was conducted. This showed that employees experience a strong culture of inclusion, where they feel a sense of belonging. An example of an area of improvement is psychological safety and the future work in this area includes the launch of an anti-discrimination, harassment, violence and bullying policy. The survey also showed a trend towards women and employees, who identified themselves as ethnic minorities, scoring lower across nearly every dimension compared to other groups. Results indicate that management commitment to DEI positively impacts the employee experience. This confirmed that future work should focus on leadership accountability and capability building as well as introducing the concept of equity into the work.\n\n## Responsible ship recycling programme continues\n\nOver the past five years, A.P. Moller - Maersk has recycled 16 vessels in six yards in Alang, India. Playing the role of a catalyst, the company's engagement in the area has driven a transformational change in the Alang ship recycling industry. In 2021, A.P. Moller - Maersk placed two vessels for recycling with yards in Alang, and completed recycling of three vessels that were placed in Alang in 2020. The company continued its established audit regime, consistently registering excellent results in the third party audits of performance against A.P. Moller - Maersk's Responsible Ship Recycling Standard. Results are reported on in detail in the annual Sustainability Report. A.P. Moller - Maersk is expanding its focus on responsible ship recycling to encompass the pursuit of responsible ship recycling opportunities globally for vessels of all sizes, and including the greenhouse gas impacts of ship recycling as part of the company's societal commitment and decarbonisation leadership role.\n\n## Operating based on responsible business practices\n\n## Business ethics\n\nHigh standards of business ethics are a foundation for operating the company's global business activities responsibly. A.P. Moller - Maersk will report performance on business ethics towards the target of ensuring that all employees are trained in the Maersk Code of Conduct by end 2023.\n\nWithin business ethics, corruption risks are critical to manage. These are present in the Ocean business primarily in the form of facilitation payments in interactions with authorities in ports and at border controls. For terminals, the risk is related mostly to negotiations with governments on concessions or other agreements. Risks in landside operations are typically also related to facilitation payments. The risk of corruption in the company's supply chain is managed through the Sustainable Procurement programme. As an element in A.P. Moller - Maersk's commitment to facilitate trade responsibly, systems are in place to enforce export controls and sanctions, and transaction spot checks are carried out on an ongoing basis.\n\nIn 2021, the regulatory compliance programme was reviewed, and mitigating actions tested for effectiveness. This included an expanded internal controls framework to build a better understanding and create awareness of business ethics risks in A.P. Moller - Maersk's operations. This framework was piloted in the terminals business.\n\n## Data ethics\n\nThe responsible use of data is a critical enabler for A.P. Moller - Maersk's business model. To avoid abuse and privacy infringement issues, and to safeguard the company from legal, business and reputational risks, it is vital to manage and control the storage and use of customers' and employees' data ethically and proactively.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk aspires to show leadership in the ability to ethically manage and use data, with customers trusting that the company uses their data appropriately. In line with regulatory requirements, A.P. Moller - Maersk established a data ethics policy in 2021, with accompanying governance measures, including a target of 100% of employees trained on data ethics by 2023.",

Finally, emerging risks to the company's longer-term value drivers are identified through an externally facilitated workshop with executives. The risks identified are then consolidated into an enterprise-wide risk landscape and validated for relevance and significance by the Risk & Compliance Committee. After final consolidation, the risk landscape is reviewed by the Executive Leadership Team, who determine the key risks for the company and the emerging risks that warrant detailed analysis to understand their potential impact. These risks are then submitted to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n## Managing A.P. Moller - Maersk's risks\n\nEach key risk is assigned an executive owner who is accountable for the management of the risks, including confirmation that adequate controls are in place and that the necessary action plans are implemented to bring or keep the key risk within acceptable levels, if not already the case. To provide adequate oversight, key risk developments and mitigation progress are monitored and reported on throughout the year. Quarterly in-dept reviews of the status of the key risks and their mitigation are conducted in the management teams and various oversight fora such as the Risk & Compliance Committee and the quarterly performance reviews. In addition, the Audit Committee conducts deep dive sessions with executive risk owner throughout the year on selected key risks. Figure 1 presents an overview of A.P. Moller - Maersk's process and governance structures, including the Risk & Compliance Committee and Audit Committee/Board of Directors.\n\n## Figure /one.tf\n\n## Overview of governance structure\n\n## Board of Directors/Audit Committee\n\nProvides oversight over ERM effectiveness\n\n## Risk and Compliance Committee\n\n- -   Review key and emerging risks -   Review  effectiveness of ERM across\n- A.P.

This, compounded with ever-increasing external threat capabilities, puts more pressure on systems to be cyber threat resilient. A cyber-attack could lead to severe operational disruption and/or data breaches.\n\n## What is this risk\n\nAdded capacity from planned new ship buildings and normalisation of the existing supply-demand imbalance due to expected easing of supply chain congestion could lead to a rapid collapse in Ocean freight rates.\n\n## Process standardisation & technology roadmap\n\n## What is this risk\n\nA serious delay or failure to standardise core endto-end business processes and execute the technology roadmap to achieve A.P. Moller - Maersk's growth vision as an end-to-end integrator of global logistics.\n\n## What is this risk\n\nThe success of A.P. Moller - Maersk's integrator strategy depends on customers' trust and confidence in A.P. Moller - Maersk to fulfil their endto-end supply chain needs through superior and consistent service levels.

        "page_content": "## Looking beyond the planning period\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk looks beyond the business planning horizon and assesses emerging risks in a 5-15 years' perspective. This is to spot threats or opportunities to the long-term value drivers in a timely manner. An emerging risk radar is established based on prevailing megatrends seen through different lenses (figure 3). One or two emerging risks are then selected for analysis to better understand their potential implications for the logistics industry and for A.P. Moller - Maersk. For 2022 three emerging risks that could potentially impact the company in the longer term were selected for focus. Climate change was selected for a detailed analysis, the outcome of which will drive articulation and implementation of mitigating strategies.\n\n## 1. Climate change\n\nThe physical impacts of climate change may affect A.P. Moller - Maersk's land-based assets and operations and the supply chains it operates. A.P. Moller - Maersk is conducting an in-depth analysis to understand and manage the risks from the physical effects of climate change. As underscored by the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, August 2021, the risks are real, and there is a need for a detailed analysis of their potential impact on A.P. Moller - Maersk. The analysis includes assessment of climate scenarios and their impact on company's operations in relevant locations, i.e. the land-based assets, the extended infrastructure on which the company depends and the vessel operations. Further studies are planned to examine the impact of climate change on the supply chains it operates. Besides addressing the need to understand the impact of the physical effects of climate change on the business, the study will also enable A.P. Moller - Maersk to expand and enhance the disclosure on climate related risks and opportunities in line with Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.\n\n## 2. Slow adaptation to technology-enabled simple supply chain models\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's integrator strategy depends on customers demanding simplified supply chain models. A lagging adoption of technology-enabled simple solutions could make the strategy irrelevant. Supply chains today are characterised by series of complex processes. Increased globalisation and shifting consumers demand add further complexities to supply chains. In response to these complexities, companies have started to adopt and utilise advanced technologies to transform and simplify their supply chains and enhance the customer experience. A.P. Moller - Maersk is advancing its strategy to digitise the customer interface and product offerings. However, if A.P. Moller - Maersk does not move fast and remain ahead of its peers in developing solutions aligned with its integrator strategy and customer demands, A.P. Moller - Maersk may not be able to provide superior value propositions to its customers.\n\n## 3. Change in trade patterns\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk business model is global and dependent on the global economy and international trade. Consequently, fundamental changes in trade patterns could expose the current business model to risk. COVID-19 has led companies to revisit their supply chain models and evaluate alternative models to meet customer needs through more resilience and diversification (e.g. dual sourcing, near shoring etc.). Customer behaviours are also changing with an increased push for climate and social goals and opportunities arising from technology potentially leading to avoidance of long-haul transportation and manufacturing closer to market. Further, rising nationalism, populism, and protectionism (e.g. USA/China decoupling) could imply a retreat from globalisation towards an increased regionalisation of trade patterns.\n\nEmerging risks radar\n\nFigure /three.tf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Emerging risks\n\n- 1.

Moller - Maersk remains focused on protecting employees, supporting customers and contributing to societies by keeping goods flowing.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, regional and local leaders across the company have since early in the pandemic been empowered to set up the necessary protective measures across offices and onshore frontline facilities and a globally coordinated approach has been taken to keep vessels and ocean network operational. A central cross-functional COVID Coordination Team has provided strategic oversight, continuously evaluating risks and opportunities and providing leaders with updated information, guidance, tools and resources.\n\nThis approach has enabled A.P. Moller - Maersk to minimise infections and largely maintain business continuity throughout 2021 despite recurring global infection waves and constant change of local regulations and requirements.\n\nAll employees are kept closely informed about the evolving protective measures at their locations and are provided with appropriate instructions on safety protocols and personal protective equipment (PPE). Where relevant, vaccination drives are facilitated, not least for seafarers whose ability to safely travel to and from vessels may be affected by their vaccination status. Office employees have worked from home for large parts of the year, and business travel was restricted for most of 2021. Through effective communication, processes, systems and steadfast resolve from leaders, employees have been able to continue to work effectively to support customers and achieve business objectives.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has sadly lost more than 90 colleagues to COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. The company has set up a relief fund to support the families of those employees who have fallen seriously ill or lost their life due to the virus.\n\nLooking ahead to 2022, the COVID-19 situation across the globe is expected to continue to evolve, as seen with the newest variant of concern Omicron which is spreading at an alarming rate and has been detected in almost all countries worldwide. Operating conditions for A.P. Moller - Maersk vessels and seafarers will also continue to require special attention in the year ahead due to varying restrictions to crew change globally and this serious issue continues to be addressed through collaboration with governments and port authorities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Terminals & Towage, revenue increased by USD 908m, driven by high global demand and increased storage income due to the continued congestion and bottlenecks along all modes of freight transportation in North America.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC), last twelve months, increased to 45.3% (9.4%)\n\n- \u00b7 EBITDA increased by USD 15.8bn to USD 24.0bn (USD 8.2bn) with increases in all segments, primarily in Ocean by USD 14.9bn due to increasing freight rates and to a lesser extent higher volumes. This was caused by the current increased demand combined with bottlenecks and congestions across global supply chains. The impact from increasing freight rates was partially offset by higher bunker consumption at a higher average bunker price and increasing handling and network costs. Logistics & Services delivered a strong increase of USD 453m, due to the higher revenue, and in gateway terminals, the increase of USD 466m was a result of the increase in volume and higher storage income.\n- \u00b7 EBIT increased by USD 15.5bn to USD 19.7bn (USD 4.2bn), positively impacted by the improved EBITDA, partly offset by higher amortisation on vessel charters.\n- \u00b7 Return on invested capital (ROIC) , last twelve months, increased to 45.3% (9.4%), as earnings improved significantly.\n- \u00b7 Financial items, net , amounted to USD 944m (USD 879m), positively impacted by lower gross debt, but more than offset by costs from early repayment of borrowings, interest on tax liabilities, and negative foreign exchange rate impacts.\n- \u00b7 Tax increased to USD 697m (USD 407m), primarily due to improved financial performance.\n- \u00b7 Net profit was USD 18.0bn (USD 2.9bn), due to significant improvement in operating earnings.\n- \u00b7 The underlying net profit after financial items and tax was USD 18.2bn (USD 3.0bn), due to the improved operational performance.\n- \u00b7 Cash flow from operating activities was USD 22.0bn (USD 7.8bn), positively impacted by EBITDA of USD 24.0bn, offset by a negative change in net working capital of USD 1.6bn and tax paid of USD 582m, leading to a cash conversion of 92% (95%).\n- \u00b7 Gross capital expenditure (CAPEX) was USD 3.0bn (USD 1.3bn), mainly driven by higher investments in Ocean and Logistics & Services.",

Payment is expected to take place on 18 March 2022.\n\n## Share buy-back\n\nIn November 2020, the Board of Directors of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S announced a share buy-back programme of up to DKK 10bn (around USD 1.6bn). The first phase of the programme of DKK 3.3bn (around USD 500m) was concluded on 29 April 2021. The Board of Directors decided to accelerate the programme with the remaining part of the programme of DKK 6.7bn (around USD 1.1bn) being exercised in one phase running from mid-May. The programme was ended on 24 September 2021.\n\nThe Board of Directors further decided in May 2021, under the authority given at the Annual General Meeting in March 2021, to commit to a new share buy-back programme of up to USD 5bn (around DKK 32bn) to be executed over a period of two years. The programme was initiated in November 2021.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors has decided to extend the share buy-back programme by an additional USD 5bn (around DKK 32bn) over the years 2024 and 2025, subject to the corresponding mandate of the Annual General Meeting. In total, from November 2021 to 2025, A.P. Moller - Maersk has committed itself to share buy-backs of up to USD 10bn.\n\nDuring 2021, A.P. Moller - Maersk bought back 132,504 A shares and 529,976 B shares, worth DKK 11bn (around USD 1.8m) excluding shares bought back for the long-term incentive plan. On 31 December 2021, A.P.

Moller - Maersk will have a strong first half year, and the assumption that normalisation in Ocean occurs early in the second half of the year.\n\nBased on these assumptions, A.P. Moller - Maersk expects for full year 2022 an underlying EBITDA of around USD 24bn, an underlying EBIT of around USD 19bn and a free cash flow (FCF) above USD 15bn.\n\nOcean is expected to grow in line with the global container demand of 2-4% in 2022, subject to high uncertainties related to the current congestion, network disruptions and demand patterns.\n\nFor 2022-2023, the expectation for the accumulated CAPEX is USD 9.0-10.0bn driven by intensified growth in Logistics & Services and ESG investments.

Business was considerably impacted by congestion and network disruptions, which continue to put pressure on global supply chains, but also resulted in higher operational costs. Multiple measures have been taken to support demand and alleviate congestion impacts on customers with additional capacity of 6.4% added during 2021, resulting in an increase in loaded volumes of 3.6% compared to 2020. Average loaded rates increased across both long-term contracts and short-term rates due to strong demand that had to be moved through the supply chain bottlenecks. Unit cost at fixed bunker increased by 6.5%, mainly driven by higher network costs and container handling costs. Utilisation remained high at 94.5%, and while schedule reliability is still above the industry average, it was challenged by numerous congestions such as at the Suez Canal, in the ports of Ningbo, China, in Los Angeles, USA, at Felixstowe, UK, and by the inland bottlenecks particularly in the USA.

Moller - Maersk continued to focus on supporting contract customers' supply chains by alleviating bottlenecks through investing in additional equipment and increasing the capacity allocated to contracted volumes.\n\nDigitalisation of the product offering continues with increased traction for Maersk Spot and Maersk Twill. Maersk Spot has reached a 47% (36%) conversion across all brands, and Maersk Twill has delivered over 200k FFE during 2021, implying growth of a factor four versus the level in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRevenue\n\nEBIT\n\nRevenue\n\nEBIT\n\nRevenue\n\nEBIT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Logistics & Services\n\nUSD 9,830m +2,867m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUSD 623m +359m\n\nThe financial results improved significantly, driven by strong revenue growth and margin improvements. The growth momentum was both organic, driven by customer wins and cross-selling to Ocean customers, and through acquisitions where portfolio capability gaps have been closed. Revenue from top 200 Ocean customers increased by USD 1.5bn and drove 62% of the organic revenue increase, while inorganically, the offerings continued being strengthened through acquisitions in 2021. The growth confirms the progress of Logistics & Services as an expanded partnership to customers in their supply chain and as a key player in helping customers overcome the global network disruptions.\n\nThe integration of the acquisitions done during 2020 is progressing according to plan. In 2021, an array of acquisitions within the e-commerce space continue to strengthen the offering of end-to-end solutions, while the service offerings within air freight, warehousing and inland transportation, amongst other, are being improved through announced intended acquisitions expected to be closed in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther to the acquisition of Senator International, three additional B767 were leased and two new B777 airplanes were ordered to serve broader customer needs.\n\nContract Logistics continues to expand as 85 new warehouses were opened in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Terminals & Towage\n\nUSD 4,715m +908m\n\nUSD 1,294m +466m\n\nTerminals & Towage reported an increased revenue of USD 4.7bn (USD 3.8bn) with an increased EBIT of USD 1.3bn (USD 828m). In gateway terminals, revenue increased to USD 4.0bn (USD 3.2bn), supported by recovery in global demand and an underlying performance improvement across most terminals in the Americas. Overall terminal volume grew by 11%, with Asia and North America leading the way. Utilisation grew significantly to 77% (70%). Continued congestion in the supply chain in the USA and increasing rates and higher sale of yard services in Latin America contributed to growth in revenue per move of 13%. Additional congestion-related costs were largely offset by efficiencies, thus cost per move only increased by 4.1%, driving up overall margins by more than 5 percentage points.\n\nThe EBITDA improvement for Terminals was positively impacted by additional congestion-related income amounting to approximately USD 250m, with the remaining improvement coming from underlying improvements in the portfolio. The results from joint ventures and associated companies of USD 297m (USD 216m) supported the increase in EBIT to 1.2bn (USD 687m).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA strengthened portfolio winning new concessions, extending concessions in existing terminals, and the sale of assets not fitting the strategic direction.\n\nSignificant efforts to ease congestion in the USA through extended opening hours and improved gate turnaround time.

As a result, the EBIT margin increased to 37.2% (11.0%).\n\nVolumes were 3.6% higher at 13,089k FFE (12,634k FFE) and were supported by strong demand coupled with increased capacity. Last year volumes were impacted by the initial COVID-19 lockdown challenges in Q2. In comparison, volumes were 1.6% lower than 2019 (13,296k FFE). East-West volumes increased by 3.4% despite the congestion challenges at the port of Long Beach, Los Angeles, USA, and Felixstowe, UK. The increase is mainly due to headhaul exports from Asia, offset by lower backhaul exports from Europe. North-South increased by 1.9%, driven by headhaul exports out of Asia and West Africa regions, offsetting the backhaul decrease. Headhaul trades increased by 6.2%. Intra-regional increased by 6.4%.\n\n## Loaded volumes\n\n| FFE ('/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf)   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf                      | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                  |

driven by strong demand combined with bottlenecks and congestions driving rate increases. On East-West trades, freight rates increased by 70%, mainly due to strong demand, vessel and equipment shortages and bottlenecks across the supply chain. The main increases were driven by Asian and European headhaul trades. On North-South trades the average freight rates increased by",

The average loaded freight rate at fixed bunker increased by 59%. The average loaded freight rate was positively affected by the development in foreign exchange rates.\n\nFreight revenue was USD 42.4bn (USD 24.9bn) and other revenue increased to USD 5.9bn (USD 4.3bn). Adjusted for the foreign exchange rate effects, the freight revenue increased by 69%.\n\nTotal operating costs increased by 17% to USD 26.8bn (USD 22.9bn), impacted by higher bunker price and container handling costs from operational congestion and bottlenecks. Over the year, the bun-\n\nker price increased by 30% to an average of USD 484/tonne (USD 372/tonne) as the global economy recovered from COVID-19. Container handling costs increased to USD 9.8bn, mainly due to higher terminal costs and empty costs. Network costs excluding bunker costs increased by 8.5%, mainly due to higher capacity, with an increased inflationary pressure on time charter equivalent cost. There was a negative impact from development in foreign exchange rates, and after adjusting for this, the operating costs increased by 16%.\n\nTotal unit cost increased by 12% to 2,130 USD/FFE (1,909 USD/FFE), driven by an increase in fuel cost caused by 30% higher average bunker price equal to 484 USD/ tonne due to higher consumption and vessel speed in response to low schedule reliability. Consequently, bunker efficiency decreased to 41.4 g/TEU*NM (40.9 g/ TEU*NM) compared to 2020.\n\nUnit cost at fixed bunker increased by 6.5% to 2,102 USD/FFE (1,973 USD/FFE), driven by increase in terminal costs and network costs with TCE costs higher by 20%, whilst the duration of contracts has increased. Adjusting for the negative impact from the developments in foreign exchange rates, the unit cost at fixed bunker increased by 5.5%.\n\nThe average capacity of 4,171k TEU increased by 2.2%. There were nine vessels in the newbuilding programme at the end of 2021, and currently thirteen at Q1 2022. The fleet consisted of 311 owned and 427 chartered vessels, of which 53k TEU or 1.3% of the fleet were idle (10 vessels), mainly due to repairs.\n\n## Fleet overview\n\n0 - 4,699 TEU\n\n4,700 - 7,999 TEU\n\n8,000 - 14,999 TEU\n\n- > 15,000 TEU\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fleet overview, year-end\n\n'/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf\n\n|                                                                                                   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Own container vessels                                                                             |                                            |                                           |\n| /zero.tf - /four.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf TEU                                           | /four.tf/six.tf/eight.tf                   | /four.tf/seven.tf/two.tf                  |\n| /four.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf - /seven.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf TEU       | /two.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf                   | /three.tf/one.tf/one.tf                   |\n| /eight.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf - /one.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf TEU | /seven.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf                 | /five.tf/three.tf/one.tf                  |\n| > /one.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf TEU                                            | /nine.tf/zero.tf/three.tf                  | /eight.tf/eight.tf/five.tf                |\n| Total                                                                                             | /two.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/six.tf/eight.tf  | /two.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf   |\n| Chartered container vessels                                                                       |                                            |                                           |\n| /zero.tf - /four.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf TEU                                           | /seven.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf                | /seven.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                 |\n| /four.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf - /seven.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf TEU       | /four.tf/nine.tf/four.tf                   | /four.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf                 |\n| /eight.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf - /one.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf TEU | /six.tf/six.tf/six.tf                      | /seven.tf/three.tf/eight.tf               |\n| > /one.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf TEU                                            | /zero.tf                                   | /zero.tf                                  |\n| Total                                                                                             | /one.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/three.tf/seven.tf | /one.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/four.tf/six.tf  |\n| Total fleet                                                                                       | /four.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/zero.tf/five.tf | /four.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/four.tf/five.tf |\n\nChartered",

        "page_content": "## Decarbonising  shipping with groundbreaking vessels and fuels\n\nIn February 2021, A.P. Moller - Maersk announced an order for the world's first vessel with a dual fuel engine configuration capable of running on green methanol, i.e., low or very low greenhouse gas emissions on a life cycle basis.\n\nThe ~2,000 TEU (Twenty Foot Equivalent) feeder vessel will be deployed in 2023 and will provide valuable bunkering, operating and safety experience for future dual-fuel vessels from its voyages in the Europe network.\n\n## Industry-first vessels in operation from 2024\n\nIn August 2021, A.P. Moller - Maersk further accelerated its decarbonisation efforts with the order of eight large vessels of ~16,000 TEU that will also be capable of running on green methanol. In January 2022, this was followed up with the announcement that A.P. Moller - Maersk has declared its options with Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) for four additional vessels to be delivered in 2025. These industry-first ground-breaking new vessels will allow A.P. Moller - Maersk to offer customers green transportation at scale on ocean trades. The advanced vessels will be designed to have a flexible operational profile, enabling them to  perform efficiently across many trades and accommodate diverse customer needs.\n\nThe first vessel is scheduled to be deployed in Q1 2024 and the full series of 12 vessels is expected to save around 1.5 million tonnes of annual greenhouse gas emissions, corresponding to 4.5% of the fleet emissions in 2020.\n\n## Green fuels needed at scale\n\nSourcing adequate amounts of green fuel for the new vessels starting on day one will be a challenge as it requires a significant ramp up of production capa city. Global, green methanol production is currently at 30,000 tonnes, and 450,000 tonnes will be needed annually by Maersk just to operate the first series of vessels.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has engaged in developing this market through dialogues with potential green methanol producers in 2021 and will continue to do so. In August, A.P. Moller - Maersk identified REintegrate as its partner to provide sustainably produced fuel for its 2,000 TEU methanol-capable feeder vessel. REintegrate is a green e-methanol producer and subsidiary of the Danish renewable energy company European Energy.\n\nThe energy needed for the power-to-methanol production will be provided by a solar farm in Kass\u00f8, Denmark, where REintegrate and European Energy will establish a new facility to produce the approximately 10,000 tonnes of e-methanol that A.P. Moller - Maersk's first vessel capable of sailing on green fuels will consume annually.\n\nThe hope is that this partnership will serve as a blueprint for scaling green fuel production through collaboration with partners across the industry ecosystem.\n\n## Venturing towards green solutions\n\nMaersk Growth, the company's venture capital arm, made minority investments in three start-up companies that typify the innovation needed to develop cost- competitive sustainable fuels:\n\n- \u00b7 Prometheus Fuels: direct air capture-technology that combines renewable energy, water, and air into cost efficient, green electro-fuels\n- \u00b7 WasteFuel: turning unrecoverable agricultural and municipal waste into sustainable aviation fuel, green bio-methanol, and renewable natural gas\n- \u00b7 Vertoro: developing liquid lignin technology, from sustainably sourced forestry and agricultural residues, which can be used as a marine fuel.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Key initiatives 2021\n\nThe focus in 2021 was to support customers and to offer contract customers additional flexibility and space to help alleviate volatility in their supply chains and the impact on their businesses. As a result, increasing capacity and additional equipment was deployed throughout the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contract products\n\nOcean introduced new differentiated contract value propositions, like block space and unlimited contracts, to address the specific needs of different customer supply chains. With new contract products, customers have the choice of selecting the product that suits their specific supply chain needs. Contract products offer features such as volume flexibility and absolute reliability on shipment level.\n\nThrough this, the share of business from contract customers has increased, as have contract validity. Contract Products volumes have continuously increased during 2021 and a total of 1.5m FFE have been signed on multi- year contracts by the end of the year.\n\n## Spot and Twill - product digitalisation\n\nMaersk Spot , launched in 2019 offering transparent prices and loading guarantee, continued to gain significant growth in 2021. Maersk Spot has reached a 47% (36%) conversion across all brands. It remains a critical product for freight forwarder customers, and Ocean will continue to expand scope across brands and keep adding features to attract more customers.\n\nTwill is the end-to-end digital product designed for small customers without in-house logistic capabilities. It has continued to gain momentum and has an average volume of above 4,700 FFE per week in 2021, up from an average of 1,173 FFE per week in 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expanding the offering of Maersk ECO delivery\n\nMaersk ECO Delivery is an Ocean transport customer offering that uses low-carbon and sustainable fuels. During 2021, this solution has helped A.P. Moller - Maersk take a big step towards the company's decarbonisation ambitions and has proved that a sustainable supply chain is possible. Since its start in 2019, Maersk ECO Delivery's customer demand has grown more than 170% year-on-year, as customers recognise the value of a credible, low investment and flexible carbon reductions initiative to meet growing demands from society and regulators.\n\n## Keeping goods flowing\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has continuously taken steps to provide the services necessary for a smooth global supply chain. Additional capacity of 6.4% was added in 2021 and the number of containers has increased by 13.2% since end of 2019.\n\nWhen ports were too congested, shipments have been rerouted and alternative modes have been used to get shipments to the final destination. This is the case in the USA where East coast port calls were expanded as an alternative to Pacific South-West gateway ports. In UK, vessel calls have been diverted to mainland Europe and then reshipped with shuttle services in smaller controlled quantities. By procuring additional terminal, carrier haulage and off-dock depot capacity, import flows were moved faster out of ocean terminals reducing the pressure on yards. Having integrating assets in the supply chain, including Ocean fleet, ports, warehouses, trucks, and digital platforms has enabled better control and agility to implement solutions to supply chain volatility. Whenever capacity could not be increased, the priority was to protect the commitments towards already contracted customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The increase in EBITA was USD 389m, of which USD 363m was organic. Performance Team and KGH Customs Services were included in the organic growth figures from Q2 and Q3 2021 after being consolidated in April 2020 and September 2020, respectively. Inorganic revenue was USD 472m with the biggest contribution from Performance Team and Visible Supply Chain Management. The inorganic EBITA was USD 26m after subtracting transaction costs for Visible Supply Chain Management and B2C Europe of USD 12m in 2021.\n\nFor the Managed by Maersk services, revenue increased by 56% to USD 1.6bn (USD 1.0bn), driven by a 28% increase in volumes in Lead Logistics to 98,394 kcbm (77,023 kcbm). The increase in volume reflects the effect of a low base in the first three quarters of 2020 due to COVID-19, as well as changing consumer patterns as customers in North America increasingly demanded retail goods, in addition to also winning new business. Further, Customs Services volumes were up by 2,613k declarations to 4,850k declarations (2,236k declarations).\n\nFor the Fulfilled by Maersk services, revenue was up by 59% to USD 2.3bn (USD 1.5bn) driven by the establishment of 85 new warehouses during 2021 and productivity improvement of existing facilities. Revenue was also positively impacted by growing volumes from increasing supply chain needs from customers and a growing footprint. The acquisitions of Visible Supply Chain Management and B2C Europe also contributed to the increase in revenue in Fulfilled by Maersk adding new e-commerce capabilities and last mile delivery.\n\nFor the Transported by Maersk services, revenue was up by 32% to USD 5.9bn (USD 4.5bn), driven by an increase in Landside Transportation Intermodal volumes of 23% to 4,491k FFE (3,640k FFE), mainly due to higher volume coming from ocean cargo and a higher penetration ratio into existing Ocean customers. Intercontinental rail also increased volume by 81% to 30.2k FFE (16.6k FFE), driven by China and Russia rail services. Further, revenue growth was driven by increased air freight forwarding volumes of 26% to 174k tonnes (138k tonnes), including ground handling, primarily coming from Asia Pacific into North America.\n\n## Logistics & Services highlights\n\nUSD million\n\n|                                                                                                          | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf                              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                             |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenue                                                                                                  | /nine.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/three.tf/zero.tf                | /six.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/six.tf/three.tf                   |\n| Direct costs (third party cost)                                                                          | /seven.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/nine.tf/six.tf                 | /five.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/two.tf/eight.tf                 |\n| Gross profit                                                                                             | /two.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/three.tf/four.tf                  | /one.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/three.tf/five.tf                   |\n| Direct operating expenses                                                                                | /nine.tf/six.tf/seven.tf                                   | /seven.tf/zero.tf/four.tf                                  |\n| Selling/comma.tf General & Administration (SG&A)                                                         | /five.tf/six.tf/zero.tf                                    | /four.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf                                 |\n| Profit before depreciation/comma.tf amortisation and   impairment losses/comma.tf etc/period.tf (EBITDA) | /nine.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf                                  | /four.tf/five.tf/four.tf                                   |\n| EBITDA margin                                                                                            | /nine.tf/period.tf/two.tf%                                 | /six.tf/period.tf/five.tf%                                 |\n| Profit after depreciation and impairment losses/comma.tf   before amortisations (EBITA)                  | /six.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf                                  | /two.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf                                   |\n| EBITA margin                                                                                             | /six.tf/period.tf/nine.tf%                                 | /four.tf/period.tf/two.tf%                                 |\n| Profit before financial items (EBIT)                                                                     | /six.tf/two.tf/three.tf                                    | /two.tf/six.tf/four.tf                                     |\n| EBIT margin                                                                                              | /six.tf/period.tf/three.tf%                                | /three.tf/period.tf/eight.tf%                              |\n| Invested capital                                                                                         | /three.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/three.tf/zero.tf                 | /one.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf/three.tf                |\n| Gross capital expenditure/comma.tf excl/period.tf acquisitions   and divestments (CAPEX)                 | /four.tf/six.tf/zero.tf                                    | /one.tf/five.tf/three.tf                                   |\n| Operational and /financial metrics                                                                       |                                                            |                                                            |\n| EBIT conversion (EBIT/gross profit -

Moller - Maersk's portfolio of logistics services expands and develops to serve customers' end-to-end logistics needs, the company is also expanding its ambition to 100% net zero solutions by 2040 to cover Logistics & Services, and hereby committing to accelerating the transition in hard-to-abate sectors, such as heavy-duty trucking, in response to customer demand and A.P. Moller - Maersk's commitment to society.\n\n## Logistics & Services commitments:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2030\n\n- \u00b7 Min. 30% air freight cargo transported with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and min. 25% SAF blend in A.P. Moller - Maersk's owned Star Air operations\n- \u00b7 Min. 90% green operations in A.P. Moller - Maersk's warehouses, depots and cold stores (scope 1 and 2).\n\n2040\n\n- \u00b7 100% net zero greenhouse gas emissions across all businesses and scopes, including landside transportation (truck, rail, barge), contract logistics, cold chain and air freight.\n\nIn 2021, the Logistics & Services business has set up a decarbonisation programme to significantly reduce emissions in the products with the highest emissions and to establish verified green offerings. The current programme focuses on 1) landside transportation (rail, truck, barge), 2) contract logistics (warehouses and deports), 3) cold chain, 4) air freight and 5) emissions transparency and might be extended as the business grows and expands.\n\nDeveloping decarbonised solutions in logistics services requires considering widely varying regulations and local conditions, and with A.P. Moller - Maersk in most cases not being the asset owner, the toolbox is more complex. Based on a thorough\n\nunderstanding of available technologies, regional and product-specific roadmaps will be developed and executed to achieve the targets and provide decarbonised solutions to customers. The transition will be enabled by improved emissions data and analytics, clear market standards for sourcing clean fuels, infrastructure development and a strong customer involvement to meet needs and requirements.\n\nDuring 2021, A.P. Moller - Maersk took the first steps by piloting and launching several products and first investments:\n\n## Landside transportation\n\nFirst pilots of ECO Delivery Inland were introduced with selected customers and markets, for example with the use of biofuels in Sweden and Japan. Activities to electrify heavy-duty transport started with the order of 16 electrical trucks in Cali fornia and with the investment of Maersk Growth in Einride, a leading start-up for electrified \"Transport-as-a-Service\".\n\n## Contract logistics and cold stores\n\n2021 saw the inauguration of a state-of-the-art pharmaceutical warehouse facility offering sustainable and scalable solutions in Mszczon\u00f3w near Warsaw - the first A.P. Moller - Maersk warehouse in Poland compliant with a BREEAM Excellent accreditation. Based on these learnings and technical standards, a more comprehensive rollout and retrofitting plan for future and existing assets will be launched in 2022.\n\n## Air freight\n\nSimilar to shipping, the key to decarbonising air freight - next to energy efficiency and technological innovations - is fuel change. The offering will be expanded by leveraging learnings from Ocean decarbonisation and engaging with current and new partners. For instance, A.P. Moller - Maersk has committed to 100,000 litres of sustainable aviation fuel with United Airlines in 2022 and joined as a new partner in their Eco-Skies Alliance programme.\n\n## Emissions transparency\n\nThe Emissions Dashboard, launched in Q2, allows customers to measure the carbon footprint across their logistics supply chain and identify emission reduced options including all transport modes, such as truck, rail, airplane or ocean vessel.",

This own-controlled and operated consolidation model with fixed sailing schedules and loading priority will help safeguard the highest-level reliability for Logistics & Services' customers.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk continued to strengthen its air offering through the intended acquisition of Senator International, the leasing of three B767-300 freighters and the purchase of two new B777F freighters, one of the suitable aircraft for optimal long-range intercontinental operations, being 10-15% more fuel-efficient than older aircraft types.\n\n## Fulfilled by Maersk\n\nThe acquisition of the aforementioned e-commerce companies has strengthened the technology capabilities in the e-commerce space along with reinforcing the geographical presence in North America through Visible SCM and in Europe through B2C.\n\nThe global warehousing network continues to expand with 3,098k sqm warehousing in 2021 from 2,245k sqm in 2020. Notably, an agreement with Saudi Ports Authority was signed in Q4 2021 for the setup of an integrated logistics park at the Jeddah Islamic Port in Saudi Arabia. This park will spread over 205k sqm and will offer warehousing and distribution, petrochemical consolidation and e-commerce solutions, as well as Transported by Maersk offerings in serving as a hub for transhipments, air freight and LCL.\n\nIn addition, A.P. Moller - Maersk announced the intended acquisition of LF Logistics, an omnichannel and fulfilment leader in Asia-Pacific, and the partnership with Grindrod Intermodal Group in South Africa.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Managed by Maersk\n\nMaersk NeoNav (4PL control tower product) continues to gain customer traction and was named by Gartner as one of the top innovations in logistics. TradeLens was listed in Forbes' annual blockchain Top 50 company and continued to expand its network and now consists of 360+ network members.\n\nCustoms Services digital customer journey continues to be enhanced with the launch of MyCustoms module on Maersk.com and A.P.

As a result, utilisation improved to 77% (70%). Volume from the Ocean segment increased by 11% (10% like-for-like) and similar volume from external customers increased by 12% (11% like-for-like).\n\nHigher congestion-driven storage revenue in North America resulted in an increase of 13% in gateway revenue per move to USD 312 (USD 275). As COVID-19-related congestion prevails globally, and due to higher volume in high-cost locations, cost per move increased by 4.3% to USD 242 (USD 232).\n\n## Regional volume\n\n| Terminals                              | Terminals                         | Terminals                        | Terminals                         |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Million moves                          | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf     | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | Growth (%)                        |\n| North America                          | /three.tf/period.tf/two.tf        | /two.tf/period.tf/eight.tf       | /one.tf/six.tf/period.tf/seven.tf |\n| Latin America                          | /two.tf/period.tf/five.tf         | /two.tf/period.tf/three.tf       | /eight.tf/period.tf/six.tf        |\n| Europe/comma.tf Russia and the Baltics | /two.tf/period.tf/six.tf          | /two.tf/period.tf/four.tf        | /eight.tf/period.tf/zero.tf       |\n| Asia                                   | /two.tf/period.tf/five.tf         | /two.tf/period.tf/zero.tf        | /two.tf/five.tf/period.tf/six.tf  |\n| Africa and Middle East                 | /one.tf/period.tf/nine.tf         | /one.tf/period.tf/nine.tf        | -/three.tf/period.tf/six.tf       |\n| Total                                  | /one.tf/two.tf/period.tf/eight.tf | /one.tf/one.tf/period.tf/five.tf | /one.tf/one.tf/period.tf/three.tf |\n\nAdjusted for foreign exchange rates, volume mix effects, and portfolio changes, revenue per move increased by 15%, and cost per move increased by 3.8%, driving up margins.\n\nThe positive volume growth and higher margins resulted in an EBITDA of USD 1.5bn (USD 989m) and an EBITDA margin of 36.4% (31.4%).

        "page_content": "## Decarbonising Terminals\n\nIn line with A.P. Moller - Maersk's target, APM Terminals is committed to reaching net zero by 2040, and has also set an ambitious near-term milestone of reducing emissions in its fully controlled terminals by 70% between 2020 and 2030.\n\nAPM Terminals is responsible for almost half a million tonnes of CO/uni2082 emissions per year as of 2020 in fully controlled entities. This is split between scope 1 emissions from 100 million litres of fuel used and scope 2 emissions from the 550 million kWh of electricity consumed.\n\nAPM Terminals' scope 1 emissions represent less than 1% of A.P. Moller - Maersk's total scope 1 emissions, but the total scope 2 emissions from electricity consumption are roughly 61% of A.P. Moller - Maersk's total scope 2.\n\nTo lead the way towards net zero terminal operations, a dedicated function has been established at APM Terminals and a broad range of initiatives have been defined. Recently, an ambitious energy efficiency programme was launched in collaboration with Siemens, with the aim of reducing controlled emissions by 10-20%.\n\nIn addition to the energy efficiency initiatives, the terminal in Gothenburg, Sweden, has successfully switched from fossil fuels to biofuel for their yard equipment. Based on this initial positive result, biofuel usage will be expanded for consequent testing and usage in the USA and later other geographies as well.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n70% reduction of absolute GHG emissions by 2030\n\nTARGET\n\nGreen electricity procurement is also an area of focus. Several terminals have already switched to renewable electricity supply, which has reduced the scope 2 emissions by 7%. Where possible, the use of onsite solar or wind installations are also being considered to better meet port energy demands.\n\nAs APM Terminals mature the capability to gradually decarbonise own operations, new and innovative ways will be developed to address the emissions where no solutions exist today. Essentially, lifting global trade - sustainably.\n\n## Key initiatives 2021\n\nTerminals has in the past year made significant progress towards becoming the best-in-class operator, upgrading the current portfolio and entering into new segments.\n\n## Automation, digitalisation and IT\n\nAs a part of the automation and digitisation programmes over 2,000 assets are now digitally connected across 16 terminals by end 2021. This solution enables terminals to monitor and visualise asset performance in real time, detect operational exceptions as they occur, and provides standardised tools and processes to respond to these. Further, a new IFS10 ERP system along with standardised way of working processes are being rolled out. Despite COVID-19-related challenges, seven gateway terminals and two hubs are already live, with the remaining terminals expected to go live in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Construction work\n\nThe expansion in Yokohama, Japan, was completed early 2021, driving the significant growth in volumes in Asia. In APM Terminals Poti, Georgia, the preparation works on site have started and in Onne, Nigeria, in parallel with the civil upgrades, additional container hand ling equipment has been received and is being put to operation. The construction work for a new terminal in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is progressing and the business setup is being put in place.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Container terminal in Plaquemines Parish\n\nIn November, Plaquemines Port, Louisiana, USA, and APM Terminals announced a letter of intent whereby APM Terminals will become the operator of a newly planned container terminal and intermodal rail facility and external parties will be the investor. Plaquemines Port and their partners will manage the financial activities associated with the infrastructure development, investment, and ownership of the port.\n\n## Sale of Terminal Wilhelmshaven\n\nAn agreement has been finalised with Hapag-Lloyd to take over Terminals' 30% shareholding of Container Terminal Wilhelmshaven (CTW), Germany.

Revenue in Australia was positively impacted by strong grain volumes and less by impact from\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs of Q1 2022, Towage will be reported under Manu facturing & Others. At the same time, the segment will change its name to Towage and Maritime Services.\n\nCOVID-19. In Asia, Middle East and Africa revenue was positively impacted by ramp-up of activities in Morocco. This was partly offset by weaker harbour towage activities in the UK, Scandinavia, and in Brazil. Terminal towage revenue increased by USD 8m excluding foreign exchange rate impact. EBITDA increased to USD 220m (USD 216m), mainly due to lower costs as 2020 was impacted by restructuring costs in Australia. EBIT decreased to USD 121m (USD 141m) as 2020 was positively impacted by a gain from the acquisition of Port Towage Amsterdam.\n\nFor terminal towage, annualised EBITDA per tug decreased by 5%, mainly driven by a termination fee received in 2020.\n\nImportant contracts in Brazil, Argentina, Oman, and Angola were renewed in 2021. New contracts were signed in Argentina, the Philippines, the UK and in Australia.\n\n## Manufacturing & Others\n\nRevenue increased by USD 94m to USD 1.3bn (USD 1.3bn) with an EBITDA of USD 136m (USD 165m) and an EBIT of negative USD 103m (positive USD 69m).\n\nMaersk Container Industry had the strongest financial year ever of its marine reefer business. Revenue was USD 690m (USD 587m) with 70% related to third-party customers, in a combination of increase in Star Cool Unit and Star Cool Integrated volumes, higher reefer pricing and a record after sales revenue. EBIT decreased to USD 78m (USD 131m), but excluding non-recurring items related to the closure of factories in 2020, EBIT increased by USD 8m to USD 71m (USD 63m). A sales agreement was signed with China International Marine Containers Ltd. (CIMC) with closing subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nMaersk Supply Service reported a revenue of USD 301m (USD 252m), and an EBITDA of USD 16m (USD 21m), due to increased activity offset by higher costs. EBIT decreased due to a net impairment loss of USD 298m, recognised because of a strategic review of the fleet and the compatibility towards the green transition. Maersk Supply Service won its first contracts in wave energy and floating wind.\n\nThe decrease in overall EBIT was partially offset by a reversal of impairment on associates. H\u00f6egh Autoliners was successfully listed on Euronext Growth in Oslo in Q4 2021, and hence USD 132m of previously recognised impairment was reversed.\n\n## Manufacturing & Others highlights\n\n|                                                                                                         | USD million                                | USD million                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf          |\n| Revenue                                                                                                 | /one.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/four.tf/eight.tf | /one.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/five.tf/four.tf |\n| Profit before depreciation/comma.tf amortisation and  impairment losses/comma.tf etc/period.tf (EBITDA) | /one.tf/three.tf/six.tf                    | /one.tf/six.tf/five.tf                  |\n| EBITDA margin                                                                                           | /one.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/one.tf%          | /one.tf/three.tf/period.tf/two.tf%      |\n| Profit/loss before financial items (EBIT)                                                               | -/one.tf/zero.tf/three.tf                  | /six.tf/nine.tf                         |\n| EBIT margin                                                                                             | -/seven.tf/period.tf/six.tf%               | /five.tf/period.tf/five.tf%             |\n| Invested capital                                                                                        | /eight.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                  | /nine.tf/eight.tf/six.tf                |\n| Gross capital expenditure/comma.tf excl/period.tf acquisitions   and divestments (CAPEX)                | /five.tf/three.tf                          | /three.tf/three.tf                      |",

The Board of Directors in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S proposes an ordinary dividend of DKK 2,500 per share based on a pay-out ratio of 40% corresponding to a dividend yield of 10.7%, which in combination with the already announced share buy-back programme of USD 2.5bn for 2022, will bring the total cash distribution to USD 9.6bn for 2022 or 14.9% of the market cap end of 2021.\n\n## Share price development\n\nThe Maersk B share price increased by 72% to DKK 23,450 from its closing price at the end of 2020 of DKK 13,595. By comparison, the benchmark indices, MSCI World Transportation and KAXCAP index in Denmark, increased by 23% and 18%, respectively. The Maersk B share price reached its highest closing price of DKK 23,650 on 29 December 2021, and its lowest price of DKK 12,320 on 16 February 2021. The total market value of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S was USD 64.3bn or DKK 421bn at the end of 2021.\n\n## Share price development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total shareholder return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe positive development of the share price was supported by a significant improvement in the financial performance throughout the year. The exceptional market conditions in Ocean, with high demand growth and extended congestions in the global supply chains, in combination with the underlying positive results of the strategic transformation growing organically and inorganically in Logistics & Services and improving returns in Terminals & Towage, led to significant strong financial results. As a result of the increasing freight rates and the positive market conditions, the full-year earnings guidance was upgraded several times during 2021.\n\nComparing the development in the total shareholder returns since the strategic review was announced back in 2016, the total shareholder return has been 261% or 26% annualised per year, adjusted for dividends, with significant positive returns generated in the past three years.\n\n## Share capital\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen and are divided into two classes: A shares with voting rights and B shares without voting rights. Each DKK 1,000 A share entitles the holder to two votes.\n\nOn 20 May 2021, the cancellation of 131,186 A shares and 524,745 B shares was completed corresponding to 3.3% of the total share capital in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S before the cancellation of shares.\n\nThe A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S share capital amounts to nominally DKK 19,376,016, divided between 10,468,215 A shares of nominally DKK 1,000 and 8,907,801 B shares of nominally DKK 1,000.",

Decisions on measures to reduce or eliminate risks are based on an assessment of materiality and probability of errors and omissions.\n\n## Control activities\n\nSpecific control activities have been defined for each significant brand and business unit.\n\nThe performance of such control activities is monitored on brand and business unit as well as on a corporate level. This monitoring includes controller reports with follow-up on findings and recommendations as well as an annual statement of representation from management of the most significant brands and business units.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nThe Board of Directors is overall responsible for the company having information and reporting systems in place to ensure that its financial reporting is in conformity with rules and regulations. For this purpose, the company has set out detailed requirements in policies, manuals and procedures, and a global consolidation system with related reporting instructions has been implemented.

Moller - Maersk delivered record-breaking financial results and made a strong progress towards its strategic transformation. The remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors remains unchanged from the previous year.\n\nUnderlining the importance of delivering on A.P. Moller - Maersk's commitments to ensure responsible business practices as well as taking leadership in the decarbonising of logistics, the company is from 2023 introducing an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) measure in the long-term incentive plan. 2022 will be used to ensure that the right ESG targets are fully aligned and integrated to deliver on the company's commitments.\n\nThe following sections set out key elements of the Remuneration Policy ('Policy'), and the total remuneration awarded to the members of Board of Directors and the Executive Board for 2021.\n\n## Remuneration policy at a glance\n\nThe Policy supports the business needs by enabling an appropriate total remuneration package that has a clear link to business strategy and aligns with shareholder interests.\n\nThe objectives of the Policy are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure appropriate total remuneration: The remuneration design and decisions are guided by market practice, reflected in the remuneration components offered and the total remuneration value provided.\n\n## 2017-2021 Remuneration\n\n| Remuneration awarded (USD million)                                                               | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/eight.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/seven.tf   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Board of Directors                                                                               |                                 |                                  |                                  |                                   |                                   |\n| Fixed annual fee                                                                                 | /three.tf                       | /three.tf                        | /three.tf                        | /three.tf                         | /three.tf                         |\n| Total                                                                                            | /three.tf                       | /three.tf                        | /three.tf                        | /three.tf                         | /three.tf                         |\n| Executive Board                                                                                  |                                 |                                  |                                  |                                   |                                   |\n| Fixed base salary                                                                                | /nine.tf                        | /eight.tf                        | /one.tf/zero.tf                  | /one.tf/zero.tf                   | /eight.tf                         |\n| Short-term cash incentive                                                                        | /eight.tf                       | /six.tf                          | /five.tf                         | /five.tf                          | /two.tf                           |\n| Long-term share-based incentives                                                                 | /three.tf                       | /two.tf                          | /one.tf                          | /one.tf                           | /one.tf                           |\n| Remuneration in connection with redundancy/comma.tf   resignations and release from duty to work | -

This does not apply to the Chairman where the fixed annual fee is all inclusive.\n\n## Executive Board\n\nThe remuneration of the Executive Board members consists of a fixed base salary, which is inclusive of company pension contribution and car, short-term incentive as well as long-term incentive components.\n\nThe remuneration structure is intended to drive a 'reward for performance' culture by aligning individual reward to company performance and shareholder value creation. The individual remuneration level is set and reviewed based on peer companies of similar size and complexity to ensure they remain comparable and fit for the business.\n\n## Total remuneration 2021\n\nThe table shows the total remuneration awarded to members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board in aggregate from 2017 to 2021, as set out in note 2.2 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFurther information regarding the share-based payments is detailed in note 5.2 of the consolidated financial statements as calculated under IFRS2.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is different in both reporting and methodology in the company's Remuneration Report 2021 which is available at the company's website on: INVESTOR.MAERSK.COM/REMUNERATION",

Moller - Maersk have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of A.P. Moller - Maersk are included in the consolidated financial statements of A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding A/S.\n\nThe accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2020, except for the changes to accounting standards that were effective from 1 January 2021 and were endorsed by the EU.\n\nA number of changes to accounting standards are effective from 1 January 2021 and endorsed by the EU:\n\nAmendments to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (IBOR reform): The changes will impact some of A.P. Moller - Maersk's existing IBOR referenced loans, swaps and facilities, which will be amended over the course of 2022. The changes are not expected to have material impact.\n\nOther changes are not expected to impact the financial statements.\n\n## ESEF/iXBRL reporting\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S is required to prepare and file the annual report in the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF), and the annual report for 2021 is therefore prepared in the XHTML format that can be displayed in a standard browser. The primary statements in the consolidated financial statements are tagged using inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). The iXBRL tags comply with the ESEF taxonomy, which is included in the ESEF Regulation and developed based on the IFRS taxonomy published by the IFRS Foundation. Where a financial statement line item is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy has been created. Extensions are anchored to elements in the ESEF taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals.\n\nThe Annual Report submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with certain technical files, all included in a file named APMM-2021-12-31-en.zip.\n\n## Change to product facilities in reportable segment\n\nAs part of the refinement of the segment structure of A.P. Moller - Maersk, the product facilities of the Logistics & Services segment have been updated.\n\n## Logistics & Services product facilities specifications\n\n| Product   families     | Details                                                                                                                                                                                           | Strategic rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Managed by  Maersk     | \u00b7  Lead Logistics (Supply Chain   Management and 4PL) \u00b7  Cold Chain logistics \u00b7  Custom Services \u00b7  TradeLens                                                                                     | Integrated management solutions enable cus- tomers to control or outsource part or all their  supply chain.

The net effect of the changes was an increase in EBIT of USD 425m.\n\nThe useful life of new containers is typically estimated to 15 years, previously 12 years. The residual values are initially estimated between 10% and 30%, depending on the container type.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1.1  General accounting policies - continued\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY - CONTINUED\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S, its subsidiaries and proportionate shares in joint arrangements classified as joint operations.\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S. Control is based on the power to direct the relevant activities of an entity and the exposure, or right, to variable returns arising from it. In that connection, relevant activities are those that significantly affect the investee's returns. Control is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or in other ways controlling more than 50% of the voting rights or by other rights, such as agreements on management control.\n\nJoint arrangements are entities in which A.P. Moller - Maersk, according to contractual agreements with one or more other parties, has joint control. The arrangements are classified as joint ventures, if the contracting parties' rights are limited to net assets in the separate legal entities, and as joint operations, if the parties have direct and unlimited rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement.\n\nEntities in which A.P. Moller - Maersk exercises a significant but non-controlling influence are considered associated companies. A significant influence is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling 20-50% of the voting rights. Agreements and other circumstances are considered when assessing the degree of influence.\n\nConsolidation is performed by summarising the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries, including the proportionate share of joint operations, which have been prepared in accordance with A.P. Moller - Maersk's accounting policies. Intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends, intra- group balances and gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised gains on transactions with associated companies and joint arrangements are eliminated in proportion to A.P. Moller - Maersk's ownership share. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way unless they indicate impairment.\n\nNon-controlling interests' share of profit/loss for the year and of equity in subsidiaries is included as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's profit and equity respectively, but shown as separate items.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, the functional currency of the parent company and the group. In the translation to the presentation currency for subsidiaries, associates or joint arrangements with functional currencies other than USD, the total comprehensive income is translated into USD at average exchange rates, and the balance sheet is translated at the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising from such translations are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and in a separate reserve of equity.\n\nThe functional currency varies from business area to business area. For A.P. Moller - Maersk's principal shipping activities, the functional currency is typically USD. This means, among other things, that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and, hence, depreciation and amortisation, are maintained in USD from the date of acquisition. For other activities, including container terminal activities and land-based container activities, the functional currency is generally the local currency of the country in which such activities are performed, unless circumstances suggest a different currency is appropriate.\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement as financial income or expenses.\n\nShare of pro/fit/loss in associated companies and joint ventures is recognised net of tax and corrected for the share of unrealised intra-group gains and losses. The item also comprises any impairment losses for such investments and their reversal.\n\n## Statement of comprehensive income\n\nOther comprehensive income consists of gains and losses not recognised in the income statement, including exchange rate adjustments arising from the translation from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustments of other equity investments (at FVOCI), cash flow hedges, forward points and currency basis spread as well as actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit plans, etc. A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of other comprehensive income in associated companies and joint ventures is also included.\n\nOn disposal or discontinuation of an entity, A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the accumulated exchange rate adjustment relating to the relevant entity with a functional currency other than USD, is reclassified to the income statement. Accumulated value adjustments of equity instruments classified as equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income will remain in equity upon disposal.\n\nOther comprehensive income includes current and deferred income tax to the extent that the items recognised in other comprehensive income are taxable or deductible.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1.1  General accounting policies - continued\n\n## Note 1.2   Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY - CONTINUED\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nInvestments in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised as A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the equity value inclusive of goodwill less any impairment losses. Goodwill is an integral part of the value of associated companies and joint ventures and is therefore subject to an impairment test together with the investment as a whole. Impairment losses are reversed to the extent the original value is considered recoverable.\n\nEquity instruments, etc. , including shares, bonds and similar securities, are recognised on the trading date at fair value, and subsequently measured at the quoted market price for listed securities and at estimated fair value for non-listed securities. Fair value adjustments from equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) remain in equity upon disposal. Dividends are recognised in the income statement.\n\nInventories mainly consist of bunker, spare parts not qualifying for property, plant and equipment, and other consumables. Inventories are measured at cost, primarily according to the FIFO method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes direct and indirect production costs.\n\nLoans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus any direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For loans and other receivables, write-downs are made for expected losses based on specific individual or group assessments. For trade receivables, the loss allowance is measured by the simplified approach according to IFRS 9, applying a provision matrix to calculate the expected lifetime losses. The provision matrix includes an impairment for non-due receivables.\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nWhen preparing the consolidated financial statements, management considers climate-related risks, where these potentially could impact reported amounts materially. The areas in which A.P. Moller - Maersk has assessed climate related-risks at the end of 2021 are included within the individual notes outlined below:\n\nNote /three.tf/period.tf/one.tf  -  Intangible assets\n\nNote /three.tf/period.tf/two.tf  -   Property/comma.tf plant and equipment\n\n## New financial reporting requirements\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has not yet adopted the following accounting standards and requirements:\n\nIFRS 17 - Insurance contracts: An analysis of the impact is being assessed and is expected to be concluded in due course ahead of the implementation date.\n\nOther changes to IFRS are not expected to have any significant impact on recognition and measurement.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements on an ongoing basis and to form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management forms its estimates and judgements based on historical experience, independent advice, external data points as well as on in-house specialists and on other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nIn its assumption setting, management deals with various aspects of uncertainty. One aspect of uncertainty is the assessment of control over investments classified as associates, joint ventures, and subsidiaries, where the assessment forms the basis for classification. Another aspect is measurement uncertainty, where management makes assumptions that derive the value of recognised assets and liabilities. These assumptions concern the timing and amount of future cash flows as well as the risks inherent in these.\n\nIn certain areas, the outcome of business plans, including ongoing negotiations with external parties to execute those plans or the outcome of negotiations to settle claims that are raised against A.P. Moller - Maersk, is highly uncertain. Therefore, assumptions may change, or the outcome may differ in the coming years, which could require a material upward or downward adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities.\n\nThe areas in which A.P. Moller - Maersk is particularly exposed to material uncertainty over the carrying amounts as at the end of 2021 are included within the individual notes outlined below:\n\nNote /two.tf/period.tf/two.tf  -  Vessel sharing agreements\n\nNote /three.tf/period.tf/one.tf  -   Cash-generating units and impairment testing\n\nNote /three.tf/period.tf/two.tf  -  Useful life and residual value\n\nNote /three.tf/period.tf/seven.tf  -  Provisions for legal disputes\n\nNote /four.tf/period.tf/three.tf  -  Provisions for pension and other employee benefits\n\nNote /five.tf/period.tf/one.tf  -  Deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions\n\nNote /five.tf/period.tf/five.tf  -  Operations in countries with limited access to repatriating surplus cash",

information\n\nRevenue for the shipping activities is based on the port of discharge for all ships operated by the Group, including leased ships on time charter agreements. Revenue for leasing out the vessels on time charter agreement, where the Group acts as a lessor, is based on the customer location. For non-current assets (e.g. terminals), which cannot be easily moved, geographical location is where the assets are located. For all other assets, geographical location is based on the legal ownership. These assets consist mainly of ships and containers registered in China, Denmark, Singapore and the USA.",

        "page_content": "## Note 2.1  Segment information - continued\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY - CONTINUED\n\n## Income statement\n\nRevenue for all businesses is recognised when the performance obligation has been satisfied, which happens upon the transfer of control to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services.\n\nRevenue from shipping activities is recognised over time as the performance obligation is satisfied, including a share of revenue from incomplete voyages at the balance sheet date. Invoiced revenue related to an estimated proportion of remaining voyage time and activities at the destination port is deferred. Number of days of a voyage, as a percentage of the total number of days a voyage is estimated to last, is considered as a close approximation of percentage of completion. Detention and demurrage fees are recognised over time up until the time of the customer's late return or pick-up of containers.\n\nRevenue from terminal operations and towing activities is recognised upon completion of the service. In container terminals operated under certain restrictive terms of pricing and service, etc., the value of tangible assets constructed on behalf of the concession grantor is recognised as revenue during the construction.\n\nRevenue from most freight forwarding activities is recognised over time.\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon the transfer of control to the buyer.\n\nNo significant element of financing is deemed present as sales are made with a credit term of 20-45 days, which is consistent with market practice. Revenue from sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.\n\n## Note 2.2  Operating costs\n\n|                                                   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf                         | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                     |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Costs of goods sold                               | /one.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/five.tf/zero.tf             | /one.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/seven.tf/one.tf           |\n| Bunker costs                                      | /five.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf          | /three.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/two.tf/zero.tf         |\n| Terminal costs                                    | /six.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf/five.tf              | /six.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/two.tf/five.tf            |\n| Intermodal costs                                  | /three.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf          | /three.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf          |\n| Port costs                                        | /two.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/eight.tf/three.tf             | /two.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/four.tf/six.tf             |\n| Rent and lease costs                              | /one.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/one.tf/seven.tf               | /one.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/nine.tf/five.tf            |\n| Staff costs                                       | /six.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/three.tf/two.tf               | /five.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf           |\n| Other                                             | /nine.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf/five.tf            | /seven.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/three.tf/nine.tf       |\n| Total operating costs                             | /three.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/four.tf/eight.tf | /three.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf/four.tf |\n| Remuneration of employees                         |                                                       |                                                    |\n| Wages and salaries                                | /five.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/one.tf/five.tf              | /four.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/six.tf/zero.tf           |\n| Severance payments                                | /three.tf/zero.tf                                     | /one.tf/four.tf/eight.tf                           |\n| Pension costs/comma.tf defined benefit plans      | /two.tf/one.tf                                        | /two.tf/nine.tf                                    |\n| Pension costs/comma.tf defined contribution plans | /two.tf/three.tf/one.tf                               | /one.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf                           |\n| Other social security costs                       | /four.tf/three.tf/seven.tf                            | /three.tf/nine.tf/six.tf                           |\n| Total remuneration                                | /six.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/three.tf/four.tf              | /five.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/three.tf/zero.tf        |\n| Of which:                                         |                                                       |                                                    |\n| Recognised in the cost of assets                  | /one.tf                                               | /one.tf                                            |\n| Included in restructuring costs                   | /one.tf                                               | /one.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                             |\n| Expensed as staff costs                           | /six.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/three.tf/two.tf               | /five.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf           |\n| Average number of employees                       | /eight.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/seven.tf/five.tf  | /eight.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/two.tf/four.tf  |\n\nCustomary agreements have been entered into with employees regarding compensation in connection with resignation with consideration for local legislation and collective agreements.\n\nFor information about share-based payments, reference is made to note 5.2.",

The committed vessel's capacity is then shared with one or more container shipping providers in proportion to each party's contribution to the joint service. In practice, it is not always possible to provide tonnage precisely as agreed in the sharing arrangements, therefore financial settlement often takes place on basis of relative capacity over/under utilised on a monthly or other mutually agreed cycle. At A.P. Moller - Maersk, these capacity adjustments are settled as close to actual costs incurred as possible based on market rates applicable at that time.\n\n## Note 2.3  Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses\n\n|                                                                       | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf             | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Total depreciation                                                    | /four.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/one.tf/five.tf | /four.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/four.tf/five.tf |\n| Total amortisation                                                    | /two.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf                 | /two.tf/three.tf/three.tf                |\n| Total impairment/comma.tf net                                         | /three.tf/five.tf/two.tf                  | /one.tf/six.tf/three.tf                  |\n| Depreciation/comma.tf amortisation and impairment losses/comma.tf net | /four.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/four.tf/four.tf | /four.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/four.tf/one.tf |\n\nDepreciations are primarily related to property, plant and equipment of USD 2bn (USD 3bn) and to leases of USD 2bn (USD 1bn).

Ocean operates its fleet of container vessels and hub terminals in an integrated network. Consequently, the Ocean activities are tested for impairment as a single cash-generating unit.\n\nLogistics & Services, including intermodal activities previously considered a part of the Ocean cashgenerating unit, is considered one cash-generating unit as a result of the continued integration within the business. Management now views the Logistics & Services products as an integrated network, with the activities tested for impairment as a single cash-generating unit.\n\nIn gateway terminals, each terminal is considered an individual cash-generating unit for impairment tests, except when the capacity is managed as a portfolio. The Towage activities make up two separate cashgenerating units.\n\nManufacturing & Others is made up of several individual businesses which are each considered one cash-generating unit.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates\n\nImpairment analysis\n\nThe recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is determined based on the higher of its value in use or fair value less costs to sell. The estimated value in use is calculated using certain key assumptions for the expected future cash flows and applied discount factor. Current market values for vessels, etc., are estimated using acknowledged brokers.\n\nProjected cash flow models are used when fair value is not obtainable or when fair value is deemed lower than value in use.\n\nThe cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and business plans approved by management. In nature, these projections are subject to judgement and estimates that are uncertain, though based on experience and external sources where available. Centralised processes and involvement of corporate functions ensure that indices and data sources are selected consistently while observing differences in risks and other circumstances.\n\nThe discount rates applied reflect the time value of money as well as the specific risks related to the underlying cash flows, i.e. project and/or country-specific risk premium. The discount rate also takes into consideration development in sustainable technologies. Further, any uncertainties reflecting past performance and possible variations in the amount or timing of the projected cash flows are generally reflected in the discount rates.\n\n## Impairment tests - key assumptions\n\nThe outcome of impairment tests is subject to estimates of the future development of freight rates and volumes, oil prices and the discount rates applied.\n\nManagement determines the key assumptions for each impairment test by considering past experience as well as market analysis and future expectations based on supply and demand trends. The future development in freight rates is an uncertain and significant factor impacting the Ocean segment in particular, whose financial results are directly affected by fluctuations in container freight rates. Freight rates are expected to be influenced by the timing of when the current supply chain bottlenecks will normalise, as well as by regional and global economic environments, trade patterns, and by industry- specific trends in respect of capacity supply and demand. There is little visibility into when the capacity bottle necks throughout the supply chain which have driven up the short-term freight rates will recede.\n\nFreight volumes are also highly contingent on when consumer goods demand begins to settle back to pre-COVID-19 levels and when the demand for services rebounds. However, inventory replenishment requirements and increasing e-commerce demands are expected to keep the demand for capacity high well into 2022. Future expectations on freight volumes impact all segments.\n\nThe future development in the oil price is also an uncertain and significant factor impacting accounting estimates across A.P. Moller - Maersk, either directly or indirectly. Ocean is directly impacted by the price of bunker oil, where the competitive landscape determines the extent to which the development is reflected in the freight rates charged to the customer. Terminals under APM Terminals located in oil-producing countries, e.g., Nigeria, Angola, Egypt, Russia and Brazil, are indirectly impacted by the development in oil prices and the consequences on the respective countries' economies, which not only affects volumes handled in the terminals, but also foreign exchange rates.",

Management has applied an assumption of growth in volumes based on a calculated terminal value with growth equal to the expected economic growth of 2% p.a. in both 2021 and 2020, based on pressure on freight rates, and continued cost efficiency. A discount rate of 7.2% (7.0%) p.a. after tax has been applied. The impairment test continues to show headroom from the value in use to the carrying amount. Management is of the opinion that the assumptions applied are sustainable.\n\nThe most significant goodwill amount relates to the Logistics & Services segment, where the impairment test is based on the estimated value in use from five-year business plans for 2022-26 where the volume and margin growth assumptions, which are regionally specific, reflect the current market expectations for the relevant period. The applied terminal value is 2% (2%). A discount rate of 6.8% (7.2%) p.a. after tax has been applied. The impairment test showed headroom from the value in use to the carrying amount.\n\nIn Terminals & Towage, management assesses indicators of impairment including decreasing volumes and based on these indicators, estimates the recoverable amounts of the individual terminals whereby impairment indicators exist. Management also tests for impairment of the CGUs where goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets are allocated to. For APM Terminals' interest in Global Port Investments, being the share of equity and significant intangible assets acquired, management assesses the recoverable amount of its interest on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe cash flow projections for each terminal cover the concession period and extension options that are deemed likely to be exercised. The growth rates assumed reflect current market expectations for the relevant period and the discount rates applied are between 5.9% and 10.6% (6.2% and 12.7%) p.a. after tax. The key sensitivities are container moves, revenue and cost per move, and local port rates, all of which are impacted by the local economic outlook and competition, as well as concession right extensions and the discount rate applied.\n\nThe impairment tests considered fair value less cost of disposal and value in use calculations compared to the carrying amount and resulted in impairment losses on assets of an immaterial amount in three terminals in 2021 (no impairment recognised on terminals in continued use in 2020). Continued economic deterioration and a lack of cash repatriation opportunities in certain oil-producing countries can potentially put pressure on carrying amounts of individual terminals.\n\nThe offshore support vessel (OSV) market has continued to suffer under strained market conditions. International oil companies are increasingly channelling new investments into green energy projects and activity. Maersk Supply Service has made a strategic choice to pursue this transition towards green energy projects and activity. On this basis, Maersk Supply Service has made a review of its current fleet concluding that part of the fleet will not be able to service the green transition due to age and technical capabilities. This change in the market outlook and revised strategy has significantly impacted the expected cash flow generation of the current fleet.\n\nThe recoverable amount for the assets has been determined based on the five-year business plans for 2022-26 using a discount rate of 9.6% p.a. after tax, resulting in a recoverable amount of USD 426m. As a result, the valuation of the assets using a value in use calculation has resulted in a net impairment loss amounting to USD 298m.\n\nThe impairment recognised in 2020 on Anchor Handling Tug Supply vessels (onerous contracts) within Maersk Supply Service was determined using a discount rate of 9.8% p.a. after tax.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nIntangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Intangible assets regarding acquired customer relationships and brand names are amortised over a useful life of 10 and 20 years, respectively. IT software is amortised over a useful life of 3-5 years.\n\nFor container terminals operated under certain restrictive price and service conditions, etc., concessional rights to collect usage charges are included under intangible assets. The cost includes the present value of minimum payments under concession agreements and the cost of property, plant and equipment constructed on behalf of the grantor of a concession. The rights are amortised from the commencement of operations over the concession period.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised when the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds the higher of the estimated value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Goodwill is attributed to cash-generating units on acquisition and impaired before other assets.\n\nIntangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if there is an indication of impairment. However, annual impairment tests are carried out for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as well as intangible assets that are not yet in use. Impairment losses are included in depreciation, amortisation and impairment, net, in the income statement.",

When there is an indication of a change in an asset's useful life, management revises the estimates for individual assets or groups of assets with similar characteristics due to factors such as quality of maintenance and repair, technical development or environmental requirements. Management has also considered the impact of decarbonisation and climate-related risks on the existing assets' useful lives. Such risks include new climate related legislation restricting the use of certain assets, new technology demanded by climate related legislation, and the increase in restoration costs for terminal sites due to new and/or more comprehensive policies.\n\nResidual values of vessels are difficult to estimate given their long useful lives, the uncertainty of future economic conditions, and the uncertainty of future steel prices, which is considered the main determinant of the residual value. Generally, the residual values of vessels are initially estimated at 10% of the purchase price excluding dry-docking costs. The long-term view is prioritised in order to disregard, to the extent possible, temporary market fluctuations which may be significant.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful life at an estimated residual value. The useful lives of new assets are typically as follows:\n\n| Ships/comma.tf etc/period.tf                             | /two.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/five.tf years                                          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Containers/comma.tf etc/period.tf                        | /one.tf/five.tf years                                                          |\n| Buildings                                                | /one.tf/zero.tf-/five.tf/zero.tf years                                         |\n| Terminal infrastructure                                  | /one.tf/zero.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf years or concession period/comma.tf if shorter |\n| Plant and machinery, cranes and other terminal equipment | /five.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf years                                                 |\n| Other operating equipment, fixtures, etc.                | /three.tf-/seven.tf years                                                      |\n\nEstimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed on a regular basis.\n\nThe cost of an asset is divided into separate components, which are depreciated separately if the useful life of the individual component differs. Dry-docking costs are recognised in the carrying amount of ships when incurred and depreciated over the period until the next dry-docking.\n\nThe cost of assets constructed by A.P. Moller - Maersk includes directly attributable expenses. For assets with a long construction period, borrowing costs during the construction period from specific as well as general borrowings are attributed to cost. In addition, the cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of removal and restoration.",

In some cases, the leasing agreements comprise purchase options exercisable by the Group and options for extending the lease term. The Group also enters into arrangements that provide the right-to-use some existing infrastructure or land as required to carry out the terminal business.\n\nTo optimise lease costs during the contract period, the Group sometimes provides residual value guarantees in relation to equipment leases. At the end of 2021, the expected residual values were reviewed if these reflect the actual residual values achieved on comparable assets and expectations about future prices. At 31 December 2021, USD 226m (USD 354m) is expected to be payable and is included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.\n\nLeases to which A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed but for which lease term has not yet commenced have an undiscounted value of USD 2.7bn (USD 557m). They comprise of approx. 60 contracts commencing in 2022 to 2024.\n\nCertain terminal concession agreements contain variable payment terms that are linked to future performance, i.e. number of containers handled. Such payments are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs.\n\nLease liabilities are disclosed in notes 4.2 and 4.5.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nRight-of-use assets are mainly leased vessels, containers, concessions arrangements and real estate property. Lease contracts for vessels and containers are typically made for fixed periods of about five years but may have extension options as described together with lease liabilities. Concession arrangements and real estate contracts are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions.\n\nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding lease liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.",

A net gain revaluation of business of USD 45m has been recognised after recycling of a translation reserve loss of USD 61m. Liquid funds acquired amounted to USD 0.1bn. On the date of acquisition, the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the listed share price, therefore the transaction has been reported as the bargain purchase. The gain from bargain purchase has been reported at USD 46m.\n\nFrom the acquisition date to 31 December 2020, Pipavav terminal contributed positively to the results with a revenue of USD 59m.

Identifiable intangible assets are recognised if they arise from a contractual right or can other wise be separately identified. The difference between the fair value of the acquisition cost and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value and any subsequent changes to contingent consideration are recognised as financial income or financial expense in the income statement. If contingent consideration is settled by issuing a predetermined number of shares, the contingent consideration is classified as equity and is subsequently not remeasured at fair value. Transaction costs are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.\n\nWhen A.P. Moller - Maersk ceases to have control of a subsidiary, the value of any retained investment is re-measured at fair value, and the value adjustment is recognised in the income statement as a gain/loss on the sale of non-current assets. The difference between sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the subsidiary is recognised in the income statement including fair value of contingent consideration at the time of sale. Contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement. The effect of the purchase and sale of non-controlling interests without changes in control is included directly in equity.\n\nLoan receivables amount to USD 5.1bn (USD 227m) and consist primarily of term deposits with a maturity of more than three months amounting to USD 5bn (USD 0bn).\n\n## Note 3.6  Assets held for sale or distribution\n\n|                                                                  | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Balance sheet items comprise:                                    |                                 |                                  |\n| Intangible assets                                                | /four.tf/one.tf                 | /three.tf/nine.tf                |\n| Property/comma.tf plant and equipment and right-of-use assets    | /one.tf/zero.tf/six.tf          | /nine.tf/four.tf                 |\n| Other assets                                                     | /five.tf/five.tf                | /five.tf/four.tf                 |\n| Non-current assets                                               | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf          | /one.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf        |\n| Current assets                                                   | /one.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf        | /three.tf/one.tf                 |\n| Assets held for sale or distribution                             | /three.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf       | /two.tf/one.tf/eight.tf          |\n| Provisions                                                       | /one.tf/three.tf                | -                                |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                         | /one.tf/one.tf                  | /one.tf/three.tf                 |\n| Other liabilities                                                | /two.tf/two.tf/zero.tf          | /seven.tf/eight.tf               |\n| Liabilities associated with assets held for sale or distribution | /two.tf/four.tf/four.tf         | /nine.tf/one.tf                  |\n\nAssets held for sale in 2021 largely relate to Maersk Container Industry within Manufacturing & Others and three terminals within Terminals & Towage.

Assets are classified as held for sale when activities to carry out a sale have been initiated, when the activities are available for immediate sale in their present condition, and when the activities are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities.\n\nAssets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount immediately before classification as held for sale and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment tests are performed immediately before classification as held for sale. Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while classified as held for sale. Measurement of deferred tax and financial assets and liabilities is unchanged.\n\n## Note 3.7  Provisions\n\n|                                                                             | Restructuring           | Legal dis- putes/comma.tf etc/period.tf   | Other                     | Total                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| /one.tf January /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf                               | /one.tf/three.tf/six.tf | /seven.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf               | /three.tf/six.tf/eight.tf | /one.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/eight.tf/one.tf  |\n| Provision made                                                              | /three.tf/two.tf        | /six.tf/three.tf/three.tf                 | /two.tf/four.tf/zero.tf   | /nine.tf/zero.tf/five.tf                 |\n| Amount used                                                                 | /eight.tf/zero.tf       | /one.tf/four.tf/seven.tf                  | /seven.tf/zero.tf         | /two.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf                 |\n| Amount reversed                                                             | /two.tf/five.tf         | /one.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf                  | /one.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf  | /three.tf/nine.tf/four.tf                |\n| Transfer                                                                    | -                       | /two.tf                                   | /one.tf/seven.tf          | /one.tf/nine.tf                          |\n| Transfer/comma.tf assets held for sale                                      | -                       | -                                         | -/two.tf/six.tf           | -/two.tf/six.tf                          |\n| Exchange rate adjustments                                                   | -/four.tf               | -/one.tf/three.tf                         | -                         | -/one.tf/seven.tf                        |\n| /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf                     | /five.tf/nine.tf        | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/six.tf/three.tf  | /three.tf/four.tf/nine.tf | /one.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/seven.tf/one.tf |\n| Of which:                                                                   |                         |                                           |                           |                                          |\n| Classified as non-current                                                   | -                       | /five.tf/four.tf/two.tf                   | /one.tf/five.tf/zero.tf   | /six.tf/nine.tf/two.tf                   |\n| Classified as current                                                       | /five.tf/nine.tf        | /five.tf/two.tf/one.tf                    | /one.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf   | /seven.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf               |\n| Non-current provisions expected to   be realised after more than five years | -                       | /six.tf/four.tf                           | /one.tf/three.tf          | /seven.tf/seven.tf                       |\n\nRestructuring includes provisions for decided and publicly announced restructurings.

The resolution of legal disputes through either negotiations or litigation can take several years to be reached and the outcomes are subject to considerable uncertainty.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nProvisions are recognised when A.P. Moller - Maersk has a present legal or constructive obligation from past events. The item includes, among other things, legal disputes, provisions for onerous contracts, unfavourable contracts acquired as part of a business combination, as well as provisions for incurred, but not yet reported, incidents under certain insurance programmes, primarily in the USA. Provisions are recognised based on best estimates and discounted where the time element is significant and where the time of settle ment is reasonably determinable.",

M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' share of the profit/loss for the year divided by the average number of shares outstanding (of DKK 1,000 each), excluding A.P. Moller - Maersk's holding of own shares. Diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the dilutive effect of the average number of share options outstanding issued by the parent company.\n\nEquity includes total comprehensive income for the year comprising the profit/loss for the year and other comprehensive income. Proceeds on the purchase and sale of own shares and dividend from such shares are recognised in equity.\n\nThe translation reserve comprises A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of accumulated exchange rate differences arising on translation from functional currency into presentation currency. The reserve for other equity investments comprises accumulated changes in the fair value of equity investments (at FVOCI), net of tax. Reserve for hedges includes the accumulated fair value of derivatives qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting, net of tax, as well as forward points and currency basis spread.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes a dividend to the shareholders of DKK 2,500 per share of DKK 1,000 - a total of DKK 46.8bn, equivalent to USD 7.1bn (DKK 330 per share of DKK 1,000 - total of DKK 6.4bn equivalent to USD 1.0bn). Payment of dividends is expected to take place on 18 March 2022. Payment of dividends to shareholders does not trigger taxes to A.P. Moller - Maersk.",

Subsequently, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, whereby transaction costs and any premium or discount are recognised as financial expenses over the term of the liabilities. Fixed interest loans subject to fair value hedge accounting are measured at amortised cost with an adjustment for the fair value of the hedged interest component.\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term, at the interest rate implicit in the lease, or at A.P. Moller - Maersk's incremental borrowing rate (IBR). A.P. Moller - Maersk's IBR reflects the Group's credit risk, leased amount, and contract duration, as well as the nature and quality of the asset's security and economic environment in which the leased assets operate. To determine the IBR, where possible, A.P. Moller - Maersk uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, with adjustments to reflect changes in financing conditions since that financing was received. Where such financing is not available, A.P. Moller - Maersk uses a build-up approach that starts with a riskfree interest rate adjusted by credit risk and specific risks faced by the lessee such as asset type, geographical risks, etc.\n\nSubsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost with each lease payment allocated between the repayment of the liability and financing cost. The finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period using the IBR that was used to discount the lease payments.\n\nThe following lease payments are included in the net present value:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit/loss.\n\nExtension and termination options in lease contracts are included in contracts, where it is reasonably certain that A.P. Moller - Maersk will exercise the options. These terms are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended or not terminated. Most of the extension and termination options held are exercisable only by A.P. Moller - Maersk and not by the respective lessor. This assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this assessment, and which is within the control of the lessee. Where A.P. Moller - Maersk will probably exercise specific purchase options, those options are included in the measurement of the lease liability with corresponding right-of-use asset depreciated over the asset's useful life rather than lease term.\n\n## Note 4.3  Pensions and similar obligations\n\n|                                                       | UK /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf          | Other /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | Total /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf         | UK /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf        | Other /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   | Total /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Speci/fication of net liability                       |                                           |                                       |                                             |                                          |                                        |                                             |\n| Present value of funded plans                         | /two.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/three.tf/three.tf | /five.tf/zero.tf/five.tf              | /two.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/three.tf/eight.tf | /two.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/two.tf/seven.tf | /five.tf/one.tf/six.tf                 | /two.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/four.tf/three.tf   |\n| Fair value of plan assets                             | -/two.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/five.tf/two.tf  | -/four.tf/zero.tf/six.tf              | -/two.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/five.tf/eight.tf | -/two.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/nine.tf/one.tf  | -/four.tf/one.tf/six.tf                | -/three.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf |\n| Net liability of funded plans                         | -/two.tf/one.tf/nine.tf                   | /nine.tf/nine.tf                      | -/one.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                     | -/two.tf/six.tf/four.tf                  | /one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                | -/one.tf/six.tf/four.tf                     |\n| Present value of unfunded plans                       | -

Generally, the pension plans within the Group are defined contribution plans, where contributions are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. A number of entities have defined benefit plans, in which retirement benefits are based on length of service and salary level. To a limited extent, these defined benefit plans also include payment of medical expenses, etc.\n\nIn 2022, the Group expects to pay contributions totalling USD 36m (USD 16m) to funded defined benefit plans.\n\nThe majority of the Group's defined benefit liabilities are 79% in the UK and 12% in the USA. All of the plans in the UK and the majority of the plans in the USA are funded. Although all of the UK plans are now closed to new entrants, active members in the two largest plans continue to accrue new benefits. The smaller UK plans are all closed to new accruals, although a salary link remains in some of the plans.\n\nOverall, the plans have an average duration of 15 years and approximately 59% of the obligation is in respect of pensioner members.\n\nAs well as being subject to the risks of falling interest rates, which would increase the obligation, poor asset returns and pensioners living longer than anticipated, the Group is also subject to the risk of higher-thanexpected inflation. This is because many pension benefits, particularly in the UK plans, increase in line with inflation although some minimum and maximum limits apply.",

The Group assumes that future improvements will be in line with the latest projections of 1.25% for all UK plans.\n\nThe liabilities are calculated using assumptions that are the Group's best estimate of future experience bearing in mind the requirements of IAS 19.\n\nThe Group's plans are funded in accordance with applicable local legislation. In the UK, each plan has a Trustee Board that is required to act in the best interests of plan members. Every three years, a formal valuation of the plan's liabilities is carried out using a prudent basis, and if the plan is in deficit, the Trustees agree with the Group or the sponsoring employer on a plan for recovering that deficit.\n\nAround 80% of the UK liabilities are now covered by insurance policies. Therefore, movement in the liabilities due to change in assumptions would equally impact the assets value related to the buy-in policies, resulting in a reduced movement in the overall balance sheet position.\n\nNo contributions to the UK plans are expected for 2022 (compared to USD 11m in 2021 of which USD 9m was deficit recovery contributions). In most of the UK plans, any surplus remaining after the last member dies may be returned to the Group. However, the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (MNRPF), and the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF) contributions paid by the Group are not refundable in any circumstance and the balance sheet liability reflects an adjustment for any agreed deficit recovery contributions in excess of deficit determined using the Group's assumptions. In 2021 an adjustment of USD 3m (USD 3m) was applied in this respect.\n\nOther than the insurance contracts and a small proportion of other holdings, the plan assets held by the Group are quoted investments.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\n## Provisions for pension and other employee benefits\n\nFor defined benefit schemes, management makes assumptions about future remuneration and pension changes, employee attrition rates, discount rates, inflation rates and life expectancy. When setting these assumptions, management considers advice from the actuaries performing the valuation. The inflation and discount rates are determined centrally for the major plans on a country-by-country basis. All other assumptions are determined on a plan-by-plan basis. Refer to the table to the left for the sensitivity of the liability to changes in these assumptions.\n\nPlan assets are measured at fair value by fund administrators.",

In general, the contributions to the schemes are based on man hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.\n\nFor the defined benefit pension plans, the Group has joint and several liabilities to fund total obligations. While the welfare/medical plans are by nature contribution plans funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. In 2021, the Group's contributions to the pension and welfare/medical plans are estimated at USD 97m (USD 91m) and USD 320m (USD 277m), respectively. The contributions to be paid in 2022 are estimated at USD 97m (USD 92m) for the pension plans and USD 335m (USD 279m) for the welfare/medical plans.\n\nNo reliable basis exists for allocation of the schemes' obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants. For the pension plans where the Group has an interest and there is a deficit, the net obligations for all employers amount to USD 97m (USD 0.3bn). This net obligation is based on the most recent available financial data from the plan's trustees, calculated in accordance with the rules for such actuarial calculation in US GAAP. The deficit in some of the schemes may necessitate increased contributions in the future. Welfare/ medical plans are pay-as-you-go and form a part of the Group's US collective bargaining agreements. They cover a limited part of employees' medical costs as occurred.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nPension obligations are the net liabilities of defined benefit obligations and the dedicated assets adjusted for the effect of minimum funding and asset ceiling requirements. Plans with a funding surplus are presented as net assets on the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the balance sheet date. Plan assets are measured at fair value. The pension cost charged to the income statement consists of calculated amounts for vested benefits and interest in addition to settlement of gains or losses, etc. Interest on plan assets is calculated with the same rates as used for discounting the obligations. Actuarial gains/losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nPension plans where A.P. Moller - Maersk, as part of collective bargaining agreements, participates together with other enterprises - so called multi-employer plans - are treated as other pension plans in the financial statements. Defined benefit multi-employer plans, where sufficient information to apply defined benefit accounting is not available, are treated as defined contribution plans.",

financial markets and seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\n\nRisk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's entities.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.

        "page_content": "## Note 4.5  Financial instruments and risks - continued\n\nThe sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2021. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nHedges comprise primarily currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives, which are further described in the following sections.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Group's currency risk relates to the fact that while income from Ocean activities is denominated mainly in USD, the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as EUR, DKK, HKD, SGD and CAD. As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. Income and expenses from other activities, including Terminals & Towage, are mainly denominated in local currencies, thus reducing the Group's exposure to these currencies.\n\nThe main purpose of hedging the Group's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Group's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Group's profit. The Group uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are:\n\n- \u00b7 Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-month horizon\n- \u00b7 Significant capital commitments or divestments in other currencies than USD are hedged\n- \u00b7 Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on the asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.\n\nCurrency derivatives hedge future revenue, operating costs and investments/divestments, and are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement and the cost of property, plant and equipment, respectively. There is not any proxy hedging for the currency risk hedging, and therefore the economic relationship between the hedged exposure and the hedge is high. Effectiveness is assessed using the critical terms match approach according to IFRS 9.\n\nHedges of future revenue and operating costs matures within a year (mature within a year). Hedges of investments matures within a year (no hedges of investments).\n\nFor hedges related to operating cash flows and investments, a loss of USD 150m in 2021 (gain of USD 95m) is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the cash flow hedge reserve amounts to a loss of USD 41m at 31 December (gain of USD 109m). For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the forward points are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred with the effective hedge when the hedged transaction occurs. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to USD 0m (USD 0m). There was no ineffectiveness in 2021 (USD 3m).\n\nBesides the designated cash flow hedges in the table, the Group uses derivatives to hedge currency exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivatives are classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe average FX hedge rates for swaps in cash flow hedge were EUR/USD 1.18 (1.24), GBP/USD 1.52 (1.52), and USD/NOK 8.25 (8.22). The average FX hedge rates for swaps in combined fair value hedge were EUR/USD 1.24 (1.24), GBP/USD 1.52 (1.52), USD/NOK 8.25 (8.25), and USD/JPY 119.39 (119.39).\n\n| Hedge of operating cash flows and investments   in foreign currencies   | Fair value/comma.tf   asset   | Fair value/comma.tf   liability   | Nominal  amount of  derivative          | Average   hedge rate                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Main currencies hedged                                                  |                               |                                   |                                         |                                       |\n| 2021                                                                    |                               |                                   |                                         |                                       |\n| EUR                                                                     | /five.tf                      | /two.tf/five.tf                   | /eight.tf/seven.tf/six.tf               | /one.tf/period.tf/two.tf/zero.tf      |\n| DKK                                                                     | -

The Group strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a modified duration range and is primarily obtained using interest rate swaps. The modified duration of the Group's debt portfolio is 2.8 (2.1) excluding IFRS 16 leases.\n\nA general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all else being equal, to affect profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, positively by approx. USD 152m (positively by USD 39m) and positively by approx. USD 146m (positively by USD 30m), respectively.\n\nThis analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is done by cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The hedging is a mix of fair value hedging, combined fair value hedging and cash flow hedging.\n\nIneffectiveness from cash flow hedges due to buy-back of issued bonds is recognised in the income statement with USD 0m (loss of USD 12m).\n\nThe hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relationship between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the change in basis spread is recognised in other comprehensive income and is a time effect during the lifetime of the swap and at maturity amounts to 0. If the hedged transaction is prepaid, the change in basis spread will be recognised in profit or loss as ineffectiveness. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to a gain of USD 6m (gain of USD 6m).",

processing and re-sale. The oil price risk arising from these oil price exposures is mitigated by entering into commodity derivative agreements. The overall exposure limit is set in the Group's risk policy, defining a maximum net open position for the Group. On 31 December 2021, the Group has entered into oil derivative positions shown in the table.",

To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties, and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach to providing the expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. In accordance with IFRS 9, non-due trade receivables have also been considered for impairment.\n\nApproximately 44% (89%) of the provision for bad debt is related to trade receivables overdue by more than one year.\n\n## Other /financial assets at amortised cost\n\nOther financial assets at amortised cost comprise loans receivable, finance lease receivables and other receivables. These financial assets are considered to have low credit risk, and thus the impairment provision calculated based on 12 months of expected losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have a low risk of default, and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.",

The equity share of total equity and liabilities was 63% (55%) at the end of 2021.\n\nFor information about cash and bank balances in countries with exchange control or other restrictions, please see text to the consolidated cash flow statement.\n\nThe Group has placed USD 5bn in term deposits (more than three months), which is included in the liquidity reserve (USD 0m). The term deposits are recognised as loan receivables. Deposits and bank balances are primarily held in relationship banks with a credit rating of at least A-.

At that time, the accumulated gains/losses are transferred to the items under which the hedged transactions are recognised. The effective portion of changes in the value of derivative financial instruments used to hedge the value of recognised financial assets and liabilities is recognised in the income statement together with changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities that can be attributed to the hedging relationship. Currency basis spread and forward points are considered a cost of hedging and deferred in equity.\n\nThe ineffective portion of hedge transactions and changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses for interest and currency-based instruments, and as other income/costs for oil price hedges and forward freight agreements.\n\n## Note 4.6  Financial instruments by category\n\n|                                                          | Carrying amount

Non-listed shares and other securities are within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of derivatives is mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period. A minor amount of crude oil price derivatives is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows.\n\nA reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the Group's profit or equity significantly.\n\n## Financial instruments carried at amortised cost\n\nFair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.\n\nFair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on discounted future cash flows.",

These regimes apply to the vast majority of A.P. Moller - Maersk's activities and result in a stable annual tax liability. Given the liability to tonnage tax is not impacted by financial profits, and is payable even in loss making years, the effective tax rate (ETR) metric can fluctuate significantly.\n\nDisclosures for 2020 tax reconciliation have been adjusted, where USD 854m is moved from profit subject to corporate income tax to profit subject to tonnage taxation. The change has no impact on expensed or paid taxes.\n\n|                                                                    | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf                        | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf               |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Tax recognised in the income statement                             |                                                      |                                              |\n| Current tax on profits for the year                                | /five.tf/eight.tf/two.tf                             | /two.tf/nine.tf/three.tf                     |\n| Adjustment for current tax of prior periods                        | /nine.tf/three.tf                                    | -/two.tf/eight.tf                            |\n| Utilisation of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets         | -/six.tf                                             | -/six.tf                                     |\n| Total current tax                                                  | /six.tf/six.tf/nine.tf                               | /two.tf/five.tf/nine.tf                      |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences                  | -/five.tf/eight.tf                                   | /one.tf/one.tf                               |\n| Adjustment for deferred tax of prior periods                       | /one.tf/zero.tf                                      | /seven.tf                                    |\n| Adjustment attributable to changes in tax rates and laws           | -/five.tf                                            | -/three.tf                                   |\n| Recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets         | -/seven.tf/nine.tf                                   | -/seven.tf                                   |\n| Reassessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets/comma.tf net | /two.tf/two.tf                                       | /four.tf/six.tf                              |\n| Total deferred tax                                                 | -/one.tf/one.tf/zero.tf                              | /five.tf/four.tf                             |\n| Total income tax                                                   | /five.tf/five.tf/nine.tf                             | /three.tf/one.tf/three.tf                    |\n| Tonnage and freight tax                                            | /one.tf/three.tf/eight.tf                            | /nine.tf/four.tf                             |\n| Total tax expense                                                  | /six.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf                             | /four.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf                    |\n| Tax reconciliation                                                 |                                                      |                                              |\n| Profit before tax                                                  | /one.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/three.tf/zero.tf  | /three.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf |\n| Profit/loss subject to Danish and foreign tonnage taxation, etc.   | -/one.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf | -/three.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/six.tf/four.tf   |\n| Internal gain/loss on sale of assets                               | -

There are no substantial unrecognised tax liabilities on investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nJudgement has been applied with respect to A.P. Moller - Maersk's ability to utilise deferred tax assets. Management considers the likelihood of utilisation based on the latest business plans and the recent financial performances of the individual entities. Net deferred tax assets recognised in entities having recognised an accounting loss in either the current or preceding period amount to USD 124m (USD 87m), excluding entities participating in joint taxation schemes. These assets mainly relate to unused tax losses or deductible temporary differences generated during the construction of terminals, where taxable profits have been generated either in the current period or are expected to be generated within the foreseeable future.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is engaged in a number of disputes with tax authorities of varying scope. Appropriate provisions and recognition of uncertain tax positions have been made where the probability of the tax position being upheld in individual cases is considered less than 50%. Claims, for which the probability of A.P. Moller - Maersk's tax position being upheld is assessed by management to be at least 50%, are not provided for. Such risks are instead evaluated on a portfolio basis by geographical area and country risk. Provisions and uncertain tax liabilities are recognised when the aggregated probability of the tax position being upheld is considered less than 50%.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nTax comprises an estimate of current and deferred income tax as well as adjustments to previous years taxes. Income tax is tax on taxable profits, and consists of corporation tax, withholding tax of dividends, etc. In addition, tax comprises tonnage tax. Tonnage tax is classified as tax when creditable in, or paid in lieu of, income tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement to the extent that it arises from items recognised in the income statement, including tax on gains on intra-group transactions that have been eliminated in the consolidation.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, where at the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable profit/loss is affected, unless the differences arise in a business combination. In addition, no deferred tax is recognised for undistributed earnings in subsidiaries, when A.P. Moller - Maersk controls the timing of dividends. No taxable dividends are currently expected. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that it can be utilised within a foreseeable future.",

For members of the Executive Board the vesting period is five years.\n\nThe employees are not entitled to any dividends during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc. A part of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' treasury B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in connection with the restricted shares plan.\n\nThe remuneration expense related to the restricted shares plan is USD 9m (USD 6m).\n\nThe average remaining contractual life for the restricted shares as per 31 December 2021 is 1.8 years (1.8 years).\n\n|                                                                      | Members of  the Executive  Board                  | Employees                                            | Total                                                  | Average   exercise   price /uni00B9                | Total fair  value   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Outstanding share options                                            | No/period.tf                                      | No/period.tf                                         | No/period.tf                                           | DKK                                                | USD million         |\n| /one.tf January /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                       | /one.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf  | /five.tf/six.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/six.tf       | /six.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/two.tf/five.tf      | /nine.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/five.tf/seven.tf         |                     |\n| Granted                                                              | /eight.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/four.tf/one.tf        | /three.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/eight.tf/three.tf | /four.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/two.tf/four.tf        | /eight.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/three.tf/nine.tf         | /four.tf            |\n| Exercised /uni00B9                                                   | -                                                 | /one.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/four.tf/six.tf     | /one.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/four.tf/six.tf       | /nine.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/six.tf/eight.tf          |                     |\n| Forfeited                                                            | -                                                 | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf/three.tf           | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf/three.tf             | /nine.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/three.tf/six.tf           |                     |\n| Outstanding /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/four.tf/zero.tf  | /six.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf   | /eight.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/three.tf/zero.tf   | /eight.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf         |                     |\n| Exercisable /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/four.tf/seven.tf        | /three.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/seven.tf/four.tf   | /three.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/two.tf/one.tf      | /one.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf  |                     |\n| Granted                                                              | /seven.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/two.tf/three.tf       | /two.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf/one.tf     | /two.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/one.tf/four.tf        | /one.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/five.tf/four.tf | /one.tf/seven.tf    |\n| Exercised /uni00B9                                                   | /two.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/three.tf/three.tf        | /one.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/five.tf/zero.tf     | /one.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf/three.tf   | /nine.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf        |                     |\n| Outstanding /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  | /two.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/three.tf/zero.tf | /seven.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/three.tf/one.tf | /one.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/six.tf/one.tf | /nine.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf/three.tf       |                     |\n| Exercisable /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  | /three.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/nine.tf/six.tf         | /four.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf           | /seven.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/seven.tf/six.tf             | /nine.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/four.tf/one.tf           |                     |\n\n- 1  The weighted average share price at the dates of exercise of share options exercised in 2021 was DKK 16,490 (DKK 12,389).\n\n## Share options plan\n\nIn addition to the restricted shares plan, A.P. Moller - Maersk has share option plans for members of the Executive Board and other key employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S.\n\nThe share options are granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S'  most recent Annual Report. Exercise of the share options is contingent upon the option holder still being employed at the time of vesting, which takes place when three years have passed from the date of grant. The share options can then be exercised when at least three years and no more than six years (seven years for share options granted to employees not members of the Executive Board) have passed from the date of grant. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc.\n\nThe share options can only be settled in shares. A part of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in respect of the share option plans.\n\nThe remuneration expense related to the share option plan is USD 8m (USD 5m).\n\nThe average remaining contractual life as per 31 December 2021 is 4.8 years (5.1 years).",

The Group does not expect these to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nTax may crystallise on repatriation of dividends. Through participation in a joint taxation scheme with A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding A/S, the Danish companies are jointly and severally liable for taxes payable, etc., in Denmark.\n\nAs part of the divestment of M\u00e6rsk Olie & Gas A/S (MOGAS) to Total S.A. in 2018, A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S has assumed a secondary liability related to the decommissioning of the offshore facilities in Denmark by issuance of a declaration. A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S assesses the risk of economic outflows because of this secondary liability as very remote.\n\n## Note 5.5  Cash flow specifications\n\n|                                                                 | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf              | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Change in working capital                                       |                                            |                                           |\n| Trade receivables                                               | -/one.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf  | -/one.tf/one.tf/five.tf                   |\n| Other working capital movements                                 | /three.tf/four.tf/six.tf                   | -/eight.tf/eight.tf                       |\n| Exchange rate adjustment of working capital                     | -/four.tf/seven.tf                         | -/three.tf/six.tf                         |\n| Total                                                           | -/one.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/one.tf/zero.tf    | -/two.tf/three.tf/nine.tf                 |\n| Purchase of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment |                                            |                                           |\n| Addition                                                        | -/eight.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/four.tf/zero.tf | -/two.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/two.tf/nine.tf  |\n| Of which right-of-use assets/comma.tf etc/period.tf             | /four.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/one.tf/seven.tf | /one.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/seven.tf/five.tf |\n| Of which borrowing costs capitalised on assets                  | /five.tf                                   | /seven.tf                                 |\n| Change in payables to suppliers regarding purchase of assets    | /five.tf/four.tf/two.tf                    | /two.tf/five.tf                           |\n| Total                                                           | -/two.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf/six.tf  | -/one.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/two.tf/two.tf  |\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS\n\n## Operations in countries with limited access to repatriating surplus cash\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk operates worldwide and, in this respect, has operations in countries where the ability to repatriate surplus cash is complicated and time consuming. In these countries, management makes judgements as to whether these cash positions can be recognised as cash or cash equivalents.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nCash /flow from operating activities includes all cash transactions other than cash flows arising from investing and financing activities such as investments and divestments, received dividends, principal payments of loans, instalments on lease liabilities, paid and received financial items and equity transactions. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is considered as a non-cash item, and the actual payments of these borrowing costs are included in cash flow from financing.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances net of bank overdrafts where overdraft facilities form an integral part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's cash management.",

M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.\n\nThe accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2021, except for the changes to accounting standards that were effective from 1 January 2021 and were endorsed by the EU.\n\nA number of changes to accounting standards are effective from 1 January 2021 and endorsed by the EU: Amendments to IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments (IBOR reform): The changes will impact some of Maersk's existing IBOR referenced loans, swaps and facilities, which will be amended over the course of 2022. The changes are not expected to have material impact.\n\nOther changes are not expected to impact the financial statements.\n\nThe accounting policies are furthermore consistent with the accounting policies for the Group's financial statements with the following exceptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Shares in subsidiaries and associated companies are measured at cost or a lower recoverable amount\n- \u00b7 Dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised as income at the time of declaration unless considered a return of capital in subsidiary\n- \u00b7 No segment information is disclosed\n- \u00b7 Value of granted share options, restricted shares and performance shares to employees in subsidiaries is expensed directly in the relevant subsidiary. At the time of the grant, the subsidiary settles the amount with A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S and the counter posting is made in equity. At the time of exercising, the proceeds are included in the company's equity.\n\n## New financial reporting requirements\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk A/S has not yet adopted the following accounting standards and requirements:\n\nIFRS 17 - Insurance contracts: An analysis of the impact is being assessed and is expected to be concluded in due course ahead of the implementation date.\n\nOther changes to IFRS are not expected to have any significant impact on recognition and measurement.\n\n## Note 1.2   Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements on an ongoing basis and to form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management forms its estimates and judgements based on historical experience, independent advice, external data points, as well as on in-house specialists and on other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nEstimates that are material to the company's financial reporting are made on the determination of impairment of financial non-current assets including subsidiaries and associated companies. Reference is made to notes 3.1, 3.2 and 4.3.\n\nManagement assesses impairment indicators for investments in subsidiaries and associated companies and in general determines the recoverable amounts consistent with the assumptions described in note 3.2 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe significant accounting estimates and judgements are described in further detail in the consolidated financial statements.",

The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the company's entities.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the company's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The sensitivity analyses in the currency risk and interest rate risk sections relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2021. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.",

The company uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-month horizon\n- \u00b7 Significant capital commitments or divestments in other currencies than USD are hedged\n- \u00b7 Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on the asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.\n\n|                  | Profit before tax             | Profit before tax              | Equity before tax             | Equity before tax              |\n|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                  | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf |\n| DKK              | -/six.tf/five.tf              | -/four.tf/two.tf               | -/six.tf/five.tf              | -/four.tf/two.tf               |\n| EUR              | -/one.tf/five.tf              | -/nine.tf/one.tf               | -/one.tf/five.tf              | -/nine.tf/one.tf               |\n| Other currencies | -/two.tf/five.tf              | -/two.tf/three.tf              | -/two.tf/five.tf              | -/two.tf/three.tf              |\n| Total            | -/one.tf/zero.tf/five.tf      | -/one.tf/five.tf/six.tf        | -/one.tf/zero.tf/five.tf      | -/one.tf/five.tf/six.tf        |\n\nThe company enters into derivatives to hedge currency exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

The company strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a modified duration range and is primarily obtained using interest rate swaps. The modified duration of the company's debt portfolio is 3.0 (2.1) excluding IFRS 16 Leases.\n\nA general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all thing else being equal, to affect profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, positively by approx. USD 91m and positively by approx. USD 48m, respectively (positively by approx. USD 151m and positively by approx. USD 96m, respectively).\n\nThis analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is done by cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The hedging is a mix of fair value hedging, combined fair value hedging and cash flow hedging.\n\nDue to buy-back of issued bonds in 2021, ineffectiveness from cash flow hedges is recognised in the income statement with a loss of USD 0m (USD 12m).\n\nThe hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relationship between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the change in basis spread is recognised in other comprehensive income and is a time effect during the lifetime of the swap and at maturity amounts to 0. If the hedged transaction is prepaid, the change in basis spread will be recognised in profit or loss as ineffectiveness. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to a gain of USD 6m (USD 6m).",

commercial counterparties but has no particular concentration of customers or suppliers. To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties, and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.\n\nFinancial assets at amortised cost comprise loans receivable, lease receivables, and other receivables. These are all considered to have low credit risk and thus the impairment provision calculated based on 12 months of expected losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have low risk of default and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.\n\nOther financial assets at amortised cost include loans to subsidiaries. As of 31 December 2021, the loans amount to USD 4.9bn (USD 17.2bn) and are considered to have a low credit risk, thus the impairment provision to be recognised during the period is limited to 12 months of expected losses. The credit risk has not increased significantly since the initial recognition and is considered low based on the investment grade credit rating for the Group and consequently the financial strength of the major subsidiaries within the Group. Prior years' loan write-down balance on Maersk Supply Service A/S loan receivables was reversed in 2021.\n\n| Maturity analysis of trade receivables incl/period.tf subsidiaries/comma.tf etc/period.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Receivables not due                                                                         | /one.tf                         | /two.tf                          |\n| Less than /nine.tf/zero.tf days overdue                                                     | /six.tf                         | /one.tf                          |\n| Receivables/comma.tf gross                                                                  | /seven.tf                       | /three.tf                        |\n| Carrying amount                                                                             | /seven.tf                       | /three.tf                        |\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nIt is of great importance for the company to maintain a financial reserve to cover the company's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the company's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.\n\nThe flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to on going prioritisation and optimisation, among other things by focusing on the release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.",

Non-listed shares and other securities fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of derivatives falls mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of observable market data as of the end of the reporting period.\n\nFair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the company's profit or equity significantly.\n\n## Financial instruments carried at amortised cost\n\nFair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.\n\nFair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of discounted interests and instalments.",

Each restricted share granted is a right to receive an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S.\n\nTransfer of restricted shares is contingent upon the employee still being employed and not being under notice of termination and takes place when three years have passed from the date of grant. For members of the Executive Board, the vesting period is five years.\n\nThe employees are not entitled to any dividends during the vesting period. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the Company's capital structure, etc. A part of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' treasury B shares will be used to meet the Company's obligations in connection with the restricted shares plan.\n\nThe remuneration expense related to the restricted shares plan is USD 2m (USD 1m).\n\nThe average remaining contractual life for the restricted shares as per 31 December 2021 is 1.8 years (1.8 years).\n\n|                                                                      | Members of  the Executive  Board/uni00B9          | Employees/uni00B9                                    | Total                                                  | Average   exercise   price /uni00B9                | Total fair  value   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Outstanding share options                                            | No/period.tf                                      | No/period.tf                                         | No/period.tf                                           | DKK                                                | USD million         |\n| /one.tf January /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                       | /one.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf  | /five.tf/six.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/six.tf       | /six.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/two.tf/five.tf      | /nine.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/five.tf/seven.tf         |                     |\n| Granted                                                              | /eight.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/four.tf/one.tf        | /three.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/eight.tf/three.tf | /four.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/two.tf/four.tf        | /eight.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/three.tf/nine.tf         | /four.tf            |\n| Exercised /uni00B9                                                   | -                                                 | /one.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/four.tf/six.tf     | /one.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/four.tf/six.tf       | /nine.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/six.tf/eight.tf          |                     |\n| Forfeited                                                            | -                                                 | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf/three.tf           | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf/three.tf             | /nine.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/three.tf/six.tf           |                     |\n| Outstanding /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/four.tf/zero.tf  | /six.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf   | /eight.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/three.tf/zero.tf   | /eight.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf         |                     |\n| Exercisable /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/four.tf/seven.tf        | /three.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/seven.tf/four.tf   | /three.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/two.tf/one.tf      | /one.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf  |                     |\n| Granted                                                              | /seven.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/two.tf/three.tf       | /two.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf/one.tf     | /two.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/one.tf/four.tf        | /one.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/five.tf/four.tf | /one.tf/seven.tf    |\n| Exercised /uni00B9                                                   | /two.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/three.tf/three.tf        | /one.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/five.tf/zero.tf     | /one.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf/three.tf   | /nine.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf        |                     |\n| Outstanding /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  | /two.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/three.tf/zero.tf | /seven.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/three.tf/one.tf | /one.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/six.tf/one.tf | /nine.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf/three.tf       |                     |\n| Exercisable /three.tf/one.tf December /two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf  | /three.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/nine.tf/six.tf         | /four.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf           | /seven.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/seven.tf/six.tf             | /nine.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/four.tf/one.tf           |                     |\n\n- 1  The weighted average share price at the dates of exercise of share options exercised in 2021 was DKK 16,490 (DKK 12,389).\n\n## Share option plans\n\nIn addition to the restricted shares plan, A.P. Moller - Maersk has share option plans for members of the Executive Board and other key employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S.\n\nThe share options are granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' most recent Annual Report. Exercise of the share options is contingent upon the option holder still being employed at the time of vesting which takes place when three years have passed from the date of grant. The share options can then be exercised when at least three years and no more than six years (seven years for share options granted to employees not members of the Executive Board) have passed from the date of grant. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death and resignation as well as changes in the Company's capital structure, etc.\n\nThe share options can only be settled in shares. A part of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' holding of own B shares will be used to meet the Company's obligations in respect of the share option plans.\n\nThe remuneration expense related to the share options plan is USD 3m (USD 1m).\n\nThe average remaining contractual life as per 31 December 2021 is 4.8 years (5.1 years).",

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nRecognition of revenue is complex due to the volume of transactions and the variety of different revenue streams within the segments.\n\nWe focused on this area due to the significance of amounts involved and because recognition of revenue involves accounting policy decisions, and judgements made by Management originating from different customer behavior, market conditions, terms and nature of services in the various segments. Further, the volume of transactions and extent of different revenue streams involves internal control and various IT applications to ensure correct revenue recognition, which are complex and introduce an inherent risk to the revenue recognition process.\n\nReference is made to note 2.1 in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nOur audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the revenue recognition accounting policies and assessing compliance with applicable accounting standards.\n\nWe tested relevant IT applications and IT dependencies supporting revenue recognition as well as relevant internal controls and Management's monitoring hereof.\n\nWe used data analytics on selected revenue streams and performed substantive procedures over invoicing and relevant contracts in order to assess the accounting treatment and principles applied, and tested journal entries on revenue. Further, we tested timing to ensure that the revenue is recognised in the correct financial year. Finally, we evaluated disclosures provided by Management in the financial statements.\n\n## Statement on the Management review\n\nManagement is responsible for the Management review (pages 5 to 76, 149 and 151).\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management review and, in doing so, consider whether the Management review is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nMoreover, we considered whether the Management review includes the disclosures required by the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, in our view, the Management review is in accordance with the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatement in the Management review.\n\n## Management's responsibilities for the financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's and the parent company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group or the parent company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence and, where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

This responsibility includes:\n\n- \u00b7 The preparing of the annual report in XHTML format;\n- \u00b7 The selection and application of appropriate iXBRL tags, including extensions to the ESEF taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for all financial information required to be tagged using judgement where necessary;\n- \u00b7 Ensuring consistency between iXBRL tagged data and the consolidated financial statements presented in human-readable format; and\n- \u00b7 For such internal control as Management determines necessary to enable the preparation of an annual report that is compliant with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the annual report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation based on the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a report that includes our opinion. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- \u00b7 Testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of the company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and\n- \u00b7 Reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of A.P.
