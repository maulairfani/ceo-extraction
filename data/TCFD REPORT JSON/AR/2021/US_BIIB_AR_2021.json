Our emphasis on scienti/fic advancements in service of humanity has driven our leadership in multiple sclerosis (MS), our innovation in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and our success in biosimilars. We also achieved important milestones, including:\n\n- -FDA approval of ADUHELM (aducanumab-avwa), the /first novel therapy approved for Alzheimer's disease since 2003.\n- -Important data readouts for potential treatments in depression, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n- -The formation of Biogen Digital Health, a global unit dedicated to pioneering personalized and digital medicine in neuroscience.\n\nNeuroscience, Biogen's principal area of focus, is an attractive /field with great potential for innovation and scienti/fic breakthroughs that address signi/ficant unmet needs of patients living with devastating diseases.'\n\nMichel Vounatsos, Chief Executive Of/ficer\n\nTo fully realize the signi/ficant opportunity we see ahead, we are pursuing a strategic plan that leverages our core competencies in neurology and in related growth areas.\n\n## Alzheimer's Disease Update\n\nIn June 2021, the FDA granted accelerated approval to ADUHELM, the /first treatment directed at an underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, the presence of amyloid beta plaques in the brain.\n\nADUHELM's introduction to the market proceeded more slowly than we would have hoped amid questions around the product's mechanism of action and clinical data. In April 2022, we were disappointed that the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued an unprecedented /final coverage determination that effectively denies all Medicare bene/ficiaries access to ADUHELM. This ruling may also limit coverage for any future FDAapproved treatment in the class.\n\nThis is not the /first time a new class of therapy on the cutting edge of scienti/fic discovery has faced headwinds. We continue to believe that ADUHELM",

        "page_content": "## CEO Letter\n\nrepresents the /first major innovation in decades and the beginning of what we hope will be a wave of new developments in this area. To this end, we continue to advance lecanemab, another amyloid-beta targeting investigational therapy under development in our collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd. (Eisai). In June 2021, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for lecanemab, and in December 2021 lecanemab also received Fast Track designation. The readout of the Phase/uni00A03 con/firmatory Clarity AD clinical trial is expected in the fall of 2022, and it is currently under rolling submission for a Biologics License Application (BLA) under the accelerated approval pathway, with /filing expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nWhen additional data from this new class of treatments become available, we will request that CMS reconsider its coverage decision for all FDA-approved amyloid-beta targeting therapies. Biogen continues to advocate for patients to have rapid and equitable access to all FDAapproved therapies to treat Alzheimer's disease and for the continuity of care for Medicare bene/ficiaries already being treated with ADUHELM.\n\nBeyond our programs targeting amyloid, we are pursuing a multi-modality approach focused on other targets in Alzheimer's disease. In a Phase/uni00A01b study, BIIB080, a tau-directed ASO, met the primary objective of safety and tolerability. Furthermore, data demonstrated a durable time and dose-dependent reduction of tau protein in cerebrospinal /fluid and, based upon these results, we expect to initiate a Phase/uni00A02 study. Growing evidence suggests tau may be a key driver of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. In addition, in February 2022 we initiated a Phase/uni00A01 study for BIIB113, a small molecule with a mechanism of action that targets tau protein aggregation.\n\n## 2021 Pipeline Highlights\n\nWe received signi/ficant data readouts during the year in a number of promising areas.\n\nWe see high potential for zuranolone (BIIB125), an investigational two-week, once-daily drug in development for the potential treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and postpartum depression (PPD), to help transform the treatment of these diseases. Zuranolone now has positive data from /five randomized clinical studies in MDD and PPD. Given the strength of this clinical data and the potentially differentiated pro/file of zuranolone, we are preparing\n\nto start, together with Sage Therapeutics, Inc. (Sage), a rolling submission with the FDA for a New Drug Application for the potential treatment of MDD. We expect to complete the /filing in the U.S. in the second half of this year.\n\nIn stroke, we received positive results from the Phase/uni00A02 study of BIIB131 (TMS-007), in acute ischemic stroke. Acute ischemic stroke accounts for about 87% 1 of all strokes worldwide. Unfortunately, approved thrombolytic agents, the current standard of care, are limited in their use due to their bene/fitrisk pro/file in later time windows where they are administered within 3 to 4.5 hours 1 of symptom onset. During the Phase/uni00A02a study, patients were dosed 4.5 to 12 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms, with treatment times averaging approximately 9.5/uni00A0hours. Patients who received BIIB131 experienced no symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. In addition, the study demonstrated signi/ficant impacts on blood vessel reopening and patient functional recovery.\n\nAs we advance BIIB131, we also have BIIB093 (glibenclamide IV), currently in Phase/uni00A03, being studied for the treatment and prevention of severe cerebral edema in large hemispheric infarction, one of the most severe types of ischemic stroke 2 where cerebral edema often leads to high morbidity and mortality.\n\nIn lupus, we announced the /first patient dosed in the Phase/uni00A03 study of BIIB059 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organ systems. The Phase/uni00A03 study will evaluate the clinical ef/ficacy and assess the safety of BIIB059 as compared to placebo. We have set enrollment targets for the study that re/flect the high prevalence of SLE in Black or African American and Hispanic and Latino communities, which are disproportionately impacted by the disease.\n\nALS also remains an area of focus for Biogen, where we continue to engage with regulators to evaluate the next step for tofersen in SOD1 ALS. In the Phase/uni00A03 study, the primary endpoint as measured by the Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) did not reach statistical signi/ficance; however, signs of reduced disease progression across multiple secondary and exploratory endpoints were observed. Furthermore, the totality of evidence from the Phase/uni00A03 and its ongoing openlabel extension showed that participants who started tofersen earlier experienced better outcomes, further suggesting a positive clinical effect.",

        "page_content": "## Advancing Digital Health\n\nRecent advances in the understanding of disease biology, along with an exponential acceleration in technologies, are paving the way for a shift in how diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are diagnosed, measured and treated. This is why in 2021 we formed Biogen Digital Health, a global unit dedicated to pioneering personalized and digital medicine in neuroscience.\n\nprogress of VUMERITY (diroximel fumarate) to treat relapsing MS. In SMA, the global expansion of SPINRAZA contributed to incremental revenue growth year over year outside the U.S. Our work in biosimilars has accelerated over the past few years as we strive to bring greater value to healthcare systems and access to patients while enhancing our own cash /flow generation opportunities.\n\nWe believe that now, more than ever, biology and technology should go hand in hand to better meet patient needs while enabling a shift toward more prevention-focused, affordable and equitable care. Building complementary digital solutions that predict, measure and prevent disease is of particular importance in neuroscience due to the heterogeneity and complexity of measuring neurological disease progression.\n\nWe believe that now, more than ever, biology and technology should go hand in hand to better meet patient needs while enabling a shift toward more prevention-focused, affordable and equitable care.\n\nFor example, developing validated digital biomarkers may enable us to accelerate clinical development and increase the probability of success of our pipeline assets, and also create opportunities for clinicians to better monitor disease progression with more sensitive and predictive measures than those currently available. As pioneers in neuroscience, we will explore synergistic opportunities for digital therapeutics to further address the unmet needs of patients.\n\n## 2021 Financial Performance\n\nOur /financial results for full-year 2021 underscored Biogen's ability to execute in the face of challenges. The company generated GAAP diluted earnings per share of $10.40 and Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $19.13 on $11.0/uni00A0billion in revenue. Notwithstanding generic competition to TECFIDERA (dimethyl fumarate) in the U.S., which materially impacted our revenue base in 2021, we maintained global leadership in MS, including the signi/ficant\n\nDuring the year, we generated approximately $3.6/uni00A0billion in net cash /flow from operations. We spent approximately $250/uni00A0million on capital expenditures, resulting in free cash /flow of approximately $3.4/uni00A0billion 3 . We ended 2021 with $4.7/uni00A0billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and a healthy balance sheet. We expect that we will continue to generate signi/ficant cash /flow in 2022, providing us with multiple options for capital allocation.\n\nLate in 2021, we announced a series of cost reduction measures to lower the company's expenses and bring them in line with our revised revenue expectations. The plan, which we began implementing in early 2022, is expected to yield approximately $500/uni00A0million in annualized savings, a signi/ficant portion of which will be realized this year. Some of these savings will be offset by investments in Biogen's pipeline and strategic initiatives.\n\n## Contributing to a Better World\n\nOur Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) efforts prioritize climate, health and equity, with a focus on vulnerable populations, as well as ongoing leadership in governance, transparency and disclosure. Re/flecting our broader commitment to these priorities, we continued to tie a portion of our employees' and executive of/ficers' compensation to advancing our ESG efforts. ESG oversight is formally embedded into our Board's Governance Principles.\n\nOne hallmark of our ESG efforts is Healthy Climate, Healthy Lives\u2122, a $250/uni00A0million initiative to eliminate fossil fuel emissions across our operations by 2040 to contribute to improved public health. In 2021, we grew our electric vehicle program to 12 countries and expanded our environmental impact assessment for key facilities and products. We joined with nine other industry leaders to launch Energize, a bold effort to decarbonize the pharmaceutical value chain.\n\nAnd we did not stop there. We collaborated with global scienti/fic leaders on a meta-analysis of air pollution",

Additionally, we accelerated our ongoing work with MIT to create a state-of-the-art integrated model of how various climate actions impact public health.\n\nWe also have advanced our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) strategy, with an ongoing focus on hiring and engaging a diverse workforce, promoting health equity, and making notable gains in supplier diversity. We shared the results of a global pay equity analysis with employees and publicly disclosed our EEO-1 data (Equal Employment Opportunity), which provides a demographic breakdown of our U.S. workforce by gender and race, and released our /first stand-alone DE&I Report in October 2021.\n\nWe strive to build on our priorities for health equity and access across our operations. For example, we continue to expand efforts globally in order to reach more patients, with a growing focus on low- and middle-income countries. Globally, we are taking further action to ensure that our research and clinical trials are inclusive and representative.\n\nWe aim to remove barriers for treatment and overcome the stigma of dementia. Black or African American and Hispanic and Latino populations are respectively two and one-and-a-half times more likely than older White Americans to have Alzheimer's disease, yet they are also more likely to be diagnosed later in the course of their disease 4 . To change this, we are working with advocates and organizations such as The Balm in Gilead, Inc., the National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, Black Health Matters, the Global Alzheimer's Platform, the National Minority Quality Forum and USAgainstAlzheimer's to improve early detection and care.\n\nWe also continue to invest signi/ficantly in building a diverse talent pipeline through STEM equity education. In 2021, we entered into a collaboration with Morehouse School of Medicine to launch a Health Equity Fellowship program, through which M.D. and/or Ph.D. students will advance projects at Biogen that support more equitable healthcare experiences for patients in underrepresented and underserved communities.\n\nAs a result of our ESG commitments and progress, we were listed as the top biotech leader on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for a seventh time and won the 2021 U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation's best sustainability program award.\n\n## Potential for Growth and Value Creation\n\nWe have entered 2022 with a robust and diversi/fied pipeline, which includes approximately 30 clinical programs across a broad set of disease areas and multiple modalities, 10 of which are in Phase/uni00A03 or /filed. We attribute this success to our own innovative research and to the more than 30/uni00A0business development deals we have reached over the past /five years, spanning a range of disease areas including MS, depression, stroke, and Parkinson's disease.\n\nOur work going forward is based on four strategic pillars to drive growth and value creation over the medium to long term.\n\nThe /first of these pillars is Biogen's continued leadership in neuroscience, which as of April 29 th , 2022, comprises over 20 of our approximately 30/uni00A0programs in clinical development.\n\nWe continue to believe in signi/ficant potential opportunities in Alzheimer's disease and depression, two large therapeutic areas with great unmet need. For 2022, we expect two remaining data readouts in these areas, including additional Phase/uni00A03 data for zuranolone and pivotal data for lecanamab, with the potential to complete two new regulatory /filings.\n\nIn the long term, we have the opportunity to build upon our planned entry into neuropsychiatry with BIIB104 (AMPA PAM), an investigational drug which is currently being evaluated in a Phase/uni00A02 study for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia.\n\nA second pillar of potential growth is our specialized immunology portfolio with two promising Phase/uni00A03",

We believe we have potential /first-in-class molecules for both systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with dapirolizumab pegol (anti-CD40L) being developed in collaboration with UCB and BIIB059 (anti-BDCA2), and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), with BIIB059. Lupus is a therapeutic area with a different risk pro/file, and we are continuing to evaluate additional opportunities across specialized immunology.\n\nThe third pillar is biosimilars, which contributed revenue of $831.1/uni00A0million in 2021. Our goal is to bring more biosimilar products to more patients across geographies, supporting the sustainability of healthcare systems and accessibility for all.\n\n## We continue to believe in signi/ficant potential opportunities in Alzheimer's disease and depression, two large therapeutic areas with great unmet need.\n\nTo that end, we announced in January 2022 an agreement with Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. (Samsung Biologics) to sell our equity stake in the Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. (Samsung Bioepis) joint venture to Samsung Biologics. This positions us to pursue further biosimilars opportunities in order to provide patient access to biologic medicines and to contribute to healthcare sustainability. With the closing of this transaction, we will retain our current role as the commercialization partner for the Samsung Bioepis anti-TNF portfolio and ophthalmology programs.\n\nLastly, our fourth pillar is directed at accelerating our efforts in digital health. We aim to leverage our signi/ficant database and utilize machine learning and arti/ficial intelligence to develop digital health solutions that may improve patient care, accelerate drug development, and further the understanding of underlying pathologies.\n\nIn summary, we expect executing on our four strategic pillars will create the opportunity for future growth and value creation.\n\n## Focused on Execution in 2022\n\nOur focus in 2022 will remain on execution and agility as we expect a number of important milestones. This includes maintaining leadership in our core business, the launch of VUMERITY in the EU, and our expected entry into the U.S. biosimilars market with BYOOVIZ, a biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS\u00ae.\n\nIn the light of the recent decision of CMS to limit coverage for ADUHELM in the U.S., we will be reevaluating certain elements of our infrastructure and reprioritizing our capital allocation in the interest of creating long-term value for our shareholders.\n\nAs a research-driven biotechnology company, we continue to be centered on delivering therapies at the cutting edge of innovation. We believe we have unique capabilities and experience to leverage progress in neuroscience, technology and biology. In scienti/fic discovery and development, we know the road is not always linear, but I believe we have the best people across Biogen to advance science and access in the pursuit of helping patients and society.\n\nI want to thank all my colleagues who work tirelessly to make Biogen such a special company and uphold the highest standards of ethics and integrity. I also want to extend thanks to our collaborators for their essential contributions, and to our investors who entrust us with their capital, which makes everything we do possible.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichel Vounatsos, Chief Executive Of/ficer of Biogen\n\n- 1  American Stroke Association.\n- 2  2018 AHA guidelines on management of ischemic stroke.\n- 3  Free cash /flow de/fined as net cash /flow from operations less capital expenditures.\n- 4  aaic.alz.org/downloads2020/2020\\_Race\\_and\\_Ethnicity\\_Fact\\_Sheet.pdf.\n- 5  Lupus Foundation of America www.lupus.org/resources/lupus-facts-and-statistics.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n\n- A Amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets for the twelve months ended December/uni00A031, 2021, re/flects the impact of a $365.0 million impairment charge related to BIIB111 (timrepigene emparvovec), a $220.0 million impairment charge related to BIIB112 (cotoretigene toliparvovec) and a $44.3 million impairment charge related to vixotrigine (BIIB074) for the potential treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TGN). During the second quarter of 2021 we announced that our Phase/uni00A03 STAR study of BIIB111 and our Phase 2/3 XIRIUS study of BIIB112 did not meet their primary endpoints. In the third quarter of 2021 we suspended further development on these programs based on the decision by management as part of its strategic review process. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized an impairment charge of $365.0 million related to BIIB111 and an impairment charge of $220.0 million related to BIIB112, reducing the remaining book values of these in-process research and development (IPR&D) intangible assets to zero.\n\nAmortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, re/flects the impact of the impairment charges related to BIIB111, which was obtained as part of the Nightstar Therapeutics plc acquisition, and BIIB054 (cinpanemab) as well as a $19.3/uni00A0million impairment charge related to one of our IPR&D intangible assets. During the fourth quarter of 2020 we recognized an impairment charge of $115.0/uni00A0million related to BIIB111 as a result of third-party manufacturing delays that impacted the timing and increased the costs associated with advancing BIIB111 through Phase 3 development.\n\nIn February 2021 we announced that we discontinued development of BIIB054 as a potential treatment of Parkinson's disease as our Phase 2 SPARK study did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Although we made this determination in February 2021, it was based on conditions that existed as of December/uni00A031, 2020. As a result, we\n\nrecognized an impairment charge of approximately $75.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2020 to reduce the fair value of the related IPR&D intangible asset to zero. We also adjusted the value of our contingent consideration obligation related to BIIB054, resulting in a gain of $51.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nAmortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets for the twelve months ended December/uni00A031, 2019, re/flects the impact of a $215.9 million impairment charge related to certain IPR&D assets associated with the Phase 2b study of BG00011 (STX-100) for the potential treatment of idiopathic pulmonary /fibrosis, which was discontinued during the third quarter of 2019. We also adjusted the value of our contingent consideration obligations related to BG00011, resulting in a gain of $61.2/uni00A0million in the third quarter of 2019.\n\n- B In August 2019 we completed the sale of all of the outstanding shares of our subsidiary that owned our biologics manufacturing operations in Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark, to FUJIFILM Corporation. Upon the closing of this transaction, we received approximately $881.9 million in cash, which may be adjusted based on other contractual terms, which are discussed below.\n\nIn connection with this transaction we recognized a total net loss of approximately $164.4 million in our consolidated statements of income. This loss included a pre-tax loss of $95.5 million, which was recorded in loss on divestiture of Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark, manufacturing operations. The loss recognized was based on exchange rates and business conditions on the closing date of this transaction, and included costs to sell our Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark, manufacturing operations of approximately $11.2 million and our estimate of the fair value of an adverse commitment of approximately $114.0 million associated with the guarantee of future minimum batch production at the Hiller\u00f8d facility. The value of this adverse commitment was determined using a probability-weighted estimate",

        "page_content": "of future manufacturing activity. We also recorded a tax expense of $68.9 million related to this transaction. During the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded a $40.2 million reduction in our estimate of the future minimum batch commitment utilizing our current manufacturing forecast, which re/flects the impact of forecasted batches of aducanumab, an investigational treatment for Alzheimer's disease, resulting in a reduction in the pre-tax loss on divestiture from $95.5 million to $55.3 million.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020 we reduced our estimate of the fair value of the adverse commitment by approximately $62.0 million based on our current manufacturing forecasts. Additionally, we recorded a reduction to our pre-tax loss of approximately $30.5/uni00A0million due to a refund of interest paid associated with a tax matter. As of December 31, 2020, the cumulative loss on the divestiture of the Hiller\u00f8d, Denmark, manufacturing operations was $33.2 million.\n\nIn addition, we may earn certain contingent payments based on future manufacturing activities at the Hiller\u00f8d facility. For the disposition of a business, our policy is to recognize contingent consideration when the consideration is realizable. Consistent with our assessment as of the transaction date, we currently believe the probability of earning these payments is remote, and therefore we did not include these contingent payments in our calculation of the fair value of the operations.\n\n- C Income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, included $90.3 million in income tax expense related to a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, due to the decisions of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of West Virginia and the U.S. District Court of the District of Delaware that the asserted claims of our U.S. patent No. 8,399,514, which cover the treatment of multiple sclerosis with 480 mg of dimethyl fumarate per day as provided for in our TECFIDERA label, are invalid.\n- D During the third quarter of 2019 a new taxing regime in the country and certain cantons of Switzerland was enacted, which we refer to as Swiss Tax Reform. As a result of the impact of Swiss Tax Reform, we recorded an income tax bene/fit of approximately $54.3 million resulting from a remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\n\n## Notes\n\nOur 'Non-GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc.' and 'Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share' /financial measures exclude the following items from 'GAAP net income attributable to Biogen Inc.' and 'GAAP diluted earnings per share': (1) acquisitions and divestitures, (2) hemophilia business separation costs, (3) restructuring, business transformation and other cost-saving initiatives, (4) (gain) loss on equity security investments, (5) other select items and (6) their related tax effects. 'Free Cash Flow' is de/fined as net cash /flow from operations less capital expenditures. We believe that these and other Non-GAAP /financial measures provide additional insight into the ongoing economics of our business and re/flect how we manage our business internally, set operational goals, and form the basis of our management incentive programs. Non-GAAP /financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of /financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Numbers may not foot due to rounding. Additional reconciliations of our Non-GAAP /financial measures can be found in the Investors section of www.biogen.com.",

Aspartorr fthe accelerated approval, we will conducta confirmatorytrr rial to verifytff heclinical benefitofADUHELM in patients with Alzheimer'sdisease. The FDA may withdraw approval if, among other things, the confirmatorytrr rial fails to verifycff linical benefitofADUHELM, ADUHELM's benefit-risk is no longer positive or we fail to comply with the conditions of the accelerated approval.\n\nIn December 2021 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency(EMA) adopted anegative opinion on the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) foraducanumab in Europe. Weare seeking a re-examination of theopinion by the CHMP.\n\nIn January 2022the Centersfor Medicareand Medicaid Servirr ces (CMS) released aproposed National Coverage Determination (NCD) decision memorandum stating theproposed NCD wouldcover FDAapproved monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid for thetreatment of Alzheimer's disease for people with Medicareonlyifthey are enrolled in qualifyiff ng clinical trials. We expect a final Medicare NCD by the second quarterr of 2022, whichshould clarify Medicare reimbursement for theclass of antibodies directed against amyloid.",

The insightsgained from these engagements help us support patients with servicesrr , programs and applications that are designed to help patients lead better lives. Among other things, we provide customer service and other related programs for our products, suchasdisease and productspecific websites, insurance research services, financial assistance programsand the facilitation of the procurementof our marketed products.\n\nWeare dedicated to helping patients obtain access to our therapies. Our patient representatives have access toasuite of financial assistancetools. With those tools, we help patients understand their\n\ninsurance coverage and,if needed, help patients compare and selectnew insurance options and programs. In the U.S., we have established programs that provideco-pay assistance orfree marketed productfor qualified uninsured or underinsured patients, based on specific eligibility criteria. Wealso provide charitable contributions to independent charitable organizations that assist patients with outof-pocket expenses associated with their therapy.\n\nWe believe all healthcare stakeholders have a shared responsibility to ensure patients have equitable access to new, innovative medicines. We regularly review our pricing strategy and prioritize patient access to our therapies. We have a valuebased contracting program designed to align the price of our therapies to the value our therapies deliver to patients. Wealso work with regulators, clinical researchers, ethicists, physicians and patient",

In some countries, partirr cularly in areas where we continue toexpand intonew geographic areas, we partner with third-partir es.\n\nWeand Eisai co-promote AVONEX, TYSABRI and TECFIDERAinJapanincertain settings.\n\nWe and Eisai co-promote ADUHELM with a region-based profit split.\n\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA and OCREVUS are marketed by the Roche Group andits sublicensees.\n\nWecommercialize BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI pursuant toour agreement withSamsung Bioepis in certain countries in Europe.\n\nWefocus our sales and marketing efforff ts r r on specialist physicians in private practice orat major medicalcenters. Weusecustomary industry practices to marketour products and to educate physicians, suchassales representatives calling on individual physicians, advertisements, professional symposia, direct mail, public relations and other methods.\n\n## Distribution Arrangements\n\nWe distributeour products in the U.S. principally through wholesale andspecialty distributors of pharmaceuticalproducts and specialty pharmacies, mail order specialty distributors or shipping servirr ce providers. In other countries, the distributionof our products varies from countrytrr ocountry,rr including through wholesale distributorsof pharmaceutical products and third-partyrr distribution partners who are responsible for most marketing and distribution activities.\n\nEisai distributes AVONEX, TYSABRI, TECFIDERA and PLEGRIDY in Indiaand other Asia-Pacific markets, excluding China.\n\nRITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA, GAZYVA and OCREVUS are distributed by the Roche Group andits sublicensees.\n\nWe distribute BENEPALI, IMRALDI and FLIXABI in certain countries in Europe and have an option to acquire exclusive rights to distribute these products in China.\n\nOur productsales to two wholesale distributors eachaccounted for more than 10.0%of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and on a combined basis,accounted for approximately 38.9%, 45.8% and 47.0% of our gross product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For additional information, please read Note 4, Revenue ,toourconsolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## Patents and Other Proprietary Rights\n\nPatentsare important to obtaining and protecting exclusive rights in ourproducts and product candidates. We regularlyseek patent protection in the U.S. and in selected countries outside the U.S. for inventions originating from our research and development effortsand those we license oracquire. In addition, we license rights to various patents and patent applications.\n\nU.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effecff tive for20 years from the date the earliest application wasfiled; however, U.S. patents that issue on applications filed before June 8, 1995, maybeeffective until 17 years from the issue date, if that is later than the20-year date. In some cases, the patent term maybeextended to recapture a portiorr nofthe term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic or, in the case of the U.S., because of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) delaysinprosecuting the application. Specifically, in the U.S.,under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonlyknown as the Hatch-Waxman Act,apatent that covers a drug approved by the FDA maybeeligible for patent term extension (for up to 5years, but not beyondatotal of 14 years from the date of productapproval) as compensation forpatent term lost during the FDA regulatoryrr eview process. The duration and extension of the termof foreign patents varies, in accordance withlocal law. For example, supplementaryprr rotection certirr ficates (SPCs) on someof our products have been granted in anumber of Europeancountries, compensating in part for delays in obtaining marketing approval.\n\nRegulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatorydr ata protection and market protection,also can provide meaningful protection for our products. Regulatory dataprotection provides to the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization, for aset period of time,the exclusive use of the proprietary pre-clinical and clinical data that itcreatedat significant cost and submitted to the applicable",

After the period of exclusive use, third-partirr es are permitted to referencesuchdata inabbreviated applications forapproval and to market (subjectto any applicable market protection) theirgeneric drugs and biosimilars. Market protection provides the holder of a drug orbiologic marketing authorization the exclusive right to commercialize its product for a period of time, thereby preventing the commercialization of another productcontainingthe same active ingredient(s) during that period. Although the World Trade Organization's agreement on traderelated aspects of intellectual property rights(TRIPS) requires signatory countries to provide regulatoryrr exclusivity toinnovative pharmaceuticalproducts, implementation and enforcement varies widelyfrom country to country.\n\nWe also rely upon other forms of unpatented confidential information to remaincompetitive. We protectsuchinformationprincipally through refraining from public disclosure and confidentialityagreements withouremployees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, scientists whose research we sponsor and other advisers. In the case of our employees, these agreements also provide, in compliance with relevant law, thatinventions and other intellectual propertyr conceived by such employees during their employment are our exclusive property.\n\nOur trademarks are important to us and are generally covered by trademarkapplications or\n\nregistrations in the USPTO and the patent or trademarkoffices of other countries. Wealso use trademarks licensed from third-partirr es, suchas the trademarkFAMPYRFF A, which we license from Acorda. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the trademarkis used and in other countries as long as the trademarkis registered. Trademark registrations generallyareforfixed but renewable terms.\n\n## Our Patent Portfolio\n\nThefollowing table describes our patents in the U.S. and Europe that wecurrentlyconsider of primary importance to our marketed products, includingthe territory, patent number, general subject matter and expected expiration dates. Exceptas otherwise noted, the expected expiration dates includeanygranted patent term extensions and issued SPCs. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to, among other things, particular formsorcompositions, methods of manufacturing or use of the drug in the treatmentof particular diseases or conditions. Wealso continue to pursue additional patents and patent termextensions in the U.S. and other territories covering various aspects of our products that may,if issued,extend exclusivitybeyond theexpiration of the patentslisted in the table.",

        "page_content": "## Competition\n\nCompetition in the biopharmaceutical industryis intense. There are many companies, including biotechnology and pharmaceuticalcompanies, engaged in developing products for the indications our approved products are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas weare targeting withour research and development activities. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do.\n\nWe believe that competition and leadershipin the industry is basedon managerial and technological excellence and innovation as well as establishing patent and other proprietarypr ositions through research and development. Theachievement of a leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to maximizetheapproval,acceptance and use of our productcandidates and theavailabilityof adequate financial resources tofund facilities, equipment, personnel,clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing. Another key aspectof remaining competitive in the industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientists and technicians to conductour research activities and advance our development programs, includingwith thecommercial expertise to effectively market our products.\n\nCompetition among products approved forsale may be based, among other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, delivery devices, reliability, availability, reimbursement and price. In addition, early entry of a new pharmaceuticalproductinto the market mayhave important advantages in gaining productacceptance and market share. Accordingly, the relative speed with which wecandevelop products, complete the testing and approval process and supplycommercial quantities of products will have a significant impacton our competitiveposition.\n\nThe introduction of newproducts or technologies, includingthe development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products or technologies, results in increased competition for our marketed products and pricing pressureonour marketed products. The development of new or improved treatment options or standardsof care or cures for the diseases our products treat reduces and could eliminate the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our productcandidates.\n\nIn addition, thecommercialization of certain of our own approved products, products of our collaboratorsand pipeline productcandidatesmay negatively impact future sales of our existing products.\n\nWealso face increased competitive pressures from the introduction of generic versions, prodrugs and biosimilarsof existing products and products approved underabbreviated regulatory pathways. Suchproductsare likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products,which may significantly reduce both the pricethat weare able to charge forour products and the volume of products we sell. In addition, in some markets, whenageneric or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it maybe automatically substituted for our productand significantly reduce our revenue in a shortprr eriod of time.\n\nWe believe our long-term competitive position depends upon oursuccess in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, along with ourability to manufacture products efficiently and to launchand market them effecff tivelyinahighlycompetitive environment.\n\nAdditional information about the competition that our marketed products face isset forthbelowand in Item 1A.

Our Company,the EMA and the EChave eachappealed the General Court'sdecision as wrongly decided and the appeal is pending.\n\nIn November 2021 the CHMPofthe EMAissued an ad hoc opinion referencing the General Court's decision whichconcluded that \"the totalityofthe available data cannot establish that [monoethyl fumarate] exertsaclinically relevant therapeutic contribution within FUMADERM.\"The EC will decide TECFIDERA's entitlement to regulatory data and market protection. If data and market protection is not upheld,wecould face generic competition in the E.U. as early as the first half of 2022, which would have an adverse impactonour TECFIDERAsales in the E.U. and our resultsof operations.\n\nFAMPYRAisindicated as atreatment toimprove walking inadult patients with MS whohave awalking disability and is the first treatment that addresses this unmet medicalneed with demonstrated efficacy in people withall types of MS. FAMPYRA is currently the only therapyapproved to improve walking in patients withMS.\n\nCompetition in the MS market is intense. Along with us,anumber of companies are working to develop additional treatments for MS that may in the future compete withourMS products. One such product that was approvedin the U.S. in2017 andin the E.U. in 2018 is OCREVUS, a treatment for RMS and PPMS that was developed by Genentech. While we have a financial interest in OCREVUS, future sales of our MS products may beadverselyaffected if OCREVUS continues to gain market share, orif other MS products that we or our competitors are developing are commercialized.\n\n## Spinal Muscular Atrophy\n\nWeface competitionfromagene therapy product andanoralproduct.

Inaddition, weare aware of several other anti-CD20 molecules, including biosimilar products, that have recently been approved andareexpected to compete with RITUXAN, RITUXAN HYCELA and GAZYVA in the oncology market. In November 2019, January 2020 and January 2021 osim bi ilar products referencing RITUXAN were launched in the U.S andare being offerff ed at lower prices.

With limited exceptions, the FDA requires companies to register both pre-approval and post-approval clinical trials and disclose clinical trial results in public databases. Failuretoregister a trial or disclose study results within the required time periods could resultin penalties, including civil monetary penalties. Clinical trial programs must establish efficacy, determine an appropriate dose anddosing regimen and define the conditions for safeuse. Thisisahigh-risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies in which the candidate product must successfully meet predetermined endpoints. The resultsofthe preclinical and clinical testing of a productare then submitted to the FDA in the formof a BLA oraNDA. In response to a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines theapplication does notprovide an adequate basis for approval.\n\nProduct development and receiptof regulatory approval takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resourcesand depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availabilityof suitable alternative treatments, potential safetysignals observed in preclinicalorclinical tests and the risks and benefits of the productasdemonstrated in clinical trials. The FDAhas substantial discretion in the productapproval process, and it is impossible to predict with any certainty whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval. The agency may require the sponsor of a BLA or NDA toconduct additional clinical studies or to provide other scientific or technical information about the product,and these additional requirements may lead to unanticipated delaysorexpenses. Furthermore, even if a productis approved, the approval may be subject tolimitations based on the FDA's interpretation of the existingpreclinical and/or clinical data.\n\nThe FDAhas developed four distinctapproaches intended to facilitate the development and expedite the regulatoryrr eview of therapeutically important drugs,especially when the drugs are thefirst available treatment or have advantages over existing treatments: accelerated approval,fast track, breakthrough therapy and priority review.\n\n- \u00b7 Acceleratedrr Approvalvv : The FDA may grant 'accelerated approval' to products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that\n\nprovide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. Under this pathway, the FDA may approve a productbased on surrogate endpointsorclinical endpoints other than survirr val or irreversible morbidity. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints orclinical endpointsother than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to provide the FDA with confirmatory data post-approval to verifyaff nd describeclinical benefit. Under the FDA's accelerated approval regulations, if the FDAconcludes that a drug that has been shown to be effecff tivecan be safely used onlyif distribution or use is restricted, it may require certain post-marketing restrictions to assure safe use. In addition, forproducts approved under accelerated approval, sponsors may be required to submitall copies of theirpromotional materials, including advertisements, to the FDA at least 30 days prior to initial dissemination. The FDA may withdraw approval if, for instance, post-marketing studies fail toverifycff linical benefit, it becomes clear that restrictions on the distribution of the productare inadequate to ensure itssafeuse orif a sponsor fails to comply with the conditions of the accelerated approval.\n\n- \u00b7 FastTraTT ck : The FDA may grant \"fast track\" status to products that treat a serious condition and have data demonstrating the potential to address an unmet medical need oradrug that has beendesignated as a qualified infectious disease product.\n- \u00b7 Breakthrough Therapypp : The FDA maygrant 'breakthrough therapy' status to drugsdesigned to treat, alone or in combination with another drug or drugs,aserious or life-threatening disease or condition and for whichpreliminaryrr clinical evidence suggestsasubstantial improvement over existing therapies based on a clinically significant endpoint. Breakthrough therapy status entitles the sponsor to earlier and more frequent meetings with the FDA regarding the development of nonclinical and clinical data and permits the FDA tooffer product development or regulatoryarr dvice for the purpose of shortening the time to productapproval. Breakthrough therapy status does not guarantee that a product will beeligible for priority review and does not ensure FDA approval.\n- \u00b7 PriorityRt eview : 'Priority review' only applies to applications (original or efficacyff supplement) for a drug that treats a serious condition and,if approved,would provideasignificant improvement in safety or effecff tiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition. Priority review may also be granted for",

If a sponsor fails to conduct the required studies, the FDAmay withdraw its approval. Inaddition, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has been shown to be effectivecanbe safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, itcan mandate post-marketing restrictions to assure safe use. In suchacase, the sponsor mayberequired to establish rigorous systems to assure use of the product under safe conditions. These systems are usually referred to as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). The FDAcan impose financial penalties for failing to comply withcertain post-marketing commitments, including REMS. Inaddition, any changes to an approved REMS must be reviewed and approved by the FDAprior to implementation.\n\n## ADVERSE EVENTVV REPORTINGTT\n\nWe monitor informationonside effects and adverse events reportedrr during clinical studies and after marketing approval and report suchinformation and events to regulatoryarr gencies. Non-compliance with the FDA's safety reporting requirements may resultincivil orcriminalpenalties. Side effecff ts or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede orprevent marketing approval. Based on new safety information that emerges after approval, the FDA can mandate productlabeling changes, impose a new REMS or the addition of elements to an existing REMS,require new postmarketing studies (including additional clinical trials) or suspend or withdraw approval of the product. These requirements may affecff tourability to maintain marketing approval of our products or require us to make significant expenditures to obtainor maintain suchapprovals.\n\n## APPROVALOFCHANGES TO AN APPROVED PRODUCT\n\nIf we seek to make certain types of changes to an approved product, suchasadding a new indication, making certain manufacturing changes or\n\nchanging manufacturers or suppliersof certain ingredientsorcomponents, the FDA will need to review and approvesuchchanges in advance. In the case of anew indication, we are required to demonstrate withadditional clinical data that the productissafe and effecff tive for a use other than what was initially approved. FDA regulatory review may resultindenial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conductadditional tests or evaluations that cansubstantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes.\n\n## REGULATIONTT OF PRODUCT ADVERTVV ISIN T T G AND PROMOTION\n\nThe FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities and communications forproducts under its jurisdiction bothbefore and afterff approval. Pursuant to FDAguidance, a company can make safety and efficacy claims either in orconsistent with the product label. However, physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug's labeling. Suchoff-labelff prescribing is common across medical specialties, and often reflects a physician'sbelief that the off-labelff use is the best treatment for patients. The FDAdoes not regulate the behavior of physicians in theirchoice oftreatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-labelff uses. Failure tocomply withapplicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity,enforcement action by the FDA,corrective advertising and the full range of civiland criminal penalties available to the government.\n\n## Regulation of Combination Products\n\nCombination products are defined by the FDA to include products comprising two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and a device). Biologics and devices eachhavetheir own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. Some of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under thisframeworkand similar regulations outside the U.S., and weexpect that some of our pipeline product candidates may beevaluated for regulatoryar pproval under thisframeworkas well.\n\nIn May 2017 new regulations governing medical devices (MDR)and in-vitrodiagnostic medical devices (IVDR) entered intoforce in the E.U. The MDRbecame applicable in May 2021. The IVDR regulations are not expected to fully apply untilMay 2022. Allproducts covered by these regulations will be required to comply with them at the end of thetransitional periods. These regulations introduce new requirements, including forclinical investigation of certain classifications of medical devices, require increased regulatorysr crutiny,enhancethe requirements for post market surveirr llance and",

These regulations also change therequirementsfor assessment of the medicaldevice components of integral drug-device combination products, necessitating assessment of the devicecomponents under both the medicaldevice and medicinal product regulatoryrr egimes.\n\n## Product Approval and Post-Approval Regulation Outside the U.S.\n\nWe market our products in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have productapproval and post-approval regulatorypr rocesses that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. InEurope, for example, where a substantial part of our ex-U.S. effortsarefocused, there are several routes for marketing approval, depending on thetype of productfor whichapprovalis sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a singleapplication to the EMA. The marketing authorization application is similar to the NDA or BLA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the CHMP, the expert scientific committee of the EMA responsible for human medicines. If the CHMP determines that the marketing authorization application fulfills the requirements for quality, safety and effiff cacy and that themedicine has a positive benefit risk balance, it willadoptapositive opinion recommending the granting of the marketing authorization by the EC. The CHMP opinion is not binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. AMAA approved by the ECis validinall member states of the E.U. The centralized procedure is required for all biological products, orphan medicinal products and new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, and it is available forcertain other products, including thosewhichconstitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation.\n\nIn addition to the centralized procedure, the European regulatory frameworkincludes the following options for regulatoryrr eview and approval in the E.U. member states:\n\n- \u00b7 a national procedure, where the first application is made to the competent authority in one E.U. member state only;\n- \u00b7 a decentralizedprocedure, where applicants submit identicalapplications to several E.U. member states and receive simultaneous approval, ifthe medicine has notyet been authorizedinany E.U. member state; and\n- \u00b7 a mutual recognitionprocedure, where applicants that haveamedicineauthorizedinone E.U. member state can applyfor mutual recognitionof this authorizationinotherE.U.memberstates\n\nAs in the U.S., the E.U. also hasdistinct approachesintended to optimize the regulatory\n\npathways for therapeutically importantdrugs, including the Priority Medicines Evaluation Scheme (PRIME), accelerated assessment and conditional marketing authorization. PRIMEisintended to provideadditional support to medicine developers throughout the development process. Regulatory review timelines in the E.U. maybetruncated under accelerated assessment for products that address an unmet medical need. In addition, conditional marketing authorizations maybe granted for products in the interest of public health, where the benefitof immediate availabilityoutweighs the risk of having less comprehensive data than normally required. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually. The marketing authorization holder is required to complete specific obligations (ongoing or new studies and, in some cases, additional activities) with a view to providing comprehensive data confirming that the benefit risk balance ispositive. Once comprehensive data on the producthave been obtained, the marketing authorization maybe converted intoastandard marketing authorization.\n\nAsidefrom the U.S. and the E.U., there are countries in other regions where it is possible to receive an\"accelerated\" review whereby the national regulatoryar uthority will commit to truncated review timelines for products that meet specific medical needs.\n\nIn the E.U. there is detailed legislation on pharmacovigilance and extensive guidance ongood pharmacovigilance practices. Afailure tocomply with the E.U. pharmacovigilance obligations may result in significant financial penalties for themarketing authorization holder.\n\nRegardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national competent authorities, the EMA,the EC and the marketing authorization holder. The EMA'sPharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee is responsible for assessing and monitoring the safety of human medicines and makes recommendations on product safetyissues. Marketing authorization holders have an obligation to inform regulatory agencies of any new information which may influence the evaluationof benefits and risks of the medicinal product concerned.\n\nIn the U.S., the E.U. and other jurisdictions, regulatoryar gencies, includingthe FDA, conduct periodic inspections of NDA, BLA and marketing authorization holders to assess theircompliancewith pharmacovigilance obligations.",

        "page_content": "## Good Manufacturing Practices\n\nRegulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment,facilities and processes usedinthe manufacturing and testing of pharmaceuticaland biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving approval from regulatoryarr gencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, locationorprocess, additional regulatoryrr review and approval may be required. Wealso must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)and product-specific regulations enforcedby regulatoryar gencies following productapproval. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatoryarr gencies also conductperiodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities and processes following the initial approval of a product. If, asaresult of these inspections, it is determined thatourequipment,facilities or processes do not comply withapplicable regulations and conditions of productapproval, regulatory agencies may seek civil,criminal oradministrative sanctions or remedies against us, including significant financial penalties and the suspension of our manufacturing operations.\n\n## Good Clinical Practices\n\nThe FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standardsfor designing, conducting, monitoring, auditing and reportirr ng the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that therights and welfare of trial participantsareadequately protected (commonly referred to as current Good Clinical Practices(cGCP)). Regulatory agencies enforce cGCP through periodic inspections of trialsponsors, principal investigators and trialsites, contract research organizations (CROs) and institutional reviewboards. If our studies fail to comply withapplicablecGCPguidelines, the clinical data generated in ourclinical trials may be deemed unreliable and relevant regulatoryarr gencies may require us to performadditional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Noncompliance can also result in civil orcriminal sanctions. We rely on third-partir es, including CROs, to carryorr ut many of our clinical trial-related activities. Failure of such thirdparties to comply withcGCP can likewise resultin rejection of our clinical trial data or other sanctions.\n\nIn April 2014 the EC adopted a new Clinical Trial Regulation, which was entered intoforce inJune 2014 but will not apply until January 2022. There are transitional provisions for clinical trials whichare ongoing at the date of application. Clinical trial applications mayalso continue to be made under the Clinical Trial Directive (theexisting regulatoryr framework) until January 2023. All clinical trials must fully comply with the Clinical Trial Regulation by January 2025. The regulation harmonizes the procedures for assessment and governance of clinical trials throughout the E.U. and will require that\n\ninformation on the authorization, conductand results of eachclinical trial conducted in the E.U. be publicly available.\n\n## Approval of Biosimilars\n\nThe Patient Protection and Afforff dable Care Act (PPACA) amended the Public HealthService Act (PHSA) to authorizethe FDA toapprove biological products, referred to as biosimilarsorfollow-on biologics, that are shown tobe \"highly similar\" to previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages. The biosimilar must show it hasnoclinically meaningful differff ences in terms of safetyand effecff tiveness from the reference product,and only minor differences in clinicallyinactive components are allowable in biosimilarproducts. Theapproval pathway for biosimilarsdoes, however, grant a biologics manufacturer a 12-year period ofexclusivity from the date of approval of its biological productbefore biosimilar competition can be introduced. There is uncertainty, however, as the approval framework for biosimilarsoriginally was enacted as partorr fthe PPACA. There have been, and there are likely to continue to be, federal legislative andadministrative efforts to repeal, substantially modifyoff rinvalidate some orall of the provisions of the PPACA. If the PPACA is repealed, substantially modified or invalidated, it is unclear what, if any, impactsuch action would have on biosimilar regulation.\n\nAbiosimilars approvalpathway has been in place in the E.U. since 2003. The EMA has issued a number of scientific and productspecific biosimilar guidelines, including requirements for approving biosimilars containing monoclonal antibodies. In the E.U., biosimilarsare generally approved under the centralized procedure. Theapproval pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approvalbased in part on reliance on theclinical trial data of an innovatorproduct to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated, through comprehensive comparability studies, to be 'similar.' In many cases, thisallows biosimilars tobe brought to market without conductingthefull complement of clinical trials typically required fornovel biologic drugs.\n\n## Orphan Drug Act\n\nUnder the U.S. OrphanDrug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a 'rare disease orcondition,' which generally is a disease or condition that affecff ts fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. If a product whichhas an orphan drug designation subsequently receives an initial FDA approval for the indication for whichithas suchdesignation, the productis entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication foraperiod of seven years",

SPINRAZA has beengranted orphan drug designation in the U.S., the E.U. and Japan.\n\n## Regulation Pertaining to Pricing and Reimbursement\n\nIn bothdomestic and foreign markets, sales of ourproducts depend, to a significantextent, on the availability and amount of reimbursement by thirdparty payors, including governments, private health plansand otherorganizations.Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the pricing and reimbursement of our products, and drug pricescontinue to receive significant scrutiny. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and pricing of our products to control cost oraffect utilization of our products. Challenges to our pricing strategies, by either government or private stakeholders,could harm our business. The U.S. and foreign governments have enacted and regularly consider additional reform measures that affecthealthcare coverage and costs. Private health plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. Other payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacybenefit managers, government health administration authorities and private healthinsurers, seek price discounts or rebates in connection with the placementof ourproducts on theirformularies and, in some cases, may impose restrictions on access, coverage or pricing of particular drugs based on perceived value.\n\n## Within the U.S.\n\n- \u00b7 Medicaid : Medicaid is a jointfederal andstate program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, weare required to pay arebate for each unitof product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of therebate is established by law and is adjusted upward if the average manufacturer price (AMP) increases more than inflation (measured by the ConsumerPrice Index - Urban). The rebate amount is calculated eachquarterr based on our report of current AMP and best price for eachof our products to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The requirements for calculating AMP and bestprice are complex. We are required to report any\n\n- revisions to AMP or best price previously reportedr within acertain period, which revisions could affect our rebate liabilityfor prior quarterr s. In addition, if we fail to provide informationtimely or we are found to have knowingly submitted falseinformation to the government, the statute governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program provides for civil monetary penalties.\n- \u00b7 Medicarerr : Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government. The program covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part Bgenerally coversdrugs that must be administered by physicians or other healthcare practitioners, are provided in connection with certain durablemedical equipment orarecertain oral anti-cancer drugs and certain oral immunosuppressive drugs. Medicare Part Bpays for suchdrugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (ASP)ofthe drugs. Manufacturers, includingus,are required to provide ASP information to the CMS on a quarterlybasis. The manufacturer-submrr itted information is used to calculate Medicare payment rates. If a manufacturer is found to have madeamisrepresentation in the reportirr ng of ASP, the governing statute provides forcivil monetary penalties.\n\nMedicare PartDr provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patientsfor self-admff inistered drugs (i.e., drugs that are not administered by a physician). Medicare Part Disadministered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government. Each drug plan establishes its own Medicare PartDrr formularyfrr or prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modifyfff rom time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and pharmacies, and maycondition formulary placement on the availabilityof manufacturer discounts. In addition, manufacturers, including us, are required to provide to the CMS a discount of up to 70.0% on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.\n\nLegislation is pending in Congress that includes significant modifications to Medicare PartBr and Medicare Part D. Specifically,the Build Back Better Act includes provisions that would,among other things:\n\n- 1) allow CMS to directlynegotiate the prices of certairr ndrugs paid for by Medicare and impose a significantlydiscounted maximum price;",

FSS participationis required for our products to becovered and reimbursed by the Veterans Administration (VA), Department of Defense, Coast Guard and Public HealthService (PHS). Coverage under Medicaid, Medicareand the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned uponFSS participation. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the pricethat wecharge our most-favored non-federal customer for a product. In addition, pricesfor drugs purchased by the VA, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel anddependents through the TriCare retailpharmacy program), Coast Guard and PHS are subject toacapon pricing equal to 76% of the non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP)FF . Anadditional discount applies if non-FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the ConsumerPrice Index - Urban). In addition,if wefail to provide information timely or wearefound to have knowingly submitted falseinformation to the government, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties.\n- \u00b7 340B Discounted Pricing : To maintain coverage of our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, wearerequired to extend significant discounts to certain covered entities that purchase products under Section 340B of the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligiblefordiscounts include hospitals that serverr a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community healthclinicsand other entities that receive certain types of grants under the PHSA. Forall of our products, we must agree to charge a price that will not exceed the amount determined under statute (the 'ceiling price') when we sell outpatient drugs to these covered entities. In addition, we may, but are not required to, offer these covered entities a price lower than the 340B ceiling price. The 340B discount formula is based on AMPand is generally similar to the level of rebates calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.\n\n## Outside the U.S.\n\nOutsidethe U.S., our products are paid for by a variety of payors, with governments being the primaryrr source of payment. Governments may determine or influencereimbursement of products and mayalso set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities candelay commercialization of ourproducts. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). Budgetaryrr pressures in many countries are continuing to cause governments to consider or implement various costcontainment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates and expanded generic substitution and patient cost-sharing.\n\n## Regulation Pertaining to Sales and Marketing\n\nare subject to various federaland state laws pertainingtohealthcare 'fraud and abuse,' including anti-kickbacklaws and false claimslaws. Antikickbacklaws generally prohibitaprescription drug manufacturer from soliciting, offerff ing, receiving or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary,theirscope is generally broad and there maybe no regulations, guidance orcourt decisions that clarify how the laws apply to particrr ular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might bechallenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. False claimslaws prohibitanyone from knowinglyand willingly presenting, orcausing to be presented, forpayment to third-partyr payors (including Medicare and Medicaid), claimsfor reimbursed drugs or services that are false orfraudulent, claimsfor items or services not provided as claimed orclaims for medically unnecessary itemsorservicrr es. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject toscrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal orcivil sanctions, including fines and civil monetaryprr enalties, and exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). In the U.S., federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry and private individuals have been active inalleging violations of the laws and bringing suitsonbehalf of the government under the federal civil False ClaimsAct. If we were subject toallegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed.\n\nLaws and regulations have been enacted by the federal governmentand various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical",

The laws include federal 'sunshine' provisions. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public)certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceuticalpricing informationand marketing expenditures. Many of these lawsand regulations containambiguous requirements. Given the lackof clarityinlaws and their implementation, our reportir ng actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state lawsand regulations.

Those lawsinclude the U.S. Foreign CorruptPractices Act(FCPA), whichprohibitsU.S. companies and their representatives frompaying, offerff ing to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anythiyy ng of value to any foreign government official,government staffff member, political partyorpolitical candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtainfavorabletreatment orinfluence a person working in an officiaff lcapacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. TheFCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.\n\nThe laws to which we are subject also include the U.K. Bribery Act2010 (BriberyAr ct), which proscribesgiving and receiving bribes in the public andprivate sectors, bribing a foreign public offiff cial and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agentsfrom giving bribes. U.S. companies that conductbusiness in the U.K. generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Actinclude significant fines for companies and criminal sanctions forcorporate officers under certain circumstances.\n\n## NIH Guidelines\n\nWe seek to conduct research at our U.S. facilities in compliancewith thecurrent U.S. National Institutes of HealthGuidelines for ResearchInvolving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIHGuidelines). By local ordinance, we are required to, among other things, comply with the NIH Guidelines in relation to our facilities in RTP,NC and are required to operate pursuant to certain permits.\n\n## Other Laws\n\nOur present and future business hasbeen and will continue to be subject tovarious other lawsand regulations.

The development of novel approaches for the treatment of diseases, including development effoff rts in new modalitiessuchasthose basedonthe antisense oligonucleotideplatformand gene therapy, may present additional challenges and risks, including obtaining approval from regulatoryarr uthorities that have limited experience with the development of such therapies.\n\nClinical trial data are subject todifferff ing interpretations and even if we view data as suffiff cient to support the safety, effecff tiveness and/or approval of an investigational therapy, regulatoryarr uthorities may disagree and may require additional data, limit the scope of the approval or deny approvalaltogether. Furthermore, the approval of a productcandidate byone regulatoryarr gencydoes not mean that other regulatoryarr gencies will also approve such productcandidate.\n\nSuccess in preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful. Clinical trials may indicate that ourproduct candidates lack efficacy, have harmful side effects, result in unexpected adverse events or raise other concerns that maysignificantly reducethe likelihood of regulatoryar pproval. This may resultin terminated programs, significant restrictions on use and safety warnings in an approved label, adverse placement within the treatment paradigm or significant reduction in the commercial potential of the productcandidate.\n\nEven if we couldsuccessfully develop new products or indications, we may makeastrategic decision to discontinue development of a productcandidate orindication if, forexample, we believe commercialization willbe difficff ult relative to the standardof care or we prefer to pursue other opportunirr ties in ourpipeline.\n\nSales of new products or products withadditional indications maynot meet investorexpectations.\n\n## If we fail to compete effectively, our business and market position would suffer.\n\nThe biopharmaceutical industry and the marketsin which we operate are intensely competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our products, the development of new products and processes, the acquisition of rights to new products withcommercial potential and the hiring and retention of personnel. Wecompete with biotechnology andpharmaceutical companies that have a greater number of products on themarket and in the productpipeline, substantially greater financial, marketing, researchand development and other resources and other technological or competitive advantages.\n\nOur products continue to face increasing competition from the introduction of neworiginator therapies, generics, prodrugs and biosimilarsof existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatoryr pathways. Some ofthese products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than our branded products. The introduction of suchproducts as well as other lower-pricrr ed competing products has reduced,and mayin the future, significantly reduce both the pricethat weareabletocharge for our products and the volume of products we sell, which will negativelyimpact our revenue. For instance, demand and price for TECFIDERAdeclined significantlyasa resultofmultiple TECFIDERAgeneric entrants entering the U.S.market in 2020. In addition, in some markets, when a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it maybe automatically substituted for our productand significantly reduce our revenue in a short period of time.\n\nOur ability tocompete, maintain and grow our business may also beadverselyaffected due to a number of factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the introduction of other products, including products that maybemore efficacious, safer, less expensive or more convenient alternatives to our products, including our own products andproducts of our collaborators;\n- \u00b7 the off-lff abel use by physicians of therapies indicated for other conditions to treat patients;\n- \u00b7 patient dynamics, including the size ofthe patient population and our ability toidentify, attractand maintain new and currentpatients toour therapies;\n- \u00b7 the reluctance of physicians to prescribe, and patients to use, our products without additional data on the efficacy and safetyof such products;\n- \u00b7 damage to physician and patient confidence inany of our products, generic or biosimilarsof our products or any other product from the same class as one of our products, or to our sales and reputation as a result of label changes, pricing and reimbursement decisions oradverseexperiences orevents that mayoccur with patients treated withour products or generic orbiosimilarsof our products;\n- \u00b7 inability toobtainappropriate pricing and reimbursement forour products compared to our competitorsin key international markets; or",

Competition fromcurrent and future competitors may negatively impact ourability to maintainpricing and our market share. New products marketed by our competitors could cause our revenue to decrease due to potential price reductions and lower sales volumes. Additionally,the introduction of generic or biosimilar versions of our products, follow-on products, prodrugs or products approved underabbreviated regulatory pathways may significantly reduce the price that weare able to charge forour products and the volume of products we sell.\n\nMany payors continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shiftaff greater portirr on of prescription costs to patients, includingmore limitedbenefitplan designs, higher patient co-pay orco-insurance obligations and limitations on patients' use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs(including through copay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs).Significant consolidation in the healthinsurance industryrr has resulted in a few large insurers andpharmacy benefit managers exerting greater pressure inpricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantlyincreasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. Further consolidation among insurers, pharmacybenefit managersand other payors would increase the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers. Additional discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions orexclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affecff ted products.\n\nOur failure toobtain or maintainadequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, revenue and results of operations.\n\nWe depend on relationships with collaborators, joint venture partners and other third-parties for revenue, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates, which are outside of our full control.\n\nWe rely on a number of collaborative, joint venture andother third-party relationships for revenueand the development, regulatory approval,commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates.

In addition, as Samsung Bioepis is a privately-yy held entity, our ability to liquidate our investment may be limited and we may realize significantly less than the value of suchinvestment.\n\nGiven these risks, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborativeefforts. If these efforff ts r fail, our productdevelopment orcommercialization of new products could be delayed, revenue from products could decline and/or we maynot realizethe anticipated benefits of these arrangements.\n\n## Our results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reforms.\n\nIn the U.S., federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-partyrr payors continue to focuson containing the cost of healthcare. Legislative and regulatoryprr roposals, enactments to reform health care insurance programs and increasing pressure from social sources could significantlyinfluencethe manner in whichour products are prescribed and purchased. For example, provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act(PPACA) have resulted in changes in the way health care ispaid for by bothgovernmental and private insurers, including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, the requirement that manufacturers participate inadiscount program for certain outpatient drugs underMedicare Part Dand theexpansion of the number of hospitals eligible for discounts under Section 340B of the Public HealthServirr ce Act. These changes have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impactonour business.\n\nWe may face uncertainties as a resultofefforts to repeal, substantially modifyoff rinvalidate some orall of the provisionsofthe PPACA. There isnoassurancethat the PPACA, as currently enacted oras amended in the future, will not adverselyaffect our business and financial results, and wecannot predict how future federal or state legislative oradministrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\n\nThere is increasing public attention on the costs of prescription drugs and weexpect drug pricing and other healthcare costs tocontinue to be subject tointense political and societal pressures on a global basis. For example, twocommittees of the U.S. House of Representatives are investigating the approval and price of ADUHELM. Inaddition, there have been, and are expected to continue to be, legislative proposals to address prescription drug pricing. Some ofthese proposals could have significant effects on our business, including an executive order issuedinSeptember 2020 to test a 'mostfavored nation' model for PartBrr and PartDrr drugs that tie reimbursement rates to international drug pricing metrics. These actions and theuncertaintyabout the future of the PPACA and healthcare laws may put downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatoryrr burdens and operating costs.\n\nThere is also significant economic pressure onstate budgets, including as a resultofthe COVID-19 pandemic, that may resultinstates increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limitcoverage or payment for our drugs. In recent years, some states have considered legislationand ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs, including laws to allow importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the U.S. and lawsintended toimpose price controls on state drug purchases. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for whichsupplemental rebates are not being paid. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expense maylead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may resultin managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding limitation on prices and reimbursement forour products.\n\nIn the E.U.and some other international markets,thegovernment provides healthcare at low cost to consumersand regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. Many countries have announced or implemented measures, and may in the future implement new oradditional measures, to reduce health care costs to limit the overalllevel of government expenditures. These measures vary by countryar nd mayinclude, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possible retroactive price reductions and other recoupmentsand increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-crr ost countries. These measures have negatively impacted our revenue and maycontinue to adverselyaffect our revenue and results of operations in the future.\n\nOur success in commercializing biosimilars is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in the development, manufacture and commercialization of biosimilars. If we are unsuccessful in such activities, our business may be adversely affected.",

Local tendering processes may restrict biosimilar products from being marketed and soldinsome jurisdictions. The number of competitors in a jurisdiction, the timing of approval and the ability to market biosimilar products successfully in atimely andcosteffective manner are additional factors that may impact oursuccess and/or the success of Samsung Bioepis in thisbusiness area.\n\n## Risks Related to Intellectual Property\n\n## If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\n\nOur success, including our long-term viability and growth, depends, in part, onourability toobtainand defend patent and other intellectualproperty rights, including certain regulatory forms of exclusivity, that are important to the commercialization of our products and productcandidates. Patent protection and/or regulatoryer xclusivity in the U.S. and other important markets remains uncertain and depends, in part, upon decisions of the patent offices, courts, administrative bodies and lawmakers in these countries.

Furthermore, payments under any licenses that weareable to obtain would reduce our profits from the covered products and servirr ces. Any of these circumstances could resultinfinancial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatilityinour stockprice.\n\n## Risks Related to Development, Clinical Testing and Regulation of Our Products and Product Candidates\n\n## Successful preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage trials, regulatory approval or commercial viability of a product.\n\nPositive resultsinaclinical trial may not be replicated in subsequent orconfirmatorytr rials. Additionally, success in preclinical workor early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful or that regulatoryarr pproval will be obtained. Even if laterstage clinical trials are successful, regulatoryar uthorities may delay or decline approval of our productcandidates. Regulatory authorities maydisagree withour view of the data, require additional studies or disagree withour trialdesign orendpoints. Regulatory authorities may also fail to approve thefacilities or processes used to manufacture a productcandidate, our dosing or delivery methods orcompanion devices. Regulatory authorities maygrant marketing approval that is more restricted thananticipated, including limiting indications to narrow patient populations and the impositionof safety monitoring, educational requirements, requiring confirmatorytrr rials and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies.

If we fail to adequately manage our clinical activities, our clinical trials or potential regulatory approvals may be delayed or denied.\n\nConducting clinical trials is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process. Our ability tocomplete clinical trials in atimely fashion depends on a number of key factors, including protocol design, regulatory and institutional review board approval, patient enrollment rates and compliancewithcurrent Good Clinical Practices. If we or our third-partyclinical trialprovidersor third-partyrr CROs do notsuccessfully carryorr ut these clinical activities, our clinical trials or the potential regulatoryar pproval of a product candidate may be delayed or denied.\n\nWe have opened clinical trial sites and are enrolling patients in a number of countries where our experience is limited. In most cases, we use the servirr ces of third-partiesrr to carryorr ut our clinical trial related activities and rely on such partiesrr to accurately report their results. Our reliance on third-parties for these activities mayimpactourability to control the timing, conduct,expense and quality of ourclinical trials. One CRO has responsibility forasubstantial portion of our activities and reportingr related to our clinical trials and if such CROdoes not adequately perform, many of our trials may beaffected. We mayneed to replace our CROs, which may resultin the delay of the affected trials or otherwise adverselyaffect our efforts toobtain regulatoryar pprovals and commercialize our product candidates.\n\n## Adverse safety events or restrictions on use and safety warnings for our products can negatively affect our business, product sales and stock price.\n\nAdverse safety events involving our marketed products, generic or biosimilar versions of our marketed products or products from the same class as one of our products may have a negative impactonour business. Discovery of safetyissues withour products could create productliabilityand could cause additional regulatorysrr crutiny and requirements for additional labeling or safety monitoring, withdrawal of products from the market and/or the imposition of fines orcriminal penalties. Adverse safety events may also damage physician, patient and/or investor confidence in ourproducts and our reputation. Any of these could resultinadverse impacts on our results of operations.\n\nRegulatory authorities are making greater amountsof stand-alone safetyinformation directly available to the public through periodic safety update reports, patient registries and other reportingrr requirements. The reporting of adverse safety events involving our products or products similar to oursand public rumorsabout such events may increase claims against us and may also cause our productsales to decline or our stockpriceto experience periods of volatility.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices in ways that heighten thisdependence, including changing the requirement that most of our office-based employees in the U.S. and our other key markets work from the office. As a result, weare increasingly dependent upon our technology systems tooperate our business and our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security,reliability and adequacyof our technology systemsand data, which includes use of cloud technologies, including Software as a Servirr ce (SaaS), PlatformasaService (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Breakdowns, invasions,corruptions, destructions and/or breaches of our technology systems, including our cloud technologies, and/or unauthorized access to our data and information could subject us toliability, negativelyimpactour business operations, and/or require replacement of technology and/or ransom payments. Our technology systems, including our cloud technologies, continue to increase in multitude and complexity, increasing our vulnerability when breakdowns, malicious intrusions and random attacks occur. Data privacyorsecurity breaches also pose arisk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secretsor personal information belonging to us, patients, customers or other business partnerrr s, may beexposed to unauthorized persons or to the public.\n\nCyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity,and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, when they impact vendors, customers or companies, including vendors, suppliers and other companies in oursupplychain. They are often carried out by motivated, well-resourced, skilled and persistent actors, including nation states, organized crime groups, 'hacktivists' and employees orcontractorsacting with careless or malicious intent. Cyber-attacks include deployment of harmful malware and key loggers, ransomware, a denial-of-ff service attack,amalicious website, the use of social engineering and other means to affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our technology systemsand data. Cyber-attacks also include manufacturing, hardware or software supplychain attacks, whichcould cause a delay in the manufacturing of products or productsproduced for contract manufacturing or lead to a data privacy or security breach. Our key business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systemscould adverselyaffect our security posture. In addition, our increased use of cloud technologies heightens these and other operational risks, and any failure bycloud or other technology servirr ce",

These initiatives focusoncommon international principles for theentitlement to taxation of global corporate profits and minimumglobal tax rates.\n\n## Our business involves environmental risks, which include the cost of compliance and the risk of contamination or injury.\n\nOur business and the business of several of our strategic partnerrr sinvolve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologicsand radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with state, federal and foreign standards, there will alwaysbethe risk of accidental contamination or injury.rr If we were tobecome liable for an accident, orif we were to sufferff an extended facility shutdown, wecould incur significant costs, damages and penalties that could harm our business. Manufacturing of our products and product candidates also requires permits from government agencies for water supply and wastewater discharge. If we do notobtain appropriate permits, including permits forsufficient quantities of water and wastewater, wecould incur significant costs and limits on our manufacturing volumes that could harm our business.\n\n## ITEM 1B.

Management's Discii ussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations located in our Annual ReportonForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n## Introduction\n\nBiogen is a global biopharmaceuticalcompany focused on discovering, developing and delivering worldwide innovative therapies for people living with serious neurological and neurodegenerative diseases as wellas related therapeutic adjacencies. We have a leading portfolio of medicines to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), have introduced the firstapproved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and are providing the first and only approved treatment to address a defining pathology of Alzheimer'sdisease. We also commercialize biosimilars of advanced biologicsand focus on advancing our pipeline in neuroscience and specialized immunology. Lastly, we are focused on accelerating our efforff ts r r in digital health tosupport our commercial and pipeline programs while also creating opportunities for potential digital therapeutics. We support our drug discovery and development efforts through the commitment of significant resources todiscovery, research and development programs and business development opportunities.\n\nOur marketed products include TECFIDERA, VUMERITY, AVONEX, PLEGRIDY, TYSABRI and FAMPYRAfor the treatment of MS; SPINRAZA for the treatment of SMA; ADUHELM for the treatment of Alzheimer'sdisease; and FUMADERM for the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis. We have certain business and financial rights with respect toRITUXAN for thetreatment of non-Hodgkin'slymphoma, CLL and other conditions; RITUXAN HYCELA for the treatment of non-Hodgkin'slymphoma and CLL; GAZYVA for thetreatment of CLL and follicular lymphoma; OCREVUS for thetreatment of PPMS and RMS; and other potential anti-CD20 therapies, including mosunetuzumab, pursuant to our collaboration arrangements withGenentech, a wholly-yy\n\nowned member of the Roche Group.Foradditional information on our collaboration arrangements with Genentech, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationshipsi ,toourconsolidated financial statementsincluded in this report.\n\nOurinnovative drug developmentand commercialization activitiesarecomplemented by our biosimilar business that expands access to medicines and reduces the cost burden forhealthcare systems. Through our agreements withSamsung Bioepis, our joint venture withSamsung BioLogics, we market and sell BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL, IMRALDI,an adalimumab biosimilar referencing HUMIRA,and FLIXABI,an infliximab biosimilar referencing REMICADE, in certain countries in Europe. We have also secured the exclusive rights to commercialize BYOOVIZ,aranibizumab biosimilar referencing LUCENTIS, which was approved in the U.S., the E.U. and the U.K. during the third quarter of 2021. Foradditional information on our collaboration arrangements withSamsung Bioepis, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationshipsi ,toour consolidated financial statementsincludedin this report.r\n\nWe seek to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines to patients around theworld. To that end, wecontinually review our manufacturing capacity, capabilities, processes and facilities. In order to support our future growth and drug development pipeline, weareexpanding our large molecule production capacitybybuilding a large-scale biologics manufacturing facilityinSolothurn, Switzerland. In the second quarter of 2021 a portirr on of the facility received a GMP multi-productlicense from SWISSMEDIC. We believethat the Solothurn facility will support our anticipated near-termneeds for the manufacturing of ADUHELM and other biologic assets. In addition, we believe that the Solothurn sitemay provide us with the ability to furtherrr expand if we need additionallarge scale manufacturing capacity to support future clinical and commercial manufacturing requirements. If we are unable to fully utilizeour manufacturing facilities, due to lower than forecasted demand forour products, we will incur excess capacitycharges which will haveanegative effecff ton our financial condition and resultsof operations.\n\nOur revenue depends upon continued sales of our products as wellas thefinancial rights we have in our anti-CD20 therapeuticprograms,and, unless we develop, acquire rights toand/orcommercialize new productsand technologies, we will be substantially dependent on sales from our products and our financial rights in our anti-CD20 therapeuticprograms for many years.",

Business, included in this report. Foradditionalinformationonour competitionand pricing risks thatcouldnegatively impactour productsales, please read Item 1A. Risk Factors, included in this report.\n\n## ADUHELM (aducanumab)\n\n## U.S.\n\nIn June 2021 the FDA granted accelerated approval of ADUHELM,which we are developing and commercializing in collaboration with Eisai, based on reduction in amyloid beta plaques observed in patients treated withADUHELM. As partorr fthe accelerated approval, we will conductaconfirmatoryrr trial to verifytff heclinical benefitofADUHELM in patients withAlzheimer'sdisease. The FDA may withdraw approvalif, among other things, the confirmatorytrr rial fails to verifycff linical benefitof ADUHELM, ADUHELM's benefit-risk is no longer positive or we fail tocomply with the conditions of the accelerated approval.\n\nThe U.S. ADUHELM productlabel states that treatment withADUHELM shouldbe initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairmentor mild dementia stage of disease, the population which was studied in clinical trials. Weexpectpatient uptake will begradual and we do not expectall eligible patients will be treated with ADUHELM foravariety of reasons, including appropriate patient selection criteria, a complex diagnostic and care pathway, the lack of readiness of healthcare providersand institutions to initiate treatment, concern regarding the accelerated approval of ADUHELM and itsdata and the ability to obtainand maintainadequate reimbursement for ADUHELM. InJanuary 2022the Centersfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released a proposed NCD decision memorandum, stating the proposed NCD would cover FDAapproved monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid for thetreatment of Alzheimer's disease for peoplewith Medicare only if they are enrolled in qualifyiff ng clinical trials. Weexpectafinal Medicare NCD by the second quarter of 2022, which should clarify Medicare reimbursement for theclass of antibodies directed against amyloid. If the final\n\nNCD is not broader than the proposedNCD, ourfuture operating results may be negativelyimpacted.\n\nUnder our collaboration agreement with Eisai (ADUHELM Collaboration Agreement), we and Eisai will co-promote ADUHELM with aregion-based profit split, withEisai reimbursing us for45.0%of development andcommercialization costsincurred by the collaboration for theadvancement of ADUHELM in the U.S. Shipments of ADUHELM commenced during the second quarter of 2021.\n\nWe have made, and maycontinue to make, commercial, medical and infrastructure investments in support of activities associated with the launch of ADUHELM in the U.S.\n\n## RestofWorWW ld\n\nIn October 2020the EMAaccepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application foraducanumab and in December 2020the MHLW accepted for review the Japanese NDA for aducanumab.\n\nIn December 2021 the CHMP of the EMA adoptedanegative opinion on the MAA for aducanumab in Europe. Weare seeking a reexamination of the opinion by the CHMP.\n\nIf we do not receive regulatory approval or are unable to successfully commercialize aducanumab in otherjurisdictions, our financial condition, business and operations may beadverselyaffected.\n\n## TECFIDERA\n\nIn 2020 U.S. federal courtsinWest Virginia and Delaware entered judgments in favor of the defendants in patent infringementproceedings relating to TECFIDERA Orange-Book listed patents. We appealed both decisions. In late 2021 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) affirmed the judgment of the West Virginia federal court. Theappeals in the Delaware cases were stayed and weexpect will remain so until the decision in the West Virginia case becomes final.\n\nMultiple TECFIDERA generic entrantsare now in the U.S.market and have deeplydiscounted prices compared to TECFIDERA. The generic competition for TECFIDERAhas significantly reduced our TECFIDERA revenue andis expected to continue to have a substantial and increasing negative impact on our U.S. TECFIDERA revenue in the future.\n\nIn May 2021 the European General Court annulled the EMA'sdecision not to validate applications forapproval of TECFIDERA genericson the basis that the EMA conducted the wrong assessment when determining TECFIDERA's entitlement to regulatory data and marketing protection. Our Company,the EMA and the EChave eachappealed the General Court'sdecision as wrongly decided and the appeal is pending.",

During the fourthrr quarter of 2021 VUMERITY was approved for the treatment of RRMS in the E.U., Switzerland and the U.K.\n\nFor2021 compared to 2020, the 60.3% decrease in U.S. Fumarate revenue was primarily due to a decrease in TECFIDERAdemand as a result of multiple TECFIDERA generic entrants entering the U.S. market. The decrease was partially offsetff by an increase in VUMERITY sales volumes in the U.S.\n\nFor2021 compared to 2020, the 9.4% increase in rest of world Fumarate revenue was primarily due to an increase in TECFIDERAsales volumes of 6.2%.\n\nIn 2020 U.S. federal courtsinWest Virginia and Delaware entered judgments in favor of the defendants in patent infringementproceedings relating to TECFIDERA Orange-Book listed patents. We appealed both decisions. In late 2021 the Federal Circuit affiff rmed the judgment of the West Virginia federal court. Theappeals in the Delaware cases were stayed and we expect will remain so until the decision in the West Virginia case becomes final.\n\nMultiple TECFIDERA generic entrantsare now in the U.S. market and have deeplydiscounted prices compared to TECFIDERA. The generic competition for TECFIDERAhas significantly reduced our TECFIDERA revenue andis expected to continue to have a substantial and increasing negative impactonour U.S. TECFIDERA revenue in the future.\n\nIn May 2021 the European General Court annulled the EMA'sdecision not to validate applications forapproval of TECFIDERA genericson the basis that the EMA conducted the wrong\n\nassessment when determining TECFIDERA's entitlement to regulatory dataand marketing protection. Our Company,the EMA and the EChave eachappealed the General Court'sdecision as wrongly decided and theappeal is pending.\n\nIn November 2021 the CHMP of the EMA issued an ad hoc opinion referencing the General Court's decision whichconcluded that \"the totalityofthe available data cannot establish that [monoethyl fumarate] exertsrr a clinically relevant therapeutic contribution within FUMADERM.\"The EC will decide TECFIDERA's entitlement to regulatory data and market protection. If data and market protection is not upheld,wecould face generic competition in the E.U. as early as the first half of 2022, which would have an adverse impactonour TECFIDERAsales in the E.U. andour resultsof operations.\n\nFor additional information, please read Note 20, Litigaii tion, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nWeexpect that TECFIDERA revenue willcontinue to decline in 2022, compared to 2021,as a resultof increasing generic competition.\n\nWeexpect an increase in VUMERITY sales volumes in 2022, compared to 2021, mostly driven by demand growth, including the continued launch of VUMERITY in the E.U.\n\n## Interferon\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor2021 compared to 2020, the 22.8% decrease in U.S. Interferon revenue was primarily due toadecrease in Interferon sales volumes of 18.7%.

These increases were offsetbylower volumes resulting from increased competition in certain established markets, particularlyGermany.\n\nWeface competition fromagene therapy product and an oral product. In 2022 weexpect that SPINRAZA revenue willbe subject to increased competition, likely resulting in continued patient discontinuations and a lower rate of new patient starts,rr combined with the impact of loading dose dynamics, as patients transition to dosing once every four months, and lower prices in certain rest of world countries.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements with Ionis, please read Note 18, Collaborativeand Other Relationships, to our consolidated financial statementsincluded in this report.",

Our most significant amortir zable intangible assets are related to our TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and TECFIDERA (rest of world) products and other programs acquired through business combinations.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, amortirr zation and impairmentof acquiredintangible assets reflects the impactof a $365.0 million impairment charge related to BIIB111, a $220.0 million impairment charge related to BIIB112 and a $44.3 million impairment charge related to vixotrigine (BIIB074) for the potential treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TGN).\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, amortirr zation and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impactof a $115.0 million impairment charge related to BIIB111,a$75.4 million impairment charge related to BIIB054 and a $19.3 million impairment charge related to one of our other IPR&D intangible assets.\n\nAmortirr zation of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, totaled $252.0 million, $255.1 million and $274.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nWe monitor events and expectations regarding productperformance. If new informationindicates that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis are substantially different than those utilized in our current estimates, our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue ofthe relevant products. The occurrence of an adverse event could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense related to our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations, which\n\nmay result in asignificant negative impactonour future results of operations.\n\n## IPR&D Related to Business Combinations\n\nIPR&D represents the fair value assigned to research and development assets that weacquired as part of a business combination and had not yet reached technological feasibilityat the date of acquisition. We review amounts capitalized as acquired IPR&D for impairmentannually, asof October 31, and whenever events orchanges in circumstances indicate to us that the carryirr ng value of the assets might not be recoverable.\n\nOverall, the value of our acquired IPR&D assets is dependent upon several variables, including estimates of future revenue and theeffects of competition, our ability tosecure sufficient pricing in a competitive market, ourability toconfirm safety and efficacy based on data fromclinical trials and regulatoryfr eedback, the level of anticipated development costs and the probabilityand timing of successfully advancing a partir cular researchprogram from one clinical trial phase to the next. Weare continually reevaluating our estimates concerning these and other variables, including our life cycle management strategies, researchand development priorities and development risk,changes in program and portfolio economics and related impactof foreign currency exchange rates and economictrends and evaluating industry and company data regarding the productivity of clinical researchand the development process. Changes in our estimates may result in a significant change to our valuation of our IPR&D assets.\n\n## Vixotrii igine\n\nIn the periods sinceweacquired vixotrigine, there have been numerous delaysin the initiationof Phase 3studies for the potential treatment of TGN and for the potential treatment of diabetic painful neuropathy (DPN), another form of neuropathic pain. We have engaged with the FDA regarding the design of the Phase 3studies of vixotriginefor the potential treatment of TGN and DPN and are now performing an additional clinical trial of vixotrigine.\n\nThe performance of this additional clinical trial delayed the initiation of the Phase 3studies of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of TGN, and,as a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $44.3 million related to vixotrigine for the potential treatmentofTGN during the first quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the carryingrr value associated with the remaining IPR&D asset forDPN was $132.7 million and thefair value of thisasset was not significantlyin excess of its carryingrr value.",

Thechange in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at December 31, 2021,from December 31, 2020, was primarily due to net cashflow provided by operating activities, partir ally offsetff by cash used forshare repurchases and capital expenditures, cash payments made in connection with ourExchange Offerand a milestone payment made to Neurimmune.\n\nInvestments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, include the carrying value of our investment in Samsung Bioepis of $599.9 million and $620.2 million, respectively. As Samsung Bioepis is a privately-heldyy entity, ourability toliquidate our investment in Samsung Bioepis may be limited and we may realize significantly less than the value of\n\nsuch investment.The investment is also subject to foreign currencyexchange fluctuations.\n\nIn connection with ourcollaboration with Sangamo, we purchased approximately 24 million shares of Sangamocommon stock in April 2020. As of December 31, 2021and 2020, the fair value of thisinvestment was$173.7 million and $333.7 million, respectively.\n\nIn connection with our collaboration with Denali, we purchased approximately 13 million shares of Denali common stockinSeptember2020. As of December 31, 2021and 2020, the fair value of this investment was $550.7 million and $935.7 million, respectively.\n\nIn connection with ourcollaboration with Sage, we purchased approximately 6.2 millionshares of Sage common stock in December 2020. As of December 31, 2021and 2020, the fair value of this investment was $231.9 million and $433.9 million, respectively.\n\nOur investment in Ioniscommon stock had a fair value of $87.5 million and $249.1 million as of December 31, 2021and 2020, respectively. The decrease was partially due to the sale of a portirr on of our investment in Ioniscommon stock during the first quarter of 2021.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements withSamsung Bioepis, Sangamo, Denali, Sage and Ionis, please read Note 18, Collaborative and Other Relationships ,toour consolidated financial statementsincluded in this report.r\n\n## Borrowings\n\nIn February 2021 we completedour Exchange Offer, consisting of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 $624.6 million aggregate principal amount of our 2045 Senior Notes was exchanged for $700.7 million aggregate principal amount of our 2051 Senior Notes and approximately $151.8 million of aggregate cash payments;and\n- \u00b7 $8.9 million aggregate principal amount of our 2045 Senior Notes was redeemed for approximately$12.1 million of aggregate cash payments, excluding accrued and unpaid interest.\n\nIn April 2020 we issuedour 2020 Senior Notes for an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion, consisting of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Senior Notes due May 1, 2030; and",

The terms of the revolving creditfacility includeafinancial covenant that requires us not to exceed amaximum consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings and were incompliance withall covenants under this facility.\n\n## Working Capital\n\nWorking capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities. Working capital was $3.6 billion and $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2021and 2020, respectively. Thechange in working capital reflects an increase in total current assets of approximately $969.4 million and an increase in total current liabilities of approximately$556.0 million.\n\nThe increase in total current assets was primarily driven by an increase in net cash,cash equivalentsand marketable securities, due to net cash flow provided by operating activities, partially offset by cash used for share repurchases andcapital expenditures, cash payments made in connection with ourExchange Offerand amilestone payment made to Neurimmune.\n\nThe increase in total current liabilities was primarily due to the reclassification of $1.0 billionof our Senior Notes due September 15,2022, to current liabilities from notes payable, as these Senior Notes\n\nare due within one year.Thisincrease was partially offset by areduction in accountspayable as wellas accrued expense and other, which was primarily related to decreases in the accrual of contingent payments, theaccrual for employee compensation and benefits and the fair values of derivative liabilities.\n\n## Share Repurchase Programs\n\nIn October2020 ourBoardof Directors authorizedour2020 Share Repurchase Program, which is a program to repurchase up to$5.0 billionof ourcommon stock.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the resultsofwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carryir ng values of assets, liabilities and equityand the amount of revenue and expense. Actual results may differff from these estimates. Other significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ,toourconsolidated financial statementsincluded in this report.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue whenour customer obtainscontrolof promised goodsorservices, in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue following the five-step model prescribed under Financial Accounting Standards Board(FASB) Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenuefroff mContracts wtt ith Customers : (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identifytff he performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction priceto the performance obligations in the contract;and (v) recognize revenue when(oras) we satisfy the performance obligations.\n\n## Product Revenue\n\nIn the U.S., we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributorsand specialty pharmacy providers. In other countries, we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors, hospitals, pharmacies and other third-partydistribution partnerrr s. These customers subsequently resell our products to healthcare providersand patients. In addition, we enter intoarrangements withhealth care providers and payors that provideforgovernment-mandated or privately-negotyy iated discounts and allowances related to our products.\n\nProduct revenue is recognized when the customerobtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. Weexpense incremental costsof obtaining a contract as and when incurred if theexpected amortization periodofthe asset that we would have recognized is one year or lessor theamount is immaterial.\n\n## Reserves for Discounts and Allowances\n\nProduct revenue is recorded netofreservesrr established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts withourcustomers, healthcare providersorpayors, includingthose associated with the implementation of pricing actions incertain of the international markets in which we operate. Our process for estimating reserverr established for these variable consideration components do not differ materially froour historical practices.\n\nProduct revenue reserves, whichareclassified as areduction in product revenue, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns.\n\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to beclaimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payabletoour customer) oraliability(if the amountispayable to a partyr other than our customer).Our estimates of reservesrr established for variable consideration are calculated based uponaconsistent application of our methodology utilizing the expected value method. These estimates reflectour historical experience, current contractual and statutoryrr equirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The transaction price, whichincludes variable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject to constraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized willnot occur in a future period. Actual amounts may ultimatelydiffer from our estimates. If actual results vary,weadjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, a 10.0% change in ourdiscounts, contractual adjustments and reserves would have resulted in a decrease of our pre-tax earnings by approximately$359.7 million.\n\nIn addition to discounts, rebates and product returns, wealso maintain certain customer service contracts withdistributorsand other customers in the distribution channel that provide us withinventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally reflected as areduction of revenue. To the extent wecandemonstrate a separable benefit and fair value for these services weclassifytff hese paymentsinselling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income.",

The determination of obsolete or excessinventory,requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about the future demand of our products, product expiration dates, estimated future sales and our general future plans. If customer demand subsequentlydifferff sfrom our forecasts, requirementsfor inventorywr rite-offs that differ from our estimates maybecome necessary.\n\nAlthough we believe that the assumptions we use in estimating inventory write-downsare reasonable, no assurance canbe given that significant future changes in theseassumptions or changes in future eventsand market conditions could resultindifferff ent estimates.\n\nDuring the fourthr quarter of 2021 we wrote-off approximately $120.0 million of inventory in excess of forecasted demand related to ADUHELM.

We may record additional write-downs of ADUHELM inventoryirr fthefinal NCD is not broader than the proposedNCD.\n\n## Acquired Intangible Assets, including IPR&D\n\nWhen we purchaseabusiness, the acquired IPR&Dis measured at fair value, capitalizedasan intangible assetand tested forimpairmentatleast annually,as of October 31, untilcommercialization, afteff r which time the IPR&D is amortizedover its estimated useful life. Ifweacquire an assetorgroup of assets thatdonot meet the definition of a business underapplicable accounting standards, the acquired IPR&D is expensed on its acquisition date. Future costs to develop these assets are recorded to research and development expense as they are incurred.\n\nWe have acquired,and expect tocontinue to acquire, intangible assets through the acquisition of biotechnology companies or through the consolidation of variable interest entities. These intangible assets primarily consist of technology associated with human therapeutic products and IPR&D productcandidates. When significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired, wegenerally engage an independent thirdparty valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date. Management will determine the fair value of less significant identifiable intangible assets acquired. Discounted cash flow modelsare typically used in\n\nthese valuations, and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in-process projects;\n- \u00b7 projeo cting regulatory approvals;\n- \u00b7 estimating future cash flowfrom productsales resulting fromcompleted products and in processprojeco ts; and\n- \u00b7 developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project.\n\nWe believe thefair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given availablefacts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates.\n\nIf these projects are not successfully developed, the sales and profitabilityofthe company maybe adverselyaffected in future periods. Additionally,the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired. No assurance canbe given that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales, development costs or profitability, or the events associated with suchprojeco ts, will transpire as estimated.\n\n## Impairment and Amortization of Long-lived Assets\n\nLong-lived assets to be heldand used include property, plant and equipment as wellasintangible assets, including IPR&Dand trademarks. Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events orchanges in circumstances indicate that the carryirr ng amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We review our intangible assets withindefinite livesfor impairment annually, asof October 31, and whenever events orchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\nWhen performing our impairment assessment, wecalculate thefair value using the same methodology as described above under Acquired Intangible Assets,tt including IPR&D . Ifthe carryirr ng value of our acquired IPR&D exceeds its fair value, then the intangible asset is written down to itsfair value. Changes in estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our acquired IPR&D could resultinanimpairment. Impairments are recorded within amortirr zation and impairment of acquired intangible assets in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nBased on our most recent impairment assessment we incurred impairment charges of approximately $629.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, mainly related to the discontinuation of IPR&D programs.

Acquired and in-licensed rightsand patentsprimarily relate to our acquisition of all remaining rights to TYSABRI from Elan. Weamortizethe intangible assets related to our TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and TECFIDERA(rest of world) products using the economic consumption method based on revenue generated from the products underlying therelated intangible assets. An analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of our TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and TECFIDERA(rest of world) products is performed annually during our long-range planning cycle and whenever events orchanges in circumstances would significantlyaffect the anticipated lifetime revenue of our TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and TECFIDERA (rest of world) products.\n\nForadditional information on the impairment charges related to our long-lived assetsduring 2021, 2020 and 2019, please read Note 6, Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\n## Contingent Consideration\n\nWe recordcontingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Each reporting period thereafterff ,we revalue the remaining obligations and record increases or decreases in theirfair valueas an adjustment to contingent consideration expense in our consolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations can resultfromchanges to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates and achievement and timing of any cumulative salesbased and development milestones orchanges in the probabilityof certain clinical eventsand changes in the assumed probabilityassociated with regulatory approval. These fair value measurements represent Level 3 measurementsas they are based on significant inputsnot observabrr le in the market.\n\nSignificant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for eachsubsequent period. Accordingly, changes in assumptions described above, could have a material impacton theamount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe prepare and file income tax returnsbased on ourinterpretation of each jurisdiction's tax laws and\n\nregulations. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we estimateour income taxliabilityin eachofthe jurisdictionsin which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together withassessing temporarydr ifferff ences resulting from differff ing treatment of items for taxand financial reportir ng purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assetsand liabilities, whichare included in our consolidated balance sheets. Upon our election in the fourthr quarter of 2018 to record deferred taxes for global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI),wehave included amounts related to GILTI taxes within temporarydrr ifferff ence.\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in assessing the realizabilityof our deferred tax assets. In performing thisassessment, weconsider whether it is more likely than not that some portir on orallofthe deferred tax assets will notberealized. The ultimate realization of deferred taxassetsisdependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making thisdetermination, under the applicable financial accounting standards, weare allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and the effects of tax planning strategies. In the event that actual resultsdifferfromour estimates, weadjust our estimates in future periodsand we may need to establish a valuation allowance, whichcould materially impact ourconsolidated financial position and resultsof operations.\n\nWeaccount for uncertain tax positions using a 'more likely than not' threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. We evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterlybasis and consider various factorsincluding, but not limited to, changesin tax law, the measurement of taxpositions taken orexpected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject toaudit, information obtained during in processauditactivities and changes in facts orcircumstances related to atax position. Weadjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions. Our liabilities for uncertain tax positions canberelieved only if the contingency becomes legallyextinguished, through either payment to thetaxing authority or theexpiration of the statute of limitations, the recognition of the benefitsassociated with the position meet the 'more likely than not' threshold or the liabilitybecomes effectively settled through theexamination process. We consider matters to beeffectively settled once the taxing authority has completed allof its required or expected examination procedures, including all appeals and administrativereviews, we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspectofthe tax position and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re-examine therelated tax",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nWeare subject tocertain risks that may affecff t our results of operations, cash flowand fair values of assets and liabilities, including volatilityinforeign currencyexchange rates, interest rate movementsand equity price exposure as wellaschanges in economic conditions in themarkets in which we operate as a resultofthe COVID-19 pandemic. We manage the impactof foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates through various financial instruments, including derivative instrumentssuchasforeign currency forwardcontracts, interest rate lock contractsand interest rate swap contracts. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Thecounterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions, and there is no significant concentration of exposure with any one counterparty.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Risk\n\nOur resultsof operations are subject toforeign currencyexchange ratefluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. As a result, our consolidated financial position, resultsof operations and cash flow canbe affected by market fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange rates, primarily with respect to the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, Japanese yenand SouthKorean won.\n\nWhile the financial results of our global activities are reportedr in U.S. dollars, the functional currencyfor most of our foreign subsidiaries is their respective local currency. Fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates of the countries in which we do business will affectour operating results, oftenff in ways that are diffiff cult to predict. In partirr cular, as the U.S. dollar strengthens versus other currencies, the value of thenon-U.S.revenue willdecline when reportedr in U.S. dollars. The impact to netincome as a resultof a strengthening U.S. dollar will be partirr ally mitigated by the value of non-U.S. expense, which will also decline when reportedr in U.S. dollars. As the U.S. dollar weakens versus other currencies, the value of the non-U.S. revenue and expense willincrease when reportedr in U.S. dollars.\n\nWe have established revenue andoperating expense hedging and balance sheet risk management programs to protect against volatilityof future foreign currencycash flows and changes in fair value caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2018 the International Practices Task Forceofthe Center for Audit Qualitycategorized Argentina as acountrywrr itha projected three-year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100.0%, which indicated that Argentina's economy is highlyinflationary. This categorization did not have a material impactonour resultsof operations orfinancial position as of December 31, 2021, and is not expected to have a material impact on our resultsof operations orfinancial position in the future.\n\n## Revenue and Operating Expense Hedging Program\n\nOurforeigncurrencyhedging program is designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the impact resulting from volatilityin exchange rate changes on revenue and operating expense. We use foreign currencyforward contracts to manage foreign currency risk,with the majora ityof our forward contracts used to hedge certain forecasted revenue and operating expense transactions denominated in foreign currencies in the next 15 months. We do not engage in currency speculation. Foramore detailed disclosure of our revenue and operating expense hedging program, please read Note 9,Derivativv ve Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements included in this report.\n\nOur ability to mitigate the impactof foreign currency exchange ratechanges on revenue andnet income diminishes as significant foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are sustained over extended periodsoftime. In particular, devaluation or significant deterioration of foreign currency exchange rates are difficult to mitigate and likely to negatively impact earnings. Thecash flowfrom these contracts are reportedr as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flow.\n\n## Balance Sheet Risk Management Hedging Program\n\nWealso use forward contracts to mitigate the foreign currency exposure related to certair nbalance sheet items. The primaryorr bjective of our balance sheet risk management program is to mitigate the exposure of foreign currencydenominated net monetary assetsand liabilities of foreign affilff iates. In these instances, we principally utilize currency forward contracts. We have not elected hedge accounting for the balance sheet related items. Thecash flowfrom these contractsare reported as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flow.\n\nThefollowing quantitative informationincludes the impactof currency movementsonforward contracts used in our revenue, operating expense and balance sheet hedging programs. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, a hypothetical adverse 10.0% movement in foreigncurrency exchange rates compared to the U.S. dollaracrossall maturities",

The estimated fair value change was determinedby measuring the impactofthe hypothetical exchange rate movement on outstanding forwardcontracts. Our use of this methodology to quantifytff he market risk of suchinstrumentsissubject toassumptions and actual impact could be significantlydiffeff rent. The quantitative informationabout market risk is limited because it does not take intoaccountall foreign currencyoperating transactions.\n\n## Net Investment Hedge Program\n\nOurnet investmenthedging program is designed to mitigate currencyfluctuationsbetween the U.S. dollar and the SouthKorean won as a result of our approximately49.9% ownershipinterest in Samsung Bioepis. We entered intoforeign currencyforward contracts to hedge changes in the spot rate over the next10 months. As of December 31, 2021and 2020, a hypothetical adverse 10.0% movement would resultinahypothetical decrease in fair value of approximately$58.7 million and $56.9 million, respectively. The estimated fair value was determined by measuring the impactofthe hypothetical spot rate movement on outstanding forwardcontracts. We plan to unwind our foreign currencyforwardcontracts in conjunction with the closing of our proposedsale of our ownership interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung Biologics. Closing of the transaction is currently anticipated in mid-2022, contingent on the effectiveness of a securities registration statement filed by Samsung Biologicsand satisfaction of certain regulatoryar nd other customary closing conditions.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nOur investmentportfolio includescash equivalentsand short-term investments. Thefair value of our marketable securities is subject to change as a resultof potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instrumentshas been assessed on a hypothetical100 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. As of December 31, 2021and 2020, we estimate that suchhypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement would resultinahypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $14.3 million and $13.2 million, respectively, to our interest rate sensitive instruments. Thefair values of our investments were determined using third-party pricing services or other market observable data.\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nFinancialinstruments thatpotentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk include cash andcash equivalents, investments, derivatives and accounts receivable. Weattempt to minimize therisks related\n\nto cash and cash equivalents and investments by investing in a broad and diverse range of financial instruments. We haveestablished guidelines related to credit ratings and maturities intended to safeguard principal balances and maintainliquidity. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with ourinvestment policy, which defines allowable investments, specifies credit qualitystandards and limits thecredit exposure of any single issuer. We minimize credit risk resulting from derivative instruments by choosing only highly rated financial institutions as counterparties.\n\nWe operate incertain countries where weakness in economic conditions, including as a resultofthe COVID-19 pandemic, can result in extended collection periods. Wecontinue to monitor these conditions, including the volatilityassociated withinternational economies and the relevant financial markets, and assess their possible impact on our business. To date, we have notexperienced any significant losses with respect to thecollection of our accounts receivable.\n\nWe believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts was adequate as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Equity Price Risk\n\nOur strategic investmentportfolio includes investments in equitysecurities of certain biotechnology companies. While weareholding such securities, wearesubject to equity price risk,and this may increase the volatilityof our income in future periods due to changes in the fair value of equity investments. We maysell such equity securities based on ourbusiness considerations, which may include limiting our price risk.\n\nChanges in the fair value of these equity securities are impactedby the volatilityofthe stock market and changes in general economic conditions, among other factors. The potential change in fair valuefor equity price sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 10.0%adverse movement. Asof December 31, 2021and 2020, a hypothetical adverse 10.0% movement would resultin a hypothetical decrease in fair value of approximately $104.8 million and $188.8 million, respectively.\n\n## ITEM 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n## Controls and Procedures\n\nWe have carriedoutan evaluation, under the supervision and with the participationof our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of theeffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (asdefined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Actof1934, as amended),as of December 31, 2021. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, asoftheend of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that:\n\n- (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reportsrr that wefile or submit under the Securities Exchange Actis recorded, processed, summarized and reportedrr within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securitiesand Exchange Commission's rules and forms;and\n- (b) suchinformationisaccumulated and communicated toour management, including our principal executive officerff andprincipal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,canprovide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possiblecontrols and procedures.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in ourinternal control overfinancial reportirr ng during the quarter ended December 31, 2021, that have materially affecff ted, or are reasonably likely to materially affecff t, our internal control over financial reportirr ng.\n\n## Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control overour financial reportir ng. Internal control over financial\n\nreportir ng is definedinRules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Actasaprocess designed by, or under thesupervision of, acompany's principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by acompany's board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliabilityof financial reportir ng and the preparation of financial statementsfor external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Forconsolidated entities where weown orareexposed to less than 100.0% of theeconomics, we recordnet income (loss) attributableto noncontrolling interests, net of tax in ourconsolidated statements of income equal to the percentage of the economicorownership interest retained in such entities by the respective noncontrolling parties. Intercompany balances and transactions areeliminatedinconsolidation.\n\nIn determining whether we are theprimary beneficiary of avariable interest entity, we apply aqualitative approach that determines whether we have both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) theobligation to absorb losses of, or theright to receive benefits from,the entity that could potentially be significant to that entity. We continuously assess whether we are theprimary beneficiary of avariable interest entity as changes to existing relationships or future transactions may resultin usconsolidating or deconsolidating one or more of our collaboratorsorpartnerrr s.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that mayaffect thereported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expense and related",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.Onanongoing basis weevaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable, the resultsofwhich form the basisfor making judgments about the carryirr ng values of assets, liabilities and equityand the amount of revenue and expense. Actual results may differff from these estimates.\n\nThe length of timeand full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic directly orindirectlyimpactsour business, results of operations and financial condition, including sales, expense, reservesrr and allowances, the supply chain, manufacturing, clinical trials, researchand development costs and employee-related costs, depends on future developments that are highly uncertain, subject to change and are difficult to predict, including as a resultof new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions taken to containor treat COVID-19 as wellas the economic impact on local, regional, nationaland international customers and markets. We have made estimates of the impactofthe COVID-19 pandemic withinourconsolidated financial statementsand there may bechanges to those estimates in future periods.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue whenour customer obtains controlof promised goodsorservices, in an amount that reflects the consideration which weexpect to receive in exchange for those goods or servirr ces. We recognize revenue following the five-step model prescribed under the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenuefroff m Contractsrr with Customersrr : (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii)identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction priceto the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when(oras) we satisfy the performance obligations.\n\n## Product Revenue\n\nIn the U.S., we sellour products primarily to wholesale distributorsand specialty pharmacy providers. In other countries, we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors, hospitals, pharmacies and other third-party distribution partnerrr s. These customers subsequently resell our products to healthcare providersand patients. In addition, we enter intoarrangements withhealth care providersand payors that provideforgovernment-mandated or privately-negotyy iated discounts and allowances related to our products.\n\nProduct revenue is recognized when the customerobtains control of our product, whichoccurs at a point in time, typically upon delivery to the customer. Weexpense incremental costsof obtaining a contract as and when incurred if theexpected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial.\n\n## Reserves for Discounts and Allowances\n\nProduct revenue is recorded netofreservesrr established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts withourcustomers, health care providersorpayors, includingthose associated with the implementationof pricing actions in certain of the international markets in which we operate.\n\nProduct revenue reserves, whichareclassified as areduction in product revenue, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, contractual adjustments and returns.\n\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to beclaimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payabletoour customer) oraliability(if the amount is payable to a partyrr other than our customer).Our estimates of reservesrr established for variable consideration are calculated based upon a consistent application of our methodology utilizing the expected value method. These estimates reflectour historical experience, current contractual and statutoryrrr equirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. The transaction price, which includes variable consideration reflecting the impact of discounts and allowances, may be subject toconstraint and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized willnot occurinafuture period. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results vary,weadjust these estimates, whichcould have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\n\nDiscounts include trade term discounts and wholesaler incentives. Trade termdiscounts and wholesaler incentives primarily relate to estimated obligations for credits to be granted to wholesalersfor remitting payment on theirpurchases within established incentive periods and credits to be granted to wholesalersfor compliancewith various contractually-definedyy inventorymrr anagement practices, respectively. We determine these reservesrr based on our historical experience, including the timing of customer payments.",

Rebateaccruals are recorded in the same period therelated revenue is recognized, resulting in areduction of product revenue and theestablishment of a liability which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Our liabilityfor Medicaid rebates consistsof estimates forclaims that a state will make for the current quarter, claimsfor prior quarters that have been estimated for whichaninvoice has not been received, invoices received forclaims from the prior quarterrr s that have not been paid and an estimate of potential claims that will be madeforinventorytrr hat existsin the distribution channel at period end.\n- \u00b7 Governmental rebates orchargebacks, including VA and PHS discounts, represent our estimated obligations resulting fromcontractual commitments tosellproducts to qualified healthcare providersat prices lower than the listprices we charge to wholesalers which provide those products. The wholesaler charges us for the differff ence between what thewholesaler paysfor the products and theultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Rebate and chargeback reserves are established in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, resulting in areduction of product revenue and areduction in the netaccounts receivable. Chargebackamounts are generally determined at the time of resaleto the qualified healthcare provider from thewholesaler, and we generally issuecredits for suchamounts within a few weeks of the wholesaler notifying us about the resale. Our reserves forVA, PHS and chargebacks consist of amounts that weexpect toissue for inventory that existsat the wholesalers that weexpect will be sold toqualified healthcare providersand chargebacks that wholesalershave claimed for which we have not issued a credit.\n- \u00b7 Managed care rebates represent our estimated obligations to third-parties, primarily pharmacybenefit managers. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period therelated revenue is recognized, resulting in areduction of product revenue and theestablishment of a liability which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. These rebates resultfromperformancebased goals, formularypr osition and price increase limitallowances (price protection). Thecalculation of the accrual for these rebates is based on an estimate ofthecoverage patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period.\n- \u00b7 Copay assistancerepresents financial assistance to qualified patients, assisting them withprescription drug co-payments required by insurance. Thecalculation of the accrual for copay is based on an estimate of claims and the cost per claim that weexpect to receive associated with inventory that exists in the distribution channel at period end.\n- \u00b7 Pharmacy rebates represent our estimated obligations resulting fromcontractual commitments tosell products to specific pharmacies. Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period therelated revenue is recognized, resulting in areduction of product revenue and theestablishment of a liability which is included in accrued expense and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. These rebates result from contracted discounts on product purchased or product dispensed. Thecalculation of the accrual for these rebates is based on an estimate of the pharmacy'sbuying or dispensing patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over the contractual period.\n- \u00b7 Other governmental rebates, non-U.S. pharmaceutical taxesorapplicable allowancesprimarily relate to mandatory rebates anddiscounts in international markets where government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primaryprr ayors for healthcare.\n\nProduct return reserves are established for returns made by wholesalersand are recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in areduction to product revenue. In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalersare permitted to returnproduct for reasons suchasdamaged orexpired product. The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration. Expired product return reservesrr are estimated through a comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of returnare determined for each productand are adjusted for knownor expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product.\n\nIn addition to discounts, rebates and product returns, wealso maintaincertain customer service contracts with distributorsand other customers in the distribution channel that provide us withinventory management, data and",

Forpurposes of this footnote, we refer to RITUXAN and RITUXAN HYCELA collectivelyasRITUXAN.\n\nOur share ofthe pre-tax co-promotion profitsonRITUXAN and GAZYVA and royalty revenue on the sale of OCREVUS resulted froman exchange of a license. As we do nothave future performance obligations under the license orcollaboration agreement, revenue is recognized as the underlying sales occur.\n\nRevenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs consist of:\n\n- (i) our share of pre-tax profits and losses in the U.S. for RITUXAN and GAZYVA;and\n- (ii) other revenue fromanti-CD20 therapeutic programs,whichprimarily consistof our share of pre-taxcopromotionprofits on RITUXAN in Canada and royalty revenue on sales of OCREVUS.\n\nPre-tax co-promotion profitsonRITUXAN and GAZYVA are calculated and paid to us by Genentechand the Roche Group. Pre-tax co-promotion profitsconsist of net sales to third-partyrr customers less applicable costs to manufacture, third-party royalty expense, distribution, selling and marketing expense andjoint developmentexpense incurred by Genentechand the Roche Group.Our share ofthe pre-tax profitsonRITUXAN and GAZYVA include estimates that are based on information received from Genentechand the Roche Group. These estimates are subject to change and actual results may differ.\n\nWe recognize royalty revenue on sales of OCREVUS based on our estimates from third-partyand market research data of OCREVUS sales occurring during the corresponding period. Differff ences between actual and estimated royalty revenue willbe adjusted for in the period in which theybecome known, which is generally expected to be the following quarter.\n\nFor additional information on our relationship withGenentech, please read Note 18, Collaborativeand Other Relationshipsi , to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Other Revenue\n\n## Royalto yR t evenue\n\nWe recognize royalty revenue related to sales by our licenseesof productscovered under patents that we own.\n\n## Collaborativeand Other Relationships\n\nWe have a number of significant collaborativeand other third-party relationships for revenue and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates. Where we are the principal on sales transactions with third-partir es, we recognize revenue, cost of sales and operating expense on a gross basis in their respective lines in our consolidated statements of income. Where we are not the principal on sales transactions with third-parties, we record our share of the revenue, costof sales and operating expense on a net basis in collaborativeand other relationships included in other revenue in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nOur development and commercialization arrangements withGenentechand Samsung Bioepis represent collaborative arrangementsas each partyr is an active partirr cipant in one or more joint operating activities and is exposed to significant risks and rewards of these arrangements. These arrangements resulted froman exchange of a license and utilizethe sales and usage based royalty exception. Therefore, revenue relating to royalties or profitsharing amounts received is recognizedas the underlying sales occur.\n\nFor additional information on our collaboration arrangements withGenentechand Samsung Bioepis, please read Note 18, Collaborativeand Other Relationships ,to these consolidated financial statements.",

Revenue under contract manufacturing agreements is recognized whenthe customerobtains control of the product, which may occuratapoint in time or over time depending on the termsand conditions of the agreement.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nWe have certain financial assetsand liabilities recordedatfair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards forfair value measurements.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 -Fair values are determined utilizing quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have theability toaccess;\n- \u00b7 Level 2 -Fair values are determined by utilizing quoted prices foridentical or similar assetsand liabilities in active markets or other market observabrr le inputssuchasinterest rates, yield curves, foreign currency spot rates and option pricing valuation models; and\n- \u00b7 Level 3 -Pricesor valuations that require inputs that are bothsignificant to thefair value measurement and unobservable.\n\nThe majora ityof ourfinancial assets have been classified as Level 2. Our financial assets (whichinclude our cashequivalents, marketable debt securities and certain of our marketableequity securities, derivative contracts and plan assetsfor deferred compensation) have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued,atthe end of each reporting period, utilizing third-party pricing servirr ces or option pricing valuation models. The pricing services utilize industry standardvaluation models, including both income and market-based approaches and observable market inputs todetermine value. These observable market inputsincludereportable trades, benchmarkyields, creditspreads, broker/dealerr quotes, bids, offerff s, current spot rates and other industry and economic events.\n\nWe validate the prices provided by our third-partyrr pricing services by understanding themodels used, obtaining market values from other pricing sources and analyzing pricing data in certain instances. The option pricing valuation models use assumptions within the model, including the term, stock price volatility,constant maturity risk-free interest rateand dividend yield. Afterff completing our validation procedures, we did not adjust or override any fair value measurements provided by our pricing servirr ces as of December 31, 2021and 2020.\n\n## Other Assets and Liabilities\n\nThecarryir ng amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheetsfor current accounts receivable, due from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, other current assets,accounts payable and accrued expense and other, approximate fair value due to theirshort-term maturities.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe consider only those investments thatare highlyliquid,readily convertible to cash and that mature within three months from date of purchasetobe cash equivalents. As of December 31,2021 and 2020, cash equivalents were comprised of money market funds,commercialpaper, overnight reverserepurchaseagreements and other debt securities with maturitiesless than90 daysfrom the date of purchase.\n\n## Accounts Receivable\n\nThe majora ityof ouraccounts receivable arisefrom productsales and primarily represent amountsduefrom our wholesaleand other third-partydistributors, public hospitals, pharmacies and other government entities and have standardpayment terms that generally require payment within 30 to90 days.\n\nWe do not adjust our receivables for theeffects of a significantfinancing componentatcontract inception if we expect to collect the receivables in one year or less from the time of sale.\n\nIn countries where we have experiencedapattern of payments extending beyond our contractual payment term and we expect tocollect receivables greater than one year from the time of sale, we have assessed whether the customer has a significantfinancing component and discounted our receivables and reduced related revenue over the period of time that we estimate those amounts will be paid using the country'r s market-based borrowing rate for such period.

We attempt to minimize therisks related to cash and cash equivalents and investments by investing in a broad and diverse range of financial instruments as previously defined by us. We have established guidelines related to credit ratings and maturities intended to safeguard principal balances and maintainliquidity. Ourinvestmentportfolio is maintained in accordance with ourinvestmentpolicy, whichdefines allowable investments, specifies credit qualitystandards and limits thecredit exposure of any single issuer. Weminimize credit risk resulting from derivative instrumentsbychoosing only highly rated financial institutions as counterparties.\n\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables, which are typically unsecured,aresomewhat mitigated due to thewide varietyof customers and markets using our products, as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas. We monitor the financial performance and creditworthiness of our customers so that wecan properlyassess and respond to changes in their credit profile.

Realized gains and losses are reported in otherincome (expense), net on a specific identification basis.\n\n## Marketable Equity Securities and Venture Capital Funds\n\nmarketableequity securities are recorded at fair market valueand unrealized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net in ourconsolidated statements of income. Our marketable equitysecurities represent investments in publicly traded equitysecurities and are included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nOur investments in venture capital funds are recorded at net asset value, whichapproximates fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net in ourconsolidated statements of income. The underlying investments of the venture capital funds in which we invest are in equitysecurities of certain biotechnology companies and are included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Non-Marketable Equity Securities\n\nWealso invest in equitysecurities of companies whose securities are not publicly traded and wherefair value is not readily available. These investments are recorded using either the equity method of accounting or the cost minus impairment adjustd ed forchanges in observablerr prices, depending on our ownershippercentage and other factors that suggest we have significantinfluence. We monitor these investments to evaluate whetherany increase or decline in their value has occurred, based on the impliedvalue of recent company financings, public market prices of comparable companies and general market conditions. These investments are included in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Evaluating Marketable Debt Securities for Other-than-Temporary Impairments\n\nWe conductperiodic reviews to identify and evaluate eachinvestment thathas an unrealized loss, in accordancewith the meaning of other-than-trr emporary impairment. An unrealized loss exists when the current fair valueof an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis.

Where we intend to sell a security, or may be required to do so, the security's decline in fair value is deemed to be other-trr han-temporary and the fullamount of theunrealized lossis reflected in earnings as an impairment loss.\n\nRegardless of our intent to sell a security,weperform additional analysis on allsecurities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthinessofthe security. Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortirr zed cost basis of a security.\n\n## Equity Method of Accounting\n\nIn circumstances where we havetheability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of a company in which we havean investment, we utilize theequity method of accounting for recording investment activity. Inassessing whether weexercise significant influence, weconsider the nature and magnitude of our investment, the voting and protective rights we hold,any partirr cipation in the governance of the other company and other relevant factorssuchas the presence of a collaborative orother business relationship. Under the equity method of accounting, we record in our consolidated statements of income our share of income or loss of the other company. If our share of losses exceeds the carryirr ng value of our investment, we will suspend recognizing additional losses and willcontinue todoso unless we commit to providing additional funding.\n\n## Inventory\n\nInventoriesare stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost based on the first-in, first-out method. We classify our inventorycosts as long-term when weexpect to utilizethe inventory beyond ournormal operating cycleand include these costs in investments and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Inventorytrr hat canbeused in either the production of clinical or commercial products is expensed as researchand development costs when identified for use in a clinical manufacturing campaign.\n\n## Capitalization of Inventory Costs\n\nWecapitalize inventory costs associated with ourproducts prior to regulatoryarr pproval, when, based on management's judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. We consider numerous attributes in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a particular productshould becapitalized as an asset. We assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular productstands in relation to that approval process, including any knownsafety or efficff acy concerns, potential labeling restrictions and other impediments to approval. Weevaluate our anticipated researchand development initiatives and constraints relating to the productand the indication in whichit will be used. We consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could hamper approvalorcommercialization. We consider the shelf life ofthe product in relation to theexpected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or delay commercialization. Wealso base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria. Finally, we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the productand assess the economic benefit that weare likely to realize. Weexpense previously capitalized costs related to pre-approval inventoryurr pon a change in suchjudgment, due to, among other potential factors,adenial or significant delay of approvalbynecessary regulatory bodies.\n\n## Obsolescence and Unmarketable Inventory\n\nAt each reporting period we reviewour inventories for excess or obsolescence and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. If the actual net realizable value is less than that estimated by us, orif it is determined that inventoryurr tilization will furtherrr diminish based on estimates of demand,additional inventorywrr rite-downs may be required. Additionally, our products are subject tostrictquality control and monitoring that we perform throughout the manufacturing process. In the event that certain batches or unitsof product no longer meet quality specifications, we will record a charge to cost of sales to write-down any unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. In allcases, productinventory is carried at the lower of costorits estimated net realizable value. Amounts written-down due to unmarketable inventory are charged to cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income.",

If the software is an integral partorr f production assets, these costs are included in machineryarr nd equipment and are amortized on a straight-line basis over theestimated useful livesofthe related softwaff re, which generally range from three to five years.\n\nWe generally depreciate or amortirr ze the cost of our propertyrr , plant and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of therespective assets, which are summarized as follows:\n\n| Asset Categoryrrg y            | Useful Lives                                                  |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Land                           | Not depreciated                                               |\n| Buildings                      | 15 to 40 years                                                |\n| Leasehold Improvements         | Lesser of the useful life or the term of the respective lease |\n| Furniture and Fixtures         | 5 to 7 years                                                  |\n| Machinery and Equipment        | 5 to 20 years                                                 |\n| Computer Software and Hardware | 3 to 5 years                                                  |\n\nWhen we dispose of propertyr , plant and equipment, we remove the associated costand accumulated depreciation from the related accounts in our consolidated balance sheetsand includeany resulting gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Leases\n\nWe determine if anarrangementisalease atcontractinception. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease termand operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease based upon the present value of leasepaymentsover the lease term. When determining the lease term, we include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\n\nWe use the implicit rate when readily determinable and use our incremental borrowingratewhen the implicit rate isnot readily determinable based upon theinformationavailableatthe commencement date indetermining the present value of the lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate isdetermined using a secured borrowing rate for the same currencyand termas the associated lease.\n\nThe leasepayments used to determine our operating leaseassets may include lease incentives, stated rent increases and escalation clauses linked to rates of inflation whendeterminableand are recognized in ouroperating lease assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Our leaseagreements may include both lease and non-lease components, which we accountforas a single lease component when the paymentsarefixed. Variable payments included in the lease agreement are expensed as incurred. For certain equipment leases, suchas vehicles, weapply a portfrr olio approach to effectively account for the operating lease assets and liabilities.\n\nOuroperating leases are reflected in operating leaseassets, accrued expense and other and in long-term operating lease liabilities in ourconsolidated balance sheets. Lease expense for minimum lease paymentsis recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWealso have real estate lease agreements whichare subleased to third-parties. Operating leases for which we are the sublessor are included in accrued expense and other and other long-term liabilities in ourconsolidated",

We recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the lease terminour consolidated statementsof income.\n\nFor additional information on our leases, please read Note 11, Leases ,to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nOur intangible assets consist of completed technology (comprised of acquired and in-licensed rights and patents, developed technology, out-licensed patents), in-process researchand development (IPR&D) acquired afterff January 1, 2009, trademarks and trade names. Our intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the time of their acquisition and are stated in our consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated amortirr zation and impairments, if applicable.\n\nIntangible assets related to acquired and in-licensed rights and patents, developed technology and out-licensed patents are amortirr zed over their estimated useful lives using theeconomic consumption method if anticipated future revenue canbe reasonably estimated. The straight-line method is used when revenue cannot be reasonably estimated. Amortirr zation is recorded within amortir zation and impairment of acquired intangible assets in our consolidated statements of income.\n\nAcquired and in-licensed rights and patentsprimarily relate toouracquisition of all remaining rights to TYSABRI from Elan Pharma International Ltd. (Elan), anaffiliate ofElan Corporation, plc. Acquired and in-licensed rights and patents also include other amounts related to our other marketed products and programs acquired through business combinations. Developed technology primarily relates to our AVONEX product, which was recordedinconnection with the merger of Biogen, Inc. and IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation in 2003. Weamortizethe intangible assets related to our TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and TECFIDERA (rest of world) products using the economic consumption method based on revenue generated from the products underlying the related intangible assets. An analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of our TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and TECFIDERA (rest of world) products is performed annually during our long-range planning cycleand whenever eventsorchanges in circumstances would significantlyaffect the anticipated lifetime revenue of our TYSABRI, AVONEX, SPINRAZA, VUMERITY and TECFIDERA (rest of world) products.\n\nIntangible assets related to trademarks, trade namesand IPR&D prior to commercialization are not amortized because they have indefinite lives; however, they are subject to review for impairment. We review our intangible assets with indefinite lives forimpairment annually, asofOctober 31, and whenever eventsorchanges in circumstances indicate that the carryingrr value of an asset may not be recoverable.\n\n## Acquired In-process Research and Development (IPR&D)\n\nAcquired IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to researchand development assets that have not reached technological feasibility. The value assigned to acquired IPR&D is determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products, estimating the resulting revenue from the projects and discounting the net cash flow to present value. The revenue and cost projections used to value acquired IPR&D are, as applicable, reduced based on the probabilityof success of developing a new drug. Additionally,the projections consider therelevant market sizes and growth factors,expected trends in technology and the natureand expected timing of new productintroductions by us and our competitors. The rates utilized to discount the net cash flow to theirpresent value are commensurate with the stage of development of the projects and uncertainties in the economic estimates used in the projections. Upon the acquisition of IPR&D, wecomplete an assessment of whether our acquisition constitutes the purchase of a singleasset oragroup of assets. Weconsider multiplefactorsin this assessment, including the nature of the technology acquired, the presence orabsence of separate cash flow, the development process and stage of completion, quantitative significance andour rationale for entering into the transaction.\n\nIf weacquire a business as defined under applicableaccounting standards, then the acquired IPR&D is capitalized as an intangibleasset. If weacquire anasset orgroup of assets that do not meet the definition of a business under applicableaccounting standards, then the acquired IPR&D is expensed on itsacquisition date. Future costs todevelop these assetsare recorded to researchand development expense in our consolidated statements of income as they are incurred.\n\nWhen performing our impairment assessment, wecalculate thefair value using the same methodology as described above. If the carryir ng value of our acquired IPR&D exceeds itsfair value, then the intangible asset is written down to its fair value.

Goodwill is notamortized, but is reviewed for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed for impairmentannually, asofOctober 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill maynot be recoverable.\n\nWe compare thefair value of our reportirr ng unit toits carryirr ng value. If the carryirr ng value of the net assets assigned to the reportir ng unit exceeds the fair value of our reportirr ng unit, we would record an impairment loss equal to the differff ence. As described in Note 24, Segment Informff ation, to these consolidated financial statements, we operate inone operating segment, whichisour only reportir ng unit.\n\n## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\n\nLong-lived assets to be heldand used, including propertyrr , plant and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events orchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount ofthe assets or asset group may not be recoverable.\n\nDetermination of recoverabilityisbased on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow resulting from theuse of the asset and its eventualdisposition. In theevent that suchcash flow is not expected to be suffiff cient to recover the carryirr ng amount of the assets, the assets are written-down to theirfair values. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value lesscosts to sell.\n\n## Contingent Consideration\n\nTheconsideration forouracquisitions often includes future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a partirr cular event orevents. We recordanobligation for suchcontingent paymentsatfair value on the acquisition date. We estimate the fair value of contingent consideration obligations through valuation models that incorporate probability-adjusted assumptions related to the achievement of themilestones and thus likelihoodofmaking related payments. We revalue our contingent consideration obligations each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations are recognized in ourconsolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can resultfromchanges to one or multiple inputs, including adjustments to the discount rates, changes in the amountor timing of expected expenditures associated with product development, changes in the amountor timing of cash flowand reserves associated with products upon commercialization, changes in the assumed achievement or timing of any cumulative sales-based and development milestones, changes in the probability of certain clinical events and changes in the assumed probabilityassociated with regulatory approval.\n\nDiscount rates in our valuation models represent a measure of the credit risk associated with settling the liability. The period over which we discountour contingent obligations is based on the currentdevelopment stage of the productcandidates, our specific development plan for that productcandidate adjusted for the probabilityof completing the development step and when the contingentpayments would be triggered. In estimating the probability of success, we utilize data regarding similar milestone events from several sources, including industry studies and our own experience. These fair value measurementsare based on significant inputsnot observablerr in the market. Significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period.\n\n## Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\n## Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments\n\nWe recognize all derivative instrumentsas either assets or liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of our derivative instrumentsare recognized eachperiod in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether the derivative instrument is designated as part of a hedge transaction and,if so, the type of hedge transaction. Weclassifytff he cash flowfrom these instruments in the same category as the cash flowfrom the hedged items. We do notholdorissue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nWe assess at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flow orfair values of the hedgeditems.

If we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring, we discontinue hedge accounting for theaffected portion of the hedge instrument, and any related unrealized gainorlosson thecontractis recognized in current earnings.\n\n## Net Investment Derivative Instruments\n\nWeare exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investmentin theequity of Samsung Bioepis, which is denominatedinacurrency other than the U.S. dollar,andcouldadverselyimpact the U.S. dollar value of this investment. Using derivative instruments, we have hedgedour net investmentposition to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations.

We hedge the changes in the spot exchange rate in accumulatedother comprehensive income (loss) and exclude changes to the forward rateand amortizetheforward pointsinother income (expense), net in ourconsolidated statements of income over the termofthe contract. We classifytff he cash flowfrom these instruments in the same categoryarr s thecash flowfrom the hedged items.\n\nFor additional information on our derivative instrumentsand hedging activities, please read Note 9,Derivative Instruments ,to these consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Translation of Foreign Currencies\n\nThefunctional currencyfor most of our foreign subsidiaries is theirlocal currency. Forour non-U.S. subsidiaries that transactinafunctional currencyother than the U.S. dollar,assets and liabilities are translated at current rates ofexchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from thetranslation of the financial statementsof ourforeign operations intoU.S. dollarsareexcluded from the determination of net income and are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),as a separate componentofequity. Forsubsidiaries where thefunctional currency of the assets and liabilities differff from the local currency, non-monetary assetsand liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange in effect on the date assets were acquired while monetary assetsand liabilities are translated at current rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average foreign currency rates for the period. Translation adjustments of these subsidiaries are included in other income (expense), net in ourconsolidated statements of income.\n\n## Royalty Cost of Sales\n\nWe make royalty payments toanumber of third-partiesrr underlicense or purchase agreements associated with ouracquisitionof intellectual property. These royalty paymentsare typically calculated as a percentage (royalty rate) of the sales of our products in a particurr lar year. That royalty rate may remain constant, increase or decrease within each year based on the total amountof sales during the annual period. Each quarterrr ly period, we estimate our total royalty obligation for the full year and recognize the proportionalamount as cost of sales based on actual quarterly sales as a percentage of full year estimated sales. For example, if the level of netsales in any calendar year increases the royalty rate within the year, we will record our cost of sales at an even rate over the year, based on the estimated blended royalty rate.\n\n## Accounting for Share-Based Compensation\n\nshare-based compensation programsgrant awards that have included stockoptions, restricted stock units that vest based on stock performance knownas market stock units (MSUs), performance-vested restricted stock units that settle in cash (CSPUs),time-vested restricted stock units (RSUs), performance-vested restricted stock units that can be settled in cash or shares of our common stock (PUs) at the sole discretion of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of our Board of Directors, performance-vested stock units that settle in stockorcash (PSUs) and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP). Compensation expense is recognized basedon the estimated fair value of the awards at grant date. We recognizecompensation expense for the number of awards expected to vest after taking intoconsiderationan estimate of award forfeitures over the requisite servirr ce period, whichisgenerally the vesting period. Where awards are made with non-substantive vesting periods (for instance, whereaportion of the award vests upon retirement eligibility),weestimate and recognize expense based on the period from the grant date to the date the employee becomes retirement eligible.\n\nThefair values of our MSUs are estimated using a lattice model with a Monte Carlosimulation. We apply an accelerated attribution method to recognize share-based compensation expense over the applicable service period",

Research and development expense is expensed as incurred. Upfront and milestone payments made to third-partyrr collaboratorsareexpensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Milestone payments made upon regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Payments we make for researchand development services prior to the servirr ces being rendered are recorded as prepaid assets in our consolidated balance sheetsand are expensed as the services are provided. Wealso accrue the costsof ongoing clinical trials associated with programs that have been terminated or discontinued for which there is no future economic benefitat the time the decision is made to terminate ordiscontinue the program.\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into development agreementsin which we shareexpenses with a collaborative partner. We recordpayments received from our collaborative partners for their share ofthe development costsasa reduction of researchand development expense, exceptas discussed in Note 18,Collaborative andOther Relationships,i to these consolidated financial statements. Because an initial indication has been approved forboth RITUXANand GAZYVA, expense incurredbyGenentech in the ongoing development of RITUXANand GAZYVA are not recorded as researchand development expense, but rather reduce our share of profits recorded as a component of revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs.\n\nFor collaborations with commercialized products, if weare the principal, we record revenue and the corresponding operating costs in their respective line items in our consolidated statements of income. If wearenot the principal, we record operating costsasareductionof revenue.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expense\n\ngeneral and administrative expense is primarily comprisedof compensation and benefitsassociated withsales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal,information technology and other administrative personnel, outside marketing, advertisirr ng and legal expense and other general and administrative costs.\n\nAdvertisirr ng costs are expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, advertisir ng costs totaled $98.7 million, $111.8 million and $79.2 million, respectively.",

Income taxes areaccounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assetsand liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carryirr ng amounts and their respective tax bases. Deferred taxassets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which thetemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Weevaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assetsand establish a valuation allowancewhenitis more likely than not that allor a portirr on of deferred tax assets will notberealized. We recognize deferred taxes associated with ourglobal intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) taxcalculations.\n\nThe income tax consequences from the intra-entity transfersof inventory within ourconsolidated group, both current and deferred,are recorded as a prepaid tax or deferred charge and recognized through our consolidated statementsof income when the inventoryir ssold to athird-partyrr . The income tax consequences from the intra-entity transfer of assetsother than inventoryarr nd associated changes to deferred taxes are recognized when the transfer occurs.\n\nWe accountfor uncertain tax positions using a 'more likely than not' threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions. Weevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterrr ly basisand consider various factors including, but not limited to,changes in tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken orexpected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matterssubject toaudit, information obtained during in process audit activities and changes in factsorcircumstances related to atax position. Wealso accrueforpotential interest and penalties related to unrecognized taxbenefits in income tax (benefit) expense in ourconsolidated statements of income.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nWe are currently involvedinvarious claims and legal proceedings. Loss contingency provisions are recorded if the potential loss fromany claim, asserted or unasserted,r or legal proceeding isconsidered probable and the amount canbe reasonably estimated or a range of losscan be determined. These accruals represent management's best estimate of probable loss. Disclosure also is provided when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision.Onaquarterlybasis, we review the status of eachsignificant matter and assess its potential financial exposure. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probabilityand as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based onlyon the bestinformation availableatthe time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claimsand litigation and maychange our estimates. Legal costs associated with legal proceedings are expensed whenincurred.\n\n## Earnings per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing undistributed net income attributabletoBiogen Inc. by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the treasury method by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus potentially dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements\n\nFrom time to time, new accountingpronouncementsare issued by the FASFF Borother standard setting bodies that weadoptas of the specified effective date.

(Pfizer). Weare developing BIIB118 for the potential treatmentof irregular sleep wakerhythm disorder in Parkinson's disease and plan to develop BIIB118 for the potential treatment of sundowning in Alzheimer'sdisease.\n\nIn connection with this acquisition, we made an upfront payment of $75.0 million to Pfizer, which was accounted for as an asset acquisition and recorded as acquired IPR&D in our consolidated statements of income as BIIB118 has not yet reached technological feasibility. We mayalso pay Pfizer up to $635.0 million in potential additional development and commercialization milestone paymentsas well as tiered royalties in the highsingle digits to sub-teens.\n\n## Acquisition of Nightstar Therapeutics plc\n\nJune2019 we completedouracquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Nightstar Therapeutics plc (NST), a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on adeno-associated virus treatmentsfor inherited retinal disorders. As a resultofthisacquisition, weadded two mid- to late-stage clinical assets, as well as preclinical programs, in ophthalmology. These assets included BIIB111 (timrepigene emparvovec),for the potential treatment of choroideremia, and BIIB112 (cotoretigene toliparvovrr ec),for the potential treatment of X-linked retinitis pigmentosa.\n\nUnder the termsoftheacquisition, we paid NST shareholders$25.50 in cash for each issuedand outstanding NSTshare, which totaled $847.6 million. In addition, we paid $4.6 million in cash for equitycompensation, which was attributabletopre-combination servirr ces and was reflected as a component ofthe total purchase price paid. The fair valueof equity compensation attributable to the post-combination servirr ce period was $26.2 million, of which $18.4 million was recognized as a charge to selling, general and administrativeexpense with the remaining $7.8 million as a charge to research and development expense in ourconsolidated statements of income. These amounts were associated with the acceleratedvesting of stockoptions previously granted to NST employees and were fully paid in cash as of June 30, 2019. We funded thisacquisition through available cash and accounted for itas an acquisition of a business. We finalized purchase accounting for thisacquisition in the fourthr quarter of 2019.\n\nThe fair value of the IPR&Dprogramsacquired was determined throughaprobabilityadjusted discounted cash flow analysis utilizing a discount rate of 12.5%. We recorded IPR&Dassetsfor BIIB111and BIIB112 at their initial fair values of $480.0 million and $220.0 million, respectively. Some ofthe more significant assumptions utilized in ourasset valuations included the estimated net cash flows for eachyear for eachasset or product, including net revenue, costof sales, researchand development and other operating expense, the potential regulatoryar nd commercial success risks, competitive trends impacting the asset and eachcash flow stream as wellasother factors. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputsnot observablerr in the market and thus represent Level 3fair value measurements.\n\nWe recognized goodwill in relation to the fair value associated with NST workforce's expertise and early research in retinaldisorders. Wealso recognized goodwill in relation to theestablishment of a deferred taxliability for theacquired IPR&D intangible assets, whichhaveno tax basis. This deferred tax liabilityisnet of therelated impacts on the deferred taxes forGILTI. Goodwill that is tax deductible for GILTI purposes wasapproximately $60.9 million.\n\nThere is no remaining book value associated with either BIIB111orBIIB112 asof December 31, 2021, as we have fully impairedboth of these IPR&Dassets.

Wealso maybe obligated to indemnifyFff UJIFILM for liabilities that existed relating to certain business activities incurred prior to the closing of this transaction.\n\nIn addition, we may earncertain contingent payments based on future manufacturing activities at the Hiller\u00f8d facility. For the disposition of a business, our policyis to recognize contingent consideration when the consideration is realizable. Wecurrentlybelievethe probabilityof earning these payments is remote and therefore we did not include these contingent payments in our calculation of the fair value of the operations.\n\nAs partorr fthis transaction, we enteredintocertain manufacturing services agreements with FUJIFILM pursuant to whichFUJIFILM will use the Hiller\u00f8d facility to produce commercial products for us, suchasTYSABRI, as wellas other third-partyrr products.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized atotal net loss of approximately$124.2 million related to the transaction in ourconsolidated statements of income. Thislossincluded a pre-tax lossof$55.3 million, which was recorded in loss on divestiture of Hiller\u00f8d,r Denmark manufacturing operations. The loss recognized was based on exchange rates and business conditions on the closing date of this transaction, and included costs to sell our Hiller\u00f8d,r Denmark manufacturing operations of approximately $11.2 million and our estimate of the fair value of adverse commitments of approximately$74.0 million, primarily associated with the guarantee of future minimum batchproduction at the Hiller\u00f8d facility. Wealso recorded atax expense of $68.9 million related to this transaction.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31,2020, we reduced our estimate of the fair value of the adverse commitment associated with the guarantee of future batchproduction by approximately $62.0 million based on our current manufacturing forecasts. Additionally, we recorded areduction to our pre-tax loss of approximately $30.5 million due to arefund of interest paid associated with atax matter.\n\nOur estimate ofthefair value of the adverse commitments is a Level 3 measurement and is based on forecasted batchproduction at the Hiller\u00f8d facility.",

The decrease in amortirr zation of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, over the three years was primarily due to a lower rate offamortization fforacquiredi g ntangible assets.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, amortir zation and impairmentof acquiredintangible assets reflects the impactof a $365.0 million impairment charge related to BIIB111,a$220.0 million impairment charge related to BIIB112 and a $44.3 million impairment charge related to vixotrigine (BIIB074) for the potential treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TGN).\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impactof a $115.0 million impairmentcharge related to BIIB111,a$75.4 million impairment charge related to BIIB054 (cinpanemab) and a $19.3 million impairment charge related to one of our other IPR&Dintangible assets.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets reflects the impact of a $215.9 million impairmentcharge related to certain IPR&Dassets associated with the Phase 2b studyof BG00011 (STX-100) for the potential treatment of idiopathic pulmonaryfrr ibrosis (IPF), which was discontinued in the thirdquarter of 2019.\n\n## Completed Technology\n\nCompleted technology primarily relates to our acquisition of all remaining rights to TYSABRI as well as other amounts related to our other marketed products and programsacquired through business combinations.\n\n## IPR&D Related to Business Combinations\n\nIPR&D represents the fair value assigned to researchand development assets that weacquired as part of a business combination and had not yet reached technological feasibilityat the date of acquisition. Included in IPR&D balances are adjustments related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We review amountscapitalized as acquired IPR&D for impairmentannually, asofOctober 31, and whenever events orchanges in circumstances indicate to us that the carryirr ng value of the assets mightnot be recoverable.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\n## Vixotrigine\n\nIn theperiods since we acquiredvixotrigine, there have been numerous delaysinthe initiationofPhase 3 studies forthe potential treatment of TGN and forthe potential treatment of DPN, another formof neuropathicpain. We have engaged with the U.S. Food andDrug Administration (FDA) regarding the design of the Phase 3studies of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of TGN and DPN andare now performing an additional clinical trial of vixotrigine.\n\nThe performance ofthis additional clinical trial delayed the initiation of the Phase 3studies of vixotrigine for the potential treatment of TGN, and,as a result, we recognized an impairment charge of $44.3 million related to vixotrigine for the potential treatment of TGN during the first quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the carryirr ng value associated with the remaining IPR&Dasset for DPN was $132.7 million and the fair value of this asset was not significantlyin excess of its carrying value.\n\n## BIIB111and BIIB112\n\nDuring the fourthr quarter of 2020 we recognized an impairment charge of $115.0 million related to BIIB111as a resultof third-partyrr manufacturing delays that impacted the timing and increased the costs associated with advancing BIIB111 through Phase 3development.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2021 we announced that our Phase 3STAR study of BIIB111 and our Phase 2/3 XIRIUS study of BIIB112 did not meet theirprimaryer ndpoints. In the third quarter of 2021 we suspended furtherrr development on these programsbased on the decision by management as partorr f its strategic review process. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized an impairmentcharge ofof $$365.0million related to BIIB111 and an impairmentchargge f of $$220.0million related to BIIB112, reduc g ing the rem g aining book values f of these IPR&D int g angible assets to zero.\n\nIn addition, ffor the year ended December 31, 2021, asaresultoffour decision to suspend ffurtherr development f of BIIB111 and BIIB112,werec gognized ch g arges f of approximately $$39.1 million related to our ma f nufactur g ing arr g angements and other costs that we expect toincur as aresultoffs g uspending these g programs, which were recorded as researchand development expense in ourconsolidated statements f of income.\n\n## BIIB00544\n\nIn February2rr 021 weannounced that we discontinueddevelopmentof BIIB054 as a potential treatment of Parkinson's disease as our Phase 2 SPARK study didnot meet itsprimary or secondary endpoints. Although we made thisdetermination in February2r 021, it wasbased on conditions that existed as of December 31, 2020. As a result, we recognizedanimpairmentcharge of approximately$75.4 million during the fourthr quarter of 2020 to reducethefair value of the related IPR&Dintangible asset to zero.\n\nThe IPR&D impairment ch g arges were included in amortir zation and impairmentoffacquiredi g ntangible assets and the ggain resulti gng ffrom theremeasurement f of our conti gngent consideration obl gigation was recorded in g(gain) losson f fair value remeasurement f of conti gngent consideration in ourconsolidated statements f of income.

In connection with the closing ofthis transaction in December 2020 we purchased $650.0 million of Sage common stock, or approximately6.2 million shares at approximately$104.14 per share, which are subject to transfer restrictions. This investment is classified as a Level 2marketableequitysecurity due to certain holding period restrictions and is remeasured each reporting period and carried at fair value.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\n## Foreign Currency Forward Contracts - Hedging Instruments\n\nDue to the global nature of our operations, portions of our revenue and operating expense are recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The value of revenue and operating expense measured in U.S. dollars is therefore subject tochanges in foreigncurrency exchange rates. In order to mitigate these changes, we use foreign currencyforwardcontracts to lockin exchange rates associated with a portion of our forecasted international revenue andoperating expense.\n\nForeign currencyforwardcontracts in effectasof December 31, 2021and 2020, had durations of 1 to15 months and 1 to24 months, respectively. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and unrealizedgains or losseson the portirr on of these foreign currencyforwardcontracts that are included in the effectiveness testare reportedrr in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (referred to as AOCI in the table below). Realized gains and losses of suchcontractsare recognized in revenue when the sale of productin the currencybeing hedged is recognizedand in operating expense when theexpense in the currency being hedged is recorded.

The interest rate swap contracts were designated as hedgesofthefair value changes in our2.90% Senior Notes attributable to changes in interest rates. InMay 2020 we settled our interest rate swap contracts, in conjunction with our early redemption of our 2.90%Senior Notes, resulting in a gain of approximately$3.3 million, which was recorded as a component of interestexpense in ourconsolidated statements of income during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\n## Net Investment Hedges - Hedging Instruments\n\nFebruary 2012weentered into a joint venture agreement with Samsung BioLogics establishing an entity, Samsung Bioepis,todevelop, manufacture and market biosimilar products. In June2018 we exercised our option under our joint venture agreement to increase ourownership percentage in Samsung Bioepis fromapproximately 5.0% to approximately 49.9%. The share purchase transaction was completed in November 2018 and, upon closing, we paid 759.5 billionSouth Korean won ($676.6 million) to Samsung BioLogics. Our investment in the equityof Samsung Bioepis is exposed to thecurrency fluctuations in the South Korean won.\n\nIn order to mitigate these currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and South Korean won,wehave entered intoforeign currencyforward contracts. Foreign currencyforward contractsin effectasof December 31, 2021, had remaining durations of 10 months. These contractshave been designated as net investment hedges. We recognize changes in the spot exchange rate in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The pre-tax portionrr of the fair value of these foreign currency forward contracts that were included in accumulatedother comprehensive income (loss)in total equity reflected net gains of $10.6 million and net losses of $21.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Weexclude fair value changes related to the forward rate from our hedging relationship and willamortizerr the forward points in other income (expense), net in ourconsolidated statements of income over the term of the contract. The pre-taxportion of the fair value of the forward points that were included in accumulated othercomprehensive income (loss)in total equity reflected net losses of $3.6 million and net gains of $0.2

Awardsgranted from the 2006 DirectorsPlan may include stock options, shares of restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights and other awardsinsuchamounts and with such terms andconditions as maybe determined by a committee of our Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of the 2006 DirectorsPlan. We have reserved atotal of 1.6 million shares of common stock forissuanceunder the 2006 DirectorsPlan. The2006 DirectorsPlan provides thatawards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights will becounted against the total number of shares reservedrr under the plan in a 1.5-to-1 ratio. In June 2015our shareholdersapproved an amendment to extend the term of the 2006 Directors Plan until June2025.\n\n## Omnibus Plan\n\nIn June 2017our shareholdersapproved the 2017 OmnibusEquity Plan for share-based awards to our employees. Awardsgranted from the 2017 Omnibus EquityPlan may include stockoptions, shares of restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares, stockappreciation rights and other awardsinsuchamounts and with such terms andconditions as maybe determined by a committee of our Board of Directors, subject to the provisions of the 2017 Omnibus EquityPlan. Shares of common stock available for grant under the 2017 Omnibus EquityPlan consist of 8.0 million shares reservedrr for thispurpose, plus shares of common stock that remained available for grant under the Biogen Idec Inc. 2008 Omnibus Equity Plan (2008Omnibus Equity Plan) as of June 7,2017, or that couldagain become available for grant if outstanding awards under the 2008 Omnibus EquityPlan as of June 7, 2017, are cancelled, surrendered or terminated in whole or in part. The2017 OmnibusEquity Plan provides that awards other than stockoptions and stock appreciation rights will becounted against the total number of shares available under the plan in a 1.5-to-1 ratio.\n\nWe have not madeany awards pursuant to the 2008 Omnibus EquityPlan since our shareholdersapproved the 2017 Omnibus EquityPlan, and do not intend to makeany awards pursuant to the 2008 Omnibus EquityPlan in the future, except that unused shares under the 2008 Omnibus Equity Plan have been carried over for use under the 2017 Omnibus Equity Plan.",

These awards are structured and accounted for the same way as the CSPUs, and vest in three equal annual increments beginning on the first anniversaryorr fthe grant date. The number of PUs granted represents the target number of units that are eligible to be earned based on the attainment of certain performance measures established at the beginning of the performance period, which ends on December 31 of eachyear. Partir cipants may ultimatelyearn between zero and 200.0% of the target number of units granted basedon the degree of actual performance metric achievement.

PSUs awarded to employees have three performance periods and vest on thethirdanniversary of the grant date. The vesting of these awards is subject to the respective employee's continued employment. The number of PSUsgranted represents the target number of units that are eligible to be earned based on the achievement of three annual performance measures established when the performance objectives are defined, which will be at the beginning of each year and will end on December 31 of such year.\n\nParticipants may ultimately earn between zero and 200.0% of the target number of PSUsgranted based on the degree of achievement of the applicable performance metric. Accordingly,additionalPSUs may be issued or currently outstanding PSUs may be cancelled upon final determination of the number of units earned. PSUs are classified as liability awardsand will be settledincash based on the 30 calendar day average closing stockprice through the vesting date, oncetheactual vested and earned number of PSUsisdetermined. Since no shares are issued, these awardsdonot dilute equity.\n\nThefollowing table summarizes our PSUs that settle in cash activity:\n\n|                               | Shares   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|\n| Unvested at December 31, 2020 | 120,000  |\n| Granted (1)                   | 60,000   |\n| Vested                        | (37,000) |\n| Forfeited                     | (9,000)  |\n| Unvested at December 31, 2021 | 134,000  |\n\n## Time-Vested Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)\n\nawarded to employees generally vest no sooner than one-thirdper year over three years on the anniversaryorr fthe date of grant, or upon thethirdanniversary of the dateofthe grant, provided the employee remains continuously employed with us, exceptasotherwise provided in the plan.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\n## Transition Toll Tax\n\nThe Tax Cutsand Jobs Actof 2017 eliminated the deferral of U.S. income tax on the historical unrepatriated earnings by imposing the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings (the Transition Toll Tax). The Transition Toll Tax wasassessed on our share of our foreign corporations' accumulated foreign earnings that were not previously taxed. Earnings in the formof cash andcash equivalents were taxedat a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of8.0%.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we have accrued income tax liabilities of $633.0 million and $697.0 million, respectively, under the Transition Toll Tax. Of the amounts accrued as of December 31, 2021, approximately $72.7 million is expected to be paid within one year. The Transition TollTax will be paidininstallmentsover an eight--year period, whichstarted in 2018, and will not accrue interest.\n\n## Unremitted Earnings\n\nAt December 31, 2021, weconsidered our earnings not to be permanently reinvested outside the U.S. and therefore recorded deferred taxliabilities associated with an estimate of the total withholding taxes expected as a resultof our repatriation of earnings. Other than for earnings, wearepermanently reinvested for book/tax basis differff ences of approximately $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, primarily arising through the impactsof purchase accounting. These permanently reinvested basis differff ences could reverse through sales of the foreign subsidiaries, as well as various other events, none of which were considered probable as of December 31, 2021. The residual U.S.tax liability,if these differences reverse, would be between $300.0 million and $400.0 million as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## TECFIDERA\n\nIn 2020 U.S. federal courts in West Virginia and Delawareenteredjudgments in favor of the defendants in patent infringementproceedings relating to TECFIDERA Orange-Book listed patents. Weappealed both decisions. In late 2021 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit)affirmed the judgment of the West Virginia federal court. Theappeals in the Delaware cases were stayed and weexpect will remain so until the decision in the West Virginia case becomes final. Foradditional information, please read Note 20, Litigatioii n ,to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nMultiple TECFIDERA generic entrantsare now in the U.S.market and have deeply discounted prices compared to TECFIDERA. The generic competition for TECFIDERAhas significantly reduced our TECFIDERA revenue and is expected to continue to have a substantial and increasing negative impact on ourU.S. TECFIDERA revenue in the future.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, weassessed therealizabilityof our deferred tax assets that are dependent on future expected sales of TECFIDERAin the U.S. and reduced the net value of certain deferred tax assetsby approximately$1.7 billion and reduced the net value of deferred tax liabilities associated with GILTI and tax credits by approximately$1.6 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the income tax expense associated with these reductions was approximately $90.3 million. We continue to assess therealizabilityofthese deferred tax assets and have recorded an increase in these deferred tax assetsof approximately$108.5 million and an increase in these deferred tax liabilities of approximately $103.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.",

Our2020 effective tax ratealso reflected an incometax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, the realization of whichisdependent on future sales of TECFIDERAin the U.S.\n\nIn addition, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, the decrease in our effective tax rate was significantlyimpacted by a current year deferred taxbenefitinSwitzerland resulting from the accelerated approval of ADUHELM by the FDA in the U.S., recognized during the second quarter of 2021. We recorded a net deferred tax asset of approximately $490.0 million during the second quarter of 2021. The net deferred tax asset is comprised of approximately$945.0 million of gross deferred taxasset, reduced by approximately $455.0 million of unrecognized taxbenefit,as discussed below. During the fourthrr quarter of 2021 we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately$390.0 million related to thisdeferred taxasset. The deferred tax benefit relates to Neurimmune's tax basisinADUHELM, therealization of which is dependent on future sales ofADUHELM and approval of the Swiss cantonal taxauthorities, with an equaland offsetff ting amount assigned to net income (loss) attributableto noncontrolling interests, net of tax in ourconsolidated statements of income, resulting in a zero net impact to net income attributabletoBiogen Inc. Foradditional information on our collaboration arrangement withNeurimmune, pleaseread Note 19, Investmentsitt nVariablVV e Interest Entities ,to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the income tax expense related to theestablishment of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, therealization of which is dependent on future sales ofTECFIDERAin the U.S., as discussed above, and partially offsetff by the benefit recognized on the effective settlement of certain tax matters. Additionally, our 2019 effective tax rate benefited froman internal reorganization of certain intellectual property rightsand theenactment of a new taxing regime in the country andcertain cantons of Switzerland, which we refer to as Swiss Tax Reform, partially offsetff by tax expenserelated to the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d,r Denmark manufacturing operations. Although we recognized a loss on the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d,r Denmark manufacturing operations, the divestiture required us to write-off certain deferred taxassets and resulted in ataxable gain in certain jurisdictions. For additional information on the divestiture of our Hiller\u00f8d,r Denmark manufacturing operations, please read Note 3,Divestitures ,to these consolidated financial statements.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\n## Tax Attributes\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had netoperating losses andgeneral business credit carryfr orwards forU.S. federal income tax purposes of approximately$0.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively, which begintoexpire in 2022 and 2027, respectively. For U.S. state incometax purposes, we had research andinvestment creditcarryr forwards of approximately $147.6 million that begin to expire in2022. For foreign income tax purposes, we had $16.7billionof Swiss federal net operating loss carryfr orwards that begin to expire in2025 and $16.2 billion of Swiss cantonal net operating losscarryfrr orwards that begin to expire in2025.\n\nIn assessing the realizabilityof our deferred tax assets, we have considered whetheritis more likely than not that some portir on orallofthe deferred tax assets will notberealized. The ultimate realization of deferred taxassets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. In making thisdetermination, under the applicable financial reportirr ng standards, we areallowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred taxliabilities, projected future taxable income and taxplanning strategies. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and incometax liabilityand projections forfuture taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assetsare utilizable, we believe itis more likely than not that we will realizethe net benefits of the deferred taxassets of our wholly owned subsidiaries, net of the recorded valuation allowance. In the event that actual resultsdiffer from our estimates or weadjust our estimates in future periods, we mayneed to adjust or establish a valuation allowance, whichcould materially impact ourconsolidated financial position and resultsof operations.\n\n## Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\n\neconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of our unrecognized taxbenefits is summarized as follows:\n\n| (In millions)                                                  | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Beginning balance                                              | $ 75.7  | $ 129.9 | $ 114.2 |\n| Additions based on tax positions related to the current period | 4.2     | 1.5     | 5.3     |\n| Additions for taxpositions of prior periods                    | 509.9   | 51.7    | 17.2    |\n| Reductions for tax positions of prior periods                  | (18.8)  | (63.6)  | (10.3)  |\n| Statute expirations                                            | (3.2)   | (7.9)   | (0.1)   |\n| Settlement refund (payment)                                    | (4.4)   | (35.9)  | 3.6     |\n| Ending balance                                                 | $ 563.4 | $ 75.7  | $ 129.9 |\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we increased our gross unrecognized taxbenefits by approximately $455.0 million, related to a deferred taxasset for Swiss tax purposes forNeurimmune's tax basis in ADUHELM, as discussed above. This unrecognized taxbenefit was recorded as areduction to the gross deferred taxasset, resulting in the netdeferred taxasset, as discussed above, and not as a separate liabilityonourconsolidated balance sheets.\n\nOur 2020 activity reflects the impactoftheeffective settlement of certain tax matters. Weand our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. Wefile income tax returns in variousU.S. states and in U.S. federal and other foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, weare no longer subject toU.S. federal tax examination for years before 2017 or state, local or non-U.S. income tax examinations foryears before 2012.\n\nThe U.S. InternalRevenue Service andother national tax authorities routinely examine our intercompany transfer pricing with respect tointellectual property related transactions and it is possible that they maydisagree withoneormore positions we have taken with respect tosuch valuations.\n\nIncluded in the balance ofunrecognized taxbenefits as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, are $87.5 million, $68.8 million and $122.7 million (net of the federal benefitonstate issues),respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, wouldaffect the effective income tax rate in future periods.\n\nWe recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized taxbenefitsinincome tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 we recognized total interestand penalty expense of $2.7 million, $1.0 million and $4.7 million, respectively. We have accrued $24.8 million and $21.2 million for the payment of interestand penalties as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.",

Beginning January 1, 2019, Eisai is reimbursing us for 45.0% of development costs incurred by the collaboration for theadvancement of ADUHELM (ADUHELM development expense).\n\nIn March 2019, based on a pre-specified futilityanalysis, we discontinued the global Phase3trials, EMERGE and ENGAGE, designed to evaluate the effiff cacy and safetyofADUHELM in patients with earlyAlzheimer'sdisease. In the first quarterr of 2019, as a result of the decision to discontinue the Phase 3 EMERGEand ENGAGE trials following the futilityanalysis, weaccrued and subsequently paid approximately$45.0 million related to the termination of various clinical trials and researchand development contracts net of the expected 45.0% Eisai reimbursement of development costs incurred under the ADUHELM Collaboration Agreement.\n\nIn October 2019 we and Eisai announced that we planned to pursue regulatory approval for ADUHELM in the U.S. Anew analysisofalarger dataset from these trials, conducted in scientific collaboration with the FDA, showed that the Phase 3 EMERGE trial met its pre-specified primary andsecondary endpoints. In July2020 wecompleted the submission of a BLA for theapproval of ADUHELM to the FDA and madea$75.0 million milestone payment to Neurimmune. We recognized net profit-sharing income of$33.8 million to reflectEisai's45.0% share of the $75.0 million milestone payment.\n\nIn June 2021ADUHELM was granted accelerated approval by the FDAfor the treatment of Alzheimer'sdisease andhad its first commercial sale. As a result of the launchofADUHELMin the U.S., we made a $100.0 million milestone payment to Neurimmune. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized net profit-sharing income of $45.0 million to reflectEisai's45.0% share of the $100.0 million milestone payment.\n\nUpon commercialization, both companies willco-promote ADUHELM with aregion-based profit split.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reportirr ng as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework(2013) issuedby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021and 2020, and the resultsof its operations andits cash flows for eachofthe three yearsin the period endedDecember 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, inall material respects, effecff tive internal control over financial reportirr ng as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Basisforff Opinions\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reportirr ng, and forits assessment of the effectiveness of internal control overfinancial reportir ng, included in Management'sAnnualReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to expressopinions on the Company's consolidated financial statementsand on the Company'sinternal control overfinancial reportirr ng based on our audits. Weare a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securities lawsand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securitiesand Exchange Commissionand the PCAOB.\n\nWeconducted our auditsinaccordancewith the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we planand perform theaudits toobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statementsarefreeof material misstatement, whether due to error orfraud,and whether effective internal control over financial reportingrr was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statementsincluded performing procedures to assess the risksof material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error orfraud,and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used andsignificant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overallpresentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our auditof internal control over financial reportingr included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,rr assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control basedon theassessed risk. Our auditsalso included performing such other procedures as weconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition andLimitations of Internal Control overFinFF ancial Reporting\n\nAcompany's internal control over financial reportir ng is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingr and the preparation of financial statementsfor external purposes in accordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles. Acompany's internal control over financial reportingrr includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertairr n to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statementsinaccordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receiptsand expenditures of the companyare being made only in accordance withauthorizations of management and directorsofthecompany;and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.",

        "page_content": "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control overfinancial reportirr ng maynot prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subjecttothe risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critrr ical Audit Matters\n\nThecritical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to becommunicated to the auditcommittee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statementsand (ii) involvedour especially challenging, subjective, orcomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as awhole, and weare not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to whichit relates.\n\n## Reserves for Medicaid and Managed Care Rebates\n\nAs described in Notes 1and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized revenue from productsales net of reserves,rr including Medicaid and managed care rebates. Withinaccrued expense and other, total contractual adjustments amounted to $759.6 million as of December 31, 2021. Aportion of thisbalance includes provisions for Medicaid and managed care rebates in the US. Medicaid rebates relate to the Company's estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. The Company'sliabilityfor Medicaid rebates consistsof estimates for claims that a state will make for the current quarter, claimsfor prior quarters that have been estimated for whichaninvoice has not been received, invoices received forclaims from the prior quarters that have not been paid and an estimate of potential claims that will be madeforinventorytrr hat exists in the distribution channel at period end. Managed care rebates represent the Company's estimated obligations to third-parties, primarily pharmacybenefit managers. These rebates resultfromperformance-based goals, formularyr position and price increase limitallowances(price protection). Thecalculation of the accrual for these rebates is based on an estimate ofthecoverage patterns and the resulting applicable contractual rebate rate(s) to be earned over a contractual period. Rebate accruals for Medicaid and managed careare recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in areduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is includedinaccrued expense and other current liabilities. The Medicaid and managed care estimates reflecthistorical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns.\n\nThe principal considerations forour determination that performing procedures relating to reserves forMedicaidand managed care rebates is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertaintyinvolved in developing these reserves,rr as the reservesrr are based on assumptions developed using historical experience, current contractual requirements, specific known market events and payment patterns, which in turnled to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and efforff ti r napplying procedures and evaluating audit evidencerelated to these assumptions.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating auditevidence inconnection with forming our overall opinionon theconsolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the reserves forMedicaidand managed care rebates, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these Medicaidand managed care rebate reserves.rr These procedures also included,among others (i) developing an independent estimate of the Medicaidand managed care rebate reservesrr by utilizing third-party data related to productdemand, data related to price changes, the terms of the specificrebate programs, the historical trend of actual rebate claimspaidand consideration of contractual requirement changes and market events; (ii)comparing the independent estimate to management's estimate; and (iii) testing rebate claimspaidby the Company, including evaluating the claimsfor consistency with thecontractual terms of the Company's rebate agreements.\n\n/s/PricewaterhouseCoopersLLP Boston, Massachusetts February3rr , 2022\n\nWe have servedrr as the Company'sauditor since 2003.",
