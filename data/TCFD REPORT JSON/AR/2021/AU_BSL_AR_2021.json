With strong cash flow and a robust balance sheet your Company is very well positioned to continue to grow and deliver value.\n\nThis financial strength allows BlueScope to simultaneously invest for a low carbon future, long term sustainable earnings, and to increase shareholder returns.\n\nBlueScope's record underlying EBIT across the business is a great testament to our clear strategy, disciplined financial framework and the operating leverage of our diverse por/t.ss03folio.\n\nThe Board of Directors and I pay tribute to our 14,000 people across all 18 countries who have served customers and communities, maintained COVID-safe workplaces and supported each other's health and wellbeing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/five.ccmp/zero.ccmp CPS\n\nFY/two.ccmp/zero.ccmp/two.ccmp/one.ccmp DIVIDENDS /parenleft.caseUNFRANKED/parenright.case\n\nON MARKET BUY/hyphen.ccmpBACK ANNOUNCED\n\n## Rewarding shareholders\n\nA core part of BlueScope's Financial Framework is balancing the competition between capital for growth initiatives and returns to shareholders, while also aiming to distribute at least 50 per cent of free cash flow in the form of consistent dividends and on-market buy-backs.\n\nThe Board's intention is to increase annual ordinary dividends to 50 cents per share per annum, that is 25 cents per share per half, subject to the Company's financial performance, business conditions, growth opportunities, capex and working capital requirements and the Board's determination at the relevant time.\n\nFor FY/two.ccmp/zero.ccmp/two.ccmp/one.ccmp, the dividend to be paid is 25 cents per share final ordinary dividend plus a 19 cents per share special dividend announced in August, complementing the six cents per share interim ordinary dividend paid in March 2021.\n\nA share buy-back of up to $5/zero.ccmp/zero.ccmpM has been approved to be conducted over the next twelve months. The timing and value of shares purchased will be dependent on prevailing market conditions, share price and other factors.\n\n## Safety\n\nThe Company has continued to focus on the evolution of its risk management approach, aiming to build a culture of learning to drive sustained safety improvements. This more human-centred approach recognises human fallibility, taps into the knowledge of BlueScope's people to identify and implement stronger controls, and creates greater capacity in systems and processes to tolerate error. The Company has also adopted broader health and safety indicators, to be/t.ss03ter align to the new approach and support its goal to reduce harm.\n\nUP TO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n$/five.ccmp/zero.ccmp/zero.ccmp",

The 850,000 tonnes per annum expansion project at the North Star mini-mill in Delta, Ohio, is progressing very well. The melt shop commissioning is well underway - the first heat of steel from the new Electric Arc Furnace was achieved in August, new equipment is being installed and production of the first coil is expected in early /two.ccmpH FY/two.ccmp/zero.ccmp/two.ccmp/two.ccmp, with commissioning to full capacity over the subsequent 18 months. The present expectation is for the total cost to be 5-10 per cent above the US$7/zero.ccmp/zero.ccmpM initial estimate, reflecting inflationary pressure and our goal to commence commissioning as soon as possible. The success of this project enables assessment to begin on a further debo/t.ss03tlenecking project to potentially li/f.ss03t hot strip mill capacity by another 500,000 tonnes per annum. This is a credit to the North Star project team in successfully continuing this project while safely managing COVID-/one.ccmp/nine.ccmp risks.\n- \u00bb Also in the US, we are increasing the capital allocated to US BlueScope Properties Group by up to US$2/zero.ccmp/zero.ccmpM to carefully grow the business and deliver more regular earnings. This reflects the growing warehouse and distribution centre market and focuses on Class A industrial properties.\n- \u00bb In Australia, residential construction growth, especially in lower density and regional housing, has seen continued growth in demand for BlueScope's products such as TRUECORE \u00ae and COLORBOND \u00ae steel. We are now evaluating further coating capacity to support this demand.\n\n$/one.ccmp./seven.ccmp /two.ccmp\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n/two.ccmp/four.ccmp ./eight.ccmp\n\n## Action on climate change\n\nClimate change is a critical global issue for our business, industry and stakeholders. Our climate strategy builds on the work we started some years ago, and shows BlueScope is serious about playing our role in meeting the Paris Agreement goals.\n\nAccordingly, we have announced a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 across global operations. Achieving this 2050 net zero goal is highly dependent on several enablers, including the commerciality of emerging and breakthrough technologies, the availability of a/f.ss03fordable and reliable renewable energy and hydrogen, the availability of quality raw materials, and appropriate policy se/t.ss03tings.\n\nWe have allocated up to $1/five.ccmp/zero.ccmpM over the next five years on near-term action on climate change. This investment will fund our technology plan to optimise current operating assets and prepare for emerging and breakthrough technologies. The initial phase is exploring production e/f.ss03ficiencies such as increased use of scrap, indigenous gases and renewable energy, as well as government and industry partnerships, collaborative opportunities with suppliers, and breakthrough R&D projects. We are actively investigating the use of biochar as a replacement for a proportion of pulverised coal injection into the blast furnace, and are seeking government co-funding for this and other pilot projects, including a hydrogen electrolyser to trial hydrogen injection in the blast furnace.\n\nDemonstrating the seriousness of our intent to meet the decarbonisation challenge, in February Gre/t.ss03ta Stephens was appointed Chief Executive Climate Change, taking on responsibility for a new Climate Change function in addition to her role as Chief Executive New Zealand and Pacific Islands.",

        "page_content": "## Port Kembla Steelworks blast furnace reline\n\nThe Company has commenced exploring options for the future configuration of the Port Kembla Steelworks, once the Blast Furnace No.5 comes to the end of its current operating campaign. Initial focus is on the option to reline the No.6 Blast Furnace, which is currently mothballed. A pre-feasibility assessment that aligns with BlueScope's climate strategy and technology pathway is well progressed, with an indicative capital cost of around $700-$8/zero.ccmp/zero.ccmpM.\n\nThe latest technologies available to reduce GHG emissions intensity will be evaluated as part of this important work. The strong earnings and cash flow capability of our Australian Steel Products business provides significant flexibility to adopt new technologies and iron making configurations, as and when they are technically and commercially viable.\n\nOur climate action strategy, decarbonisation pathway and capital planning process are outlined in BlueScope's first Climate Action Report published in early September.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe continue to build an inclusive workforce which reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate. This is guided by the Company's Inclusion and Diversity Strategic Framework which also provides each business with the flexibility to tailor specific activities to suit their local community and business needs. While COVID-/one.ccmp/nine.ccmp has presented many challenges, it has also o/f.ss03fered opportunities for a more connected workforce that supports its communities.\n\nRecognising the increased focus of the Company's social responsibility to our people, workplaces, and communities, a new function - Social Impact and Inclusion - has been created to help increase our social value.\n\nLast year we commi/t.ss03ted to seek certification under the ResponsibleSteel TM Standard for our major steelmaking site at Port Kembla, Australia. The standard defines the performance expectations for responsible sourcing and production of steel. I am proud to report that the stage 1 audit for ResponsibleSteel TM site certification was conducted in April. This detailed investigation into responsible sourcing went very well, highlighting our prioritisation, supplier engagement and assessment processes. While COVID-/one.ccmp/nine.ccmp travel restrictions have stalled the timetable for the certification audit, we hope it will be completed by the end of 2021.\n\n## Executive appointments\n\nAppointments made to the Executive Leadership Team during the year reflect BlueScope's focus on strategic growth opportunities. In April Connell Zhang joined the Company as Chief Executive NS BlueScope, based in Singapore. With strong industrial business experience, he brings a further focus on innovation and digital transformation to ensure the NS BlueScope joint venture continues to grow and deliver smart solutions to our customers and communities.\n\nEqually importantly, to sharpen our focus on the growth opportunities identified in the US market, Kristie Keast takes on additional responsibilities as Chief Executive People and North American Development to oversee expansion and realise synergies across our North American businesses. Additionally, Susan Stark has been appointed President BlueScope Buildings to drive further growth and profitability, leveraging BlueScope's technology leadership in the expanding pre-engineered buildings market.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile BlueScope has seen favourable macroeconomic and industry trends over the last year, the Company's record performance and robust position reflect the success of its strategy at work.\n\nLooking forward to the immediate term, in /one.ccmpH FY/two.ccmp/zero.ccmp/two.ccmp/two.ccmp, as order and despatch rates in key markets remain robust, the Company expects underlying EBIT to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion. While in the medium term we see supportive industry and end use demand trends, it is uncertain how long the current robust conditions will be sustained.\n\nThese expectations are subject to spread, foreign exchange and market conditions.\n\nWe will provide a further update on trading conditions at our Annual General Meeting on 18 November 2021.\n\nManagement and employees have continued to demonstrate extraordinary resilience throughout the most di/f.ss03ficult pandemic circumstances. I thank them for their wonderful contribution.\n\nI also thank my fellow Directors for their support, and you, our shareholders.\n\nJohn Bevan Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Deploying financial strength for sustainable growth and returns\n\nGiven the strength of BlueScope's balance sheet, and the strong cash flows presented by FY2021 trading conditions, BlueScope is well positioned to deploy its financial strength to position the business for a low carbon world, to invest for long term sustainable earnings and growth, and to deliver increased returns to shareholders.\n\n## Positioning the Business for a Low Carbon World\n\nIn 2018, BlueScope set targets to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity for its steelmaking sites by 12% by 2030 at a target run rate of 1% year on year. This year, BlueScope has announced a goal of net zero emissions by 2050 with success dependent upon:\n\n- \u00b7 evolution of emerging and breakthrough technologies to viable, commercial scale\n- \u00b7 access to appropriate quality and quantities of raw materials in both the near and longer-term\n- \u00b7 access to affordable, reliable renewable energy\n- \u00b7 availability of appropriate volumes of competitively priced hydrogen from renewable sources\n- \u00b7 public policy that supports investment in decarbonisation and avoids risk of carbon leakage.\n\nIn addition to the net zero goal and steelmaking emissions intensity reduction target, BlueScope has also announced a target to reduce emissions across its midstream non-steelmaking operations by 30% by 2030 relative to a 2018 baseline - bringing total coverage of 2030 targets to 98% of Group scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions.\n\nThe Company's 2050 net zero goal is based on scope 1 and 2 emissions and is underpinned by a decarbonisation pathway that is built on a suite of existing, emerging and breakthrough technology options. In the near to mid-term, BlueScope's focus will be on optimising its existing assets and processes, whilst working in partnership with industry and research bodies to progress the technical and commercial viability of future technology options.\n\nDelivering the 2030 targets and progress on the 2050 goal will be supported by BlueScope's revised Capital Allocation Framework, which now incorporates climate related investments to ensure they receive appropriate prioritisation. These investments are considered critical in maintaining BlueScope's long-term sustainability, and as such will be prioritised ahead of growth investments and shareholder returns where appropriate. However, investments must have an appropriate commercial overlay to ensure decarbonisation is pursued in the most capital efficient manner.\n\nOn an indicative basis, an estimated $300M to $400M of capital will be required over the next 10 years. To that end, the Company has made an initial allocation of up to $150M over the next five years to help deliver on its midterm commitments and make progress on its longer-term decarbonisation journey. Funding is in place to progress research and development into emerging and breakthrough technologies.\n\nFurther detail will be provided in BlueScope's first Climate Action Report, due for release in early September 2021.\n\n## Long-Term Sustainable Earnings and Growth\n\nBlueScope has a wide range of growth opportunities across its footprint, leveraging sector trends, allowing the Company to deploy capital in a disciplined and efficient manner to support growth and future earnings.\n\nBlueScope has identified over $500M of growth projects across its footprint, building on the strength of its portfolio of assets and leveraging key macro and sectoral trends, such as the improving industry conditions across China and the US, the supportive investment environment provided by low interest rates and government stimulus, shifts in preferences towards lower density regional housing and online shopping, and recognition of the critical nature of steel in underpinning the transition to a clean energy future.",

The debottlenecking project is expected to require significantly less capital than the original expansion.\n- \u00b7 BlueScope is also looking to increase the allocation of capital to US BlueScope Properties Group (BPG) in order to carefully grow the business. This incremental ~$200M investment will allow BPG to target a more regular earnings contribution, from an expanded pipeline of projects whilst remaining focused on Class A industrial properties.\n- \u00b7 In Australia, the business continues to pursue inter-material growth in value added products, such as COLORBOND\u00ae steel and TRUECORE\u00ae steel, with both product suites seeing continued growth in demand. To support further growth and address current operating constraints, BlueScope is in the initial phases of assessing additional coating capacity at Port Kembla.\n\n## Increasing Shareholder Returns\n\nFollowing a review, the Board's intention is to increase annual ordinary dividends and will now target 50 cents per share per annum (i.e. 25 cents per share per half). For FY2021, the dividend will be comprised of the 25 cents per share final ordinary dividend and 19 cents per share special dividend announced today, complementing the 6 cents per share interim ordinary dividend paid in March 2021. The revised annual dividend level will be subject to the Company's financial performance, business conditions, growth opportunities, capex and working capital requirements and the Board's determination at the relevant time.\n\nBlueScope will continue to use on-market share buy-backs to supplement the payment of consistent dividends, given the flexibility they provide in managing capital and for the EPS enhancement they can deliver. The buy-back of up to $500M is intended to be conducted over the next twelve months, the timing of which, and value of shares purchased, will be dependent on the prevailing market conditions, share price and other factors.",

As part of the reline assessment, latest technologies available to reduce GHG emissions intensity will be evaluated as an integral part of the project.\n\nThe pre-feasibility assessment is well progressed as part of rigorous multi-stage capital investment evaluation process, with further updates to be provided during 1H FY2022. The highly indicative capital cost is around $700-$800M, likely to be spent over FY2023 to FY2025.\n\nThis pre-feasibility work aligns with BlueScope's climate strategy and technology pathway. The strong earnings and cash flow capability of its Australian Steel Products business provides significant flexibility and optionality to adopt new technologies and iron making configurations as and when they are technically and commercially viable.\n\nElectric Arc Furnace (EAF) steelmaking has been considered as an alternative to a reline. However, it is not currently viable given Australia's insufficient availability of prime or ex-manufacturing scrap required for flat steel production grades, and high electricity costs. DRI was also considered, however the relatively high cost of natural gas on the east coast of Australia and lack of cost effective DRI grade pellets renders this option economically unviable at this time.",

The injury profile continues to be lower severity injuries (e.g. sprains, strains and lacerations), with less than 1% of injuries having had the potential to be permanently life changing.\n\nBlueScope continues to progress the evolution of its approach to risk management, with an emphasis on a culture of learning, to drive sustained improvements in safety. The Company continues to integrate its humancentred approach, which leverages the knowledge of BlueScope's people to identify and strengthen our controls. Through the year, the Company also sought to create greater capacity in systems and processes to tolerate error without harm to our people or the environment.\n\nBlueScope has maintained a persistent focus on maintaining COVID-safe workplaces and supporting the health and wellbeing of our people and communities, including a focus on vaccination efforts.\n\n## Inclusion and Diversity\n\nIn FY2021 we have continued to build an inclusive workforce which reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate. While COVID-19 has presented many challenges, it has also offered opportunities that have resulted in a more connected workforce that supports BlueScope's community when needed. BlueScope's Inclusion and Diversity Strategic Framework focuses on advancing its gender diversity journey as well as providing each business with the flexibility to tailor specific activities to suit their local community and business needs.\n\nWhilst the overall female share of recruitment reduced slightly from 37% to 36% for FY2021, female participation in the workforce increased to 22% from 21%. The percentage of women in operator and trade roles has doubled over the past five years. The focus in FY2022 remains on female recruitment and reinforcing BlueScope's inclusive culture - across all aspects of its business - with clear focus areas, business accountabilities and a governance framework to track progress and continuous improvement.\n\n## Sustainable Supply Chain\n\nBlueScope seeks to foster responsible business practices and uphold human rights through engagement, risk assessment and improvement activities, and endeavours to partner with suppliers who share its core values.\n\nIn FY2021, BlueScope achieved its target, completing engagements and assessments with 230 suppliers\n\nagainst an end of year target of 220. BlueScope also transitioned most new assessments to an independent EcoVadis process and increased its use of third-party on-site supplier assessments. Despite COVID-19 restrictions on travel, seven third-party on-site audits were completed in FY2021. Supplier corrective action plans are in place for 20 per cent of assessed suppliers (up from 11% in FY2020), demonstrating the focus on improvement.\n\nThe supplier segmentation model was also refreshed in FY2021 with updated supplier and risk data, increasing the model's coverage from 80% of total business unit / country spend to 90%, to now cover over 1,000 suppliers. This refresh increased the supplier engagement and assessment target from 220 to 280 over the next two years.\n\nBlueScope achieved an 85th percentile rating in an EcoVadis sustainability assessment of our business in FY2021. The ResponsibleSteel\u2122 site certification process is underway at the Port Kembla Steelworks, with positive feedback on BlueScope's responsible sourcing program received during the stage one audit conducted in April 2021.\n\n## Communities\n\nThroughout the half, many of BlueScope's businesses continued to support communities hit by the pandemic:\n\n- \u00b7 A team of employees across Australia, China, the US, Singapore and India worked together to source and ship N95 masks, oxygen concentrators and ventilators to India for donation to communities and hospitals in need.\n- \u00b7 BlueScope China shipped 20,000 N95 masks to NS BlueScope's Cilegon site in Indonesia where authorities are struggling to control the pandemic.\n- \u00b7 North Star BlueScope Steel donated to the 'V Project', a local community initiative to encourage vaccinations and help slow the spread of COVID19.  North Star also hosted an on-site vaccination clinic for a local healthcare provider.\n\nBlueScope seeks opportunities to strengthen local communities through encouraging employee participation and through financial and in-kind support:\n\n- \u00b7 In the US, the BlueScope Foundation awarded nine scholarship awards to help children of BlueScope employees complete their education.\n- \u00b7 BlueScope Butler China is building partnerships with local schools to help students build skills, choose a career and enter the workforce.\n- \u00b7 Australian Steel Products has joined a partnership with the NSW Department of Education to establish a STEM Academy in the Illawarra.\n- \u00b7 BlueScope is a long-standing supporter of Lifeline South Coast in the Illawarra, with employees training to be volunteer crisis supporters and participating in suicide awareness training.",

        "page_content": "## Finance Costs and Funding\n\nNet finance costs increased by $4.8M largely due to higher commitment fees on the increased size of the syndicated bank facility and lower interest income on cash due to falling interest rate.\n\nFinancial liquidity was $3,694.1M at 30 June 2021 ($3,144.4M at 31 December 2020), comprised of $1,732.2M committed undrawn bank debt capacity and $1,961.9M cash. Liquidity in the NS BlueScope Coated Products JV was $769.8M, which is included in the Group liquidity measure.\n\nIn July 2021, subsequent to the balance date, BlueScope replaced its $1.205Bn syndicated bank facility with bilateral revolving facilities totalling $1.005Bn. The revised facilities deliver lower cost and longer tenor, with three to five year maturities.\n\n## Tax\n\nFY2021 tax expense of $388.1M (FY2020 $128.1M), equivalent to an effective tax rate of 23.2% (FY2020 51.5%, impacted by the non-tax effected $197M writedown of New Zealand Steel and Pacific Islands assets - 28.8% excluding the write-down), was impacted by higher profit, offset by lower tax rates in North America and Asia and the utilisation of unrecognised tax losses in New Zealand.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, the BlueScope Australian consolidated tax group is estimated to have carried forward tax losses of approximately $710M, which are all recognised on the balance sheet. There will be no Australian income tax payments until these losses are recovered. The Group continues to defer the full recognition of past tax losses in New Zealand until a sustainable return to taxable profits has been demonstrated. New Zealand tax losses are able to be carried forward indefinitely.\n\n## Dividend and Capital Management\n\nBlueScope's capital management policy:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group pursues a returns-focussed process with disciplined competition for capital that balances annual shareholder returns and long-term profitable growth.\n- \u00b7 Having regard to the above, the current policy is to distribute at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of consistent dividends and buy-backs.\n- \u00b7 In the short to medium term, BlueScope will retain balance sheet capacity to fund investment for growth and major projects.\n- \u00b7 In the longer term, BlueScope will continue to target around $400M net debt.\n\n## Dividends:\n\n- \u00b7 Following a review, the Board's intention is to increase annual ordinary dividends and will now target 50 cents per share per annum (i.e. 25 cents per share per half year). For FY2021, the dividend\n\n- will be comprised of the 25 cents per share final ordinary dividend and 19 cents per share special dividend announced today, complementing the 6 cents per share interim ordinary dividend paid in March 2021.\n- \u00b7 The revised annual dividend level will be subject to the Company's financial performance, business conditions, growth opportunities, capex and working capital requirements and the Board's determination at the relevant time.\n- \u00b7 The final and special dividends will be unfranked for Australian and New Zealand tax purposes and are declared to be conduit foreign income. BlueScope's dividend reinvestment plan will not be active for the final and special dividends. Relevant dates for the final and special dividends are as follows:\n- -Ex-dividend share trading commences: 7 September 2021.\n- -Record date for dividends: 8 September 2021.\n- -Payment of dividends: 13 October 2021.\n\n## Buy-back:\n\n- \u00b7 BlueScope will continue to use on-market share buy-backs to supplement the payment of consistent dividends.\n- \u00b7 Buy-backs are attractive given BlueScope's lack of franking credits, the flexibility they provide in managing BlueScope's capital and for the EPS enhancement they can deliver.\n- \u00b7 The Board has approved an on-market buy-back of up to $500M to be conducted over the next twelve months. The timing and value of stock purchased will be dependent on the prevailing market conditions, share price and other factors.\n\n## Financial Position\n\nNet assets increased $1,120.8M to $8,160.4M at 30 June 2021 from $7,039.6M at 30 June 2020. Net assets were lower as a result of foreign exchange translation (approximately $300M) primarily as a result of a stronger A$:US$. This was more than offset by an increase in net assets in their functional currency. Significant movements in underlying currency were:\n\n- \u00b7 $605M increase in cash due to net cash flow during the period\n- \u00b7 $547M increase in receivables on higher sales prices and volumes\n- \u00b7 $509M increase in property, plant and equipment, including assets associated with the North Star expansion project\n- \u00b7 $450M increase in inventory mainly due to higher rates\n- \u00b7 $240M decrease in retirement obligations mainly as a result of actuarial gains\n- \u00b7 Partly offset by a $524M increase in creditors, $148M increase in provisions and $207M decrease in deferred tax assets.",

Its key focus is on higher value, branded products for the building and construction industry.\n\nThe Port Kembla Steelworks - in New South Wales' Illawarra region - is the largest steel production facility in Australia, with an annual crude steel production capacity of over three million tonnes.\n\nBlueScope's branded products are market leaders in Australia, and include COLORBOND\u00ae steel, TRUECORE\u00ae steel, ZINCALUME\u00ae metallic coated steel, GALVASPAN\u00ae steel, and the LYSAGHT\u00ae brand of quality steel building products.\n\nThe ASP segment includes LYSAGHT\u00ae and FIELDERS\u00ae building products, ORRCON\u00ae pipe and tube operations and steel distribution sites, and BlueScope Distribution throughout Australia.\n\n## Financial Performance FY2021 vs. FY2020\n\n## Sales revenue\n\nThe $430.4M increase in sales revenue was primarily due to higher volumes on robust domestic activity, along with stronger prices on higher global steel prices, partly offset by the unfavourable influence of a stronger A$:US$ exchange rate.\n\n## EBIT performance\n\nThe $369.2M increase in underlying EBIT was largely due to:\n\n- \u00b7 higher steelmaking spread with higher domestic and export selling prices driven by stronger global steel prices combined with lower raw material costs\n- \u00b7 improved steel volumes, particularly in metal coated and painted products\n- \u00b7 higher contribution from export coke.\n\n## Key Financial and Operational Measures\n\n## Table 2: Segment financial performance\n\nTable 3: Steel sales volume\n\n| $M              | FY2021   | FY2020   | Var %   | 2H  FY2021   |\n|-----------------|----------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| Sales revenue   | 5,848.5  | 5,418.1  | 8%      | 3,109.0      |\n| Reported EBIT   | 674.3    | 305.1    | 121%    | 415.2        |\n| Underlying EBIT | 674.3    | 305.1    | 121%    | 415.2        |\n| NOA (pre-tax)   | 2,975.2  | 2,626.4  | 13%     | 2,975.2      |\n| ROIC (LTM)      | 23.6%    | 11.0%    | +12.6%  | 23.6%        |\n\nChart 1: ASP domestic steel sales volume mix FY2021\n\n| 000 tonnes    | FY2021   | FY2020   | Var %   | 2H  FY2021   |\n|---------------|----------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| Domestic      |          |          |         |              |\n| - ex-mill     | 2,487.7  | 2,168.9  | 15%     | 1,311.4      |\n| - ext sourced | 155.4    | 118.4    | 31%     | 82.2         |\n| Export        | 503.3    | 646.5    | (22)%   | 156.7        |\n| Total         | 3,146.4  | 2,933.8  | 7%      | 1,550.3      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Return on invested capital\n\nROIC increased to 23.6% driven by higher EBIT partly offset by higher net operating assets.

The significant lift in activity has been supported by several factors, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Targeted campaigns focussed on consumers, builders and fabricators particularly in the Sydney and Melbourne metropolitan areas.\n- \u00b7 In new detached housing, State and Federal Government stimulus measures, improved credit availability and sentiment, and a solid economic recovery supported a strong pipeline of residential approvals and commencements.\n- \u00b7 The take-up of the Federal Government's 'HomeBuilder' program in FY2021 was strong, with almost 100,000 new build applications and 22,000 substantial renovation applications submitted as at the end of the program's second phase, which closed at the end of March 2021.\n- \u00b7 In April 2021, the Government announced the extension of the program's commencement deadline. This announcement has helped ease the pressures in the sector, especially on labour and materials, spreading out the robust pipeline over the next full financial year.\n- \u00b7 Activity across the alterations and additions segment benefitted from a significant increase in home renovation activity as homebound consumers redirected discretionary spending during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales into this segment were further supported by recovery activity following recent storm / flood events and Government stimulus measures announced as part of the 'HomeBuilder' Program.\n\nSales into non-residential construction increased significantly in FY2021 compared to FY2020.\n\n- \u00b7 The Social and Institutional sub-segment has been particularly strong, supported by Government investment in health, education, defence and prison projects, particularly for the products BlueScope produces.\n- \u00b7 Prior to the pandemic, the Commercial and Industrial sub-segment was experiencing an uptrend in approvals, the pipeline of which carried over into FY2021. The pandemic impact was expected to be quite significant, however like the rest of the economy, private sector confidence returned much faster than anticipated, leading to some projects previously paused now coming back into focus. Uncertainty in confidence remained prevalent in the aged care and entertainment.\n\nSales into the engineering and mining sectors increased during FY2021 compared with FY2020, with the national infrastructure plan driving activity in roads and rail together with growth in mining and consumables, partially offset by an easing in activity within wind tower projects on project timing.\n\nDemand in the agriculture segment improved in FY2021 compared with FY2020, supported by the rebuild program following last year's bushfires and improved growing conditions more broadly with encouraging rainfall during CY2020.\n\nDemand in the manufacturing sector increased during FY2021 compared with FY2020 due to increased activity within residential construction and limited availability of steel intensive competing finished goods. Favourable Government policy supporting instant tax write-offs of new investments spurred a rise in orders for manufactured goods.\n\n## Export sales\n\nDespatches to export customers in FY2021 were lower than FY2020 driven by the prioritisation of domestic despatches. Export prices were higher in FY2021 than the prior corresponding period due to higher global steel prices.\n\n## Export coke sales\n\nIn FY2021, despatch volumes were 672kt, 14% lower than FY2020 due to timing of shipments and increased use of coke in ironmaking. Margins were stronger in FY2021 due to strong global steel demand driving stronger coke prices and relatively lower cost coal inputs.",

Around 2 million tonnes of hot rolled coil are produced annually from North Star's dual electric arc furnaces, using scrap metal, pig iron and alloys.\n\nNorth Star is consistently rated as one of the top producers of flat rolled steel in North America in the annual Jacobson Survey of steel customers measuring customer satisfaction.\n\nNorth Star sells approximately 90% of its production in the Midwest US, with its end customer segment mix being broadly 50% automotive, 35% construction, 10% manufacturing/industrial and 5% agricultural.\n\n## Financial Performance FY2021 vs. FY2020\n\n## Sales revenue\n\nThe $664.7M increase in sales revenue was primarily due to materially stronger realised selling prices, driven by record Midwest benchmark hot rolled coil prices, partly offset by unfavourable foreign exchange translation due to a stronger A$:US$ exchange rate.\n\n## EBIT performance\n\nThe $487.6M increase in underlying EBIT was largely due to higher realised steel spreads, due to stronger regional steel prices, partly offset by elevated raw material costs, and unfavourable foreign exchange translation due to a stronger A$:US$ exchange rate.\n\nUnderlying adjustments in reported EBIT are set out in tables 12 and 13.\n\n## Return on invested capital\n\nROIC increased to 31.6% driven by a stronger EBIT contribution partly offset by higher net operating assets. Net operating assets at 30 June 2021 were $314.9M higher than at 30 June 2020, primarily due to higher fixed assets as a result of the capacity expansion project partly offset by the unfavourable foreign exchange translation impact of a stronger A$:US$.\n\nNote that the ROIC outcome is unfavourably impacted by expansion capital work in progress, which is\n\n## Key Financial and Operational Measures\n\n## Table 4: Segment performance\n\nTable 5: Segment performance in US$M\n\n| $M              | FY2021   | FY2020   | Var %   | 2H  FY2021   |\n|-----------------|----------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| Sales revenue   | 2,377.7  | 1,713.0  | 39%     | 1,591.8      |\n| Reported EBIT   | 674.5    | 187.7    | 259%    | 606.7        |\n| Underlying EBIT | 677.2    | 189.6    | 257%    | 607.6        |\n| NOA (pre-tax)   | 2,374.3  | 2,059.4  | 15%     | 2,374.3      |\n| ROIC (LTM)      | 31.6%    | 9.3%     | +22.3%  | 31.6%        |\n| Despatches (kt) | 2,083.1  | 2,043.8  | 2%      | 1,058.4      |\n\n| 000 tonnes    | FY2021   | FY2020   | Var %   | 2H  FY2021   |\n|---------------|----------|----------|---------|--------------|\n| Sales revenue | 1,796.6  | 1,149.1  | 56%     | 1,227.5      |\n| Und.

Both are 50/50 joint ventures, with BlueScope controlling and therefore consolidating the joint venture with NSC, and jointly controlling and therefore equity accounting the joint venture with Tata Steel.\n\nBuilding Products' China businesses are wholly owned by BlueScope and are comprised of metal coating, painting and Lysaght operations, and Engineered Buildings Solutions (EBS).\n\n## Financial Performance FY2021 vs. FY2020\n\n## Sales revenue\n\nThe $348.1M increase in sales revenue was mainly due to higher sales volumes and higher regional steel prices. This was partly offset by unfavourable foreign exchange translation mainly due to a stronger A$:US$ exchange rate.\n\n## EBIT performance\n\nThe $178.2M increase in underlying EBIT was largely due to higher margins combined with higher despatch volumes:\n\n- \u00b7 North America: FY2021 underlying EBIT of $138.5M, improving substantially compared to $40.2M in FY2020. The improvement was due to cyclical margin expansion driven by relatively lower steel feed costs in the rapidly rising price environment.\n- \u00b7 ASEAN: performance improved in FY2021, delivering underlying EBIT of $114.5M compared to $50.9M in FY2020.

This increased volume was driven by robust demand, particularly in building and construction, which was supported by the strong economic recovery and government stimulus programs. Given the rapid rise in North America steel prices, somewhat more stable feed costs, and the length of the supply chain, the business saw a level of cyclical margin expansion, particularly in 2H FY2021. Various customer centric strategic initiatives are ongoing, with a focus on the growth of the design solution product and service offering.\n\nASC Profiles (building components) also saw strong demand in its key sectors, particularly in the decking and residential construction segments. Higher North American steel prices resulted in increased feed costs, negatively impacting margins, however the business realised improvements in its operating cost structure, gaining benefits from strategic optimisation of manufacturing sites.\n\n## ASEAN\n\nFY2021 sales volumes across the ASEAN business increased by 24% from FY2020 due to stronger demand however disruptions from COVID-19 remained, particularly in Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam, which escalated towards the end of the half.\n\nStrong demand in residential activity and lower import levels supported sales growth in the retail segment, mainly in Thailand and Indonesia. The business continues to grow the retail channel through the Authorised Dealer network, whilst expanding BlueScope's distribution footprint, enhancing brand value and building customer loyalty. The number of Authorised Dealers reached 284 stores across ASEAN at the end of FY2021.\n\nProject segment demand was broadly stable, supported by recovering construction activities, although some projects were delayed due to continuing uncertainty around the pandemic and the stronger steel price environment.\n\nThe Ignite 5G cost and productivity improvement program continues to deliver incremental benefits, and the business is now balancing robust cost discipline and investment in future growth.\n\n## China\n\nEconomic activity continued to improve during FY2021 following the domestic impacts of COVID-19 in FY2020.\n\nCoated China despatch volumes increased over FY2020 driven by a number of external customerfocussed initiatives, combined with strong demand growth from the owned downstream channel and general market recovery.\n\nBuildings business (Butler and Lysaght) growth continued into FY2021, driven by the continued strategy aimed at targeting premium high-growth segments, which in turn has led to an increase in despatch volumes on FY2020 levels.\n\nBlueScope China continues to enhance business performance through measures such as:\n\n- \u00b7 targeting higher growth end-use segments such as advanced manufacturing, distribution, healthcare and electronics, which have each demonstrated rapid post COVID-19 recovery and higher than national GDP growth rates\n- \u00b7 promotion of Next Generation ZINCALUME\u00ae into China.\n\n## India (in joint venture with Tata Steel (50/50) for all operations)\n\nThe joint venture delivered underlying EBIT of $68.9M in FY2021 (100% basis), compared to $43.3M in FY2020, primarily driven by increased volumes offsetting lower margins on higher steel feed costs.\n\nOverall despatch volumes in FY2021 increased by 23% compared to FY2020, driven by pent-up demand post the COVID-19 related Government mandated shuts during Q4 FY2020. Domestic painted and bare volumes increased by 24% and 13% respectively.\n\nBlueScope's joint venture partner, Tata Steel, has acquired Bhushan Steel, which includes coating and painting assets.

This was due to higher vanadium slag prices and sales volumes, along with lower costs of ferro vanadium alloy purchases, partly offset in part by higher nitrided vanadium costs.\n\n## Strategic review\n\nNotwithstanding the current strong demand environment, the business has implemented most of the proposed changes to eliminate a range of lossmaking products, including cold rolled annealed products, pipe and hollows, and targeting only profitable export HRC sales.\n\nThe business is also delivering on initiatives for warehousing and logistics, painted capacity enhancements and operational efficiencies, along with other cost reductions.\n\nConsultation for all affected roles has been completed, with some staff having been informed their roles have been maintained until demand declines, impacting approximately 40 production roles. By the end of FY2021, 108 people had left or were in the process of leaving the business as a result of the initiatives from the Strategic Review.",

Spot steel spreads in North America are materially higher than both 2H FY2021 and longer-term averages. In light of these unusually strong conditions, the Company expects underlying EBIT in 1H FY2022 to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion.\n- \u00b7 While in the medium term we see supportive industry and end use demand trends, it is uncertain how long the current robust conditions will be sustained.\n- \u00b7 For the purposes of the outlook, the Company has made the following 1H FY2022 average assumptions:\n- -US mini-mill benchmark spreads to be ~US$420/t higher than 2H FY2021 1 .\n- -East Asian HRC price of ~US$810/t 2\n\n.\n\n- -62% Fe iron ore price of ~US$170/t CFR China 2 .\n- -Index hard coking coal price of ~US$180/t FOB Australia 2 .\n- -A$:US$ at US$0.74 2 .\n- \u00b7 Relative to 2H FY2021, expect similar underlying net finance costs, underlying tax rate, and profit attributable to non-controlling interests.\n- \u00b7 Expectations are subject to spread, foreign exchange and market conditions\n\nExpectations for the performance of BlueScope's businesses in 1H FY2022 relative to 2H FY2021 are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Australian Steel Products:\n- -Expect a better result compared to 2H FY2021\n- -Similar to, or slightly higher domestic despatches on ongoing robust construction demand\n- -Stronger benchmark spreads\n- -Higher scrap and coating metal costs on global index pricing\n- -Lower coke contribution on realised margins\n- \u00b7 North Star:\n\n- -Expect significantly stronger result compared to 2H FY2021\n- -Higher benchmark spreads partly offset by unfavourable impact of realised selling prices, noting specific sales mix\n- -Unfavourable impact of lower volumes on planned outage\n- -Higher conversion costs including alloy input costs and labour\n- \u00b7 Building Products Asia & North America:\n- -Expect a similar to slightly better result to 2H FY2021\n- -North America - expect a similar result on ongoing demand strength and cyclically elevated margin\n- -ASEAN - expect a lower result due to ongoing COVID-19 disruption particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia\n- -China - result expected to be around double that of 2H FY2021 on favourable seasonality\n- -India - similar result\n- \u00b7 Buildings North America:\n- -Overall, expect a slightly higher result than 2H FY2021\n- -Lower earnings in the core EBS business compared to 2H FY2021 with ongoing margin compression due to higher steel feed prices offsetting higher volumes\n- -BPG contribution expected to be higher than last half on project timing\n- \u00b7 New Zealand and Pacific Islands:\n- -Expect a higher result than 2H FY2021\n- -Similar domestic despatches on ongoing robust construction and infrastructure activity\n- -Higher benchmark steel pricing, partly offset by unfavourable impact of specific sales mix relative to benchmark\n- -Moderately lower energy costs\n- -Similar net vanadium contribution\n- \u00b7 Intersegment, Corporate & Group\n- -Higher Corporate costs reflecting investment in Digital and Climate initiatives\n- 2 Quoted on an unlagged basis for the six-month period; volumes quoted in metric tonnes.",

        "page_content": "## Future prospects and risks\n\nBlueScope operates in markets which are impacted by economic cycles and short-term volatility which can affect the Group's financial performance and financial outcomes both positively and negatively. On the negative side, periods of slower demand for its products, lower global commodity steel prices relative to raw material costs, and unfavourable exchange rate movements, in particular a stronger Australian dollar relative to the US dollar, are some of the macroeconomic factors to which the Group is exposed.\n\nThe emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic during FY2020 created a public health emergency in much of the world. Continued outbreaks through FY2021 have meant that challenges arising from the pandemic have persisted and are expected to continue for some time.\n\nThe Group continues to operate with COVID-19 safe work practices, provide on-going support to our teams and encourage its employees to be vaccinated. These measures have been effective at minimising operational disruption and the health impacts to its employees. However, the risk of community transmission affecting the workplace requiring further measures, including Government mandated site closures, continues to be a risk to BlueScope.\n\nIn addition, travel restrictions continue to limit access by management, and our technical and project resources to key locations which may impede delivery of business improvement and capital development projects.\n\nWhile customer demand across the BlueScope Group was negatively impacted to varying degrees during 2H FY2020, the global economy, and in particular North America, Australia and New Zealand, recovered faster and stronger than anticipated with favourable macroeconomic conditions in FY2021.\n\nThe price, cost and demand for BlueScope's products are uncertain and the Company considers a number of recognised external forecasters when assessing possible future market conditions. These external forecasters expect commodity steel prices to peak in FY2022 and return to be broadly in line with historical long-term average levels by FY2026. In addition, demand for BlueScope's products is expected to moderate but still remain relatively strong in Australia and New Zealand, support full utilisation of its steelmaking capacity in North America and continue to grow from the FY2021 levels in Asia over the next three years.\n\nThe pandemic has demonstrated the resilience of BlueScope's business model and its ability to manage key risks.\n\nNotwithstanding the positive economic environment in FY2021, persistent macroeconomic and market risk factors for BlueScope include:\n\n- a. Economic downturn or weaker economic conditions.\n- A deep or prolonged economic downturn in developed economies or significantly slower growth in emerging economies, could have a material adverse effect on the global steel industry which may affect demand for the Group's products and financial prospects.\n- b. A significant cyclical or permanent downturn in the\n- industries in which the Group supplies its products. The Group's financial prospects are sensitive to duration of these economic cycles unpredictable. While a large proportion of the Group's cost base\n- the level of activity in a number of industries, principally the building, construction and manufacturing industries. These industries are cyclical in nature, with the timing, extent and varies with production volumes, many are fixed and the Group may not readily be able to reduce its costs in proportion to an economic downturn and therefore any significant, extended or permanent downturn could negatively affect the Group's financial prospects.\n- c. Declines in the price of steel, or any significant and sustained increase in the price of raw materials in the absence of corresponding steel price increases.\n\nThe Group's financial prospects are sensitive to the long-term price trajectory of international steel products and key raw material prices. A significant and sustained increase in the price of raw materials, in particular iron ore, coking coal, pig iron and scrap, with no corresponding increase in steel prices, would have an adverse impact on the Group's financial prospects, as would a decline in the price of steel with no corresponding decrease in the price of raw materials.\n\nA sustained decline could impact the long-term competitiveness of supply of steel from BlueScope's Australian and New Zealand steelmaking businesses and impact ongoing reinvestment.\n\nIn addition to these longer-term trends, the price of raw materials and steel products can fluctuate significantly in a reasonably short period of time affecting the Group's short-term financial performance. In particular this relates to commodity products such as plate, hot rolled coil,",

The Group is exposed to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations.\n- The Group's financial prospects are sensitive to foreign exchange rate movements, in particular the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar. A stronger Australian dollar relative to the US dollar has adverse effects on the Group. This is because in the Australian market a strong Australian dollar makes imported steel products less expensive to Australian customers, potentially resulting in more imports of steel products and/or lower domestic prices. These effects are offset in part by a significant amount of raw material purchases being denominated in US dollars. In addition, BlueScope has significant earnings generated by its international businesses, in particular in the US, which must be translated into Australian dollars for financial reporting purposes.\n- e. Competition from other materials and from other steel producers could significantly reduce prices and demand for the Group's products.\n- In many applications, steel competes with other materials such as aluminium, concrete, composites, plastic and wood. Improvements in the technology, production, pricing or acceptance of these competitive materials relative to steel could result in reduced volumes or margins.\n- BlueScope competes with local and international steel suppliers. Changes to trade measures (such as tariffs or local standards) anywhere in the world can have flow through impacts that could also negatively impact the Company.\n\nBlueScope monitors and responds to the above risks as required through business diversification, market and product development, cost control, operational restructuring and maintaining adequate liquidity.\n\nBlueScope is also exposed to risks associated with positioning the business for a low carbon world. This includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Unilateral government regulation of greenhouse gas emissions without sufficient measures to maintain international competitiveness that could impact the viability of steelmaking in Australia and New Zealand; and\n- \u00b7 Not adapting and appropriately responding to long term implications of climate change such as increased frequency and intensity of natural hazards, disruption to supply chains and changes in demand for steel products. BlueScope's Climate Action Report, which is expected to be released in September 2021, provides further information including disclosures against the Task force for\n\n## Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) framework.\n\nIn addition to these external macroeconomic variables, market factors and climate change risks, BlueScope is also exposed to a range of other market, operating, compliance and financial risks.\n\nThe Group has risk management and internal control systems which identify and manage risk across seven broad categories: Markets & Products; Health, Safety, Environment & Communities; Ethical Conduct & Compliance; People & Remuneration; Operations; Technology and Financial.  BlueScope's systems are designed to ensure the Group understands its appetite for risk across each of these broad categories, monitors tolerance metrics, identifies current and emerging risks, and implements internal controls and mitigating actions.\n\nThe nature and potential impact of risks are by their nature uncertain and change over time. The risks identified as having the potential to materially impact the achievement of the Group's strategies and future prospects include, but are not limited to:\n\n## Markets & Products:\n\n- \u00b7 Political, social and economic policies and uncertainties specific to the countries in which the Group operates.\n- \u00b7 Potential product performance and warranty claims.\n\n## Health, Safety, Environment & Communities:\n\n- \u00b7 Failure to maintain effective occupational health and safety systems, including measures aimed at protecting BlueScope's workforce and onsite contractors since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Ethical Conduct & Compliance:\n\n- \u00b7 Potential for breaches of extensive government laws and regulation, including environmental, greenhouse gas emissions, tax, accounting, payroll, occupational health and safety, employment, modern slavery, competition law and trade measures in each of the countries in which it operates. The Group is also subject to the risk of regulatory investigations into compliance with these laws and regulations which could be lengthy and costly.\n- \u00b7 The conduct of BlueScope's employees and other participants in the supply chain not complying with regulatory requirements or its ethical standards.\n- \u00b7 Potential legal claims. Civil proceedings brought by the ACCC alleging contraventions of the Australian competition law cartel provisions are ongoing.",

These\n\nitems have been considered in relation to their size and nature, and have been adjusted from the reported information to assist readers to better understand the financial performance of the underlying operating business. Throughout this report the Group has used the term 'reported' to reference IFRS financial information and 'underlying' to reference non-IFRS financial information. These adjustments are assessed on a consistent basis from period to period and include both favourable and unfavourable items. Non-IFRS financial information while not subject to audit or review has been extracted from the financial report which has been audited by BlueScope's external auditors. An explanation of each adjustment and reconciliation to the reported IFRS financial information is provided in the table below.\n\nTable 12: Reconciliation of Underlying Earnings to Reported Earnings\n\n|                                                        | EBITDA $M   | EBITDA $M   | EBIT $M   | EBIT $M   | NPAT $M   | NPAT $M   | EPS $  10   | EPS $  10   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                        | FY2021      | FY2020      | FY2021    | FY2020    | FY2021    | FY2020    | FY2021      | FY2020      |\n| Reported earnings                                      | 2,246.3     | 844.4       | 1,758.5   | 309.7     | 1,193.3   | 96.5      | 2.37        | 0.19        |\n| Underlying adjustments:                                |             |             |           |           |           |           |             |             |\n| Net (gains) / losses from businesses  discontinued  1  | (9.6)       | 4.7         | (9.6)     | 4.7       | (9.0)     | 6.4       | (0.02)      | 0.01        |\n| Asset impairments  2                                   | -           | 197.0       | -         | 197.0     | -         | 197.0     | -           | 0.39        |\n| Business development and  acquisition costs  3         | 7.9         | 9.4         | 7.9       | 9.4       | 4.2       | 4.3       | 0.01        | 0.01        |\n| Restructure and redundancy costs  4                    | 6.2         | 17.3        | 6.2       | 17.3      | 4.3       | 11.2      | 0.01        | 0.02        |\n| Asset sales  5                                         | (12.8)      | (10.6)      | (12.8)    | (10.6)    | (9.2)     | (5.8)     | (0.02)      | (0.01)      |\n| India write-off after tax change  6                    | -           | 6.0         | -         | 6.0       | -         | 6.0       | -           | 0.01        |\n| US Pension Fund  7                                     | (26.4)      | 30.5        | (26.4)    | 30.5      | (16.3)    | 23.5      | (0.03)      | 0.05        |\n| Tax asset impairment / (write back)  8                 | -           | -           | -         | -         | (10.6)    | 13.9      | (0.02)      | 0.03        |\n| US Federal Tax payable on internal  entity transfer  9 | -           | -           | -         | -         | 9.6       | -         | 0.02        | -           |\n| Underlying Operational Earnings                        | 2,211.6     | 1,098.7     | 1,723.8   | 564.0     | 1,166.3   | 353.0     | 2.32        | 0.70        |\n\n- 4 FY2021 reflects employee redundancy and restructuring costs at New Zealand & Pacific Steel ($4.6M pre-tax) and at Buildings North America ($1.6M pre-tax).

To keep our people focused on delivering the best outcome for shareholders in this ambiguous context, the Board determined it would be in the best interests of our people and shareholders to adjust the Short Term Incentive (STI) in a manner that allowed us to set 1H and 2H financial targets separately, allowing for in flight adjustments that ensure the right level of stretch outcome whilst maintaining the safety and integrity of our operations.\n\nThe outstanding outcome delivered has been underpinned by three key themes: strong underlying customer demand, steel spreads and government stimulus driving demand, and importantly, timely and decisive management decisions to optimise the upside and protect against the potential downside drag on profit. This combination led BlueScope to deliver record underlying EBIT of $1.72 billion in FY2021.\n\nTo ensure a fair and balanced outcome for all stakeholders the Board has:\n\n- \u00b7 Adjusted 2H FY2021 STI targets upwards on 1H actual and updated outlook;\n- \u00b7 Pressure tested performance by reviewing the full year result and key performance indicators both macro and operational; and\n- \u00b7 Reviewed individual, business and Group performance to ensure remuneration outcomes were reflective of business impact.\n\nIt is noteworthy that despite the challenging environment, BlueScope had an outstanding year in FY2021.\n\nDomestic despatch volumes increased across the portfolio, driven by residential construction activity, growth in warehousing and e-commerce related infrastructure and transport. The Executive Leadership Team has performed exceptionally well to execute our strategy and maintain the safe operation of BlueScope's businesses. These factors, along with strong commodity steel spreads, enabled BlueScope's underlying EBIT to reach consecutive record highs, with $1.19 billion of the $1.72 billion result delivered in the second half. The business achieved a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 24.8 per cent during the year whilst we continued to invest in growth in the key US market, through the cornerstone North Star expansion project. Underlying performance meant that the balance sheet was further strengthened by strong operating profits giving Directors the confidence to increase the final dividend to 25 cents per share, announce a special dividend of 19 cents per share and an on-market buy-back of up to $500M over the next twelve months.\n\n## Health and Safety\n\nThis year our performance was measured against a combination of key safety metrics. Leaders' participation in our safety transformation program exceeded our 95 per cent target, a strong indicator of engagement. However, whilst at an industry low, our lagging injury metric TRIFR has continued to plateau, only marginally exceeding the target range of 5-7. As a result, the threshold for safety under the STI was not achieved. Accordingly, the Board decided to reduce the maximum STI that could be awarded from 150 per cent to 145 per cent. While our absolute number of total recordable injuries have increased, it is pleasing that severity has decreased and there were no fatalities during the year.\n\nIn conjunction with safely managing high production volumes in many of our operations, FY2021 was dominated by managing COVID-19. Travel restrictions, remote working arrangements, hygiene measures and additional access restrictions on manufacturing sites remained in place to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our people and communities. We supported vaccination programs as they became available, according to local government guidelines. The Board and management regularly received external expert medical advice and we supported our employees through wellbeing activities and our Employee Assistance Program. In FY2021, we continued evolving our approach to safety to drive sustained improvements in risk management across our global footprint. Our leaders, including the Board and Executive Leadership Team, participated in expert-led workshops to develop knowledge in contemporary safety and leadership philosophies. Leveraging this knowledge, we began integrating",

        "page_content": "our human-centred approach and implemented a substantial number of HSE risk control improvement projects across all business units.\n\nTo increase our focus on proactively managing safety and resultant outcomes in FY2022, our indicators for safety performance measures will be expanded to include critical risk management - the things that can really harm our people.\n\n## Inclusion and Diversity\n\nIn FY2021 we have continued to build an inclusive workforce which reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate. BlueScope is now a signatory to the HESTA 40:40 Vision by which it is committing to achieve gender balance (40:40:20) in executive leadership by 2030.  We have already reached the 40:40 Vision target of 40 per cent women on both our Executive Leadership Team and Board of Directors.\n\nOur female workforce participation is growing each year and women currently represent 22 per cent of our workforce.  This has increased from 16.5 per cent in FY2016.\n\n## FY2021 Performance and Reward Outcomes\n\n## Remuneration Framework Overview\n\nBlueScope's remuneration framework is designed to maintain a deliberate and continued focus on financial fundamentals and provide more value to executives at less cost to shareholders. In summary:\n\n- \u00b7 The quantum of Total Reward is set below the median of our market peers, with fixed pay at, or slightly above the median, and STI set lower than our peers.\n- \u00b7 The quantum of our Alignment Rights is set lower than market peers, reflecting the increased likelihood of equity vesting as a result of performance hurdles at a threshold level that, if achieved over the cycle, generate good returns for shareholders.\n- \u00b7 The framework drives alignment of executives with shareholders through equity ownership, both through the design of the Alignment Rights and minimum shareholding requirements. Most executive Key Management Personnel (KMP) hold shares greater than their minimum shareholding requirement.\n\nWhile consideration has been given to the impact of COVID-19 and market uncertainty on remuneration programs, both in FY2020 and FY2021, no significant changes have been required as the mechanisms for ensuring alignment during times of volatility are already in place and working as intended.\n\n## Fixed Remuneration\n\nThere was a freeze on fixed pay increases in FY2021 for all Executive KMP, with the exception of an increase for the Chief Executive New Zealand and Pacific Islands who received an adjustment to better align remuneration to the market for this role. No increase to fees for Non-executive Directors was made during FY2021.\n\nIn FY2022 all executive KMP will receive a fixed remuneration increase of 5 per cent, which for most incumbents is the first increase in several years. The MD & CEO will receive a fixed pay increase of 5 per cent in FY2022, the first increase since his appointment in January 2018.\n\n## Short Term Incentives\n\nAs noted, uncertainties surrounding the business impact of the COVID-19 pandemic made setting realistic STI targets at the outset of the financial year challenging. Given this, the Board determined to set financial targets for 1H FY2021 in the first quarter, and 2H FY2021 targets early in the calendar year. The Board also resolved to review performance at the completion of FY2021 based on the full-year outcome, with consideration of the shareholder experience throughout the year.\n\nThe STI awarded to the MD&CEO and all Executive KMP was 96.7 per cent of maximum. While there was some individual variation in performance against individual objectives, consistent strong financial performance across all business units resulted in no individual differentiation in the final awards. The STI scorecard is designed so that while each objective can be assessed between 0 and 200 per cent, the total scorecard is capped at 150 per cent of target (equal to 100 per cent of maximum). In FY2021, all Executive KMP achieved assessed outcomes above 150 per cent of target but, in line with the plan design, these were capped at 150 per cent. This was then further",

Combined with prudent balance sheet management consistent with the objectives of our Financial Framework, both performance conditions of the FY2019 Alignment Rights have been met and awards will vest in full in September 2021.\n\n## Changes to the Remuneration Framework in FY2022\n\nWe have conducted a review of the remuneration framework in response to feedback from shareholders on the FY2020 Remuneration Report. As a result, we have changed the STI for FY2022, by increasing the weighting in the STI scorecard for safety and other Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) measures including climate change, as well as continuing to align our safety measures to our broader safety evolution program. No changes have been made to the Alignment Rights as they have been specifically designed for the cyclicality of our operating environment and continue to operate as intended in the current volatility. Further detail of these changes is shown in section 5.4.\n\nWe trust that this Report clearly outlines the links between our strategy, performance, and executive remuneration alignment with shareholder interests. We look forward to your continued support at our Annual General Meeting in November.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRebecca Dee-Bradbury\n\nChairman, Remuneration & Organisation Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJohn Bevan\n\nChairman",

Are Alignment  Rights'  hurdles  sufficiently | like owners and their remuneration outcomes are directly aligned to the shareholder  experience.  BlueScope's fixed remuneration is set at or slightly above the median of our market  competitors but is offset by lower variable reward - so total reward is lower than the  market median for comparable organisations. The lower total reward is balanced  against increased certainty of payment, while the significant weighting to equity  encourages optimal management in favour of shareholders through the cycle. | Section 3                             |\n| challenging?                                                                                                                                                         | Our Alignment Rights plan is designed to focus executives on sustainable growth and  reward them for generating shareholder returns. The hurdles are set at threshold level  to reduce the impact of external cyclicality on reward outcomes. It is expected that the  plan will vest regularly and in recognition of this increased certainty awards are lower  in quantum relative to the market.                                                                                                                          | Section 3,  Section 4.1,  Section 4.3 |",

This results in higher debt without any  commensurate change in the underlying financing arrangements and therefore the  risk profile of the business.   As noted, uncertainties surrounding the business impact of the COVID-19 pandemic  made setting realistic STI targets at the outset of the financial year challenging. Given  this, the Board determined to set financial targets for 1H FY2021 in the first quarter,  and 2H FY2021 targets early in the calendar year. The targets for 2H FY2021 were  subsequently revised upwards based on actual 1H performance and the updated  outlook.

TRIFR is a more  comprehensive measure and is aligned to evolving industry standards.   In response to shareholder feedback to reinforce our existing focus on safety, in  FY2022 we have increased the total weighting of safety measures in the STI from 5  per cent to 10 per cent.

The table below summarises the Company's performance against a range of indicators for FY2021 and the last four years, along with the MD&CEO's STI outcomes and Alignment Rights vesting since the introduction of the remuneration framework in FY2018.\n\nSTI outcomes for the MD&CEO have been aligned with BlueScope's performance against the challenging targets set within the context of each year. The targets vary each year based on the prevailing market conditions. Alignment Rights have vested in each year since FY2020, aligning executive reward with shareholders through equity ownership, and reflect sustainable multi-year performance even when taking into account the variability in market conditions between years.\n\n|                                                  | FY2017               | FY2018               | FY2019               | FY2020               | FY2021               |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Underlying NPAT ($M)                             | 652                  | 826                  | 966                  | 353                  | 1,166                |\n| Underlying EBIT ($M)                             | 1,105                | 1,269                | 1,348                | 564                  | 1,724                |\n| Share price at end of period ($)                 | 13.21                | 17.26                | 12.05                | 11.69                | 21.96                |\n| Dividends per ordinary share (cents)             | 9                    | 14                   | 14                   | 14                   | 50                   |\n| Buybacks ($M) 1                                  | 150                  | 300                  | 510                  | 229                  | 0                    |\n| Reported earnings per share (cents)              | 125.3                | 281.8                | 189.9                | 19.0                 | 237.0                |\n| Annual ROIC                                      | 18.5%                | 20.0%                | 19.5%                | 7.6%                 | 24.8%                |\n| Annual total shareholder return 2                | 109%                 | 32%                  | (30%)                | (2%)                 | 89%                  |\n| MD&CEO STI award (% of maximum) 3                | N/A                  | 97%                  | 80%                  | 75%                  | 97.6%                |\n| 3-year average annual ROIC                       | 11.5%  (FY15 - FY17) | 16.0%  (FY16 - FY18) | 19.3%  (FY17 - FY19) | 15.7%  (FY18 - FY20) | 17.3%  (FY19 - FY21) |\n| 3-year total shareholder return 2                | 150%  (FY15 - FY17)  | 491%  (FY16 - FY18)  | 94%  (FY17 - FY19)   | (9%)  (FY18 - FY20)  | 31%  (FY19 - FY21)   |\n| Alignment Rights Vesting 3  (performance period) | N/A                  | N/A                  | N/A                  | (FY18 - FY20)        | (FY19 - FY21)        |\n\n- 1 Value of stock purchased during period\n- 2 TSR is calculated as (Close Price at end multiplied by Cumulative Dividend Factor divided by Close Price at beginning) and assumes that dividends are reinvested on the payment date.

        "page_content": "## 4.2  FY2021 Short-Term Incentive Outcomes\n\nIn assessing performance, the Board considers both what has been achieved and how it was achieved, by assessing each Executive's behaviour against the expectations outlined in Our Bond, which are the guiding principles that outline our conduct and how we work. The actual STI awarded can be adjusted where these expectations are deemed not to have been met. No such adjustments have been made for Executive KMP in FY2021. The Board also considers the application of discretion against pre-determined principles that are outlined in section 7.4. These include consideration of the shareholder experience, the broader employee experience and the impact of factors both within and outside of management's control.\n\nDue to the uncertain outlook at the beginning of FY2021, separate financial targets were set for each financial measure for 1H and 2H FY2021 with the Board retaining the discretion to consider the full year result in determining the final STI awards.\n\nFollowing the end of FY2021 and with consideration to the prevailing economic environment, market conditions and the Full Year results, the Board reviewed the FY2021 STI outcomes. The Board determined that whilst there were significant external tailwinds contributing to the result, management responded remarkably well to maintain operations and take advantage of market conditions.\n\nIn taking this approach, the Board balanced exceptional team and business performance and strong outcomes for shareholders. The Board is satisfied that management was able to capitalise on the strong market conditions to deliver significant value in FY2021, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Continued progress against GHG emissions intensity targets\n- \u00b7 Cost containment in Australian Steel Products, and robust cost discipline delivered by cost and productivity improvement program in NS BlueScope\n- \u00b7 Steel sales of COLORBOND\u00ae steel, TRUECORE\u00ae steel, TRU-SPEC\u00ae steel and Galvanised were the highest on record for Australian Steel Products\n- \u00b7 Robust demand for North Star, with sales into automotive markets largely unaffected by COVID-19\n- \u00b7 New Zealand & Pacific Islands has implemented most of the proposed changes to eliminate a range of lossmaking products and deliver operational efficiencies and other cost reductions\n- \u00b7 In China, strong recovery in the key building and construction markets\n- \u00b7 Buildings North America, foundational technology investment to modernise and provide a complete digital engineering and customer experience\n- \u00b7 Success of BlueScope Properties Group, profitably completing 10 projects in last five years.\n- \u00b7 Identified and commenced projects to deliver the next wave of customer, growth and productivity improvements through digital technology\n- \u00b7 The ongoing implementation of the North Star BlueScope Steel expansion, safely managing COVID-19 disruption, and collaboration and integration with existing business\n- \u00b7 Continuity of business operations through COVID-19 government directed lockdowns and restrictions\n- \u00b7 Leadership engagement and management of employee mental health, wellbeing and safety\n\nThe STI scorecard is designed so that while each objective can be assessed between 0 and 200 per cent, the total scorecard is capped at 150 per cent of target (equal to 100 per cent of maximum). In FY2021, all Executive KMP achieved assessed outcomes above 150 per cent of target but, in line with the plan design, these were capped at 150 per cent. This was then further reduced to 145 per cent of target, at the Board's discretion, as a result of not meeting the threshold for safety performance.\n\nWith respect to the safety component, while performance against the leading indicator (safety participation) was at the stretch level, the TRIFR result fell below the threshold level and no award was made for this measure. Consistent with the approach taken in previous years, the Board therefore reduced the maximum STI payable from 150% to 145% of target.\n\nBelow the ELT, most BlueScope employees participate in business profit share plans. In FY2021, profit share plan outcomes averaged 163 per cent of target, exceeding the STI outcomes for executive KMP.\n\nMore details on the MD & CEO's performance against the STI objectives is provided in the scorecard shown below.",

This will apply for the period of the approved build and ramp up and is to ensure participants are not penalised for undertaking an investment which is expected to deliver long term profitable growth.\n\nTo be eligible to receive Alignment Rights, participants must have adhered to Our Bond across the performance period. All executive KMP demonstrated adherence to Our Bond and will receive their full allocation of Alignment Rights. The Board, through the ROC, reviews the outcomes of all reward programs and determined in FY2021 not to apply discretion to adjust the outcomes of the Alignment Rights vesting, or to apply malus/clawback to any vested or unvested awards.",

        "page_content": "## 5. Executive Remuneration Framework\n\nBlueScope's remuneration framework is guided by the principles outlined in Section 3. The principles extend to all elements of remuneration as described in detail below.\n\nSome changes are proposed to elements of the remuneration framework in FY2022 and these are outlined in section 5.4.\n\n## 5.1  Fixed Pay\n\nFixed pay recognises the market value of an individual's skills, experience, accountability and their expected sustained contribution in delivering the requirements of their role.  To attract and retain experienced and capable leaders, BlueScope aims to set fixed pay at or slightly above the median of the peer group noted below. Fixed pay includes base pay and superannuation or local retirement plans.\n\nIn FY2021, only Ms Gretta Stephens, the Chief Executive New Zealand and Pacific Islands and Chief Executive Climate Change, received a fixed pay increase. In accordance with BlueScope's remuneration philosophy, a fixed pay increase of 7.1% was offered to align remuneration quantum to the target position against the market and her sustained performance.\n\n## Remuneration Peer Group\n\nThe ROC has selected (and reviews annually) a peer group of companies to benchmark remuneration that reflect the size and complexity of BlueScope with similarities on one or more of the following dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 operate in multiple geographies\n- \u00b7 have manufacturing or logistics operations in Australia\n- \u00b7 are involved in the building and construction industry\n- \u00b7 have similar number of employees\n- \u00b7 have similar revenue, or similar market capitalisation on the ASX.\n\nThe peer group is not solely based on market capitalisation, as the ROC believes this would lead to unmanageable fluctuations in executive remuneration, and could result in an inability to attract and retain the skills required to manage a business operating in the complex and volatile environment in which BlueScope operates globally.\n\nThe peer group for FY2021 is broadly consistent with last year and is listed below:\n\nAdbri Ltd\n\nBoral Ltd\n\nFletcher Building Ltd\n\nOrora Ltd\n\nAGL Energy Ltd\n\nAmpol Ltd\n\nIncitec Pivot Ltd\n\nQantas Airways Ltd\n\nALS Ltd\n\nCIMIC Group Ltd\n\nLend Lease Corp Ltd\n\nQube Holdings Ltd\n\nAurizon Holdings Ltd\n\nCSR Ltd\n\nOrica Ltd\n\nSouth32 Ltd\n\nBrambles Ltd\n\nDowner EDI Ltd\n\nOrigin Energy Ltd\n\nWorleyParsons Ltd\n\nIn addition to the peer group noted above, remuneration for Executive KMP is also benchmarked against local peers in international markets, where this is appropriate for the role and the incumbent. This ensures that BlueScope is able to attract and retain local talent in regions outside Australia, particularly where pay practices are quite different (e.g. in the US).",

They are designed to reinforce and drive business strategy.\n\n## Safety\n\nSafety remains BlueScope's number one priority. A gateway of no fatalities applies, overlayed with a TRIFR target, and a requirement to meet additional leading indicators in order to achieve target or above. TRIFR includes Fatalities, Lost Time Injuries, Medical Treatment Injuries and work restrictions of more than seven days. Combined with the leading indicator, the safety objective focuses leaders on reducing the severity of incidents and injuries while building Health, Safety and Environment capability and identifying and implementing high level controls for material risks.\n\n## Strategic Measures\n\nThe strategic measures vary by role and from year to year for each individual. They are primarily linked to the successful achievement of material and strategic projects with long-term impact on BlueScope's success. Projects can be either corporate or business unit driven.\n\nExecutive KMP each has a component of their strategic measures linked to BlueScope's material sustainability topics. These include objectives linked to achieving BlueScope's greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction targets for the MD & CEO and the leaders of each of our three steelmaking sites.\n\nPerformance targets for the STI, including Threshold, Target and Stretch levels of performance, are set by the Board in the first quarter of the year for all Executive KMP. Threshold is the minimum level of performance at which a payment can be made, and stretch is the level at which the maximum STI for that measure is awarded. The Board takes care to set performance targets that are challenging yet sufficiently motivating to drive Executive performance towards the objectives.\n\nTargets are set with reference to annual budgets and business plans, economic conditions and market outlook, and are set with a range between threshold to stretch to enable outperformance to be rewarded.\n\nBlueScope's usual approach is to set targets, both financial and non-financial, in line with the annual budget setting process which is finalised around August of each year. In FY2021 financial targets were set separately for 1H and 2H FY2021 as described in section 4.2 but are expected to be set annually in future years.\n\nDescription",

        "page_content": "## 5.4  Changes in FY2022\n\n## Fixed Pay Adjustments\n\nIn FY2022, the MD & CEO's fixed remuneration will be increased by 5 per cent. This is the first time Mr Vassella's salary has been increased since his appointment in January 2018 and reflects his sustained performance in the role, delivery of strong business results and alignment to BlueScope's target market positioning for fixed remuneration.\n\nEffective September 2021, fixed remuneration increases of 5 per cent will be passed on to most Executive KMP. Increases for Executive KMP are not generally provided each year, and for all except the CE NZ&PI and Climate Change, the FY2022 increase is the first adjustment either since FY2020 or appointment to their current role. The increases reflect sustained performance and market movements and are aligned with remuneration increases passed on to other BlueScope employees over the same period.\n\n## FY2022 Short Term Incentive Plan\n\nBased on a review of the STI plan and considering feedback received from investors and other stakeholders last year, the ROC has approved some changes to the STI to apply from FY2022. These changes are summarised below and will be disclosed in detail in the FY2022 Remuneration Report.\n\nTo reflect the increasing importance of ESG indicators as a measure of sustainable success, the STI scorecard has been rebalanced. From FY2022, 25 per cent of the weighting in the STI scorecard will be allocated to the key sustainability areas of safety (10 per cent) and other ESG measures including climate change (15 per cent) as shown in the diagram below. Financial measures remain weighted at 50 per cent and the remaining 25 per cent is allocated to individual objectives relevant to the executive's role and BlueScope's strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.5  Executive Service Agreements\n\nThe following table outlines the summary terms of employment for the MD & CEO and other Executive KMP.\n\n| Role                | Term of agreement   | Notice period by  executive   | Maximum notice  period by Company   | Maximum  Termination Benefits   |\n|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| MD&CEO              | Open                | 12 months                     | 12 months                           | 12 months fixed pay             |\n| Other Executive KMP | Open                | 6 months                      | 6 months                            | 12 months fixed pay             |\n\nAgreements are also in place for Executive KMP detailing the approach the Group will take with respect to termination payments and with respect to exercising its discretion on the vesting of Alignment Rights in the event of a 'Change of Control' of the organisation.\n\nExecutive KMP are also subject to restraints which will apply upon cessation of employment to protect the business interests of BlueScope. No separate amount is payable in relation to these restraints over and above the contractual entitlements outlined above.\n\nThe maximum payment on termination (including notice) is capped at 12 months fixed pay.",

        "page_content": "## 5.7  FY2021 Realised Pay\n\nThe following table outlines actual pay earned or realised by Executive KMP during FY2021. This is a voluntary disclosure and is provided as additional information to the statutory remuneration tables contained in Section 5.6 This table is different from the amounts shown in the statutory tables, as it excludes accruals and estimations and is therefore a closer measure of 'take home pay' earned by Executives in respect of the current year. Amounts are presented inclusive of any income tax payable.\n\nRealised pay includes the base salary, superannuation/retirement and other benefits paid or payable in relation to FY2021. It also includes the realised value of STI awards earned in relation to the FY2021 performance year (both cash and equity components), and the realised value of vested Alignment Rights with a performance period ending on 30 June 2021.\n\nThe realised value of equity awards is calculated as the difference between the allocation price, or price on grant, and the closing share price at the end of the performance period. This is different from the valuation of equity awards presented in the statutory tables which uses the accounting standard for expensing equity awards over time.\n\nOther benefits include the cost to the Company of executive health checks and benefits and fringe benefits tax provided to international assignees. Tax equalisation payments, which include the difference between the amounts withheld by the Company and the actual tax paid on behalf of international assignees, are not included in the calculation of realised pay, however are included in the statutory tables.\n\n| Name                   | Year   | Fixed  Remuneration 1 $   | Other  Benefits 2 $   | STI  (Cash) 3 $   | STI  (equity) 4 $   | LTI (value  at grant) 5 $   | Total $   | Share price  change (STI) 6 $   | Share price  change (LTI) 6 $   | Total including  share price  change $   |\n|------------------------|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| M Vassella             | 2021   | 1,800,000                 | 1,804                 | -

For P Finan, this amount includes a Project Incentive for the period 1 January - 30 December 2020 that was paid during FY2021.\n- 4 STI (equity) is the amount relating to performance in the FY2021 financial year which the executive elected to take as equity (share price at grant of $11.8609 based on 3 month VWAP to 31 August 2020).\n- 5 The FY19 LTI award will vest in September, the value at allocation was $17.9002 per share (3 month VWAP to 31 August 2018).\n- 6 Share price change is equal to the number of rights vested multiplied by the difference in the allocation price and the closing price at the end of the performance period (30 June 2021).\n\nA portion of the value realised by executives from STI equity and LTI is due to changes in the share price from the time of grant to vesting. In this way, reward for the executives is automatically aligned with the outcomes for shareholders over the performance period.  BlueScope's share price over the vesting period for the FY2019 Alignment Rights and FY2021 STI resulted in an increase in value delivered since grant as shown in the chart below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

J Bevan, P Bingham-Hall and K Conlon have elected superannuation guarantee exemptions.  The additional superannuation allowance has been included under fees. J Bevan, M Hutchinson and J Lambert have elected to sacrifice a portion of their fees in exchange for BlueScope shares.  Fees have been reduced to reflect these salary sacrifice amounts: J Bevan - $75,980; M Hutchinson - $40,057 and J Lambert $26,705.\n- 2 Non-executive Directors receive statutory superannuation contributions in line with the Superannuation Guarantee unless they elect an exemption. No other postemployment benefits apply.\n- 3 Share based payments represent the fair value of the salary sacrificed shares. The fair value has been assessed at $12.54 per share.",

Such consultants report directly to the ROC. Potential conflicts of interest are considered in selecting remuneration consultants and their terms of engagement regulate their level of access to, and require independence from, BlueScope's management. Any advice from external consultants is used as a guide and is not a substitute for thorough consideration of all the issues by the ROC. The Chairman of the Board does not participate in any discussions relating to the determination of his own fees.\n\nDuring FY2021, the ROC employed the services of independent remuneration advisors to provide information and advice on remuneration strategy and structure including market practice which covers Executive KMP.  No remuneration recommendations as defined in section 9B of the Corporations Act 2001 were provided.\n\n## 7.4  Board Discretion\n\nThe ROC and the Board consider it critical to be able to exercise appropriate discretion to ensure that remuneration outcomes for Executives appropriately reflect the performance of the Group and individuals and meet shareholders' expectations. Some of the ways this discretion can be exercised are outlined below.\n\n| Element                    | Terms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Variable  reward  outcomes | The Board retains the discretion to limit, defer or cancel any STI or LTI awards in exceptional circumstances,  including determining that a reduced award or even no award should be paid/vest. The Board is also able to  moderate variable reward outcomes in circumstances where the calculated result does not align with  employee, customer and shareholder experience.  In determining whether any discretion should be applied, the Board considers the extent to which reward  outcomes are:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Malus /  Forfeiture        | cent to 145 per cent to reflect the Safety component forgone by not meeting the threshold performance level  for TRIFR.  In the event of serious misconduct by management which undermines the Company's performance, financial  soundness and/or reputation, or inappropriate ethics and/or behaviour, the Board has absolute discretion to  cancel and withdraw any unvested STI or LTI awards that Executives elect to take in cash or equity.   Misconduct includes misrepresentation or material misstatements due to errors, omissions or negligence.  In FY2021, the Board did not exercise their discretion on variable reward relating to misconduct.                                                                                                          |\n| Clawback                   | The Board has discretion in certain circumstances to clawback Alignment Rights awards, resulting shares or  the financial benefit of those shares. These circumstances include fraud or gross misconduct, breach of law,  material breach of policies or standards, bringing BlueScope into disrepute, material misstatement in financial  statements, certain oversight failures or any other circumstances where there would be an inappropriate  benefit. The clawback provisions apply to participants who were members of the ELT at the time any such  circumstance occurred for the outstanding FY2018 and FY2019 awards. From the FY2020 award onwards, the  clawback provision applies to all participants.  No awards were subject to clawback during FY2021. |",

It also prohibits entry into transactions in associated products that limit the economic risk of participating in unvested entitlements under equity-based remuneration schemes. In addition, nominated employees, including KMP, are prohibited from dealing in the Company's securities outside prescribed trading periods.\n\n## 7.6  Minimum Shareholding Requirements\n\nA key principle of the remuneration framework is to encourage Executives to behave like owners. The Board believes that the interests of all KMP should be closely aligned to those of shareholders through significant exposure to the Company's share price and dividends. Accordingly, the following minimum shareholding requirements are in place:\n\n|                                           | Minimum Shareholding  Requirement   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Non-executive Directors                   | 100% of base fees                   |\n| MD & CEO                                  | 200% of fixed pay                   |\n| Executive Leadership Team (including KMP) | 100% of fixed pay                   |\n\nThe ELT, including KMP, is expected to build their shareholding on a progressive basis over a reasonable period. The ROC regularly monitors the shareholding of KMP and the ELT. The Alignment Rights plan is an important mechanism to drive Executive share ownership through the regular vesting of rights on the achievement of the threshold performance hurdles. As at 30 June 2021, most Executive KMP hold shares in excess of the minimum shareholding requirement, and those who do not are on track to achieving this in the next two years.",

This is consistent with the Company's overall number of non-compliances reported last year, noting that the total number is at the lower end of the historical range and less than half the number recorded only a decade ago.\n\nThe NSW EPA issued four advisory letters in relation to incidents at the Port Kembla Steelworks, although two of these were addressed to Australian Steel Products' contractors (in relation to coal dust emissions from No.4 Coal Storage Area on 25 September 2020 and in relation to an extended truck wash outage in Alliances and Recycling Area on 17 February 2021), in recognition of the primary control exercised by the contractors.  The other two advisory letters related to a partial collapse on 11 July 2020 of a structure supporting the grit arrester system at the coke ovens which reduced the capacity of the grit arrester by approximately 15% and to an emission from a coke making battery standpipe on 1 April 2021.\n\nAlso in relation to the Port Kembla Steelworks, Australian Steel Products received from the EPA an official caution for a breach of the limit for total suspended solids at Flat Products East No. 1 Drain on 14 July 2020, a formal warning for an emission from a battery hopper at coke making  on 28 November 2020 and a penalty infringement notice (A$15k fine) for the discharge of approximately 100L of dilute Coke Ovens Gas (COG) Condensate from a Blast Furnace COG sump into the Blower Station Drain  on 17 April 2021.\n\nFor the financial year to date no other penalty infringement notices or use of regulatory instruments have been reported across BlueScope's Australian operations.\n\nFurther environmental information will be provided in BlueScope's Sustainability Report and first Climate Action Report, due for release in September 2021.\n\n## Indemnification and Insurance of Officers\n\nThe Company has entered into directors' and officers' insurance policies and paid an insurance premium in respect of the insurance policies, to the extent permitted by the Corporations Act 2001. The insurance policies cover former Directors of the Company along with the current Directors of the Company (listed on page 30). Executive officers and employees of the Company and its related bodies corporate are also covered.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 21 of its Constitution, the Company to the maximum extent permitted by law:\n\n- \u00b7 must indemnify any current or former Director or Secretary; and\n- \u00b7 may indemnify current or former executive officers,\n\nof the Company or any of its subsidiaries, against all liabilities (and certain legal costs) incurred in those capacities to a person, including a liability incurred as a result of appointment or nomination by the Company or its subsidiaries as a trustee or as a Director, officer or employee of another corporation.\n\nCurrent and previous Directors of the Company and the previous Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Legal Officer and Company Secretary have entered into an Access, Insurance and Indemnity Deed (Deed) with the Company. The Deed addresses some or all of the matters set out in Rule 21 of the Constitution and includes, among other things, provisions requiring the Company to indemnify an officer to the extent to which they are not already indemnified as permitted under law, and to use its best endeavours to maintain an insurance policy covering the period while they are in office and seven years after ceasing to hold office. It is the Company's practice that its",

No payment has been made to indemnify Ernst & Young during or since the financial year.\n\n## Proceedings on Behalf of BlueScope\n\nAs at the date of this Report, there are no leave applications or proceedings made in respect of BlueScope or that a person has brought or intervened in on behalf of BlueScope under section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001.\n\n## Rounding of Amounts\n\nAmounts in the Directors' Report are presented in Australian dollars with values rounded to the nearest hundred thousand dollars, or in certain cases a lesser amount, in accordance with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) instrument 2016/191.",

        "page_content": "## 2  Revenue (continued)\n\nRevenue is recognised at a point in time for goods being upon delivery to the customer or over the ship's rail. Revenue is recognised over time for bundled goods and services such as design, construction or installation services. The Group has determined that the output method is the best method in measuring bundled goods and the input method for measuring services as there is a direct relationship between the Group's effort and the transfer of goods and services to the customer. The Group recognises revenue on the basis of the total goods delivered and costs expected relative to the total expected goods to be delivered and total expected costs.\n\nThe contract transaction price can vary due to volume and steel pricing rebates, early payment discounts and for short tail claims for product shipped and billed to the customer that did not meet previously agreed specifications. Variable consideration is estimated using the 'most likely amount method' for contracts with a single volume threshold and the 'expected value method' for contracts with more than one volume threshold.\n\nThe majority of the Group's product warranties are assurance type warranties. However, the North American Buildings and Building Product businesses offer service warranties to customers, ranging from 5 to 30 years. Service warranty premium is treated as a separate performance obligation with revenue recognised over the warranty period.\n\n## 3  Other income\n\n|                                                              |       | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                              | Notes | 2021 $M        | 2020 $M        |\n| Carbon permit income                                         |       | 62.2           | 45.0           |\n| Government grants                                            | 3(a)  | 1.8            | 11.2           |\n| Insurance recoveries                                         |       | 0.1            | 1.0            |\n| Net gain on sale of PP&E                                     | 12(a) | 10.0           | 9.0            |\n| Net gain on fair value revaluation and disposal of associate | 3(b)  | -              | 2.1            |\n|                                                              |       | 74.1           | 68.3           |\n\n## (a)  Government grants and assistance\n\nCurrent period government grants includes COVID-19 Government wage subsidies of $1.0M in China and $0.6M in Malaysia and Singapore.

However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than from a business combination or the adoption of a new accounting standard, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.

A provision for impairment is recognised when there is objective evidence that amounts due may not be received. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to current receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial.

The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on the Group's historical credit loss experience, adjusted for any forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.\n\n## 7  Inventories\n\n|                                            | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                            | 2021           | 2021           | 2020           | 2020           |\n|                                            | Current $M     | Non- current   | Current $M     | Non- current   |\n|                                            |                | $M             |                | $M             |\n| At lower of cost and net realisable value: |                |                |                |                |\n| Raw materials and stores                   | 818.0          | -              | 591.3          | -              |\n| Work in progress                           | 624.2          | -              | 536.6          | -              |\n| Finished goods                             | 756.9          | -              | 607.0          | -              |\n| Spares and other                           | 119.1          | 61.6           | 186.7          | 60.2           |\n|                                            | 2,318.2        | 61.6           | 1,921.6        | 60.2           |\n\n## (a)  Inventory expense / write-back\n\nDuring the year, $27.9M (2020: $7.8M expense) was recognised as a write-back for inventories carried at net realisable value. The write-back has been included in 'raw materials and consumables used' in the profit and loss.\n\n## (b)  Inventory spares write-downs\n\nIn the prior period, a total of $37.0M of inventory spares in New Zealand Steel and Pacific Steel was written-down (refer to note 14(f)).\n\n## (c)  Recognition and measurement\n\nRaw materials and stores, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead expenditure, the latter being allocated on the basis of normal operating capacity. Cost includes the transfer from equity of any gains/losses on qualifying cash flow hedges relating to purchases of raw materials. Costs are assigned to inventory on the basis of weighted average costs. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates and discounts. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs to sell.\n\n## 8  Operating intangible assets\n\n|                                                       | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                       | 2021           | 2021           | 2020           | 2020           |\n|                                                       |                | Non-           |                | Non-           |\n|                                                       | Current $M     | current $M     | Current $M     | current $M     |\n| Emission unit (EU) permits - not held for trading (i) | 41.0           | 106.2          | 33.5           | 78.4           |\n| Energy certificates - not held for trading (ii)       | 4.6            | -              | 2.4            | -              |\n|                                                       | 45.6           | 106.2          | 35.9           | 78.4           |\n\n## (a)  Recognition and measurement\n\n(i) Emission unit (EU) permits which are not held for trading are classified as intangible assets and are carried at cost. Intangible EU assets are not amortised as the economic benefits are realised from surrendering the rights to settle obligations arising from the emissions trading scheme.\n\n(ii) Energy certificates represent acquired permits in the Australian Steel Products segment generated from the Finley NSW solar farm as part of the Solar PPA agreement (refer to note 31(d)(iv)) and various local state schemes. Energy certificates which are not held for trading are classified as intangible assets and are carried at cost.",

        "page_content": "## 10  Provisions (continued)\n\n## (c)  Key judgements and estimates\n\nProvisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.\n\n## (d)  Employee benefits\n\n## (i)   Annual leave and long service leave\n\nThe liability for annual leave and long service leave expected to be settled after 12 months is measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds other than New Zealand where Government bonds are used, with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.\n\nEmployee benefit on-costs are recognised and included in employee benefit liabilities and costs when the employee benefits to which they relate are recognised as liabilities.\n\n## Amounts not expected to be settled within 12 months for current leave provisions\n\nThe current provision for long service leave includes all unconditional entitlements where employees have completed the required period of service. The entire annual leave amount and vested portion of long service leave are presented as current. Since the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement, based on past experience, the Group does not expect all employees to take the full amount of accrued annual leave and long service leave or require payment within the next 12 months. Current annual leave and long service leave obligation expected to be settled after 12 months is $152.7M (2020: $127.9M).\n\n## (ii)  Termination benefits\n\nLiabilities for termination benefits, not in connection with a business combination or the closure of an operation, are recognised when the Group is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a formal plan without possibility of withdrawal, or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.\n\nThe employee redundancy provision balance reflects a range of internal reorganisations. All redundancies are expected to take effect within 12 months of the reporting date.\n\n## (iii) Short Term Incentive plans (STI)\n\nThe Group recognises a liability and an expense for STI plan payments made to employees. The Group recognises a provision where past practice and current performance indicates that a probable constructive obligation exists.\n\n## (e)  Restructuring costs\n\nLiabilities arising directly from undertaking a restructuring program, defined as the closure of an operating site, are recognised when a detailed plan of the restructuring activity has been developed and implementation of the restructuring program as planned has commenced, by either entering into contracts to undertake the restructuring activities or making a detailed announcement such that affected parties are in no doubt the restructuring program will proceed.\n\nThe provision primarily relate to Australian Steel Products segment to cover estimated future costs of site closures which are to be utilised over various terms up to a maximum period of 12 years.\n\n## (f)  Product claims\n\nProvision for claims is based on modelled data combining sales volumes with past experiences of repair and replacement levels in conjunction with any specifically identified product faults.\n\n## (g)  Workers compensation\n\nIn Australia and North America, the Company is a registered self-insurer for workers compensation. Provisions are recognised based on calculations performed by an external actuary in relation to the expectation of future events. A contingent liability exists in relation to guarantees given to various state workers compensation authorities, due to self-insurance prerequisites (refer to note 25(a)).",

The present value of the defined benefit obligation is based on expected future payments which arise from membership of the fund to the end of the reporting period, calculated half yearly by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service.\n\nExpected future payments are discounted using market yields on government or corporate bonds where a deep market exists, with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.\n\nActuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, in other comprehensive income.\n\nPast service costs are recognised in profit or loss, unless the changes to the superannuation plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\n\nFuture taxes that are funded by the entity and are part of the provision of the existing benefit obligation (e.g. taxes on investment income and employer contributions) are taken into account in measuring the net liability or asset.\n\n## INVESTED CAPITAL\n\nThis section of the notes provides further information about property, plant and equipment, non-current intangibles assets and carrying amount of these non-financial assets, including accounting policies, key judgements and estimates relevant to understanding these items.\n\n## 12  Property, plant and equipment\n\n|                                              | Notes   | Land and  Buildings $M   | Plant,  machinery & equipment $M   | Total $M   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------|\n| Year ended 30 June 2021                      |         |                          |                                    |            |\n| Opening net book amount                      |         | 802.6                    | 3,372.7                            | 4,175.3    |\n| Additions                                    |         | 28.7                     | 833.4                              | 862.1      |\n| Depreciation charge                          |         | (40.8)                   | (311.4)                            | (352.2)    |\n| Disposals                                    |         | (1.3)                    | (4.9)                              | (6.2)      |\n| Asset reclassifications                      |         | 9.3                      | (9.3)                              | -          |\n| Asset reclassifications to computer software |         | -                        | (4.4)                              | (4.4)      |\n| Assets reclassified from held-for-sale       | 12(a)   | 9.0                      | -                                  | 9.0        |\n| Exchange fluctuations                        |         | (42.5)                   | (119.2)                            | (161.7)    |\n| Closing net book amount                      |         | 765.0                    | 3,756.9                            | 4,521.9    |\n| At 30 June 2021                              |         |                          |                                    |            |\n| Cost                                         |         | 1,612.7                  | 12,132.0                           | 13,744.7   |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairment      |         | (847.7)                  | (8,375.1)                          | (9,222.8)  |\n| Net book amount                              |         | 765.0                    | 3,756.9                            | 4,521.9    |\n| Assets under construction included above:    |         | 4.8                      | 998.9                              | 1,003.7    |",

Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Cost also includes transfers from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of a replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the reporting period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or, in the case of leasehold improvements, the shorter lease term, unless there is reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership at the end of the lease term.\n\nThe useful lives of major categories of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n| Category                                  | Useful Life     |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Land                                      | Not depreciated |\n| Buildings                                 | 30-40 years     |\n| Iron and steel making plant and machinery | 20-40 years     |\n| Coating lines                             | 20-30 years     |\n| Building components plant and equipment   | 12-18 years     |\n| Other plant and equipment                 | 5-15 years      |\n\n## Derecognition\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is sold or otherwise disposed of, or when its use is expected to bring no future economic benefits.\n\n## (e)  Key estimates\n\nThe estimation of the useful lives of plant and machinery has been based on historical experience and judgement with respect to technical obsolescence, physical deterioration and usage capacity of the asset in addition to any legal restrictions on usage. The condition of the asset is assessed at least once a year and considered against the remaining useful life.\n\n## 13  Intangible assets\n\n| Consolidated                            | Goodwill $M   | Patents,  trademark and other rights $M   | Computer  software $M   | Customer  relation- ships $M   | Other intangible assets $M   | Total $M   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------|\n| Year 30 June 2021                       |               |                                           |                         |                                |                              |            |\n| Opening net book amount                 | 1,293.6       | 5.1                                       | 86.1                    | 308.5                          | 28.2                         | 1,721.5    |\n| Additions                               | -             | -                                         | 6.9                     | -                              | -                            | 6.9        |\n| Amortisation charge                     | -             | (0.3)                                     | (16.0)                  | (28.5)                         | (1.7)                        | (46.5)     |\n| Reclassifications from PP&E             | -             | -                                         | 4.4                     | -                              | -                            | 4.4        |\n| Exchange fluctuations                   | (110.2)       | (0.4)                                     | (5.0)                   | (26.2)                         | (0.4)                        | (142.2)    |\n| Closing net book amount                 | 1,183.4       | 4.4                                       | 76.4                    | 253.8                          | 26.1                         | 1,544.1    |\n| At 30 June 2021                         |               |                                           |                         |                                |                              |            |\n| Cost                                    | 1,696.8       | 21.2                                      | 393.2                   | 480.5                          | 41.3                         | 2,633.0    |\n| Accumulated amortisation and impairment | (513.4)       | (16.8)                                    | (316.8)                 | (226.7)                        | (15.2)                       | (1,088.9)  |\n| Net book amount                         | 1,183.4       | 4.4                                       | 76.4                    | 253.8                          | 26.1                         | 1,544.1    |",

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested at least annually for any impairment.\n\nFor assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting period to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\n## (b)  Allocation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives to cash generating units\n\nGoodwill is allocated to the Group's cash generating units (CGUs) for impairment testing purposes as follows:\n\n| Cash generating units           | Reportable segments                      | 2021 $M   | 2020 $M   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Building Products North America | Building Products Asia and North America | 3.7       | 4.0       |\n| Buildings North America         | Buildings North America                  | 291.3     | 318.5     |\n| North Star BlueScope Steel      | North Star BlueScope Steel               | 885.1     | 967.8     |\n| Buildings China                 | Building Products Asia and North America | 3.3       | 3.3       |\n| Total goodwill                  | Total goodwill                           | 1,183.4   | 1,293.6   |\n\nThe allocation is made to those cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. In addition to goodwill, the Group has other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives of $3.9M (2020: $4.2M) allocated to the Buildings North America CGU which primarily relates to the Varco Pruden trade names acquired in February 2008. All of the above CGUs were tested for impairment at the reporting date.\n\n## (c)  Key assumptions and estimates\n\nThe recoverable amount of each CGU is determined on the basis of value-in-use (VIU), unless there is evidence to support a higher fair value less cost to sell. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic during FY2020 has created a public health emergency which is ongoing. While customer demand across the Group was negatively impacted to varying degrees during 2H FY2020, the global economy, and in particular North America, Australia and New  Zealand, recovered faster and stronger than anticipated with favourable macroeconomic conditions in FY2021.\n\nThe price, cost and demand for BlueScope's products is uncertain and the Company considers a number of recognised external forecasters when assessing possible future market conditions. These external forecasters expect commodity steel prices to peak early FY2022 and progressively return to be broadly in line with historical long-term average levels by FY2026. In addition, demand for BlueScope's products is expected to moderate but still remain relatively strong in Australia and New Zealand, support full steelmaking capacity in North America and continue to grow from the FY2021 levels in Asia over the forecast period.",

Pre-tax VIU cash flows are discounted utilising pre-tax discount rate of 11.9% (2020: 11.9%).\n\nAt 30 June 2021 the recoverable amount of the CGU is 4.0 times (2020: 2.3 times) the carrying amount of $2,374.3M (2020: $2,059.4M), including non-current assets and net working capital. This CGU is most sensitive to assumptions in relation to the spread between North American hot rolled coil and purchased scrap prices. Taking into account external forecasts, the Group expects the spread to peak early FY2022 and progressively return to be broadly in line with historical long-term average levels by FY2026. To illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions, if they were to differ, such that the expected cash flow forecasts for North Star BlueScope Steel were to decrease by approximately 76% (2020: 47%) across the forecast period, without implementation of mitigation plans, the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying amount.\n\n## (e)  Sensitivity of carrying amounts\n\nIn addition to the GCU's with significant goodwill, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment of the Group is most sensitive to cash forecasts for Australian Steel Products (ASP) and New Zealand and Pacific Islands (NZPI), as they are exposed to global steel macroeconomic factors. The carrying amount of these CGUs are determined taking into account the key assumptions set out above.\n\nFor ASP, recognised external forecasters estimate the Australian dollar relative to the US dollar to remain broadly consistent to the average year ended 30 June 2021 level and estimate a decrease in Asian commodity steel prices relative to iron ore and coking coal costs. The Group believes that the long-term assumptions adopted are appropriate.\n\nASP is exposed to variable macroeconomic factors and domestic demand, and to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions, if they were to differ such that the expected cash flow forecasts were to decrease by approximately 57% (2020: 45%) across the forecast period, without implementation of mitigation plans, the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying amount.\n\nFor NZPI, recognised external forecasters estimate the New Zealand dollar relative to the US dollar to remain broadly consistent to the average year ended 30 June 2021  level and estimate a decrease in Asian commodity steel prices relative to the year ended 30 June 2021. The Group  believes that the long term assumptions adopted are appropriate.\n\nNZPI is exposed to variable macroeconomic factors and to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions, if they were to differ such that the expected cash flow forecasts were to decrease by 48% (June 2020: Nil) across the forecast period, without implementation of mitigation plans, the recoverable amount would be equal to the carrying amount.\n\n## (f)  Recognised asset write-downs\n\n| Cash generating units                                                 | 2021   | 2020   | Discount rates   | Discount rates   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                                       | $M     | $M     | 2021 (%)         | 2020 (%)         |\n| New Zealand Steel & Pacific Steel asset impairment (i)                | -      | 156.2  | -                | 12.1             |\n| New Zealand Steel - Pipe mill closure PP&E impairment (i)             | -      | 3.8    | -                | -                |\n| NS Bluescope Lysaght Singapore - PP&E impairment                      | -      | 0.7    | -                | -                |\n| Impairment expense of non-current assets                              | -      | 160.7  | -                | -                |\n| New Zealand Steel & Pacific Steel inventory spares write-down (i)     | -      | 36.0   | -                | -                |\n| New Zealand Steel - Pipe mill closure inventory spares write-down (i) | -      | 1.0    | -                | -                |\n| Total asset write-down                                                | -      | 197.7  |                  |                  |\n\n## (i) New Zealand Steel & Pacific Steel\n\nAs at 30 June 2020, New Zealand Steel and Pacific Steel recognised a total asset write-down of $197.0M against property and plant, ROU assets, spares and computer software, primarily as a result of a reassessment of sustainable earnings throughout the cycle from the current model.

        "page_content": "## 17  Leases (continued)\n\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the lease or over the life of the asset if ownership of the underlying asset is to be transferred at the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets are subject to impairment and are assessed at either individual asset level, if it generates cash flows which are largely independent from other assets, or at a cash generating unit level.\n\n## (iii)  Lease liabilities\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any incentives receivable;\n- \u00b7 Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate as at the commencement date; and\n- \u00b7 The exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\n\nVariable lease payments that vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time (e.g. rentals based on usage) are excluded from lease payments recognised on balance sheet and are recognised in the profit and loss as incurred. Variable leases for the Group primarily relate to leases embedded within service agreements relating to transport and steel mill services.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently increased by interest on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase option, extension option or lease termination is reasonably certain to be exercised or when there is a lease modification.\n\n## (iv)   Short-term and leases of low value assets\n\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases, being a period of 12 months or less from the commencement date, and one which does not contain a purchase option. It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption, being a distinct asset worth less than $10,000 when brand new. This would typically include laptop computers and office equipment. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low value assets are recognised as an expense on a straightline basis over the lease term.\n\n## (f) Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group has applied judgement when determining the relative standalone prices of the lease and non-lease components contained within service agreements.The lease asset rentals have been determined using estimated asset depreciation charges uplifted for specific contract margins.\n\nJudgement has also been applied when determining the lease terms for lease contracts containing extension options. Lease terms have been assessed based on whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise such options. This assessment impacts the value of the lease liability and right-of-use asset recognised. Lease extension options are at the Group's discretion of being exercised and are primarily associated with property leases within the ASP building product businesses. The use of extension options provides the Group flexibility when determining the future use of leasehold properties that meets ever changing business requirements. Gross lease extension options, for which the Group is not reasonably certain of exercise and has been excluded from the lease liability, total $524.7M. Of this amount, $332.9M relates primarily to property lease extension options beyond 2030.",

        "page_content": "## 25  Contingencies (continued)\n\n## (iii) Taxation\n\nThe Group operates in many countries across the world, each with separate taxation authorities, which results in significant complexity. At any point in time there are tax computations which have been submitted but not agreed by those tax authorities and matters which are under discussion between Group companies and the tax authorities. The Group provides for the amount of tax it expects to pay taking into account those discussions and professional advice it has received. While conclusion of such matters may result in amendments to the original computations, the Group does not believe that such adjustments will have a material adverse effect on its financial position, although such adjustments may be significant to any individual year's income statement.\n\n## (iv) Regulatory\n\nThe Group is subject to extensive government laws and regulation, including environmental, greenhouse gas emissions, tax, occupational health and safety, competition law and trade restrictions in each of the countries in which it operates. The Group is also subject to risks posed by the conduct of our employees and other participants in the supply chain and to the risk of regulatory investigations into compliance with government laws and regulations which could be lengthy and costly.\n\n## (b)  Contingent assets\n\nThere are no material contingent assets required for disclosure as at 30 June 2021.\n\n## 26  Events occurring after balance date\n\nThe Board has approved an on-market share buyback of $500 million.\n\n## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nThis section of the notes includes information on items which require disclosure to comply with Australian Accounting Standards and other regulatory pronouncements but are not considered critical in understanding the financial performance or position of the Group.\n\n## 27  Share-based payments\n\n## (a)  Share award schemes\n\n## (i)   STI share award\n\nThe Board approved the annual FY2021 STI for the CEO and executives, being a one year equity program. No amount will be paid in cash. Performance was assessed against a range of financial and other measures aligned with the returns delivered to shareholders from the implementation of initiatives under the Group's strategic plan. The shares will be issued in late August 2021.\n\n## (ii) Long Term Alignment Rights Plan (LTAR)\n\nThe long term alignment rights plan is a program determined annually by the Board, which awards share rights to eligible senior management of BlueScope Steel Limited. Alignment Rights are designed to build share ownership and reward senior management for long-term value creation, and are part of the Group's overall recognition and retention strategy. The share rights give the right to receive an ordinary share at a later date subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria and continued employment with the Group.\n\nThe share rights available for exercise are contingent on the Group's achievement of a three-year rolling average level of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and debt leverage, as well as individual adherence to the BlueScope Bond. Share rights that fail to meet performance vesting conditions will lapse upon the Alignment Rights expiry date, or sooner upon employee resignation or termination. Plans have been granted to senior management, all at $Nil exercise price.\n\n## (iii) Deferred Equity / Retention Rights Award\n\nThe Board awarded deferred equity awards to senior management throughout the Group, with no performance hurdles required to be met. The equity award gives the right to receive an ordinary share at a later date subject to continued employment with the Group.\n\n## (iv) Non-Executive Director Salary Sacrifice Share Plan (NED)\n\nIn FY2021, the Board awarded a fee sacrifice plan to non-executive directors, designed to provide them the opportunity to acquire share rights through sacrificing a fixed portion of their fees covering periods of 6 months intervals. The share rights are being settled by an on-market purchase of BlueScope Steel shares.",

        "page_content": "## 27  Share-based payments (continued)\n\nNon-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share awards or share rights that are expected to vest. The expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are expected to be satisfied. At the end of each period, the entity revises its estimates of the number of share awards and share rights that are expected to vest based on non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\nThe cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until vesting date reflects the extent to which the expected vesting period has expired and the number of rights that are expected to ultimately vest. This number is based on the best available information at the reporting date. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest due to a performance condition not being met, except for share rights where vesting is only conditional upon a market condition. No adjustment is made for the likelihood of market performance conditions being met as the effect of these conditions is included in the determination of fair value at grant date.\n\nUpon the exercise of equity settled share awards, the balance of the share-based payments reserve relating to those rights and awards is transferred to share capital. The dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding rights is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## Cash settled transactions\n\nThe ultimate expense recognised in relation to cash-settled transactions will be equal to the actual cash paid to the employees, which will be the fair value at settlement date. The expected cash payment is estimated at each reporting date and a liability is recognised to the extent that the vesting period has expired and in proportion to the amount of the awards that are expected to ultimately vest.\n\n## 28  Related party transactions\n\n## (a)  Parent entities\n\nThe ultimate parent entity within the Group is BlueScope Steel Limited, which is incorporated in Australia.\n\n## (b)  Key Management Personnel compensation\n\n|                                              | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                              | 2021 $'000     | 2020 $'000     |\n| Short-term employee benefits                 | 8,983.5        | 10,718.1       |\n| Post-employment and other long-term benefits | 369.5          | 435.1          |\n| Share-based payments                         | 9,836.8        | 6,749.6        |\n|                                              | 19,189.8       | 17,902.8       |\n\n## (c)  Transactions with other related parties\n\nThe following transactions occurred with related parties other than Key Management Personnel or entities related to them:\n\n|                                                             | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                             | 2021 $M        | 2020 $M        |\n| Sales of goods and services                                 |                |                |\n| Sales of goods to associates                                | 2.7            | 1.9            |\n| Superannuation contributions                                |                |                |\n| Contribution to superannuation funds on behalf of employees | 118.6          | 109.4          |\n\n## (d)  Outstanding balances\n\nThe following balances are outstanding at the reporting date in relation to transactions with related parties other than key management personnel:\n\n|                                                   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                   | 2021           | 2020           |\n|                                                   | $M             | $M             |\n| Current receivables (sales of goods and services) |                |                |\n| Associates                                        | 0.8            |                |",

        "page_content": "## 31  Financial instruments and risk (continued)\n\n## (ii)   Forward commodity contracts\n\nIn September 2019, the Group entered into a Gas Supply Agreement with Esso Australia for its Australian business from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2025, with the contract price linked to Brent Oil in US dollars. Given exposure to a variable Brent Oil price, 95% of the first three year's exposure has been hedged. Both of these forward contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges with the effective portion of gains and losses recognised directly in equity. Additionally, the Group has entered into forward contracts for the purchase of electricity for its New Zealand Steel business\n\n## (iii)  Commodity option\n\nAs part of the sale agreement of New Zealand Steel Mining Limited to Taharoa Mining Investments Limited (TMIL), BlueScope is eligible to receive future royalties of US$1.66 per dry metric tonne (DMT) when the Platts Index Quotation is equal or greater than US$65 per DMT. The royalty period is for iron sand shipments made between years 2 and 11 from 1 May 2017. The royalty agreement ends on 10 May 2028.\n\nThe key inputs impacting the value of the derivative are the Platts index iron ore price, the historical volatility of iron ore prices, the credit worthiness of TMIL and production risk. The royalty was valued at US$9.6M as at 30 June 2021 (June 2020: US$5.3M). The royalty value is reassessed at each reporting date with any movement in the fair value of the derivative fair valued through the profit and loss and included in discontinued operations. Royalties received for the year was $6.6M.\n\n## (iv)   Solar PPA\n\nThe Group entered into a solar power purchase agreement (PPA) in June 2018 for a period of seven years from the commencement of commercial production. The solar farm is situated in Finley NSW. The project was completed in two stages with Stage 1 involving the construction of an 88MW facility, completed in November 2019 and Stage 2 construction of an additional 45M, completed in February 2020. The solar farm is currently operating at full output. The Group's percentage offtake is equal to 100% of Stage 1 (or 66% of the total solar farm output). The Group has no involvement in financing, operating and maintaining the solar farm.\n\nThe PPA is not a physical electricity supply contract. It operates as a 'contract for differences' (CfD) whereby the parties have agreed to a 'strike price'. If the NSW electricity spot price is higher than the strike price then the solar farm will pay the difference to the company and vice versa if the spot price is lower than the strike price. The CfD is a derivative and is required to be fair valued at each reporting date with any movements recorded in the profit or loss.\n\nThe key inputs impacting the value of the derivative are the strike price, the contract period, forward NSW electricity spot prices (Level 3 unobservable input), future estimates of the Group's share of solar output and the credit worthiness of the service provider. The 30 June 2021 PPA derivative payable was valued at $12.8M (June 2020: $6.0M). The increase in fair value is primarily driven by an increase in electricity spot prices.\n\n## (e)  Fair values\n\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Group's financial instruments recognised in the financial statements are materially the same, with the exception of the following:\n\n|                                  | 2021                | 2021          | 2020                | 2020          |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n|                                  | Carrying  amount $M | Fair value $M | Carrying  amount $M | Fair value $M |\n| Non-traded financial liabilities |                     |               |                     |               |\n| Other loans                      | 399.3               | 432.0         | 436.6               | 490.7         |\n| Net assets (liabilities)         | (399.3)             | (432.0)       | (436.6)             | (490.7)       |\n\nThe fair value of interest bearing financial liabilities where no market exists is based upon discounting the expected future cash flows by the current market interest rates on liabilities with similar risk profiles that are available to the Group (level 3).",

They provide mandatory temporary relief enabling hedge accounting to continue during the period of uncertainty before the replacement of an existing interest rate benchmark with an alternative 'nearly risk-free' benchmark.\n\nThese amendments apply retrospectively. However, any hedge relationships that have previously been de-designated cannot be reinstated, nor can any hedge relationships be designated with the benefit of hindsight. An assessment of the amendments of the standard has not resulted in any impact on the financial statements.\n\n## (ii)  AASB 2018-7 Amendments to AASs- Definition of Material (effective 1 July 2020)\n\nThe amendments align the definition of 'material' across AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements and AAS 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, and clarify certain aspects of the definition. The new definition states that, 'Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.\n\nThe amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, or both. An entity will need to assess whether the information, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of the financial statements. An assessment of the amendments of the standard resulted in no significant impact on the Group's current criteria of 'materiality' principles.",

The guidance helped clarify whether an identifiable controllable asset arises from a software as a service (SaaS) arrangement. The segment information provided to the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer for the reportable segments for the year ended 30 June 2021 is as follows:\n\n30 June 2021\n\nBuilding\n\nNew\n\nThe IFRIC guidance states that in most cloud computing arrangements configuration and customisation costs should be expensed as incurred. This is on the basis that the customer does not create an asset as they do not control the software being configured and or customised and this does not create a resource that is controlled by the customer that is separate from the software. However, in some circumstances the arrangement may result in, for example, additional code from which the customer has the power to obtain the future economic benefits and to restrict others access to those benefits. In that case the customer assesses whether the additional code results in an identifiable asset that meets the recognition criteria under AASB 138 (Intangible Assets).

Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2021 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and\n- b.

Our responsibilities under t hose standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with t h e Code.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.",

Carrying value of property, plant & equipment (PPE) and intangible assets (including goodwill)\n\n## Why significant\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nAs required by Australian Accounting Standards the Group annually tests goodwill for impairment and tests other non-current assets where indicators of impairment exist using a discounted cash flow model to estimate the recoverable value.\n\nAt 30 June 2021, the Cash Generating Units (CGUs) with significant goodwill balances include North Star BlueScope Steel (goodwill balance of $885m) and Buildings North America (goodwill balance of $291m). The CGUs with a significant PPE balance are Australian Steel Products (PPE balance of $2,001m) and North Star BlueScope Steel (PPE balance of $1,277m).\n\nThe carrying value of PPE and intangible assets, (including goodwill) was a key audit matter due to t he significance of these balances, the complex judgements in the impairment assessment process such as forecast foreign exchange rates, steel, iron ore, coal pricing and domestic sales volumes t hat are affected by future market or economic conditions.\n\nThe Group's disclosures are included in Note 14 of the financial report, which specifically explain the key operating assumptions used; and sensitivity of changes in the key assumptions which could give rise to an impairment loss or impairment reversal of the PPE and intangible assets (including goodwill) balance in the future.\n\nOur audit procedures included assessing the appropriateness of the Group's determination of its CGUs where impairment testing was performed, taking into consideration the levels at which Management monitors business performance and the interdependency of cash flows.\n\nIn respect to the Group's cashflow forecasts, for relevant CGUs, where indicators of impairment were present or in CGUs that contained significant goodwill balances as at 30 June 2021, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessed the Group's results in comparison to historical forecasts to assess forecast accuracy\n- \u00b7 Assessed key assumptions such as forecast steel, iron ore and coal pricing, foreign exchange rates and domestic sales volumes in comparison to external independent data where relevant\n- \u00b7 Compared future cash flows to board approved budgets\n- \u00b7 Assessed the adequacy of capital expenditure f or ecast s\n- \u00b7 Assessed the Group's assumptions for long term growth rates in comparison to economic and industry forecasts\n- \u00b7 Assessed discount rates through comparing the cost of capital for the Group with comparable businesses\n- \u00b7 Tested the mathematical accuracy of the discounted cash flow model.\n- \u00b7 Considered the EBITDA multiples against comparable companies as a valuation cross check\n\nWhere considered necessary, we performed a sensitivity analysis in respect of the assumptions noted above which were considered to have the most significant impact on carrying values, to ascertain the extent of changes in those assumptions which either individually or collectively would be required for the PPE and intangible assets (including goodwill) to be impaired, or f or a previous impairment to be reversed where applicable. We assessed the likelihood of these changes in assumptions arising.\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the Group's disclosures of those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive, that is, those that have the most significant effect on the determination of t he recoverable amount of PPE and intangible assets (including goodwill).",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if , individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u25ba Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
