Equally important, we were there for our Clients when they needed us most. Delivering on our purpose of helping Clients achieve lifetime financial security and live healthier lives proved more important this past year than ever before.\n\nThese results were made possible by the determination, commitment and resilience of our employees and advisors as the pandemic proved to be relentless. The Board and I continue to be inspired by how our people achieve meaningful outcomes for Clients while trying to balance the responsibilities and challenges of maintaining their own and their families' well-being.\n\nSun Life's diversified business model, combined with our robust risk management and disciplined approach to capital allocation, once again proved to be a key strength.\n\nThe company achieved 10% growth in underlying net income in 2021.\n\nThe company achieved 10% growth in underlying net income in 2021. In terms of capital allocation, Sun Life managed more than 10 capital transactions that continued to help us build scale and add capabilities across our businesses. Our agreement to acquire DentaQuest in the U.S. and the ACB bancassurance transaction in Vietnam are great examples.\n\nSun Life also continues to make significant investments in areas that contribute to our Client Impact Strategy including digital leadership. Thinking and acting like a digital company is core to Sun Life's strategy. This philosophy has helped enhance our digital capabilities across the organization and transform both our Client experience and the way we work.\n\nAs I have noted in my previous letters to shareholders, Sun Life has been repeatedly recognized for our sustainability strategy. While many companies continue to play a larger role addressing issues including the\n\nenvironment, diversity, equity and inclusion, Sun Life has taken even bolder steps in our sustainability journey.\n\nIn 2021 we established the role of Chief Sustainability Officer reporting directly to the CEO and we embedded sustainability into the strategy of each of our businesses. We also committed an additional $20 billion in new sustainable investments over the next five years and set a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 as an asset owner and manager.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion remains integral to our sustainability plan. As part of Sun Life's focus, meaningful progress is being made towards achieving our 2025 diversity targets. This focus also extends to your Board of Directors. I'm proud of the broad range of business and strategic expertise we have added to the Board the past year with the addition of Deepak Chopra, David Ho, Helen Mallovy Hicks and Marie-Lucie Morin. We have increased boardroom representation in gender and from underrepresented communities to further enhance our capabilities. Sun Life's values and purpose resonate deeply with all of our Directors.\n\nI would be remiss if I didn't congratulate our new President and CEO, Kevin Strain, who succeeded Dean Connor in August 2021. Kevin is off to a great start and the Board is confident in his ability to lead Sun Life's continued success for all our stakeholders well into the future.\n\nMy 12-year term as a Director ends after the Annual Meeting in May. It has been a pleasure and an honour to serve and represent our shareholders and policyholders the past 12 years, five of which I served as Chair. I would also like to recognize Martin Glynn who is retiring after the Annual Meeting having completed his 12year term. Martin has been an excellent Director and an important contributor to all of our Board discussions.\n\nI am pleased to welcome Scott Powers as the next Chair of Sun Life's Board. Scott has been a highly respected and valued Board member since 2015. He brings strong leadership, a strategic approach to governance and extensive experience in financial services.\n\nDuring my tenure on the Board, I have seen tremendous growth and transformation take place across the company under the leadership of both Dean and Kevin. This transformation was an important factor enabling Sun Life to deliver a Total Shareholder Return of 18.75%, compounded annually, for the ten years ending in 2021, a leader among our global industry peers.\n\nOn behalf of the Board and all of Sun Life's dedicated employees and advisors, our deepest appreciation to our Clients, shareholders and other stakeholders for your continued loyalty and trust.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It's our purpose. It inspires, guides and drives everything we do.\n\nSo much has changed in the last two years. The COVID-19 pandemic's deadly toll, social justice inequities, environmental threats, and geopolitical aggressions have redefined our lives and our priorities. These pressures have weighed heavily on all of us, mentally and physically. We've felt isolated during lockdowns and seen great illness and tragic loss of life. Even as I write this letter, the world is now grappling with more tragedy and devastation with the invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing humanitarian crisis. It's my fervent hope that peace is restored quickly.\n\nAt the same time, it's been inspiring to witness the resilience and adaptability of the human spirit, which gives me hope. Nothing embodies this more than the introduction of vaccines and innovative therapies. Technology has also played a critical role in our ability to adapt by helping us stay in touch at work and in our personal lives. It has also led us to redefine the future of work at Sun Life, creating a work environment where there is flexibility and choice guided by Client and business needs.\n\nWe have been there for our Clients when they needed us most. Since March 2020, Sun Life has paid almost $900 million to our Clients and their families in COVIDrelated claims. We've also been there for our communities throughout the pandemic, donating more than $4.5 million in support of food banks, closing the gap around health inequities, and to aid vaccine distribution efforts.\n\nSince March 2020, Sun Life has paid almost\n\n$900 million to our Clients and their families in COVID-related claims.\n\nAnd we saw many people and companies, including Sun Life, make tangible and visible commitments to sustainability. We made net-zero greenhouse gas commitments as both an asset owner and as an asset manager in an effort to be part of the solution to climate change.\n\nI remain hopeful that this resilience will lead to a brighter future and that we will create a more positive, sustainable, healthier world. As Nelson Mandela once said, 'I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward.' At Sun Life we are optimistic about our future.\n\nThe Sun Life team rose to meet every challenge over the past year. We've kept our heads pointed towards the sun and kept moving forward. We rallied together, helped each other and showed great care in serving our Clients as they faced some of their greatest challenges. We found new and innovative ways to help our Clients with their financial security and to help them live healthier lives.",

This is what makes us truly unique. This mix of businesses will help deliver on our purpose, but also reach our ambition: to be one of the best asset management and insurance companies in the world.\n\nOur path to win is based on a clear strategy to grow across our pillars - Asset Management, Canada, U.S. and Asia.

Ultimately, we are focused on creating exceptional digital experiences and digital Client relationships.\n\nThe pandemic accelerated the need for digital tools and innovation to support Clients where and when they needed it.

For us, sustainability is an imperative. To keep our strategy future-focused, we appointed Sun Life's first Chief Sustainability Officer, reporting to me, with a mandate to lead company-wide actions and embed sustainable practices across our businesses.\n\nOur drive for sustainability focuses on the areas we know best and where we can have the biggest impact increasing financial security, fostering healthier lives and advancing sustainable investing. Last year we launched several initiatives to drive real change.\n\nThrough our General Account and SLC Management's third-party investments, we have approximately $60 billion in sustainable investments and set a goal to invest an additional $20 billion over the next five years. We achieved carbon neutrality across our global business operations and committed to the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner as an asset owner and manager.\n\n## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nWe continue to make progress towards our 2025 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion goals, which include gender parity at\n\nthe VP+ level and 25% of our senior leaders in North America from underrepresented communities. We're a member of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business and we're one of the first insurance companies in Canada to begin PAR (Progressive Aboriginal Relations) certification.\n\nI'm proud of the positive social and environmental impact Sun Life has had and the work we've done towards our sustainability commitments. And because the work is not done, we will continue our impact and look for ways to increase it.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Guided by our purpose, we executed on our strategic priorities and made great strides towards our ambition.\n\nOur results are impressive, especially given they were achieved with the pandemic as a backdrop. In 2021, Reported net income was $3.9 billion, up 64% compared to 2020. Underlying net income and underlying earnings per share increased 10% in 2021, at the top end of our medium-term objective of 8-10%.\n\nSuccess was driven across the company with each business contributing to our results. 51% of our income came from wealth and asset management, SLC Management had net flows of over $32 billion, MFS hit record AUM, Asia's wealth sales increased by more than $4.5 billion, Canada saw growth in underlying net income of 5%, and the U.S. had record Group Benefits sales of US$1.2 billion.\n\nWe're delivering value to our shareholders, with a 10year Total Shareholder Return of 18.75%, compounded annually. And with the removal of government restrictions for regulated financial institutions last year, we announced a 20% increase to our common share dividend, reinforcing our commitment to provide strong returns to shareholders.\n\n## Leadership matters\n\nLast year, Sun Life's former President and CEO Dean Connor retired after 10 years leading the organization. Dean's legacy lives on. He is my mentor and under his leadership we put Clients at the centre of our strategy. Throughout Dean's tenure, Sun Life became known as a company with a strong strategy and even stronger execution.\n\nBill Anderson, Sun Life's Chair, announced in December he's retiring after his full term of 12 years on our Board, the last five as Chair. Bill has played an instrumental role charting Sun Life's path forward and delivering industry-leading returns to you, our shareholders.\n\nScott Powers, Chair of the Governance, Investment and Conduct Review Committee, will succeed Bill as Board Chair following our upcoming Annual Meeting in May. Scott brings an exceptional level of expertise and experience to his new role. I look forward to working with Scott as we build Sun Life for the future.\n\nWe announced a 20% increase to our common share dividend , reinforcing our commitment to provide strong returns to shareholders.\n\nWe effectively managed capital with more than 10 strategic transactions. This included the acquisitions of PinnacleCare and Crescent Capital, our agreement to acquire DentaQuest (scheduled for completion in 2022), the IPO of our India asset management joint venture, and an increase in our investment in Bowtie, Hong Kong's first virtual insurer.\n\nIn Q3 2021, we announced a new medium-term underlying Return on equity (ROE) objective of 16%+, and for the year we trended well towards our objective, generating an underlying ROE of 15.4%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk Universe\n\nAs a large financial services organization operating in a complex inGLYPH<df00>ustry, the Company encounters a variety of risks anGLYPH<df00> uncertainties. We face risks in formulating our business strategy anGLYPH<df00> business objectives, in carrying on our business activities in the pursuit of our strategy anGLYPH<df00> objectives, anGLYPH<df00> from external factors such as changes in the economic, political, competitive, regulatory anGLYPH<df00> environmental lanGLYPH<df00>scapes. We are subject to financial anGLYPH<df00> insurance risks that are connecteGLYPH<df00> to our liabilities anGLYPH<df00> with the management anGLYPH<df00> performance of our assets, incluGLYPH<df00>ing how we match returns from assets with the payment of liabilities to our Clients.

The Risk Framework covers all risks anGLYPH<df00> these have been groupeGLYPH<df00> into six major categories: creGLYPH<df00>it, market, insurance, business anGLYPH<df00> strategic, operational anGLYPH<df00> liquiGLYPH<df00>ity risks. The Risk Framework sets out the key risk management processes in the areas of risk: appetite, iGLYPH<df00>entification, measurement, management, monitoring anGLYPH<df00> reporting. The Risk Framework sets out both qualitative anGLYPH<df00> quantitative measures anGLYPH<df00> processes to control the risk the Company will bear in respect of each of these categories of risk anGLYPH<df00> in aggregate.\n\n## 4.

In particular, our risk appetite supports the pursuit of shareholGLYPH<df00>er value while ensuring that the Company's ability to pay claims anGLYPH<df00> fulfill policyholGLYPH<df00>er commitments is not compromiseGLYPH<df00>.\n\nThe Company's risk appetite is the primary mechanism to operationalize its risk philosophy anGLYPH<df00> the bounGLYPH<df00>aries of permissible risk-taking across the enterprise. It ensures that business activities are assesseGLYPH<df00> against performance criteria that are appropriately risk-aGLYPH<df00>justeGLYPH<df00>. Our risk appetite supports the objective of maintaining aGLYPH<df00>equate capital, managing return on equity, managing earnings volatility, managing operational risk anGLYPH<df00> managing liquiGLYPH<df00>ity. To accomplish this, our risk appetite incluGLYPH<df00>es a wiGLYPH<df00>e array of qualitative anGLYPH<df00> quantitative stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s that reflect the Company's overall risk management principles anGLYPH<df00> values.\n\nWe generally accept GLYPH<df00>iversifiable risks anGLYPH<df00> utilize risk pooling to create portfolios with relatively low liability volatility. We take risk where we have internal expertise such as actuarial, unGLYPH<df00>erwriting, claims management, investment or GLYPH<df00>istribution or where reinsurance partners are able to supplement our internal expertise. We prefer risks where it is possible to GLYPH<df00>iversify across various segments incluGLYPH<df00>ing proGLYPH<df00>ucts, geographies, GLYPH<df00>istribution channels or asset classes in orGLYPH<df00>er to maximize GLYPH<df00>iversification opportunities.\n\n55",

Real estate price risk may arise from external market conGLYPH<df00>itions, inaGLYPH<df00>equate property analysis, inaGLYPH<df00>equate insurance coverage, inappropriate real estate appraisals, or from environmental risk exposures. We holGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>irect real estate investments that support general account liabilities anGLYPH<df00> surplus, anGLYPH<df00> fluctuations in value will impact our profitability anGLYPH<df00> financial position.

This risk may arise from a variety of sources such as foreign currency transactions anGLYPH<df00> services, foreign currency heGLYPH<df00>ging, investments GLYPH<df00>enominateGLYPH<df00> in foreign currencies, investments in foreign subsiGLYPH<df00>iaries anGLYPH<df00> net income from foreign operations. Changes or volatility in foreign exchange rates, incluGLYPH<df00>ing a change to currencies that are fixeGLYPH<df00> in value to another currency, coulGLYPH<df00> aGLYPH<df00>versely affect our financial conGLYPH<df00>ition anGLYPH<df00> results of operations.\n\nAs an international proviGLYPH<df00>er of financial services, we operate in a number of countries, with revenues anGLYPH<df00> expenses GLYPH<df00>enominateGLYPH<df00> in several local currencies. In each country in which we operate, we generally maintain the currency profile of assets to match the currency of aggregate liabilities anGLYPH<df00> requireGLYPH<df00> surplus. This approach proviGLYPH<df00>es an operational heGLYPH<df00>ge against GLYPH<df00>isruptions in local operations causeGLYPH<df00> by currency fluctuations. Foreign currency GLYPH<df00>erivative contracts such as currency swaps anGLYPH<df00> forwarGLYPH<df00>s are useGLYPH<df00> as a risk management tool to manage the currency exposure in accorGLYPH<df00>ance with our Asset Liability Management Policy.

A strengthening in the local currency of our foreign operations relative to the CanaGLYPH<df00>ian GLYPH<df00>ollar woulGLYPH<df00> have the opposite effect.

Changes in these positions GLYPH<df00>ue to new sales or maturities, asset purchases/sales, or other management actions coulGLYPH<df00> result in material changes to these reporteGLYPH<df00> sensitivities.

There is a possibility of rate increases or renegotiation of some of the legacy reinsurance contracts by a few of our reinsurers, as they continue to review anGLYPH<df00> optimize their business moGLYPH<df00>els. In aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition, changes to the regulatory treatment of reinsurance arrangements coulGLYPH<df00> have an aGLYPH<df00>verse impact on our capital position.\n\nWe have an Insurance Risk Policy anGLYPH<df00> an Investment & CreGLYPH<df00>it Risk Policy approveGLYPH<df00> by the Risk Committee, which set acceptance criteria anGLYPH<df00> processes to monitor the level of reinsurance ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to any single reinsurer.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nIn the normal course of business, we are engageGLYPH<df00> in a variety of financial arrangements. The principal purposes of these arrangements are to earn management fees anGLYPH<df00> aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>itional spreaGLYPH<df00> on a matcheGLYPH<df00> book of business anGLYPH<df00> to reGLYPH<df00>uce financing costs.\n\nWhile most of these activities are reflecteGLYPH<df00> on our balance sheet with respect to assets anGLYPH<df00> liabilities, certain of them are either not recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> on our balance sheet or are recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> on our balance sheet in amounts that GLYPH<df00>iffer from the full contract or notional amounts. The types of off-balance sheet activities we unGLYPH<df00>ertake primarily incluGLYPH<df00>e asset securitizations anGLYPH<df00> securities lenGLYPH<df00>ing.\n\n## Asset Securitizations\n\nIn the past, we solGLYPH<df00> mortgage or bonGLYPH<df00> assets to non-consoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> structureGLYPH<df00> entities, which may also purchase investment assets from thirGLYPH<df00> parties.

The choice of best estimate assumptions takes into account current circumstances, past experience GLYPH<df00>ata (Company anGLYPH<df00>/or inGLYPH<df00>ustry), the relationship of past to expecteGLYPH<df00> future experience, anti-selection, the relationship among assumptions, anGLYPH<df00> other relevant factors. For assumptions on economic matters, the assets supporting the liabilities anGLYPH<df00> the expecteGLYPH<df00> policy for asset-liability management are relevant factors.\n\n## Margins for AGLYPH<df00>verse Deviations\n\nThe appropriate level of margin for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations on an assumption is guiGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice. For most assumptions, the stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00> range of margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations is 5% to 20% of the best estimate assumption, anGLYPH<df00> the actuary chooses from within that range baseGLYPH<df00> on a number of consiGLYPH<df00>erations relateGLYPH<df00> to the uncertainty in the GLYPH<df00>etermination of the best estimate assumption. The level of uncertainty, anGLYPH<df00> hence the margin chosen, will vary by assumption anGLYPH<df00> by line of business anGLYPH<df00> other factors. ConsiGLYPH<df00>erations that woulGLYPH<df00> tenGLYPH<df00> to inGLYPH<df00>icate a choice of margin at the high enGLYPH<df00> of the range incluGLYPH<df00>e:\n\n- \u00b7 The statistical creGLYPH<df00>ibility of the Company's experience is too low to be the primary source of GLYPH<df00>ata for choosing the best estimate assumption.\n- \u00b7 Future experience is GLYPH<df00>ifficult to estimate.\n- \u00b7 The cohort of risks lacks homogeneity.\n- \u00b7 Operational risks aGLYPH<df00>versely impact the ability to estimate the best estimate assumption.\n- \u00b7 Past experience may not be representative of future experience anGLYPH<df00> the experience may GLYPH<df00>eteriorate.\n\nProvisions for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations in future interest rates are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by testing a number of scenarios of future interest rates, some of which are prescribeGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice, anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>etermining the liability baseGLYPH<df00> on the range of possible outcomes. A scenario of future interest rates incluGLYPH<df00>es, for each forecast perioGLYPH<df00> between the statement of financial position GLYPH<df00>ate anGLYPH<df00> the last liability cash flow, interest rates for risk-free assets, premiums for asset GLYPH<df00>efault, rates of inflation, anGLYPH<df00> an investment strategy consistent with the Company's investment policy. The starting point for all future interest rate scenarios is consistent with the current market environment. If few scenarios are testeGLYPH<df00>, the liability woulGLYPH<df00> be at least as great as the largest of the outcomes. If many scenarios are testeGLYPH<df00>, the liability woulGLYPH<df00> be within a range GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> by the average of the outcomes that are above the 60th percentile of the range of outcomes anGLYPH<df00> the corresponGLYPH<df00>ing average for the 80th percentile.\n\nProvisions for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations in future equity returns are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by scenario testing or by applying margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations. In blocks of business where the valuation of liabilities uses scenario testing of future equity returns, the liability woulGLYPH<df00> be within a range GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> by the average of the outcomes that are above the 60th percentile of the range of outcomes anGLYPH<df00> the corresponGLYPH<df00>ing average for the 80th percentile. In blocks of business where the valuation of liabilities GLYPH<df00>oes not use scenario testing of future equity returns, the margin for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations on common share GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>enGLYPH<df00>s is between 5% anGLYPH<df00> 20%, anGLYPH<df00> the margin for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations on capital gains woulGLYPH<df00> be 20% plus an assumption that those assets reGLYPH<df00>uce in value by 20% to 50% at the time when the reGLYPH<df00>uction is most aGLYPH<df00>verse. A 30% reGLYPH<df00>uction is appropriate for a GLYPH<df00>iversifieGLYPH<df00> portfolio of North American common shares anGLYPH<df00>, for other portfolios, the appropriate reGLYPH<df00>uction GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>s on the volatility of the portfolio relative to a GLYPH<df00>iversifieGLYPH<df00> portfolio of North American common shares.\n\nIn choosing margins, we ensure that, when taken one at a time, each margin is reasonable with respect to the unGLYPH<df00>erlying best estimate assumption anGLYPH<df00> the extent of uncertainty present in making that assumption, anGLYPH<df00> also that, in aggregate, the cumulative impact of the margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations is reasonable with respect to the total amount of our insurance contract liabilities. Our margins are generally stable over time anGLYPH<df00> are generally only reviseGLYPH<df00> to reflect changes in the level of uncertainty in the best estimate assumptions. Our margins tenGLYPH<df00> to be at the miGLYPH<df00>-range, with the higher range useGLYPH<df00> where there is greater uncertainty. When consiGLYPH<df00>ering the aggregate impact of margins, the actuary assesses the consistency of margins for each assumption across each block of business to ensure there is no GLYPH<df00>ouble counting or omission anGLYPH<df00> to avoiGLYPH<df00> choosing margins that might be mutually exclusive. In particular, the actuary chooses similar margins for blocks of business with similar characteristics, anGLYPH<df00> also chooses margins that are consistent with other assumptions, incluGLYPH<df00>ing assumptions about economic factors. The actuary is guiGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice in making these professional juGLYPH<df00>gments about the reasonableness of margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations.\n\nThe best estimate assumptions anGLYPH<df00> margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations are revieweGLYPH<df00> at least annually anGLYPH<df00> revisions are maGLYPH<df00>e when appropriate. The choice of assumptions unGLYPH<df00>erlying the valuation of insurance contract liabilities is subject to external actuarial peer review.\n\n## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nSignificant factors affecting the GLYPH<df00>etermination of policyholGLYPH<df00>ers' benefits, the methoGLYPH<df00>ology by which they are GLYPH<df00>etermineGLYPH<df00>, their significance to the Company's financial conGLYPH<df00>ition anGLYPH<df00> results of operations are GLYPH<df00>escribeGLYPH<df00> below.\n\n## Non-fixeGLYPH<df00> Income Market Movements\n\nWe are exposeGLYPH<df00> to equity markets through our segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00> proGLYPH<df00>ucts (incluGLYPH<df00>ing variable annuities) that proviGLYPH<df00>e guarantees linkeGLYPH<df00> to unGLYPH<df00>erlying funGLYPH<df00> performance anGLYPH<df00> through insurance proGLYPH<df00>ucts where the insurance contract liabilities are supporteGLYPH<df00> by non-fixeGLYPH<df00> income assets.\n\nFor segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00> proGLYPH<df00>ucts (incluGLYPH<df00>ing variable annuities), we have implementeGLYPH<df00> heGLYPH<df00>ging programs involving the use of GLYPH<df00>erivative instruments to mitigate a large portion of the equity market risk associateGLYPH<df00> with the guarantees.

These proGLYPH<df00>ucts generally have minimum interest rate guarantees.\n\nHeGLYPH<df00>ging programs are in place to help mitigate the impact of interest rate movements.\n\n## Mortality\n\nMortality refers to the rates at which GLYPH<df00>eath occurs for GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> groups of people. Life insurance mortality assumptions are generally baseGLYPH<df00> on the past five to ten years of experience. Our experience is combineGLYPH<df00> with inGLYPH<df00>ustry experience where our own experience is insufficient to be statistically valiGLYPH<df00>. AssumeGLYPH<df00> mortality rates for life insurance anGLYPH<df00> annuity contracts incluGLYPH<df00>e assumptions about future mortality improvement baseGLYPH<df00> on recent trenGLYPH<df00>s in population mortality anGLYPH<df00> our outlook for future trenGLYPH<df00>s.\n\n## MorbiGLYPH<df00>ity\n\nMorbiGLYPH<df00>ity refers to both the rates of acciGLYPH<df00>ent or sickness anGLYPH<df00> the rates of recovery therefrom. Most of our GLYPH<df00>isability insurance is marketeGLYPH<df00> on a group basis. We offer critical illness policies on an inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual basis in CanaGLYPH<df00>a anGLYPH<df00> Asia, long-term care on an inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual basis in CanaGLYPH<df00>a, anGLYPH<df00> meGLYPH<df00>ical stop-loss insurance is offereGLYPH<df00> on a group basis in the U.S. In CanaGLYPH<df00>a, group morbiGLYPH<df00>ity assumptions are baseGLYPH<df00> on our five-year average experience, moGLYPH<df00>ifieGLYPH<df00> to reflect any emerging trenGLYPH<df00> in recovery rates. For long-term care anGLYPH<df00> critical illness insurance, assumptions are GLYPH<df00>evelopeGLYPH<df00> in collaboration with our reinsurers anGLYPH<df00> are largely baseGLYPH<df00> on their experience. In the U.S., our experience is useGLYPH<df00> for both meGLYPH<df00>ical stop-loss anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isability assumptions, with some consiGLYPH<df00>eration of inGLYPH<df00>ustry experience.\n\n## Policy Termination Rates\n\nPolicyholGLYPH<df00>ers may allow their policies to lapse prior to the enGLYPH<df00> of the contractual coverage perioGLYPH<df00> by choosing not to continue to pay premiums or by surrenGLYPH<df00>ering their policy for the cash surrenGLYPH<df00>er value. Assumptions for lapse experience on life insurance are generally baseGLYPH<df00> on our five-year average experience. Lapse rates vary by plan, age at issue, methoGLYPH<df00> of premium payment, anGLYPH<df00> policy GLYPH<df00>uration.\n\n## Premium Payment Patterns\n\nFor universal life contracts, it is necessary to set assumptions about premium payment patterns. StuGLYPH<df00>ies prepareGLYPH<df00> by inGLYPH<df00>ustry or the actuarial profession are useGLYPH<df00> for proGLYPH<df00>ucts where our experience is insufficient to be statistically valiGLYPH<df00>. Premium payment patterns usually vary by plan, age at issue, methoGLYPH<df00> of premium payment, anGLYPH<df00> policy GLYPH<df00>uration.\n\n## Expense\n\nFuture policy-relateGLYPH<df00> expenses incluGLYPH<df00>e the costs of premium collection, claims aGLYPH<df00>juGLYPH<df00>ication anGLYPH<df00> processing, actuarial calculations, preparation anGLYPH<df00> mailing of policy statements, anGLYPH<df00> relateGLYPH<df00> inGLYPH<df00>irect expenses anGLYPH<df00> overheaGLYPH<df00>. Expense assumptions are mainly baseGLYPH<df00> on our recent experience using an internal expense allocation methoGLYPH<df00>ology.

Application of GLYPH<df00>ifferent assumptions may result in GLYPH<df00>ifferent measurement of the insurance contract liabilities. There is insurance risk from the uncertainty of proGLYPH<df00>uct performance GLYPH<df00>ue to GLYPH<df00>ifferences between the actual experience anGLYPH<df00> expecteGLYPH<df00> experience.

We also operate mutual funGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> investment management businesses, primarily in CanaGLYPH<df00>a, the U.S., anGLYPH<df00> Asia.\n\n## Statement of Compliance\n\nWe prepareGLYPH<df00> our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Financial Statements in accorGLYPH<df00>ance with International Financial Reporting StanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s (\"IFRS\") as issueGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> aGLYPH<df00>opteGLYPH<df00> by the International Accounting StanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s BoarGLYPH<df00> (\"IASB\"). Our accounting policies have been applieGLYPH<df00> consistently within our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Financial Statements.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nOur ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Financial Position are presenteGLYPH<df00> in the orGLYPH<df00>er of liquiGLYPH<df00>ity anGLYPH<df00> each statement of financial position line item incluGLYPH<df00>es both current anGLYPH<df00> non-current balances, as applicable.\n\nWe have GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> our reportable business segments anGLYPH<df00> the amounts GLYPH<df00>iscloseGLYPH<df00> for those segments baseGLYPH<df00> on our management structure anGLYPH<df00> the manner in which our internal financial reporting is conGLYPH<df00>ucteGLYPH<df00>.

We have establisheGLYPH<df00> proceGLYPH<df00>ures to ensure that our accounting policies are applieGLYPH<df00> consistently anGLYPH<df00> that the processes for changing methoGLYPH<df00>ologies for GLYPH<df00>etermining estimates are controlleGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> occur in an appropriate anGLYPH<df00> systematic manner.\n\n## Use of Estimates anGLYPH<df00> Assumptions\n\nThe preparation of our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Financial Statements requires us to make estimates anGLYPH<df00> assumptions that affect the application of our policies anGLYPH<df00> the reporteGLYPH<df00> amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue anGLYPH<df00> expenses. Key sources of estimation uncertainty incluGLYPH<df00>e the measurement of insurance contract liabilities anGLYPH<df00> investment contract liabilities, GLYPH<df00>etermination of fair value, impairment of financial instruments, GLYPH<df00>etermination anGLYPH<df00> impairment of gooGLYPH<df00>will anGLYPH<df00> intangible assets, GLYPH<df00>etermination of provisions anGLYPH<df00> liabilities for pension plans, other post-retirement benefits, income taxes, anGLYPH<df00> the GLYPH<df00>etermination of fair value of share-baseGLYPH<df00> payments.

We also use juGLYPH<df00>gment when applying accounting policies anGLYPH<df00> when GLYPH<df00>etermining the classification of insurance contracts, investment contracts anGLYPH<df00> service contracts; the substance of whether our relationship with a structureGLYPH<df00> entity, subsiGLYPH<df00>iary, joint venture or associate constitutes control, joint control or significant influence; functional currencies; contingencies; acquisitions; GLYPH<df00>eferreGLYPH<df00> income tax assets; anGLYPH<df00> the GLYPH<df00>etermination of cash generating unit (\"CGU\").\n\n## COVID-19 PanGLYPH<df00>emic ConsiGLYPH<df00>erations\n\nIn early 2020, the worlGLYPH<df00> was impacteGLYPH<df00> by COVID-19, which was GLYPH<df00>eclareGLYPH<df00> a global panGLYPH<df00>emic by the WorlGLYPH<df00> Health Organization. The overall impact of the COVID-19 panGLYPH<df00>emic is still uncertain anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ent on the progression of the virus anGLYPH<df00> on actions taken by governments, businesses anGLYPH<df00> inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>uals, which coulGLYPH<df00> vary by country anGLYPH<df00> result in GLYPH<df00>iffering outcomes.\n\nThe application of our accounting policies requires estimates, assumptions anGLYPH<df00> juGLYPH<df00>gments as they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. We have establisheGLYPH<df00> proceGLYPH<df00>ures to ensure that our accounting policies are applieGLYPH<df00> consistently anGLYPH<df00> that the processes for changing methoGLYPH<df00>ologies for GLYPH<df00>etermining estimates are controlleGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> occur in an appropriate anGLYPH<df00> systematic manner.

Interests in controlleGLYPH<df00> entities helGLYPH<df00> by external parties are reporteGLYPH<df00> as non-controlling interests (\"NCI\").\n\nWe control an entity when we have power over an entity, exposure to or rights to variable returns from our involvement with an entity, anGLYPH<df00> the ability to affect our returns through our power over an entity. Power exists when we have rights that give us the ability to GLYPH<df00>irect the relevant activities, which are those activities that coulGLYPH<df00> significantly affect the entity's returns. Power can be obtaineGLYPH<df00> through voting rights or other contractual arrangements. JuGLYPH<df00>gment is requireGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine the relevant activities anGLYPH<df00> which party has power over these activities. When we have power over anGLYPH<df00> variable returns from an entity, incluGLYPH<df00>ing an investment funGLYPH<df00> that we manage, we also apply significant juGLYPH<df00>gment in GLYPH<df00>etermining whether we are acting as a principal or agent.

Joint control is the contractually agreeGLYPH<df00> sharing of control anGLYPH<df00> exists only when the GLYPH<df00>ecisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Associates are entities over which SLF Inc. or its subsiGLYPH<df00>iaries are able to exercise significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial anGLYPH<df00> operating policy GLYPH<df00>ecisions of an investee but not have control or joint control over those GLYPH<df00>ecisions. Significant influence is generally presumeGLYPH<df00> to exist when SLF Inc. or its subsiGLYPH<df00>iaries holGLYPH<df00>s greater than 20% of the voting power of the investee but GLYPH<df00>oes not have control or joint control. The equity methoGLYPH<df00> is useGLYPH<df00> to account for our interests in joint ventures anGLYPH<df00> associates. A joint operation exists when SLF Inc., or one of its subsiGLYPH<df00>iaries, has joint control of an arrangement that gives it rights to the assets anGLYPH<df00> obligations for the liabilities of the operation, rather than the net assets of the arrangement.

Fair value is measureGLYPH<df00> using the assumptions that market participants woulGLYPH<df00> use when pricing an asset or liability. We GLYPH<df00>etermine fair value by using quoteGLYPH<df00> prices in active markets for iGLYPH<df00>entical or similar assets or liabilities. When quoteGLYPH<df00> prices in active markets are not available, fair value is GLYPH<df00>etermineGLYPH<df00> using valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs.

Once an impairment loss on a GLYPH<df00>ebt security classifieGLYPH<df00> as AFS is recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to income, any reversal of impairment loss through income occurs only when the recovery in fair value is objectively relateGLYPH<df00> to an event occurring after the impairment was recognizeGLYPH<df00>.

GooGLYPH<df00>will is assesseGLYPH<df00> for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that may result in the recoverable amount of a CGU or a group of CGUs falling below its carrying value. A CGU is the smallest iGLYPH<df00>entifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely inGLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ent of cash inflows from other groups of assets.

IFRS 17 establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isclosure of insurance contracts. IFRS 17 requires entities to measure insurance contract liabilities at their current fulfillment values using one of three measurement moGLYPH<df00>els, GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ing on the nature of the contract. IFRS 17 is to be applieGLYPH<df00> retrospectively to each group of insurance contracts unless impracticable. If, anGLYPH<df00> only if, it is impracticable to apply IFRS 17 retrospectively for a group of insurance contracts, an entity shall apply IFRS 17 using a moGLYPH<df00>ifieGLYPH<df00> retrospective approach or a fair value approach. IFRS 17 will affect how we account for our insurance contracts anGLYPH<df00> how we report our financial performance in our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Operations. We are currently assessing the impact of IFRS 17. We anticipate it will have an impact on the timing of earnings recognition anGLYPH<df00> the presentation anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isclosure of financial results in our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Financial Statements.\n\nIn July 2014, the IASB issueGLYPH<df00> the final version of IFRS 9, which replaces IAS 39. IFRS 9 incluGLYPH<df00>es guiGLYPH<df00>ance on the classification anGLYPH<df00> measurement of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets, anGLYPH<df00> heGLYPH<df00>ge accounting. Financial asset classification is baseGLYPH<df00> on the cash flow characteristics anGLYPH<df00> the business moGLYPH<df00>el in which an asset is helGLYPH<df00>. The classification GLYPH<df00>etermines how a financial instrument is accounteGLYPH<df00> for anGLYPH<df00> measureGLYPH<df00>. IFRS 9 also introGLYPH<df00>uces an impairment moGLYPH<df00>el for financial instruments not measureGLYPH<df00> at fair value through profit or loss that requires recognition of expecteGLYPH<df00> losses at initial recognition of a financial instrument anGLYPH<df00> the recognition of full lifetime expecteGLYPH<df00> losses if certain criteria are met. In aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition, a new moGLYPH<df00>el for heGLYPH<df00>ge accounting was introGLYPH<df00>uceGLYPH<df00> to achieve better alignment with risk management activities. This stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00> is effective for annual perioGLYPH<df00>s beginning on or after January 1, 2018. In October 2017, the IASB issueGLYPH<df00> narrow-scope amenGLYPH<df00>ments to IFRS 9. The amenGLYPH<df00>ments clarify the classification of certain prepayable financial assets anGLYPH<df00> the accounting of financial liabilities following moGLYPH<df00>ification. The amenGLYPH<df00>ments are effective for annual perioGLYPH<df00>s beginning on or after January 1, 2019. However, pursuant to the aforementioneGLYPH<df00> amenGLYPH<df00>ments to IFRS 4, we electeGLYPH<df00> the GLYPH<df00>eferral approach permitteGLYPH<df00> unGLYPH<df00>er IFRS 4 to continue to apply IAS 39. We are currently assessing the impact that IFRS 9, along with these amenGLYPH<df00>ments, will have on our ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Financial Statements.\n\n## 3.

Our valuation processes for these assets are as follows:\n\nThe fair value of investment properties are baseGLYPH<df00> on the results of appraisals performeGLYPH<df00> annually anGLYPH<df00> revieweGLYPH<df00> quarterly for material changes. The valuation methoGLYPH<df00>ology useGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine the fair value is in accorGLYPH<df00>ance with the stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of the Appraisal Institute of CanaGLYPH<df00>a, the U.S., anGLYPH<df00> the UK. Investment properties are appraiseGLYPH<df00> externally at least once every three years. Investment properties not appraiseGLYPH<df00> externally in a given year are revieweGLYPH<df00> by qualifieGLYPH<df00> appraisers. A management committee, incluGLYPH<df00>ing investment professionals, reviews the fair value of investment properties for overall reasonability.\n\nThe fair value of Debt securities is generally obtaineGLYPH<df00> by external pricing services. We obtain an unGLYPH<df00>erstanGLYPH<df00>ing of inputs anGLYPH<df00> valuation methoGLYPH<df00>s useGLYPH<df00> by external pricing services.

Therefore, the shaGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> text anGLYPH<df00> tables in our MD&A are an integral part of these ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Financial Statements.\n\nWe use GLYPH<df00>erivative instruments to manage market risks relateGLYPH<df00> to equity market, interest rate anGLYPH<df00> currency fluctuations anGLYPH<df00> in replication strategies for permissible investments. We GLYPH<df00>o not engage in speculative investment in GLYPH<df00>erivatives.

We use moGLYPH<df00>els anGLYPH<df00> techniques to measure the effectiveness of our risk management strategies.\n\n## 6.A CreGLYPH<df00>it Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nCreGLYPH<df00>it risk is the possibility of loss from amounts oweGLYPH<df00> by our borrowers or financial counterparties. We are subject to creGLYPH<df00>it risk in connection with issuers of securities helGLYPH<df00> in our investment portfolio, GLYPH<df00>ebtors, structureGLYPH<df00> securities, reinsurers, counterparties (incluGLYPH<df00>ing GLYPH<df00>erivative, repurchase agreement anGLYPH<df00> securities lenGLYPH<df00>ing counterparties), other financial institutions anGLYPH<df00> other entities. Losses may occur when a counterparty fails to make timely payments pursuant to the terms of the unGLYPH<df00>erlying contractual arrangement or when the counterparty's creGLYPH<df00>it rating or risk profile otherwise GLYPH<df00>eteriorates. CreGLYPH<df00>it risk can also arise in connection with GLYPH<df00>eterioration in the value of, or ability to realize, any unGLYPH<df00>erlying security that may be useGLYPH<df00> as collateral for the GLYPH<df00>ebt obligation. CreGLYPH<df00>it risk can occur as a result of broaGLYPH<df00> economic conGLYPH<df00>itions, challenges within specific sectors of the economy, or from issues affecting inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual companies. Events that result in GLYPH<df00>efaults, impairments or GLYPH<df00>owngraGLYPH<df00>es of the securities in our investment portfolio woulGLYPH<df00> cause the Company to recorGLYPH<df00> realizeGLYPH<df00> or unrealizeGLYPH<df00> losses anGLYPH<df00> may cause an increase in our provisions for asset GLYPH<df00>efault, aGLYPH<df00>versely impacting earnings.\n\n## CreGLYPH<df00>it Risk Management Governance anGLYPH<df00> Control\n\nWe employ a wiGLYPH<df00>e range of creGLYPH<df00>it risk management practices anGLYPH<df00> controls, as outlineGLYPH<df00> below:\n\n- \u00b7 CreGLYPH<df00>it risk governance practices are in place, incluGLYPH<df00>ing inGLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ent monitoring anGLYPH<df00> review anGLYPH<df00> reporting to senior management anGLYPH<df00> the Risk Committee.\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite limits have been establisheGLYPH<df00> for creGLYPH<df00>it risk.\n- \u00b7 Income anGLYPH<df00> regulatory capital sensitivities are monitoreGLYPH<df00>, manageGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> reporteGLYPH<df00> against pre-establisheGLYPH<df00> risk limits.\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive Investment anGLYPH<df00> CreGLYPH<df00>it Risk Management Policy, guiGLYPH<df00>elines anGLYPH<df00> practices are in place.\n- \u00b7 Specific investment GLYPH<df00>iversification requirements are in place, such as GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> investment limits for asset class, geography, anGLYPH<df00> inGLYPH<df00>ustry.\n- \u00b7 Risk-baseGLYPH<df00> creGLYPH<df00>it portfolio, counterparty, anGLYPH<df00> sector exposure limits have been establisheGLYPH<df00>.\n- \u00b7 ManGLYPH<df00>atory use of creGLYPH<df00>it quality ratings for portfolio investments has been establisheGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> is revieweGLYPH<df00> regularly.

The creGLYPH<df00>it exposure for GLYPH<df00>ebt securities may be increaseGLYPH<df00> to the extent that the amounts recovereGLYPH<df00> from GLYPH<df00>efault are insufficient to satisfy the actuarial liability cash flows that the assets are intenGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to support.\n\nThe positive fair value of GLYPH<df00>erivative assets is useGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine the creGLYPH<df00>it risk exposure if the counterparties were to GLYPH<df00>efault. The creGLYPH<df00>it risk exposure is the cost of replacing, at current market rates, all GLYPH<df00>erivative contracts with a positive fair value. AGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>itionally, we have creGLYPH<df00>it exposure to items not on the ConsoliGLYPH<df00>ateGLYPH<df00> Statements of Financial Position as follows:\n\n| As at December 31,       | 2021     | 2020     |\n|--------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Off-balance she et item: |          |          |\n| Loan commitments (1)     | $  2,402 | $  1,890 |\n\n## 6.A.ii Right of Offset anGLYPH<df00> Collateral\n\nWe invest in financial assets which may be secureGLYPH<df00> by real estate properties, pools of financial assets, thirGLYPH<df00>-party financial guarantees, creGLYPH<df00>it insurance, anGLYPH<df00> other arrangements.\n\nFor OTC GLYPH<df00>erivatives, collateral is collecteGLYPH<df00> from anGLYPH<df00> pleGLYPH<df00>geGLYPH<df00> to counterparties to manage creGLYPH<df00>it exposure accorGLYPH<df00>ing to the CreGLYPH<df00>it Support Annex (\"CSA\"), which forms part of the International Swaps anGLYPH<df00> Derivatives Association's (\"ISDA\") master agreements. It is common practice to execute a CSA in conjunction with an ISDA master agreement. UnGLYPH<df00>er the ISDA master agreements for OTC GLYPH<df00>erivatives, we have a right of offset in the event of GLYPH<df00>efault, insolvency, bankruptcy, or other early termination. In the orGLYPH<df00>inary course of business, bilateral OTC exposures unGLYPH<df00>er these agreements are substantially mitigateGLYPH<df00> through associateGLYPH<df00> collateral agreements with a majority of our counterparties.\n\nFor exchange-traGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>erivatives subject to GLYPH<df00>erivative clearing agreements with the exchanges anGLYPH<df00> clearinghouses, there is no provision for set-off at GLYPH<df00>efault. Initial margin is excluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> from the table below as it woulGLYPH<df00> become part of a pooleGLYPH<df00> settlement process.\n\nFor repurchase agreements anGLYPH<df00> reverse repurchase agreements, assets are solGLYPH<df00> or purchaseGLYPH<df00> with a commitment to resell or repurchase at a future GLYPH<df00>ate. AGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>itional collateral may be pleGLYPH<df00>geGLYPH<df00> to or collecteGLYPH<df00> from counterparties to manage creGLYPH<df00>it exposure accorGLYPH<df00>ing to bilateral repurchase or reverse repurchase agreements.

6.A.iii Concentration Risk\n\nConcentrations of creGLYPH<df00>it risk arise from exposures to a single GLYPH<df00>ebtor, a group of relateGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>ebtors, or groups of GLYPH<df00>ebtors that have similar creGLYPH<df00>it risk characteristics, such as groups of GLYPH<df00>ebtors in the same economic or geographic regions or in similar inGLYPH<df00>ustries. RelateGLYPH<df00> issuers may have similar economic characteristics so that their ability to meet contractual obligations may be impacteGLYPH<df00> similarly by changes in the economic or political conGLYPH<df00>itions. We manage this risk by appropriately GLYPH<df00>iversifying our investment portfolio through the use of concentration limits.

We employ a portfolio monitoring process to iGLYPH<df00>entify assets or groups of assets that have objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment, having experienceGLYPH<df00> a loss event or events that have an impact on the estimateGLYPH<df00> future cash flows of the asset or group of assets. There are inherent risks anGLYPH<df00> uncertainties in our evaluation of assets or groups of assets for objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment, incluGLYPH<df00>ing both internal anGLYPH<df00> external factors such as general economic conGLYPH<df00>itions, issuers' financial conGLYPH<df00>itions anGLYPH<df00> prospects for economic recovery, market interest rates, unforeseen events which affect one or more issuers or inGLYPH<df00>ustry sectors, anGLYPH<df00> portfolio management parameters, incluGLYPH<df00>ing asset mix, interest rate risk, portfolio GLYPH<df00>iversification, GLYPH<df00>uration matching, anGLYPH<df00> greater than expecteGLYPH<df00> liquiGLYPH<df00>ity neeGLYPH<df00>s. All of these factors coulGLYPH<df00> impact our evaluation of an asset or group of assets for objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment.\n\nManagement exercises consiGLYPH<df00>erable juGLYPH<df00>gment in assessing for objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment anGLYPH<df00>, baseGLYPH<df00> on its assessment, classifies specific assets as either performing or into one of the following creGLYPH<df00>it quality lists:\n\n\"Monitor List\" - the timely collection of all contractually specifieGLYPH<df00> cash flows is reasonably assureGLYPH<df00>, but changes in issuer-specific facts anGLYPH<df00> circumstances require monitoring. No impairment charge is recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> for unrealizeGLYPH<df00> losses on assets relateGLYPH<df00> to these GLYPH<df00>ebtors.\n\n\"Watch List\" - the timely collection of all contractually specifieGLYPH<df00> cash flows is reasonably assureGLYPH<df00>, but changes in issuer-specific facts anGLYPH<df00> circumstances require heighteneGLYPH<df00> monitoring. An asset is moveGLYPH<df00> from the Monitor List to the Watch List when changes in issuer-specific facts anGLYPH<df00> circumstances increase the possibility that a security may experience a loss event on an imminent basis. No impairment charge is recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> for unrealizeGLYPH<df00> losses on assets relateGLYPH<df00> to these GLYPH<df00>ebtors.\n\n\"ImpaireGLYPH<df00> List\" - the timely collection of all contractually specifieGLYPH<df00> cash flows is no longer reasonably assureGLYPH<df00>. For these investments that are classifieGLYPH<df00> as AFS or amortizeGLYPH<df00> cost, an impairment charge is recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> or the asset is solGLYPH<df00> anGLYPH<df00> a realizeGLYPH<df00> loss is recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> as a charge to income. Impairment charges anGLYPH<df00> realizeGLYPH<df00> losses are recorGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> on assets relateGLYPH<df00> to these GLYPH<df00>ebtors.\n\nOur approach to GLYPH<df00>etermining whether there is objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment varies by asset type. However, we have a process to ensure that in all instances where a GLYPH<df00>ecision has been maGLYPH<df00>e to sell an asset at a loss, the asset is impaireGLYPH<df00>.\n\n## Debt Securities\n\nObjective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment on GLYPH<df00>ebt securities involves an assessment of the issuer's ability to meet current anGLYPH<df00> future contractual interest anGLYPH<df00> principal payments. In GLYPH<df00>etermining whether GLYPH<df00>ebt securities have objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment, we employ a screening process. The process iGLYPH<df00>entifies securities in an unrealizeGLYPH<df00> loss position, with particular attention paiGLYPH<df00> to those securities whose fair value to amortizeGLYPH<df00> cost percentages have been less than 80% for an extenGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> perioGLYPH<df00> of time. Discrete creGLYPH<df00>it events, such as a ratings GLYPH<df00>owngraGLYPH<df00>e, are also useGLYPH<df00> to iGLYPH<df00>entify securities that may have objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment. The securities iGLYPH<df00>entifieGLYPH<df00> are then evaluateGLYPH<df00> baseGLYPH<df00> on issuer-specific facts anGLYPH<df00> circumstances, incluGLYPH<df00>ing an evaluation of the issuer's financial conGLYPH<df00>ition anGLYPH<df00> prospects for economic recovery, eviGLYPH<df00>ence of GLYPH<df00>ifficulty being experienceGLYPH<df00> by the issuer's parent or affiliate, anGLYPH<df00> management's assessment of the outlook for the issuer's inGLYPH<df00>ustry sector.\n\nManagement also assesses previously impaireGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>ebt securities whose fair value has recovereGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine whether the recovery is objectively relateGLYPH<df00> to an event occurring subsequent to the impairment loss that has an impact on the estimateGLYPH<df00> future cash flows of the asset.\n\nAsset-backeGLYPH<df00> securities are assesseGLYPH<df00> for objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment. Specifically, we perioGLYPH<df00>ically upGLYPH<df00>ate our best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security. In the event that there is an aGLYPH<df00>verse change in the expecteGLYPH<df00> cash flows, the asset is impaireGLYPH<df00>. Estimating future cash flows is a quantitative anGLYPH<df00> qualitative process that incorporates information receiveGLYPH<df00> from thirGLYPH<df00> parties, along with assumptions anGLYPH<df00> juGLYPH<df00>gments about the future performance of the unGLYPH<df00>erlying collateral. Losses incurreGLYPH<df00> on the respective mortgage-backeGLYPH<df00> securities portfolios are baseGLYPH<df00> on loss moGLYPH<df00>els using assumptions about key systematic risks, such as unemployment rates anGLYPH<df00> housing prices, anGLYPH<df00> loan-specific information such as GLYPH<df00>elinquency rates anGLYPH<df00> loan-to-value ratios.\n\n## Equity Securities anGLYPH<df00> Other InvesteGLYPH<df00> Assets\n\nObjective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment for equity securities anGLYPH<df00> investments in limiteGLYPH<df00> partnerships, segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00>s, anGLYPH<df00> mutual funGLYPH<df00>s involves an assessment of the prospect of recovering the cost of our investment. Instruments in an unrealizeGLYPH<df00> loss position are revieweGLYPH<df00> to GLYPH<df00>etermine if objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment exists. Objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment for these instruments incluGLYPH<df00>es, but is not limiteGLYPH<df00> to, the financial conGLYPH<df00>ition anGLYPH<df00> near-term prospects of the issuer, incluGLYPH<df00>ing information about significant changes with aGLYPH<df00>verse effects that have taken place in the technological, market, economic, or legal environment in which the issuer operates, anGLYPH<df00> a significant or prolongeGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>ecline in the fair value of the instruments below their cost.\n\nWe apply presumptive impairment tests to GLYPH<df00>etermine whether there has been a significant or prolongeGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>ecline in the fair value of an instrument below its cost, anGLYPH<df00> unless extenuating circumstances exist, the instrument is consiGLYPH<df00>ereGLYPH<df00> to be impaireGLYPH<df00>.\n\n## Mortgages anGLYPH<df00> Loans\n\nObjective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment on mortgages anGLYPH<df00> loans involves an assessment of the borrower's ability to meet current anGLYPH<df00> future contractual interest anGLYPH<df00> principal payments. In GLYPH<df00>etermining whether objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment exists, we consiGLYPH<df00>er a number of factors incluGLYPH<df00>ing, but not limiteGLYPH<df00> to, the financial conGLYPH<df00>ition of the borrower anGLYPH<df00>, for collateral GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ent mortgages anGLYPH<df00> loans, the fair value of the collateral.\n\nMortgages anGLYPH<df00> loans causing concern are monitoreGLYPH<df00> closely anGLYPH<df00> evaluateGLYPH<df00> for objective eviGLYPH<df00>ence of impairment. For these mortgages anGLYPH<df00> loans, we review information that is appropriate to the circumstances, incluGLYPH<df00>ing recent operating GLYPH<df00>evelopments, strategy review, timelines for remeGLYPH<df00>iation, financial position of the borrower anGLYPH<df00>, for collateral-GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ent mortgages anGLYPH<df00> loans, the value of security as well as occupancy anGLYPH<df00> cash flow consiGLYPH<df00>erations.",

This risk can arise from general economic conGLYPH<df00>itions, unexpecteGLYPH<df00> increases in inflation, slower than anticipateGLYPH<df00> growth, or reGLYPH<df00>uction in proGLYPH<df00>uctivity leaGLYPH<df00>ing to increases in unit expenses. Expense risk occurs in proGLYPH<df00>ucts where we cannot or will not pass increaseGLYPH<df00> costs onto the Client anGLYPH<df00> will manifest itself in the form of a liability increase or a reGLYPH<df00>uction in expecteGLYPH<df00> future profits\n\nThe sensitivity of liabilities for insurance contracts to a 5% increase in unit expenses woulGLYPH<df00> result in a GLYPH<df00>ecrease in shareholGLYPH<df00>ers' net income anGLYPH<df00> equity of about $165 ($175 in 2020). These sensitivities reflect the impact of any applicable ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> reinsurance arrangements.\n\n## Expenses Risk Management Governance anGLYPH<df00> Control\n\nWe closely monitor expenses through an annual buGLYPH<df00>geting process anGLYPH<df00> ongoing monitoring of any expense gaps between unit expenses assumeGLYPH<df00> in pricing anGLYPH<df00> actual expenses.\n\n## 7.A.vi Reinsurance Risk\n\n## Risk Description\n\nWe purchase reinsurance for certain risks unGLYPH<df00>erwritten by our various insurance businesses. Reinsurance risk is the risk of financial loss GLYPH<df00>ue to aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>evelopments in reinsurance markets (for example, GLYPH<df00>iscontinuance or GLYPH<df00>iminution of reinsurance capacity, or an increase in the cost of reinsurance), insolvency of a reinsurer or inaGLYPH<df00>equate reinsurance coverage.\n\nChanges in reinsurance market conGLYPH<df00>itions, incluGLYPH<df00>ing actions taken by reinsurers to increase rates on existing anGLYPH<df00> new coverage anGLYPH<df00> our ability to obtain appropriate reinsurance, may aGLYPH<df00>versely impact the availability or cost of maintaining existing or securing new reinsurance capacity, with aGLYPH<df00>verse impacts on our business strategies, profitability anGLYPH<df00> financial position. There is a possibility of rate increases or renegotiation of some of the legacy reinsurance contracts by a few of our reinsurers, as they continue to review anGLYPH<df00> optimize their business moGLYPH<df00>els. In aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition, changes to the regulatory treatment of reinsurance arrangements coulGLYPH<df00> have an aGLYPH<df00>verse impact on our capital position.\n\n## Reinsurance Risk Management Governance anGLYPH<df00> Control\n\nWe have an Insurance Risk Policy anGLYPH<df00> an Investment & CreGLYPH<df00>it Risk Policy approveGLYPH<df00> by the Risk Committee, which set acceptance criteria anGLYPH<df00> processes to monitor the level of reinsurance ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to any single reinsurer. These policies also set minimum criteria for GLYPH<df00>etermining which reinsurance companies qualify as suitable reinsurance counterparties having the capability, expertise, governance practices anGLYPH<df00> financial capacity to assume the risks being consiGLYPH<df00>ereGLYPH<df00>. AGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>itionally, these policies require that all agreements incluGLYPH<df00>e provisions to allow action to be taken, such as recapture of ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> risk (at a potential cost to the Company), in the event that the reinsurer loses its legal ability to carry on business through insolvency or regulatory action. PerioGLYPH<df00>ic GLYPH<df00>ue GLYPH<df00>iligence is performeGLYPH<df00> on the reinsurance counterparties with which we GLYPH<df00>o business anGLYPH<df00> internal creGLYPH<df00>it assessments are performeGLYPH<df00> on reinsurance counterparties with which we have material exposure. Reinsurance counterparty creGLYPH<df00>it exposures are monitoreGLYPH<df00> closely anGLYPH<df00> reporteGLYPH<df00> annually to the Risk Committee.\n\nNew sales of our proGLYPH<df00>ucts can be GLYPH<df00>iscontinueGLYPH<df00> or changeGLYPH<df00> to reflect GLYPH<df00>evelopments in the reinsurance markets. Rates for our in-force reinsurance treaties can be either guaranteeGLYPH<df00> or aGLYPH<df00>justable for the life of the ceGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> policy. In orGLYPH<df00>er to GLYPH<df00>iversify reinsurance risk, there is generally more than one reinsurer supporting a reinsurance pool.",

Insurance Contract Liabilities anGLYPH<df00> Investment Contract Liabilities\n\n## 10.A Insurance Contract Liabilities\n\n## 10.A.i Description of Business\n\nThe company sells a variety of insurance contracts that incluGLYPH<df00>e all forms of life, health anGLYPH<df00> critical illness insurance solGLYPH<df00> to inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>uals anGLYPH<df00> groups, life contingent annuities, accumulation annuities, anGLYPH<df00> segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00> proGLYPH<df00>ucts with guarantees.\n\n## 10.A.ii MethoGLYPH<df00>s anGLYPH<df00> Assumptions\n\n## General\n\nThe liabilities for insurance contracts represent the estimateGLYPH<df00> amounts which, together with estimateGLYPH<df00> future premiums anGLYPH<df00> net investment income, will proviGLYPH<df00>e for outstanGLYPH<df00>ing claims, estimateGLYPH<df00> future benefits, policyholGLYPH<df00>ers' GLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>enGLYPH<df00>s, taxes (other than income taxes), anGLYPH<df00> expenses on in-force insurance contracts.\n\nIn GLYPH<df00>etermining our liabilities for insurance contracts, assumptions must be maGLYPH<df00>e about mortality anGLYPH<df00> morbiGLYPH<df00>ity rates, lapse anGLYPH<df00> other policyholGLYPH<df00>er behaviour (\"policyholGLYPH<df00>er behaviour\"), interest rates, equity market performance, asset GLYPH<df00>efault, inflation, expenses, anGLYPH<df00> other factors over the life of our proGLYPH<df00>ucts. Most of these assumptions relate to events that are anticipateGLYPH<df00> to occur many years in the future. Assumptions require significant juGLYPH<df00>gment anGLYPH<df00> regular review anGLYPH<df00>, where appropriate, revision.\n\nWe use best estimate assumptions for expecteGLYPH<df00> future experience anGLYPH<df00> apply margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations to proviGLYPH<df00>e for uncertainty in the choice of the best estimate assumptions. The amount of insurance contract liabilities relateGLYPH<df00> to the application of margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations to best estimate assumptions is calleGLYPH<df00> a provision for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations.\n\n## Best Estimate Assumptions\n\nBest estimate assumptions are intenGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to be current, neutral estimates of the expecteGLYPH<df00> outcome as guiGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice. The choice of best estimate assumptions takes into account current circumstances, past experience GLYPH<df00>ata (Company anGLYPH<df00>/or inGLYPH<df00>ustry), the relationship of past to expecteGLYPH<df00> future experience, anti-selection, the relationship among assumptions, anGLYPH<df00> other relevant factors. For assumptions on economic matters, the assets supporting the liabilities anGLYPH<df00> the expecteGLYPH<df00> policy for asset-liability management are relevant factors.\n\n## Margins for AGLYPH<df00>verse Deviations\n\nThe appropriate level of margin for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations on an assumption is guiGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice. For most assumptions, the stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00> range of margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations is 5% to 20% of the best estimate assumption, anGLYPH<df00> the actuary chooses from within that range baseGLYPH<df00> on a number of consiGLYPH<df00>erations relateGLYPH<df00> to the uncertainty in the GLYPH<df00>etermination of the best estimate assumption. The level of uncertainty, anGLYPH<df00> hence the margin chosen, will vary by assumption anGLYPH<df00> by line of business anGLYPH<df00> other factors. ConsiGLYPH<df00>erations that woulGLYPH<df00> tenGLYPH<df00> to inGLYPH<df00>icate a choice of margin at the high enGLYPH<df00> of the range incluGLYPH<df00>e:\n\n- \u00b7 The statistical creGLYPH<df00>ibility of the Company's experience is too low to be the primary source of GLYPH<df00>ata for choosing the best estimate assumption\n- \u00b7 Future experience is GLYPH<df00>ifficult to estimate\n- \u00b7 The cohort of risks lacks homogeneity\n- \u00b7 Operational risks aGLYPH<df00>versely impact the ability to estimate the best estimate assumption\n- \u00b7 Past experience may not be representative of future experience anGLYPH<df00> the experience may GLYPH<df00>eteriorate\n\nProvisions for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations in future interest rates are incluGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by testing a number of scenarios of future interest rates, some of which are prescribeGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice, anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>etermining the liability baseGLYPH<df00> on the range of possible outcomes. A scenario of future interest rates incluGLYPH<df00>es, for each forecast perioGLYPH<df00> between the statement of financial position GLYPH<df00>ate anGLYPH<df00> the last liability cash flow, interest rates for risk-free assets, premiums for asset GLYPH<df00>efault, rates of inflation, anGLYPH<df00> an investment strategy consistent with the Company's investment policy. The starting point for all future interest rate scenarios is consistent with the current market environment. If few scenarios are testeGLYPH<df00>, the liability woulGLYPH<df00> be at least as great as the largest of the outcomes. If many scenarios are testeGLYPH<df00>, the liability woulGLYPH<df00> be within a range GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> by the average of the outcomes that are above the 60th percentile of the range of outcomes anGLYPH<df00> the corresponGLYPH<df00>ing average for the 80th percentile.",

Our margins are generally stable over time anGLYPH<df00> are generally only reviseGLYPH<df00> to reflect changes in the level of uncertainty in the best estimate assumptions. Our margins tenGLYPH<df00> to be at the miGLYPH<df00>-range, with the higher range useGLYPH<df00> where there is greater uncertainty. When consiGLYPH<df00>ering the aggregate impact of margins, the actuary assesses the consistency of margins for each assumption across each block of business to ensure there is no GLYPH<df00>ouble counting or omission anGLYPH<df00> to avoiGLYPH<df00> choosing margins that might be mutually exclusive. In particular, the actuary chooses similar margins for blocks of business with similar characteristics, anGLYPH<df00> also chooses margins that are consistent with other assumptions, incluGLYPH<df00>ing assumptions about economic factors. The actuary is guiGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice in making these professional juGLYPH<df00>gments about the reasonableness of margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations. The best estimate assumptions anGLYPH<df00> margins for aGLYPH<df00>verse GLYPH<df00>eviations are revieweGLYPH<df00> at least annually anGLYPH<df00> revisions are maGLYPH<df00>e when appropriate. The\n\nchoice of assumptions unGLYPH<df00>erlying the valuation of insurance contract liabilities is subject to external actuarial peer review.\n\n## Mortality\n\nMortality refers to the rates at which GLYPH<df00>eath occurs for GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> groups of people. Life insurance mortality assumptions are generally baseGLYPH<df00> on the past five to ten years of experience. Our experience is combineGLYPH<df00> with inGLYPH<df00>ustry experience where our own experience is insufficient to be statistically valiGLYPH<df00>. AssumeGLYPH<df00> mortality rates for life insurance anGLYPH<df00> annuity contracts incluGLYPH<df00>e assumptions about future mortality improvement baseGLYPH<df00> on recent trenGLYPH<df00>s in population mortality anGLYPH<df00> our outlook for future trenGLYPH<df00>s.\n\n## MorbiGLYPH<df00>ity\n\nMorbiGLYPH<df00>ity refers to both the rates of acciGLYPH<df00>ent or sickness anGLYPH<df00> the rates of recovery therefrom. Most of our GLYPH<df00>isability insurance is marketeGLYPH<df00> on a group basis. We offer critical illness policies on an inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual basis in CanaGLYPH<df00>a anGLYPH<df00> Asia, long-term care on an inGLYPH<df00>iviGLYPH<df00>ual basis in CanaGLYPH<df00>a, anGLYPH<df00> meGLYPH<df00>ical stop-loss insurance is offereGLYPH<df00> on a group basis in the U.S. In CanaGLYPH<df00>a, group morbiGLYPH<df00>ity assumptions are baseGLYPH<df00> on our five-year average experience, moGLYPH<df00>ifieGLYPH<df00> to reflect any emerging trenGLYPH<df00> in recovery rates. For long-term care anGLYPH<df00> critical illness insurance, assumptions are GLYPH<df00>evelopeGLYPH<df00> in collaboration with our reinsurers anGLYPH<df00> are largely baseGLYPH<df00> on their experience. In the U.S., our experience is useGLYPH<df00> for both meGLYPH<df00>ical stop-loss anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isability assumptions, with some consiGLYPH<df00>eration of inGLYPH<df00>ustry experience.\n\n## PolicyholGLYPH<df00>er Behaviour\n\n## Lapse\n\nPolicyholGLYPH<df00>ers may allow their policies to lapse prior to the enGLYPH<df00> of the contractual coverage perioGLYPH<df00> by choosing not to continue to pay premiums or by surrenGLYPH<df00>ering their policy for the cash surrenGLYPH<df00>er value. Assumptions for lapse experience on life insurance are generally baseGLYPH<df00> on our five-year average experience. Lapse rates vary by plan, age at issue, methoGLYPH<df00> of premium payment, anGLYPH<df00> policy GLYPH<df00>uration.\n\n## Premium Payment Patterns\n\nFor universal life contracts, it is necessary to set assumptions about premium payment patterns. StuGLYPH<df00>ies prepareGLYPH<df00> by inGLYPH<df00>ustry or the actuarial profession are useGLYPH<df00> for proGLYPH<df00>ucts where our experience is insufficient to be statistically valiGLYPH<df00>. Premium payment patterns usually vary by plan, age at issue, methoGLYPH<df00> of premium payment, anGLYPH<df00> policy GLYPH<df00>uration.\n\n## Expense\n\nFuture policy-relateGLYPH<df00> expenses incluGLYPH<df00>e the costs of premium collection, claims aGLYPH<df00>juGLYPH<df00>ication anGLYPH<df00> processing, actuarial calculations, preparation anGLYPH<df00> mailing of policy statements, anGLYPH<df00> relateGLYPH<df00> inGLYPH<df00>irect expenses anGLYPH<df00> overheaGLYPH<df00>. Expense assumptions are mainly baseGLYPH<df00> on our recent experience using an internal expense allocation methoGLYPH<df00>ology. Inflationary increases assumeGLYPH<df00> in future expenses are consistent with the future interest rates useGLYPH<df00> in scenario testing.\n\n## Investment Returns\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nWe generally maintain GLYPH<df00>istinct asset portfolios for each major line of business. In the valuation of insurance contract liabilities, the future cash flows from insurance contracts anGLYPH<df00> the assets that support them are projecteGLYPH<df00> unGLYPH<df00>er a number of interest rate scenarios, some of which are prescribeGLYPH<df00> by CanaGLYPH<df00>ian actuarial stanGLYPH<df00>arGLYPH<df00>s of practice. Reinvestments anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>isinvestments take place accorGLYPH<df00>ing to the specifications of each scenario, anGLYPH<df00> the liability is set baseGLYPH<df00> on the range of possible outcomes.\n\n## Non-FixeGLYPH<df00> Income Rates of Return\n\nWe are exposeGLYPH<df00> to equity markets through our segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00> proGLYPH<df00>ucts (incluGLYPH<df00>ing variable annuities) that proviGLYPH<df00>e guarantees linkeGLYPH<df00> to unGLYPH<df00>erlying funGLYPH<df00> performance anGLYPH<df00> through insurance proGLYPH<df00>ucts where the insurance contract liabilities are supporteGLYPH<df00> by non-fixeGLYPH<df00> income assets.\n\nFor segregateGLYPH<df00> funGLYPH<df00> proGLYPH<df00>ucts (incluGLYPH<df00>ing variable annuities), we have implementeGLYPH<df00> heGLYPH<df00>ging programs involving the use of GLYPH<df00>erivative instruments to mitigate a large portion of the equity market risk associateGLYPH<df00> with the guarantees. The cost of these heGLYPH<df00>ging programs is reflecteGLYPH<df00> in the liabilities. The equity market risk associateGLYPH<df00> with anticipateGLYPH<df00> future fee income is not heGLYPH<df00>geGLYPH<df00>.",

Pension Plans anGLYPH<df00> Other Post-Retirement Benefits\n\nWe sponsor GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension plans anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution plans for eligible employees. All of our material GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit plans worlGLYPH<df00>wiGLYPH<df00>e are closeGLYPH<df00> to new entrants with new hires participating in GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution plans. Material GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit plans are locateGLYPH<df00> in CanaGLYPH<df00>a, the U.S., anGLYPH<df00> the UK. The GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension plans offer benefits baseGLYPH<df00> on length of service anGLYPH<df00> final average earnings anGLYPH<df00> certain plans offer some inGLYPH<df00>exation of benefits. The specific features of these plans vary in accorGLYPH<df00>ance with the employee group anGLYPH<df00> countries in which employees are locateGLYPH<df00>. In aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition, we maintain supplementary non-contributory GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension arrangements for eligible employees, which are primarily for benefits which are in excess of local tax limits. As at December 31, 2014, there are no active members in the UK anGLYPH<df00> the U.S. GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit plans continuing to accrue future service benefits. On January 1, 2009, the CanaGLYPH<df00>ian GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit plans were closeGLYPH<df00> to new employees. CanaGLYPH<df00>ian employees hireGLYPH<df00> before January 1, 2009 continue to earn future service benefits in the previous plans, which incluGLYPH<df00>es both GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit anGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution components, while new hires since then are eligible to join a GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution plan. In aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition, one small GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit plan in the Philippines remains open to new hires.\n\nOur funGLYPH<df00>ing policy for GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension plans is to make at least the minimum annual contributions requireGLYPH<df00> by regulations in the countries in which the plans are offereGLYPH<df00>. Our UK GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension scheme is governeGLYPH<df00> by pension trustees. In other countries in which we operate, the GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> benefit pension arrangements are governeGLYPH<df00> by local pension committees. Significant plan changes require the approval of the BoarGLYPH<df00> of Directors of the sponsoring subsiGLYPH<df00>iary of SLF Inc.\n\nWe also establisheGLYPH<df00> GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution plans for eligible employees. Our contributions to these GLYPH<df00>efineGLYPH<df00> contribution pension plans may be subject to certain vesting requirements. Generally, our contributions are a set percentage of employees' annual income anGLYPH<df00> may be a set percentage of employee contributions, up to specifieGLYPH<df00> levels.\n\nIn aGLYPH<df00>GLYPH<df00>ition to our pension plans, in CanaGLYPH<df00>a anGLYPH<df00> the U.S., we proviGLYPH<df00>e certain post-retirement health care anGLYPH<df00> life insurance benefits to eligible employees anGLYPH<df00> to their GLYPH<df00>epenGLYPH<df00>ents upon meeting certain requirements. Eligible retirees may be requireGLYPH<df00> to pay a portion of the premiums for these benefits anGLYPH<df00>, in general, GLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00>uctible amounts anGLYPH<df00> co-insurance percentages apply to benefit payments. These post-retirement benefits are not pre-funGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00>. In CanaGLYPH<df00>a, certain post-retirement health care anGLYPH<df00> life insurance benefits are proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> for eligible employees who retireGLYPH<df00> before December 31, 2015. Eligible employees in CanaGLYPH<df00>a who retire after December 31, 2015 will have access to voluntary retiree-paiGLYPH<df00> health care coverage. In the U.S., certain post-retirement health care anGLYPH<df00> life insurance benefits are proviGLYPH<df00>eGLYPH<df00> to eligible retirees. In the U.S., employees who were not age 50 with 10 years of service as of December 31, 2015 only have access to subsiGLYPH<df00>izeGLYPH<df00> retiree health care coverage until eligible for MeGLYPH<df00>icare.

All figures in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\n\n1 All figures as of December 31, 2021. 2 Underlying net income, underlying return on equity (ROE), underlying earnings per share, financial leverage ratio, dividend payout ratio, value of new business, sales, and assets under management described on pages 1-8 of this Annual Report represent non-IFRS financial measures. For additional information see section L - Non-IFRS Financial Measures in our 2021 Annual Management's Discussion and Analysis ('MD&A'). 3 Wealth & Asset Management includes Canada individual wealth, Group Retirement Services and Sun Life Global Investments (SLGI), Asia wealth, and Asset Management; Group & shorter duration insurance includes Canada Sun Life Health and U.S. Group Benefits, UK, and Asia insurance (excluding International). Refer to the reconciliation of underlying to reported net income below. 4 Percentage results are 5-year compound annual growth rates (CAGR) from 2016 to 2021. 5 Value of new business represents the present value of our best estimate of future distributable earnings, net of the cost of capital, from new business contracts written in a particular time period, except new business in our Asset Management pillar. Value of new business was restated back to 2018,  reflecting a change in the timing of recognition of U.S. group policies sold or renewed with an effective date of January 1, which will recognize Value of new business for these policies in the prior year rather than the first quarter, to align with the timing of U.S. renewals and reported insurance sales 6 Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test ('LICAT') ratio of SLF Inc. and of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada ('SLA'). Our LICAT ratios are calculated in accordance with OSFI-mandated guideline, Life Insurance Capital Adequacy Test. 7 Although considered reasonable, we may not be able to achieve our medium-term financial objectives as our assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, our actual results could differ materially from our medium-term financial objectives as described on the slide. Our medium-term financial objectives do not constitute guidance. Our medium-term financial objectives are forward-looking non-IFRS financial measures and additional information is provided in section O - Forward-looking Statements - Medium-Term Financial Objectives in our 2021 Annual MD&A. 8 Underlying dividend payout ratio represents the ratio of common shareholders' dividends to diluted underlying EPS. See section I - Capital and Liquidity Management - 3 - Shareholder Dividends in our 2021 Annual MD&A for further information regarding dividends. 9 Underlying EPS growth is calculated using a compound annual growth rate. Underlying ROE and underlying dividend payout ratio are calculated using an average. 2021 reported net income by business pillar (excludes Corporate reported net income of $(90)M): Asset Management 22%, Canada 39%, Asia 27%, U.S. 12%.\n\n## From Endnote 3 above:\n\n## Business Mix Net Income ($ millions)\n\n|                                                       | Insurance   | Management   | Duration Insurance   | Subtotal   | Other *   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|------------|-----------|---------|\n| 2021 Reported net income (loss)                       | 1,143       | 1,879        | 1,213                | 4,235      | (301)     | 3,934   |\n| Items excluded from underlying net income             | 416         | (67)         | 95                   | 444        | (43)      |         |\n| Underlying net income (loss)                          | 727         | 1,946        | 1,118                | 3,791      | (258)     | 3,533   |\n| Percentage of underlying net income (excluding other) | 19%         | 51%          | 30%                  | 100%       |           |         |\n\n401\n\n* Includes Corporate Support and Business Group support functions\n\nTraditional\n\nWealth & Asset\n\nGroup & Shorter",
